5|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} the ten Rosenborg players with the most appearances in the top league, including their appearances in European football. As no comprehensive statistics for cup appearances exists, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> not included in the total.|$|E
5|$|The list {{includes}} those {{players who have}} captained their team {{in at least one}} BPL match. The list is initially organised by the number of matches as a captain and if <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> tied, the list is sorted by win–loss percentage. If still tied then they are sorted by their last name.|$|E
5|$|The list {{includes}} those {{players who have}} captained their team {{in at least one}} IPL match. The list is initially organised by the number of matches as a captain and if <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> tied, the list is sorted by last name.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> {{divisible}} by 2 and 11 then <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> divisible by 22.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> {{assigned}} to sounds and to symbols, e.g. 304 is the open front unrounded vowel, 415 is the centralization diacritic. Together, {{they form a}} symbol that represents the open central unrounded vowel. There is no three digit number for the open central unrounded vowel.|$|E
5|$|The list is {{initially}} organised {{by the number}} of matches as an umpire, and if <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> tied, the list is sorted by last name. This list is correct as of the 2015 IPL season, and does not cover the games played by IPL teams in other tournaments or tours, such as the Champions League Twenty20, the British Asian Cup or the 2008 Kolkata Knight Riders tour of Australia.|$|E
5|$|This {{is in fact}} true of {{the binary}} {{expansions}} of many rational numbers, where the values of <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> equal but the corresponding binary tree paths are different. For example, 0.10111...2=0.11000...2, which are both equal to , but the first representation corresponds to the binary tree path LRLRLLL... while the second corresponds to the different path LRLLRRR....|$|E

5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the siege}} {{consumed}} {{a large part}} of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the frontier. On the Byzantine side, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the Bulgars, with whom Leo concluded a treaty that possibly included alliance against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the most}} stable and secure {{part of the sea}} otter's range is Russia. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the Kuril Islands, with more near Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. After the years of the Great Hunt, the {{population}} in these areas, currently part of Russia, was only 750. By 2004, sea otters had repopulated all of their former habitat in these areas, with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> reaching carrying capacity.|$|E

5|$|Each {{episode of}} series 1 of Red or Black? {{consisted}} of 10 rounds; in each round, the player {{had to choose}} either red or black, with those who choose incorrectly being eliminated. The rounds are split into three stages. The first is an arena stage, which is recorded at Wembley Arena. The winning contestants move onto the location stage, where <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> eventually reduced down to the final eight. Those eight then go forward to the live studio final, where they are reduced down to the final competitor, who {{has a chance to}} play for the £1m prize. The first series was broadcast over seven nights in September 2011, running {{over the course of a}} week, except for the Tuesday night, from Saturday to the following Saturday. Over 100,000 people applied to compete in the show.|$|E
5|$|MDOT assigns {{the numbers}} for a {{parallel}} system of county-designated highways in the state; <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> assigned in a grid system by the department. These highways, while signed from connecting trunklines and shown on the official MDOT map, are maintained by the various counties. They were started in 1970 {{as a supplement to}} the main trunkline system and carry a letter-number combination on the national standard pentagon-shaped marker in blue and yellow. The letter component of the name corresponds to a zone of the state; zones A–F are in the Lower Peninsula while G and H are in the Upper Peninsula. The numbers correspond to a numbered grid within each lettered zone. Other county systems are designated and maintained in each of the 83counties, and signage and numbering practices vary. The state's 533incorporated cities and villages also maintain their own street networks, but townships in the state have no jurisdiction over roads.|$|E
5|$|The Red Wings {{have also}} made the number 6 of Larry Aurie and the number 16 of Vladimir Konstantinov no longer {{available}} for issue. However, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> {{not considered to be}} officially retired. Although Aurie's uniform was retired in 1938 by James E. Norris, current team owner Mike Ilitch does not consider the number to be retired. Konstantinov's number has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled in a vehicle accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals. Number 99 is also unavailable due to having been retired by the league in honor of Wayne Gretzky.|$|E

5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{casualties}} is unknown. There are different numbers that each derive from different investigations that used different definitions of what a victim in this case should be. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> hardly comparable. On top of that, some results are published infrequently or investigations were ceased with a provisional number. There is also a publicly held controversy between two groups regarding the number of victims. The opponents are the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August and the ZZF. The former's numbers are higher, as they include, according to ZZF's Hans-Hermann Hertle, victims with an unclear or unsure connection to the border regime. After the ZZF published its interim results in August 2006, Alexandra Hildebrandt of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft has accused them of withholding numbers to invoke a more positive picture of East Germany. She argues that the ZZF project was funded {{by a coalition of}} social democrats and leftists.|$|E
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, together with the avocet, the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat {{and a lack of}} sufficient large food fish; although European eels, a favoured food, are present, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> too low. These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed bed to create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 avocet nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully fledging seven young.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{comprehensive}} demographic {{study was}} done by historian John Demos for his seminal 1970 work on the Pilgrims A Little Commonwealth. He reports that the colony's average household grew from 7.8 children per family for first-generation families to 8.6 children for second-generation families, and to 9.3 for third-generation families. Child mortality also decreased over this time, with 7.2 children born to first-generation families living until their 21st birthday. That number increased to 7.9 children by the third generation. Life expectancy was higher for men than for women. Of the men who survived {{until the age of}} 21, the average life expectancy was 69.2 years. Over 55 percent of these men lived past 70; less than 15 percent died before the age of 50. For women, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> much lower, owing to the difficulties inherent in childbearing. The average life expectancy of women at the age of 21 was only 62.4 years. Of these women, less than 45 percent lived past 70, and about 30 percent died before the age of 50.|$|E
