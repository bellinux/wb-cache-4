5|$|At around 1:30am {{the tide}} had risen {{enough to allow}} the LFEE's {{floating}} fire engine to arrive on the scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at Rotherhithe.

5|$|Although the {{territorial}} gains produced by his {{defeat of the}} Persians were lost to the advance of the Muslims, Heraclius still ranks among the great Roman Emperors. His reforms of the government reduced the corruption which had <b>taken</b> <b>hold</b> in Phocas's reign, and he reorganized the military with great success. Ultimately, the reformed Imperial army halted the Muslims in Asia Minor and held on to Carthage for another 60 years, saving a core from which the empire's strength could be rebuilt.|$|E

He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the first had been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his devoted wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw an {{increasing}} interest in international cuisines. Sushi, in particular, has <b>taken</b> <b>hold</b> {{as a popular}} style for eating out and as an entrée for events. In restaurants, fusion cuisine, with the melding of classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread. In the 2000s, the trend of “eating healthy” {{with an emphasis on}} organic and whole grain foods has become prominent, and medical research has led many Israelis to re-embrace the Mediterranean diet, with its touted health benefits.|$|E

5|$|The {{process by}} which an {{organisation}} achieves sufficient prominence that {{it is able to}} exercise naked power can be described as the rule of three phases (Russell 1938:63). According to this rule, what begins as fanaticism {{on the part of some}} crowd eventually produces conquest by means of naked power. Eventually, the acquiescence of the outlying population transforms naked power into traditional power. Finally, once a traditional power has <b>taken</b> <b>hold,</b> it engages in the suppression of dissent by the use of naked power.|$|E

25|$|Christian {{literature}} is writing {{that deals with}} Christian themes and incorporates the Christian world view. This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. Christian poetry is any poetry that contains Christian teachings, themes, or references.

25|$|Sufism {{is popular}} in such African {{countries}} as Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal, {{where it is}} seen as a mystical expression of Islam. Sufism is traditional in Morocco but has seen a growing revival with the renewal of Sufism under contemporary spiritual teachers such as Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi. Mbacke suggests that one reason Sufism has <b>taken</b> <b>hold</b> in Senegal is because it can accommodate local beliefs and customs, which tend toward the mystical.|$|E

25|$|The Straits Settlements were {{originally}} an outlier of the British East India Company. The Spanish dollar had already <b>taken</b> <b>hold</b> in the Straits Settlements {{by the time}} the British arrived in the 19th century. The East India Company tried to introduce the rupee in its place. These attempts were resisted by the locals, and by 1867 when the British government took over direct control of the Straits Settlements from the East India Company, attempts to introduce the rupee were finally abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The first Japanese {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} Brazil in 1908. Brazil {{is home to}} the largest Japanese population outside Japan. According to the IBGE, as of 2009 there were approximately 1.6million people of Japanese descent in Brazil, and estimated at just under 1.5 million as of 2014. Since the 1980s, a return migration has emerged of Japan Brazilians to Japan.

25|$|By then, a new {{stalemate}} had <b>taken</b> <b>hold.</b> Burma had annexed {{the lower}} Tenasserim coast but again failed to eliminate Siam as the sponsor of rebellions in her {{eastern and southern}} borderlands. In the following years, Hsinbyushin was preoccupied by the Chinese threat, and did not renew the Siamese war until 1775—only after Lan Na had revolted again with Siamese support. The post-Ayutthaya Siamese leadership proved more than capable; they defeated the next two invasions (1775–1776 and 1785–1786), and annexed Lan Na in the process.|$|E

25|$|The year of 1049 was {{a series}} of successes. Dirk of Holland was {{defeated}} and killed. Adalbert of Bremen managed a peace with Bernard of Saxony and negotiated a treaty with the missionary monarch SweynII of Denmark. With the assistance of Sweyn and Edward the Confessor of England, whose enemies Baldwin had harboured, Baldwin of Flanders was harassed by sea and unable to escape the onslaught of the imperial army. At Cologne, the pope excommunicated Godfrey, in revolt again, and Baldwin. The former abandoned his allies and was imprisoned by the emperor yet again. Baldwin too gave in under the pressure of Henry's ravages. Finally, war had ceased in the Low Countries and the Lorraines, and peace seemed to have <b>taken</b> <b>hold.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Olympic Games, a truce, or ekecheiria was observed. Three runners, {{known as}} spondophoroi were sent from Elis to the {{participant}} cities at {{each set of}} games to announce {{the beginning of the}} truce. During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia and legal disputes {{and the use of the}} death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed. Thucydides wrote of a situation when the Spartans were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 minae for assaulting the city of Lepreum during the period of the ekecheiria. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet <b>taken</b> <b>hold.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{principal}} {{source for}} the items in Illich-Svitych's dictionary was the earlier work of Alfredo Trombetti (1866–1929), an Italian linguist who had developed a classification scheme for all the world's languages, widely reviled {{at the time and}} subsequently ignored by almost all linguists. In Trombetti's time, a widely held view on classifying languages was that similarity in inflections is the surest proof of genetic relationship. In the interim, the view had <b>taken</b> <b>hold</b> that the comparative method—previously used as a means of studying languages already known to be related and without any thought of classification—is the most effective means to establish genetic relationship, eventually hardening into the conviction that it is the only legitimate means to do so. This view was basic to the outlook of the new Nostraticists. Although Illich-Svitych adopted many of Trombetti's etymologies, he sought to validate them by a systematic comparison of the sound systems of the languages concerned.|$|E
