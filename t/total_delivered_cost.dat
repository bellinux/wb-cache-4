40|$|As Company X {{looks to}} improve {{customer}} service and deliver new growth opportunities, it is driving toward a more efficient, aligned and effective organization that eliminates waste through integration of its supply and production networks. The current manufacturing system is optimized for high volume products with low demand variation signals, and is used for all products regardless of demand characteristics. The effects of such a system on the supply network are higher holding cost and stale inventory, while the effects on the business are lost sales and higher <b>total</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>cost.</b> A more responsive production system {{is an opportunity to}} reduce strain on the supply network, reduce <b>total</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>cost</b> and improve product fulfillment. Analysis of a portfolio of products demonstrates two main findings: (1) considerable impact of inventory cost on the <b>total</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>cost</b> and (2) a definitive case for differentiated manufacturing strategy - for high and low volume products. Previously only manufacturing cost had been used to make the decision of which system might better fit the goals of providing products in a timely and cost efficient manner. However, the uncovering of the impact of inventory cost on the <b>total</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>cost</b> has challenged that perception. An analysis was also performed on various algorithms which optimize (1) the product lot size and (2) job scheduling on machines. EOQ and a Mixed Integer Program were both analyzed for lot size determination, with the latter demonstrating more cost efficient and production efficient results due to more flexibility with the time scale and the consideration of manufacturing capacity. Finally, a couple of bin packing algorithm heuristics were tested for job scheduling. The results demonstrated significant time savings in job scheduling and have highlighted the need to automate the scheduling process. by Renata Bakousseva. Thesis: S.

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that preprocessing procedure {{can reduce the}} transportation and storage costs of biomass feedstock for biofuel production by condensing the feedstock’s size. However, the capital costs of preprocessing facilities could be significant in the feedstock logistics system.

40|$|Economic variety {{control and}} {{modularity}} 1 Abstract: Since the industry revolution, companies {{have tried to}} standardize more their components, {{in order to allow}} mass production and to increase components ’ commonality between products. To remain competitive, companies always have to offer more variety to customers. Manufacturers of complex assembled products that are facing the challenge of mass customization are forced to increase simultaneously commonality of used components and the variety of end products. Variety control is more than ever an issue but seems to lack a complete economic insight. In this paper we propose a systematic economic optimization for variety control taking into account the whole <b>total</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>cost</b> (TDC) including investments and operating costs. It is clear that modular product architecture is a cornerstone to allow end product customization at low cost. Modular architecture facilitates variety control; thanks to interfaces standardization and appropriate architectures, the diversity of alternative modules can easily be controlled. On the other hand the decoupling of modules will always be limited due to inevitable technical combinatorial restrictions between modules. After a description of the main concepts of modular product, we will propose an extent to the model of variety control in order to take into account these constraints between modules...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: West Virginia is {{the third}} most heavily forested state in the U. S. and {{produces}} 2. 41 million dry tons of wood residues annually. These wood wastes are sustainable {{and can be used}} as feedstock for biofuels, bio-gas and green electricity. Biomass sustainability, efficient harvesting, extraction, and transportation of woody biomass are the key to the economic success of wood residue utilization. The cost components of collecting, processing, and delivering woody biomass are not well documented, which hinders further research on the economic feasibility of woody biomass-based biorefineries in West Virginia. A mix integer programming (MIP) model was developed using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) to optimize potential woody biomass-based biorefinery locations with the objective of minimizing the <b>total</b> annual <b>delivered</b> <b>cost</b> of available woody biomass. The model was applied in West Virginia and analyzed in terms of sensitivity analysis under different resource and operational scenarios, such as proportion of woody biomass availability, demand levels at plant, and others.

However, the research found that SMEs do not seem to be concerned with a lack of trust and cooperation among supply chain members as this is usually covered by contractual relationships. It is found that there is a need to improve project coordination and information sharing, as well as shortening time to respond to requests for information. Further to these, the research found that the level of e-commerce practice by the SMEs has improved in recent years and this provides a good platform for the integration of SMEs into the construction supply chain through e-commerce. Despite the above provisos the findings reflected that supply chain integration is an important issue for construction SMEs and the use of compatible information system will increase the supply chain integration and management and hence improve the performance of the entire construction supply chain...|$|R

Defines biomass fuels {{and the reasons for}} the growth in interest in their use for electricity generation. The activities and parties involved in the biomass fuel supply chain are discussed together with the management of the chain in order to achieve smooth and consistent flow of biomass fuel to power stations. Explains the approach used to modelling the delivered costs of biomass fuels for four types of biomass fuel included in the project: forest fuel, short rotation coppice, straw and miscanthus. Comments are given on the environmental impacts of the fuel supply chains. The results indicate that straw supply systems are capable of producing the lowest delivered costs of the four fuels studied. Short rotation coppice and miscanthus, two new energy crops, are likely to have the highest delivered costs at present. This is due to the cost of growing these fuels and the financial incentives required by farmers to persuade them to grow these crops. Logistics costs (i. e. transport, storage and handling) are shown to represent a significant proportion of <b>total</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>cost</b> in biomass supply.

In this paper we use a new tool developed in the WREZ initiative to evaluate possible renewable resource selection and transmission expansion decisions. We evaluate these decisions under a number of alternative future scenarios centered on meeting 33 % of the annual load in the Western Interconnection with new renewable resources located within WREZ-identified resource hubs. Our analysis finds that wind energy is the largest source of renewable energy procured to meet the 33 % RE target across nearly all scenarios analyzed (38 - 65 %). Solar energy is almost always the second largest source (14 - 41 %). We find several load zones where wind energy is the least cost resource under {{a wide range of}} sensitivity scenarios. Load zones in the Southwest, on the other hand, are found to switch between wind and solar, and therefore to vary transmission expansion decisions, depending on uncertainties and policies that affect the relative economics of each renewable option.

40|$|Shorthaul transport, {{also known}} as {{secondary}} intermediate transport (SIT), is a feature of pulpwood transport in South Africa. SIT is an additional transport phase within traditional secondary transport. It originates at roadside landing or depot and terminates at another depot, rail siding or merchandising area (not the final destination). The reason {{for the inclusion of}} SIT is identified {{as the result of the}} poor and steady decline of forest road conditions to the extent that highway type vehicles are unable to reach roadside landings. This necessitates the use of intermediate storage sites, from where timber is once again loaded and transported to its final destination. A network analysis model, assisted by newly developed and industry accepted terminology, and pixel-based geographic information system (GIS) were combined to analyse various transport scenarios within three study areas in the KwaZulu/Natal Midlands of South Africa, employing SIT on poor, high-density forest road networks. The simple pixel-based GIS contained information on the forest road network, surface cover and slope. The results of the economic analysis highlighted the need for the reduction of road network densities and for the improvement of the remaining network. This would eliminate the need for extended primary transport and allow the use of highway vehicles transporting from compartment roadside to and past plantation exits. Results show the average annual cost penalty to the industry, by maintaining SIT and related transport, to be R 43. 25 million or R 8. 24 /m 3.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessAgricultural EconomicsVincent R. Amanor-BoaduThe United States was the world’s {{third largest}} {{producer}} of raspberries (by pounds) in 2013, behind Russia and Poland. Raspberries are {{the third most}} popular berry in the United States behind strawberries and blueberries. Most U. S. production of red raspberries occurs in the states of Washington and Oregon during July and August depending on variety. Harvest and production for industrial pack typically runs for five weeks. Sieved red raspberries or single strength red raspberry puree {{is one of many}} industrial packs produced in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Sieved red raspberries are produced by forcing fresh, cleaned and sorted red raspberries and red raspberry crumbles and pieces through a mesh screen, collected in drums or pails and stored for use in further processed products such as pies, confectioneries and other consumer food products. For this thesis, sieved berries are packed in 55 -gallon steel drums lined with food grade plastic bags. They are shipped from the processing plant to a third party warehouse to be frozen and stored. The final processing plant draws on these stored frozen products for use in the production of the Company’s consumer food products. The purpose of this thesis is to review the Company’s current procurement practices of sieved red raspberries and determine how these practices may be improved to reduce its <b>total</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>cost.</b> We use an optimization modelling approach to assess the procurement process used by the Company. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} reduce procurement costs and improve efficiencies by making changes to the current procurement strategy. By implementing the procurement strategy developed in this study, we show that the Company can save as much as $ 1. 69 million per year, which is equivalent to about 20. 3 % of the current spend. This would suggest that adopting the optimization strategy could allow the Company to increase its total sieved raspberry utilization by as much as 0. 9 million pounds per annum, all other things remaining unchanged...|$|E

40|$|New Zealand has {{ratified}} the Kyoto Protocol {{and agreed to}} reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels in the first commitment period 2008 - 2012. Energy generated from renewable sources, such as New Zealand plantation forests and wood processing sites, is considered greenhouse gas neutral. But the use of biomass for bioenergy in New Zealand is very small. Some {{of the reasons for}} this include a lack of information about the future fuel supply and <b>delivered</b> <b>cost.</b> This thesis aims to provide a methodology to estimate biomass fuel availability and the <b>delivered</b> <b>cost,</b> of a range of forest and wood processing sources within a district, and to analyse the impact of harvest age, harvesting practices, terrain, collection and chipping costs, opportunity cost and transport costs on the availability and <b>delivered</b> <b>cost</b> of biomass for bioenergy. The six biomass streams included were chiplogs, forest landing residues, cutover residues, sawdust, bark and chip. The methodology was developed based on an area in Canterbury, and tested on an area in the Nelson/Marlborough region. It utilises forest growth models, Geographic Information Systems and Microsoft Excel. Growth models allow the analysis to be customised to a particular area or region, while the use of GIS allows the model to take spatial aspects (for example slope and transport distance) into consideration. Developing the overall framework within Excel allows easy analysis of the results and changes to the underlying assumptions. Opportunity costs make up {{a large proportion of the}} total cost of delivery for the chiplog, sawdust, bark and chip biomass and need to be included in any estimate of cost for these biomass streams. The logistic system chosen for collecting and chipping the forest residues has a large impact on their <b>delivered</b> <b>cost</b> as do the transport costs. However transport cost is not the most significant influence on the <b>delivered</b> <b>cost</b> of other biomass streams.
