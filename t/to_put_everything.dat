5|$|Alan Grant {{returned}} for a second outing to write Curse, about a grave digger who unleashed a 150-year-old curse onto Smallville, and Clark's attempt <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> back the way it was. In Temptation, Clark used red kryptonite to try and impress Lana and Chloe after they become infatuated with a new, French foreign exchange student. Aspect released their final novel on March 1, 2004; written by Devin K. Grayson, City chronicled Clark and Lex's trip to Metropolis. While in the city, the pair got caught between the Japanese mafia and a secret agent who believed he has found an alien. In Little, Brown Young Readers' final novel, written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld, Sparks featured Clark trying to save Chloe after she was exposed to a kryptonite fireworks display that makes her the desire of every man. For one of the men, when the desire wears off he decides that he really does want Chloe and kidnaps her.|$|E
500|$|Despite this success, the Shaughnessy {{connection}} {{was not the}} breakthrough she had hoped for. Schuur failed to impress bandleader Doc Severinsen, who turned her down when she auditioned for a guest spot on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Some {{people in the industry}} dubbed her [...] "Lady Overkill" [...] because she had a tendency to oversing or tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> she knew into a brief space. For the next three years, Shuur performed in clubs and sharpened her skills. Jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, who had been impressed when he heard her sing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] at Monterey in 1979, did not give up on her. He became her advisor and coach. Discussing Getz in this role, Schuur stated, [...] "he really was a mentor of mine. He taught me that less is more." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{is always}} made much too polite; {{it always has}} been in movies. This isn't the Wuthering Heights of Kate Bush -- that little fanciful Wuthering Heights. The scene they always cut out is the scene when Heathcliff digs up Catherine's body and dances in the {{moonlight}} and on the beach with it. I think you can't get much more operatic or passionate than that. I was trying to write a song about dead things coming to life. I was trying to write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love, not just enchanted and happy with it. It was about the dark side of love; about the ability to be resurrected by it... I just tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> I could into it, and I'm real proud of it.|$|E
50|$|O-eo {{is made to}} order. You {{can choose}} the topping by yourself. Red-White means o-eo with red beans. White-Black means o-eo with black jelly grass and White-Red-Black means <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in <b>everything.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Roadblock, {{one team}} member {{had to take}} on the role of a lustrabota, a Chilean shoeshiner at Paseo Ahumada. After shining a customer's shoes, the racer had <b>to</b> {{properly}} <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> they got at their lustrabota station into the cart and transport it back to the storage depot at Merced 738 where they would receive their next clue.|$|R

500|$|Cooper and {{his family}} share a close bond. Two years {{after the death of}} his father from lung cancer in 2011, he {{relocated}} to Los Angeles with his mother. He says that during his father's diagnosis: [...] "I was in a very lucky position because I was able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> on hold in all aspects of my life and completely focus on taking care of him." [...] He has described the process of his treatment as [...] "just simply overwhelming, incredibly stressful, complex and all consuming." [...] The actor has since supported organizations that help fight cancer. In June 2014, Cooper joined the board of directors for the charity Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a non-profit organization that serves people coping with cancer. In April 2016, he participated in the launch of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy that works for cancer patients. He served as an executive producer for Stand Up to Cancer's Fifth Biennial Telecast, a primetime fundraising special that aired in September.|$|E
2500|$|Lea also {{revealed}} in a 1976 fan club interview: [...] "We {{just got a}} terrific buzz when {{we were working on}} the album. We were more relaxed than we've ever been, more willing and able to be more experimental in the studios, and we took it easy and relaxed. Certainly we felt we had a good product in the making, so it seemed right <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> we had into it." ...|$|E

50|$|Later, Emily has {{a falling}} {{out with her}} mother and decides to move out. Katie begs her to stay but Emily still leaves. Emily moves in with Naomi and they seem <b>to</b> have <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> behind them. However, when they go to a party later on, Emily becomes {{suspicious}} again when Naomi starts talking to other girls. Cook sees Effy and Freddie kissing at the party and takes his anger out on a fellow party-goer and ends up headbutting JJ also.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the same}} time he was really fond of Miss Ogilvy, and what she said about being ill touched him. Also there was {{something}} that drew him; it might be Eleanor, or it might be Madame Riennes. At any rate he felt a great longing <b>to</b> go. <b>Putting</b> <b>everything</b> else aside, these investigations had their delights. What other young fellow of his age could boast an Eleanor, who said she had been fond of him {{tens of thousands of years}} before? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} {{they have to do}} it ALWAYS," [...] grumbled Davy. [...] "Seems <b>to</b> me <b>everything's</b> <b>put</b> on the men in this world. Can I have some more pudding, Marilla?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he made {{haste to}} explain, [...] "in the {{meanwhile}} I must endeavour <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> except this scheme {{out of my}} mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I want to {{have some}} sober talk,' said Jonas; 'I want to prevent any mistakes, you know, and <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> upon a {{pleasant}} understanding. That's desirable and proper, ain't it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hall, {{the first}} lieutenant's orders {{are that you}} are to measure this young gentleman for a midshipman's undress uniform, and you are <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> else by and push it forward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{it will be}} {{the finest}} {{baseball}} aggregation {{this part of the country}} has ever seen--that is, for a school nine," [...] boasted Tommy Flanders.

2500|$|Ibn Babawayh said {{he wrote}} the synopsis: [...] "... because I found it {{appropriate}} to do so. I compiled the book without isnads (asanid) so that the chains (of authority) should not be too many (-and make the book too long-) and so that the book's advantages might be abundant. I {{did not have the}} usual intention of compilers (of books of traditions) <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forward <b>everything</b> which they (could) narrate but my intention was <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forward those things by which I gave legal opinions and which I judged to be correct.|$|R
6000|$|... "But she is his wife, sir. Where am I {{to go if}} not {{to where}} he lives? Am I <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with <b>everything</b> gone, and my poor husband {{in the right way}} to go to Bedlam, and not to say a word about it to the grand {{relations}} of him who did it all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's easy enough," [...] {{said the}} girlish student. [...] "All you've {{got to do}} is <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> in its proper place at the start, and then put it back after you have used it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! So Bill's got to {{come down}} the chimney, has he?' said Alice to herself. 'Shy, they seem <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> upon Bill! I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this {{fireplace}} is narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!' ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1982, Worden {{ran for the}} United States House of Representatives in Florida's 12th congressional {{district}} but lost the Republican primary to state senator Tom Lewis. He sold some of the postal covers to pay debts from this unsuccessful campaign. Despite the loss, Worden has referred to the endeavour as {{the high point of}} his life, saying [...] "I thought that was a very important thing <b>to</b> do. I <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> into it and lost, but that is okay." ...|$|R
2500|$|The key {{component}} characterizing such groups is {{the synthesis of}} rock and roll rhythm and energy with a decided will to distance themselves from specifically American blues origins, drawing on German or other sources instead. Jean-Hervé Peron of Faust says: [...] "We were trying <b>to</b> <b>put</b> aside <b>everything</b> we had heard in rock 'n' roll, the three-chord pattern, the lyrics. We had the urge of saying something completely different." [...] According to Peel, the only American or British band to [...] "clearly influence" [...] the genre was England's Pink Floyd, particularly for their [...] "spacey music".|$|R
5000|$|In 1840 M. l'Abbé Pierre Darbins succeeded M. Farbos as curé of Mimbaste. Marie {{revealed}} {{her soul}} to him.

60|$|To {{his mind}} {{there was nothing}} very serious {{in the loss of}} the water which had been carried into the dwelling, because the spring was within the stockade, and however much {{mischief}} the sheep had done, it would be the work of but few moments <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> in proper order once more.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked from}} Macphail to his wife, {{standing}} helplessly {{in different parts}} of the room, like lost souls, and she pursed her lips. She saw that she must take them in hand. Feckless people like that made her impatient, but her hands itched <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> in the order which came so naturally to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't tell. Country {{people of}} a certain kind are apt <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> on their backs and their walls and floors. Of course such a house here doesn't mean what it would in town." [...] She {{examined}} the texture of the carpet more critically, and the curtains; she had no shame about a curiosity that made her daughter shrink.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ellison at once {{went down}} to the village, and got a woman to scrub the cottage from top <b>to</b> bottom, and <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> tidy. The {{furniture}} went with the house, and had been provided by the squire. Mrs. Ellison went over it, and ordered a few more things to be sent down from the house to make it more comfortable for a married couple and, driving over to Lewes, ordered a carpet, curtains, and a few other little comforts for it.|$|R
50|$|At dawn, True {{rubbed his}} eyes with the dew, and regained his sight. He went to serve the king and <b>put</b> <b>to</b> use <b>everything</b> the animals had said, ending with {{restoring}} the princess's speech and hearing, at which the king married him to the princess and gave him half his kingdom.|$|R
60|$|Not so Anders. When that worthy {{saw that}} Teyma would not act, and that Leo from some inexplicable reason hesitated, he quietly took the matter {{into his own}} hands, and so wrought on the {{feelings}} of a weak but amiable youth of the tribe, that he prevailed on him to carry {{a message to the}} enemy, explaining to him earnestly that no evil, but the reverse, would result from his mission; that the Kablunets were men of peace, who would immediately come over <b>to</b> Flatland and <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> right in a peaceable and satisfactory manner.|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} settled that Mr. and Mrs. Mac-Morlan should take {{possession}} of the house {{a few days before}} Mannering's arrival, both <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> in perfect order and to make the transference of Miss Bertram's residence from their family to his as easy and delicate as possible. Accordingly, {{in the beginning of the}} month of December the party were settled at Woodbourne.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts, bustling {{into the}} dining-room and reappearing with a tumbler and a decanter: [...] "The very thing, Amy! And {{thank you so}} much. Trying to make Edward {{remember}} seems <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> out of my head! I might have thought of whiskey, though! If it's only loss of sleep, it will wake him up, and if it's grippe, it's the most nourishing thing in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So it is,' rejoined Bob, 'lunch is {{the very}} thing. Hollo, you sir! Lunch for three, directly; and keep the horses back {{for a quarter of}} an hour. Tell them <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>everything</b> they have cold, on the table, and some bottled ale, and let us taste your very best Madeira.' Issuing these orders with monstrous {{importance}} and bustle, Mr. Bob Sawyer at once hurried into the house to superintend the arrangements; in less than five minutes he returned and declared them to be excellent.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Moore Office Queen" [...] is {{a massive}} desk, made for a sitting user. From the outside it looks, when closed, much like its competitor, the Wooton desk but it differs from it in several ways. For one, it has but a single large door to lock up the main work surface and the drawers and nooks around it, while the Wooton has two. More {{importantly}} (the manufacturer liked to boast about it) the main work surface slides {{in and out of}} the main body of the desk so that work can be stopped and the desk closed without having <b>to</b> <b>put</b> away <b>everything,</b> as is the case for the Wooton desk.|$|R
5000|$|Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih {{is mainly}} {{concerned}} with Furoo al-Din. The book {{is meant to}} be a reference book to help ordinary Shia Muslims in the practise of the legal requirements of Islam. Generally, the Isnad's (Chains of the narrations) is absent. Thus, the book is a summary of the study of legal traditions. Shaikh al-Saduq himself said about his work: I compiled the book without Isnads so that the chains (of authority) should not be too many (-and make the book too long-) and so that the book's advantages might be abundant. I did not have the usual intention of compilers (of books of traditions) <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forward <b>everything</b> which they (could) narrate but my intention was <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forward those things by which I gave legal opinions and which I judged to be correct ...|$|R
5000|$|According {{to another}} reviewer, Marcus {{proceeds}} in his examination of American popular culture with the [...] "democratic assumption" [...] that Presley and Herman Melville are already {{cultural and political}} equals, and are, therefore, [...] "in conversation with one another - having a dialogue about freedom and limits, innovation and tradition, American dreams and American obsessions." [...] When the 2nd edition came out, Elvis had recently died, and Marcus was asked to amend the chapter relating <b>to</b> Elvis by <b>putting</b> <b>everything</b> {{in the past tense}} but he refused, because, he said, [...] "Elvis' presence was so powerful, I felt he's always in the present tense." ...|$|R
