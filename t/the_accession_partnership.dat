The main source of this help is PHARE. One of its components - Institution Building - allows financing the strengthening of administrative capacity. One of the mechanisms of support of institution building is twinning. It is the agreement between an institution in the candidate country and its equivalent in one or more member states. The aim of twinning is to deliver specific and guaranteed results, agreed between the parties in advance and fulfilling the goals set out in <b>the</b> <b>Accession</b> <b>Partnerships.</b> <b>The</b> parties sing the "Twinning Covenant" in which they agree on detailed work plan and means to achieve the result.

In the European Union, even though all member states apply their own national regional policies, {{there is a common}} regional policy to provide the economical and social development and to remove the regional instabilities.
