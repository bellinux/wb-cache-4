40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{relationship}} between meiotic pairing and progress of spermatogenesis, an analysis of male meiotic pairing {{was carried out in}} four reciprocal translocation heterozygotes and two double heterozygotes for two semi-identical reciprocal translocations. The reciprocal translocations were chosen to range from fertility (T 70 H/+) through almost complete sterility (T 31 H/+) to complete sterility (T 32 H/+, T 42 /H+). If meiotic pairing in the <b>translocation</b> <b>multivalent</b> was incomplete, it concerned terminal or probably more often proximal chromosome segments (Chain IV). If both segments failed to pair the multivalent symbol is Chain III + I. Complete pairing is symbolized by Ring IV. To contrast and complement observations of this type, the double heterozygotes were introduced. Males of this type in theory possess two heteromorphic bivalents with a central area of incomplete meiotic pairing (loop formation). Of the T 70 H/T 1 Wa double heterozygotes, 36 % of the males are capable of inducing at least one decidual reaction in two females whereas for T 26 H/T 2 Wa, 79 % of the males can do so. For the reciprocal translocations, it was found that proximity of the multivalent to the sex bivalent during pachytene increased in the order Ring IV, Chain IV, Chain III + I. The degree of spermatogenic impairment as measured from cell counts in histological sections and tubular whole mounts, is positively related to the frequency of proximity between the sex chromosomes and the <b>translocation</b> <b>multivalent</b> and thus to lack of meiotic pairing within the multivalent. The meiotic pairing analysis of the double heterozygotes yielded the following findings. For the long heteromorphic bivalents a true loop was never seen in T 70 H/T 1 Wa and only rarely observed in T 26 H/T 2 Wa. Small marker bivalents of both types were usually recognizable by the following criteria: pairing confined to distal or proximal segments, both distal and proximal segments pairing and loop formation and pairing covering the entire length of both "homologues" but the longer one often with a "thickened" lateral element. The same positive correlation between the absence of pairing (proximal, distal or central) and the proximity of the small marker bivalent synaptonemal complex to the sex bivalent has been found as for unpaired segments within reciprocal translocation multivalents. One unexpected finding was the occurrence of diploid spermatids and spermatozoa especially in T 32 H/+ males (70 - 91 %) but also in T 31 H/+ (3 - 39 %...|$|E
40|$|Two T 7 OH/+ translocation-carrying male mice {{were used}} in an {{investigation}} into the relation between the segregation pattern of the translocation caused multivalent at anaphase I and the position of the only chiasma in a long interstitial segment. Moreover, the relation between meiotic stage (from early diakinesis to metaphase I) and chiasma movement was assessed. It appeared that pronounced movement of a chiasma within the multivalent was linked with chiasma terminalization in an adjacent segment, either {{on the same side of}} the translocation breakpoint or on the other side. On summing the CIV and CIII+I configurations (making up 97. 9 % of all configurations found) and focusing on the multivalents from late meiotic cells, 41. 3 % had a proximal chiasma in the long interstitial segment of the multivalent. In total, a percentage of 33. 5 % of all secondary spermatocytes were characteristic of adjacent- 2 segregation (i. e., homologous centromeres move to the same pole at anaphase I). Results obtained with T 7 OH translocation trisomics, which are briefly discussed in this paper, confirm the tendency of proximal chiasma frequencies in late meiotic cells to coincide with the frequency of absence of homologous centromere separation within the T 7 OH <b>translocation</b> <b>multivalent.</b> The importance of this phenomenon for normal bivalent behavior during anaphase I is considered...|$|E
40|$|In this section, {{the order}} of the {{articles}} has not been closely followed. Each point ends with the number(s) of the article(s) (as given in the contents), where the conclusion is based on. 1) Cytological meiotic studies of T(2; 8) 26 H and T(1; 13) 70 H heterozygotes and Ts(1 13 ) 70 H tertiary trisomics indicate, that chiasmata are more often located in the distal (translocated) segments than in the proximal (interstitial) segments containing centric heterochromatin (3 and 5). 2) This study opens the possibility that the presence of centric heterochromatin decreases the probability of chiasma formation in its vicinity with a positive gradient distally (5). 3) The genetic lengths of the interstitial and translocated chromosome segments coincide rather well with the physical length of these segments as estimated with the aid of Giemsa-banding. This finding does not fit the tendency expressed in the conclusions 1 and 2. The apparent exception of this rule is segment 13 t which is overestimated when looking at genetic recombination. For cytological studies, the physical length of a segment is of a greater value (4). 4) Univalence for chromosome 1 13 at metaphase I - anaphase I does not lead to an appreciable loss of this chromosome in the male, neither in the Ts(1 13 ) 70 H tertiary trisomic karyotype nor in the T(1; 13) 70 H heterozygote (3 and 5). 5) In the T 70 H/+ karyotype, there is strong evidence for coorientation of the 1 13 univalent so that the four reciprocal translocation involved chromosomes segregate two by two. Occasionally, equational separation of the two 1 13 chromatids may occur at anaphase I (5). 6) The segregational behavior of heterozygous <b>translocation</b> <b>multivalent</b> configurations can, within the genetic background concerned, be best explained by time differences of chiasma terminalization during metaphase I - anaphase 1 (5). 7) The genetic background most likely exerts an influence on the behavior of mouse reciprocal translocations (5). 8) The reliability of the formula which relates the summed frequencies of adjacent II disjunction and numerical non- disjunction and the relative viability of heterozygous translocation outcross progeny depends on the existence of selection against small litters during gestation. This is the more likely when the theoretically expected litter size decreases (5). 9) A-chiasmate non-homologous chromosome association of the centric heterochromatin of chromosome 1 13 and the X-chromosome does occur (3 and 5). 10) The majority of male Ts(1 13 ) 70 H tertiary trisomics are capable of producing offspring. Thus, tertiary trisomy does not invariably lead to sterility in the male mouse (2 and 3). 11) Tertiary trisomics for chromosome 1 13 in the mouse display a variety of phenotypes. The condition can lead to death in utero, to death before weaning, to morphologically affected but viable animals and to animals with an unaltered appearance (2 and 3). 12) The ratio between morphologically affected and unaffected tertiary trisomics for chromosome 1 13 at birth (live or dead) amounts to between 2 and 3. This ratio might depend on the genetic background concerned (2 and 3). 13) The most obvious abnormality of the morphologically affected tertiary trisomics of the Ts(1 13 ) 70 H karyotype is a malformation of the bones of the skull which often leads to an abnormal growth of the upper and lower incisors (2). 14) The impaired fertility of Ts(1 13 ) 70 H males is most probably due to a lowered production of functional spermatozoa and the consequences this has for the continuation of pregnancy. Thus, the elimination of "unbalanced" progeny is not the first cause (3) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{chromosomes}} {{involved in}} twenty reciprocal translocations in G. hirsutum were reidentified {{by means of}} a specially designed crossing program. Each translocation line was crossed to appropriate monosomic, monotelodisomic, and/or translocation lines. The F₁ hybrids were then scored cytologically to verify the original chromosome identification. These twenty reciprocal translocations now become the cytogenetic tester set for G. hirsutum. Seed stocks for each verified translocation line will be maintained at, and distributed by, the University of Arizona. Nineteen of the twenty heterozygous translocations had a modal chiasma frequency per quadrivalent of four. Fourteen of these translocation lines formed predominantly ring multivalents at MI, and the remaining five <b>translocations</b> usually formed <b>multivalents</b> with at least one interstitial chiasma. One translocation line, which was originally produced by an interspecies cross, formed predominantly chains at MI. This increased amount of chaining in the quadrivalent is probably the result of interspecific chromosome material within the translocation reducing the chiasma frequency. The orientation of the centromeres in quadrivalents is influenced {{by the size of the}} chromosomes involved in the reciprocal translocation, and the constraints imposed by the chiasmata within the chromosome arms. Ten of the twenty reciprocal translocations studied formed predominantly alternate orientations at MI. Eight of these ten translocation lines were reciprocal translocations between two A subgenome chromosomes. This suggests that the large A subgenome chromosomes allow the quadrivalent to be more flexible, resulting in easy reorientation to the stable alternate configuration. Proximal chiasma formation influences the orientation and probable involvement of the homologous centromeres in spindle formation. Lines in which a high frequency of multivalents with interstitial chiasma were observed had a significantly lower frequency of multivalents with either one or two centromeres not involved in spindle formation of 3 : 1 orientations. In most of the heterozygous translocations, identification of each chromosome within the quadrivalent at MI was not possible. Estimation formulae were developed to estimate the positions of the breakpoints and the genetic lengths of each segment defined by <b>multivalents</b> in these <b>translocations...</b>|$|R
40|$|In the mouse, {{heterozygosity}} {{for several}} reciprocal and Robertsonian translocations {{is associated with}} impairment of chromosome synapsis and suppression of crossover formation in segments near the points of exchange during prophase of meiosis. This thesis describes {{the analysis of the}} consequences of the occurrence of non-homologous synapsis and/or suppression of meiotic crossover formation over many successive generations for male fertility and viability of the progeny. For studying chromosome synapsis, we modified a drying down technique which results in high yields of nuclei of all first meiotic prophase stages in both male and female from only small amounts of tissue (chapter 2). Preparations are suitable for synaptonemal complex (SC) analysis by normal light and electron microscopy (chapters 2, 3 and 7), for fluorescence immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization (chapters 2, 8). In the study presented in chapter 3, we analysed the variation in male fertility of mice double heterozygous for two near identical reciprocal translocations T(1; 13) 70 H and T(1; 13) 1 Wa in relation to the synaptic behaviour of two differently sized heteromorphic bivalents during meiotic prophase. Male fertility rises when non-homologous synapsis in the small 1 13 heteromorphic bivalent, leading to a "symmetrical" SC, is more frequent at the initial prophase stages. Based on the data presented, we favour the "unsaturated pairing site" model as the primary cause for male sterility. In T 70 H/T 1 Wa females not all heterologous synapsis within the small heteromorphic bivalent is effectuated during the early stages of meiosis; some is achieved lateron by the mechanism of "synaptic adjustment" (chapter 3). Each heteromorphic bivalent contains a copy of the chromosome 1 region between the T 70 H and T 1 Wa breakpoints which is about 10 cM in size (Δ 1 segment). Although axial elements representing these Δ 1 segments are seen to approach each other during early meiotic prophase stages, they never successfully constitute a synaptonemal complex in either sex (chapter 3). This agrees with the fact that in earlier cytogenetic studies quadrivalents were never seen at both male and female diakinesismetaphase 1. In chapter 7, we demonstrate that male fertility of the T 70 H/T 1 Wa mice is not only determined by the chromosomal constitution of the carrier but is additionally influenced by the pairing or synaptic history in previous meioses of especially the T 70 H and T 1 Wa short translocation chromosomes. Fertility of T 70 H/T 1 Wa males is more impaired after one or more successive transmissions of the T 1 Wa translocation chromosomes through a heteromorphic bivalent configuration, irrespective of the sex of the transmitting parent. Furthermore, we show that the introduction of the Robertsonian translocation Rb(l 1. 13) 4 Bnr into the T 70 H/T 1 Wa karyotype restores fertility of double heterozygous males by stimulating non-homologous synapsis of the small heteromorphic bivalent. We speculate that this Rb 4 Bnr effect is mediated by a prolongation of the early stages of meiotic prophase I. Successive female transmissions of the T 1 Wa translocation chromosomes in the presence of Rb 4 Bnr inititially resulted in an increase of the capacity for early meiotic nonhomologous synapsis within the small heteromorphic bivalent, leading to a restoration of fertility for the majority of carriers. Subsequently, a decrease of the capacity of the small heteromorphic bivalent to fully synapse was noticed, although a higher than original (F 1) background level of male fertility remained. These variations in male fertility are most likely based on epigenetic variance, reflected as the capacity to engage into non-homologous synapsis early in male meiosis leading to a "symmetrical" SC, despite the different amounts of chromatin to accommodate. In chapter 4, the localization of several microsatellite markers and single copy genes relative to the T 70 H and T 1 Wa breakpoints, using quantitative PCR, quantitative Southern blotting and in situ hybridization, is described. In chapter 5, we investigated the level of suppression of meiotic recombination and impairment of chromosome synapsis in T 70 H heterozygotes in relation to the viability of the progeny. For T 70 H/+ females, the introgression of the D 1 Mit 4, D 1 Mit 20 and D 1 Mit 122 microsatellite marker alleles positioned distal of the T 70 H breakpoint on the normal chromosome 1 into the 13 1 T 70 H long translocation chromosome was suppressed in a distance dependent manner. This effect was more pronounced in T 70 H/+ females, additionally homozygous for Rb 4 Bnr. The delay in introgression was paralleled by a reduction of the frequency and extent of non-homologous synapsis in segments near the T 70 H breakpoints of the pachytene <b>translocation</b> <b>multivalents</b> in T 70 H/+ and Rb 4 BnT 70 H/Rb 4 Bnr+ males. The extend of non-homologous synapsis around the centre of the synaptic cross configuration in these males correlated with fluctuations in prenatal viability of segregating translocation homozygotes in crosses between (Rb 4 Bnr) T 70 H homozygous males and heterozygous females when meiotic drive at the female second meiotic division is excluded. The reduction in viability is explained by the gain of mutations resulting from incorrect processing of recombination intermediates which is due to non-homologous synapsis around the translocation breakpoints. In chapter 6, we analysed the consequences of the absence of crossing over for regions between the T 70 H and T 1 Wa breakpoints (Δ 1 and Δ 13 segments) of the Rb 4 BnrT 1 Wa translocation chromosomes, which have been transmitted for over 20 generations via heteromorphic bivalents in Rb 4 BnrT 70 H/Rb 4 BnrT 1 Wa females. Survival of heterozygous and homozygous carriers for these segments was taken as the phenotypic endpoint. The viability of progeny of crosses between Rb 4 BnrT 70 H homozygous males and Rb 4 BnrT 70 H/Rb 4 BnrT 1 Wa females, of which the latter principally produce 4 types of gametes, was estimated using a haplotype analysis of microsatellites in the Δ 1 segment for genotyping (see chapter 4). We observed no differences in the pre- and postnatal survival rates of the double heterozygous and 13 1 H, 13 1 H, 1 13 Wa 1 13 H "duplication" progeny in which the Δ 1 and Δ 13 segments of the T 1 Wa translocation chromosomes had either no, an onegeneration or a multi-generation history of non-homologous synapsis in heteromorphic bivalents during previous female meioses. In addition, intercrossing of Rb 4 BnrT 70 H/Rb 4 BnrT 1 Wa double heterozygotes after genetic isolation of these Δ 1 and Δ 13 segments for 20 to 22 generations, showed that the viability of the Rb 4 BnrT 1 Wa homozygotes was not different from the Rb 4 BnrT 70 H homozygous and Rb 4 BnrT 70 H/Rb 4 BnrT 1 Wa karyotypes generated by this cross. Thus, exclusion of the Δ 1 and Δ 13 segments from meiotic crossing over within non-homologous synapsed heteromorphic bivalents during 20 to 25 successive generations does not result in an accumulation of recessive lethal mutations or an increased susceptibility for gaining dominant lethal mutations. For the D 1 Mit 122 microsatellite used in offspring haplotyping a higher mutation frequency was observed after transmission through a double heterozygous than after transmission through a T 70 H homozygous karyotype (chapter 6). On the basis of the identity of the mutations, the ectopic pairing of the St 2 gene copies (containing D 1 Mit 122) during meiosis of T 70 H/T 1 Wa males (chapter 8) and the observation of ectopic homologous contacts of the Δ 1 segments during the zygotene stage without SC formation (chapter 3), we speculate that these mutations are the result of ectopic homologous gene conversion events most likely occurring {{in the absence of a}} synaptonemal complex. The crossover suppressive influence of the Rb translocation on the Δ 1 segment (chapter 5) enabled us to analyze the effects of introgression of genetic material from the Swiss +/+ stock into the translocation karyotypes. Introgression of "new" genetic material correlated with an increase in littersize of Rb 4 BnrT 70 H homozygotes (chapter 5), an improvement of the life expectancy of Δ 1 duplication offspring from double heterozygous mothers (chapter 6) and a clear improvement of male fertility in double heterozygous and T 70 H homozygous males also carrying Rb 4 Bnr (chapter 7). These pleiotrophic findings are discussed in chapter 8 in terms of genetic versus epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance. Finally, when T 1 Wa was backcrossed for many generations to the Rb 4 BnrT 70 H/Rb 4 BnrT 70 H karyotype, essentially precluding genetic recombination in the Δ 1 and Δ 13 segments, or when T 1 Wa was combined with Rb 4 Bnr after many successive transmissions via alternating T 1 Wa heterozygotes and homozygotes, stable Rb 4 BnrT 1 Wa homozygous lines could not be bred (chapter 8). Especially female reproductive performance decreases after repeated male and female homologous meiosis. As non-homologous synapsis in the centre of the synaptic cross configuration in T 1 Wa/+ males is common too (unpublished results), more work into the genetic stability of chromosome segments, that have a history of hindered homologous interaction, is indicated (chapter 8) ...|$|R
