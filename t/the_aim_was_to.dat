5|$|As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) {{with the}} {{incorporated}} VoMi Himmler was {{deeply involved in}} the Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E
5|$|Concepts for an MMORPG {{within the}} Dragon Quest series began among a small team during the later {{development}} of Dragon Quest VIII. Development progressed alongside that of Dragon Quest IX. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make it accessible to series fans and newcomers alike, along with creating a long-term content plan. The development team featured multiple series veterans, including director Jin Fujisawa, series creator and designer Yuji Horii, series artist Akira Toriyama, and series composer Koichi Sugiyama. New staff members included producer Yosuke Saito, {{who had previously}} worked on the Drakengard series and whose company Orca helped with development; and Chikara Saito, who joined as co-director in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a more accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work {{was provided by the}} rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E

5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, the Working Group, {{devised a}} more ambitious {{proposal}} in November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> bribe the SS {{with money from}} Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{instructed}} Bremner {{to be more}} attacking in the 1973–74 campaign, and {{the result}} was 11 goals in 52 appearances, his biggest goal tally in 12 years. The manager focused entirely on the league and told his team <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> go the season unbeaten, and although they lost three games they secured a second league title by a five-point margin on second-place Liverpool. Bremner was named on the PFA Team of the Year and finished second in the FWA Footballer of the Year voting to Ian Callaghan. At {{the end of the season}} he was given a testimonial match against Sunderland which raised him £32,500; he had chosen the opponents in an attempt to avenge defeat in the previous year's FA Cup final.|$|E

5|$|Soma Bringer was the {{creation}} of producer and studio co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi. Initially a standard role-playing game before transitioning to action role-playing due to hardware restrictions, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create an engaging multiplayer experience: this resulted in the gameplay being developed before the story, a reversal of the development style used for earlier Monolith Soft titles. It featured returning staff from Takahashi's earlier titles, including Xeno series writer Soraya Saga, and Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Development took approximately two years.|$|E

5|$|The {{modifications}} {{are attributed}} to Maunsell’s Chief Draughtsman James Clayton, who had transferred to Ashford railway works in 1914 from Derby works. They {{were the result of}} cooperation between the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR) when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a series of standard freight and passenger locomotives for use throughout Britain, and meant that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design. These included streamlined steam passages, long-travel valves, the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure.|$|E
5|$|The next NASA {{astronaut}} {{to stay on}} Mir was Michael Foale. Foale and Russian {{mission specialist}} Elena Kondakova boarded Mir from Atlantis on mission STS-84. The STS-84 crew transferred 249 items between the two spacecraft, along with water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. One of the first items transferred to Mir was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Atlantis was stopped three times while backing away during the undocking sequence on May 21. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> collect data from a European sensor device designed for future rendezvous of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) with the International Space Station.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s, with vehicle numbers depleted by wartime service in France and Belgium, the Underground Group's bus operations began to experience a surge in competition from a large number of new independent bus operators. These small operators were unregulated and preyed on the group's most profitable routes taking away a large number of its passengers and a large amount of its income. Albert Stanley (ennobled as Lord Ashfield in 1920) and Pick fought back by calling on parliament to regulate bus operations in the capital. The London Traffic Act 1924 granted their request by establishing the London Traffic Area to regulate road passenger traffic within London and the surrounding districts. Throughout the 1920s, Pick led the Underground Group's efforts to coordinate its services with the municipal tram operators, the Metropolitan Railway and the suburban mainline rail services. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> achieve a pooling of income between all of the operators and remove wasteful competition. At the end of 1930, a solution was announced in a bill for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation which was {{to take control of the}} Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway and the majority of the bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area covering the County of London and Middlesex and parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron {{returned}} from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, {{the most of any}} B-1B squadron on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled an average of two to three air support requests per day. On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500lb GBU-54 bombs, 500lb and 2,000lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), and Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets; the B-1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.|$|E
5|$|In mid-February 1944, the 37th Battalion, {{as part of}} 14th Brigade, was {{involved}} in the Battle of the Green Islands, codenamed Operation Squarepeg. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> secure an airfield for use in further advances in the Solomon Islands. On 15 February, the battalion was landed on the western side of Nissan Island, largely a coral reef, along with 35th Battalion. The 30th Battalion was landed on {{the eastern side of the}} island; collectively, the landings were the largest amphibious operation mounted by New Zealand forces in the war. Although the Japanese were present on the island, the landing was unopposed. Initially positioned to the north of the island's airstrip, it later moved to the village of Sior. Although the Japanese were reported to be in the south of the island, the battalion still carried out patrols to ensure none were still in their sector. Later in the month, soldiers from the battalion carried out landings on Sau, a small island to the northeast of Nissan Island, to deal with Japanese there. Four were wounded in exchanges of gunfire but this operation effectively ended any meaningful Japanese resistance in the area. With Nissan Island secure by 28 February, the battalion switched to a defensive mode of operations, monitoring for Japanese counterattacks and assisting in the building of the facilities necessary to allow the island to be used for air and sea operations.|$|E

5|$|On 21 March, Germany {{launched}} Operation Michael. This attack, {{which became}} the opening salvo of their Spring Offensive, aimed to deliver a single, decisive, war winning blow. The Germans intended to strike the southern British flank, to separate the British and French armies and then move north to engage {{the bulk of the}} British forces in France in a vernichtungsschlacht (battle of annihilation). <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> inflict such a defeat upon the British armies that the country would abandon the war, which in turn would force the French to sue for peace. After the first ten days of the German offensive, the casualties suffered by the 2nd and the 47th (London) Divisions were such that the 38th was ordered south to take up positions near Albert to relieve the two formations. The infantry moved south, and the divisional artillery remained at Armentières to support the 34th Division and subsequently took part in the Battle of the Lys. During this battle, the artillery went on to aid French forces before being transferred temporarily to the British 25th Division and conducting a fighting withdrawal. Its actions with both divisions earned the men of the divisional artillery plaudits from both divisional commanders.|$|E
5|$|The Comilla Model (1959) was Khan's {{initiative}} {{in response to}} the failure of a Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) programme that was launched in 1953 in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. V-AID remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of rural development. Khan launched the project in 1959 on his return from Michigan, and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. Advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from Harvard and Michigan State Universities, the Ford Foundation, and USAID. Practical help was also sought from Japan to improve the local farming techniques.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault was}} under the direct command of Major-General Essad Pasha. The plan was to gather the assault force {{secretly}} behind the Turkish lines on 18 May. Then at 03:30 19 May, {{while it was still}} dark, the Turkish forces would simultaneously attack all along the ANZAC perimeter. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> force the defenders out of their trenches and back into the sea. To maintain surprise the attack would not be preceded by an artillery bombardment; but the previous day all the available Turkish artillery bombarded the ANZAC lines between 17:00 and midnight. This was something they had done twice before that month. The signal to start the attack {{was supposed to have been}} the detonation of a large mine at Quinn's Post, in the centre of the ANZAC lines, but by 19 May the tunnel for the mine had not been completed. The attacking force, from north to south, comprised the 19th Division (now made up of the 27th, 57th and 72nd Infantry Regiments), 5th Division (13th and 14th Infantry Regiments), 2nd Division (1st, 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments), 16th Division (33rd, 47th, 48th and 125th Infantry Regiments) and the now independent 77th Infantry Regiment. In total this was around 42,000 men. The 2nd and 16th Divisions were fresh, having just arrived on the peninsula, while the other two had taken part in some of the previous counter-attacks at Anzac Cove.|$|E
