40|$|F-Actin {{treated with}} a half molar {{equivalent}} of the heterobifunctional cross-linker, 4 -bromomethyl- 3 -nitrobenzoic acid succinimide ester (BNBA-SE), produced a population of actin oligomers containing 2 - 14 or more protomers and {{a significant amount of}} uncrosslink-ed actin protomers. The crosslinking reaction is presumed to occur between Cys 374 of one actin protomer with Lys 191 of an adjacent protomer on the genetic helix of F-actin, in a similar manner to iV-maleimidobenzoic acid succinimidyl ester, which shares similar reactive groups and crosslinking dimensions. Crosslinked oligomers and uncrosslinked protomers were found to form filaments that sediment after high-speed centrifugation, even in a buffer of low ionic strength [G-buffer: 2 mM <b>tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane</b> (pH 8. 0), 0. 2 mM CaCl 2, 0. 2 mM ATP, 0. 3 mM NaN 3, 5 mM 2 -mercaptoethanol] where affinity between actin protomers usually becomes weak, leading to the depolymerization of native F-actin. By performing the crosslinking reaction in the presence of an environment-sensi-tive fluorescent label, 6 -acryloyl- 2 -(dimethylamino) naphthalene (acrylodan), which com-petes with BNBA-SE for Cys 374 of actin protomers, fluorescent, crosslinked F-actin filaments were obtained which were also stable in G-buffer.

40|$|Replacement of {{barbiturate}} buffer by a <b>tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane</b> buffer in the thymol test reagent of Maclagan greatly {{improves the}} stability of the reagent. Thymol turbidity measurements made by means of the modified reagent agreed closely with those made with barbiturate-containing reagents. However in hyperlipemic sera, the latter reagent gave higher turbidities. A reaction of barbiturate with serum chylomicrons and triglycerides explains the difference. It is believed that the modified reagent is less likely to be affected by casual changes in serum lipid concentration and that therefore it should prove to be more dependable as an aid in the study of liver disease. Heating is not an essential operation in preparation of thymol test reagents. The pH is of critical importance in measurement of thymol turbidity. The large change in pH of barbiturate and Tris buffers with change in temperature makes care-ful control of temperature essential. Tables showing the appropriate reagent pH at various laboratory temperatures are presented. ALTHOUGH thymol turbidity measurement was originally proposed by Maclagan (1) as a semiquantitative test for the diagnosis of liver diseases, its potentialities as an aid to diagnosis may be substantially increased by careful control of certain factors that affect the reaction of thymol with serum proteins and lipids (2). Among the more impor...|$|E
40|$|Humic {{substances}} (HS) {{extracted from}} 14 Sphagnum peats of various geographical origin were submitted to capillary electrophoresis (CE) in free solution and in entangled polymer solutions (25 g l- 1 and 50 g l- 1) of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Electrophoretic runs {{were made in}} uncoated capillaries (75 Î¼m internal diameter) using a <b>tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane</b> (TRIS) -phosphate buffer (pH 8. 3) eventually containing PEG and applying a voltage of 10 kV. The HS extract of a Lithuanian peat was fractionated by ultrafiltration into five fractions with a nominal mean relative molecular mass (M) of 3000, 7500, 20 000, 75 000 and 200 000 Da. Without PEG, migration times {{were not correlated with}} the logarithm of M, but linear relations were obtained with 25 g l- 1 and 50 g l- 1 PEG solutions. Both solutions separated the different fractions by size; the best regression and the largest interval of linearity, M from 3000 to 200 000 Da, was obtained with the 25 g l- 1 PEG solution. At 10 kV and without PEG, migration times ranged from 6. 5 to 8. 1 min and did not differentiate the peats, whereas at 25 g l- 1 PEG, migration times ranged from 3. 3 to 6. 5 min and, when plotted as a function of either the r value or the von Post index (H), which are used to evaluate the degree of decomposition of horticultural peats, they separated samples {{on the basis of their}} geographical origin and probable type of mire complex. At 25 g l- 1 PEG, migration times also showed a well-defined linear decreasing trend with the increase of mean annual temperatures. These relations suggest the hypothesis that humification in mires goes along with an increase in the average size of humic molecules...|$|E
