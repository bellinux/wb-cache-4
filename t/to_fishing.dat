5|$|Reef {{environments in}} Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species {{richness}} and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007. A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} yellow {{stingray}} under Least Concern, citing its wide distribution and high abundance in certain regions. In addition, its small size implies relatively high productivity, {{which would make}} its population more resilient <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure. This species is not targeted commercially, but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range. It is also harvested for the home aquarium trade, being the most frequently available member of its family on the North American market. The extent of this trade {{has not yet been}} quantified. Another potential threat is habitat degradation, particularly to seagrass beds. No conservation measures have been enacted for this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{bramble shark}} {{is not known}} to pose a danger to humans. It is caught {{incidentally}} by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line, {{as well as by}} sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that bramble shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. This decline has been attributed <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, deep-sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient.|$|E

Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury <b>to</b> <b>fish</b> and lowering the general stress level in the population.

5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is taken}} by {{fisheries}} operating off Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and likely elsewhere, using longlines, gillnets, and trawls. The meat and liver are eaten, though sharks from certain areas present a substantial risk of ciguatera poisoning (especially the liver, which contains {{a much higher}} concentration of the toxin than the meat). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as its numbers have dropped in recent decades due to increasing, and thus far unregulated, fishing pressure in the tropics. Its restricted habitat, low dispersal, and slow reproduction are factors that limit this shark's capacity for recovering from overfishing. On the Great Barrier Reef, populations of whitetip reef sharks in fishing zones have been reduced by 80% relative to no-entry zones. Furthermore, populations in no-take zones, where boats are allowed but fishing prohibited, exhibit levels of depletion comparable <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> zones due to poaching. Demographic models indicate that these depleted populations will continue to decline by 6.68.3% per year without additional conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|Several causes {{provoked}} a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, {{who used to}} consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population {{is estimated to be}} less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 20 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals. Consequently, there is low genetic variability.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{people of}} the Fanno Creek watershed were the Atfalati or Tualaty tribe of the Kalapuya, said to have displaced even earlier inhabitants, the Multnomahs, prior to European contact. The valleys of the Willamette River and its major tributaries such as the Tualatin River consisted of open grassland maintained by annual burning, with scattered groves of trees along the rivers and creeks. The Kalapuya moved {{from place to place}} in good weather to fish, to hunt small animals, birds, waterfowl, deer, and elk, and to gather nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. Important foods included camas and wapato. In addition <b>to</b> <b>fishing</b> for eels, suckers, and trout, the Atfalati traded for salmon from Chinookan tribes near Willamette Falls. During the winter, the Kalapuya lived in longhouses in settled villages. Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18thcentury with Europeans, who carried malaria, smallpox, measles, and other diseases. Added pressure came from white settlers who seized and fenced native land, regarded it as private property, and sometimes punished natives for trespassing. Of the original population of 1,000 to 2,000Atfalati reported in 1780, only 65 remained in 1851. In 1855, the U.S. government sent the survivors to the Grande Ronde reservation further west.|$|E
