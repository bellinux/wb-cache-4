40|$|Current {{trend has}} shown that farms are getting fewer, but farm size is {{becoming}} larger and larger. As the farm size is getting larger, the farm equipment is simultaneously becoming larger to adapt the new state and federal regulations which encourage farmers <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>manure</b> as a liquid and apply it {{in a short time}} period. The sizes of farm as well as farm equipment are growing faster than both the pavement design technology and the state regulations. The effect of such an increase on pavements would be an accelerated rate of pavement deterioration. There is a concern that the heavy farm equipment can do significant damage to pavement and bridges. Initiated in early 2007, this study used a comprehensive series of combinations of farm equipments, axle load, speed and traffic wanders to determine the pavement response under various types of farm equipments and to quantify the pavement damage due to various agricultural equipments. Two typical instrumented concrete testing pavement sections were used to measure the critical pavement responses and validate the theoretical pavement response model ISLAB 2005. Through this research, it was determined that traffic wander, seasonal effect, pavement structure, and vehicle type/configuration have pronounced impact on pavement responses. However, traffic speed is not statistically significant with respect to pavement performance. Additionally, all agricultural vehicles tested generated higher pavement responses than a standard semi-truck when they are fully loaded. It is also found that if the rear axle of the agricultural vehicles is driven 18 - 24 inches (2 feet) away from the pavement shoulder, the pavement damage could be reduced to minimal even when they were fully loaded. The study also found that by increasing concrete pavement thickness by 2. 5 inches, the pavement strain response will be reduced as much as 280 %. ISLAB 2005, a finite element program, was utilized to perform the damage analysis for different pavement structures under various agricultural vehicles with and without slab curling behavior. The damage analysis results confirmed the field behavior that all agricultural vehicles introduce higher pavement responses than a standard semi-truck. The damage analysis also concluded that the damage due to slab curling coupled with heavy agricultural vehicle‟s loading could be devastating for the concrete pavement. The findings of this study is expected to provide {{a better understanding of the}} interaction of farm equipment with the pavement structures which will facilitate more rational regulation of Spring load restrictions, additionally with respect to acceptance of new designs and innovations in vehicle configuration. The findings will help highway agencies to design roads that are more capable of resisting to damage related to heavy loading with complex gear configuration...|$|E

Emissions of NH 3 and the greenhouse gases methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from an uncovered and covered heap of solids separated from pig slurry were compared, and related to the oxygenation level inside the manure heap. Approximately 15 % of the initial nitrogen content was lost when separated solids were stored uncovered.

Passive diffusion samplers (Willems Badges) were used to determine vertical concentration profiles to a height of 4. 5 m at a number of locations around each slurry store. An atmospheric dispersion model was applied to estimate the contribution from emissions from other on-farm ammonia sources to the measured data and also to determine the emission rates from the <b>stored</b> <b>manure.</b> A procedure was applied whereby the emission rates from each source were allowed to vary and a numerical equation solver was applied to backfit the modelled data set to the field measurements.

The model simulates contrasted management systems, including different options for housing (slatted floor or deep litter), outside storage of manure and treatment (anaerobic digestion, biological N removal processes, slurry composting (SC) with straw and solid manure composting). Farmer practices and climatic conditions, which have significant effects on gaseous emissions within each option, have also been identified. The quantification of their effects was based on expert judgement from literature and local experiments, relations from mechanistic models or simple emission factors, depending on existing knowledge. The model helps to identify relative advantages and weaknesses for each system. For example, deep-litter with standard management practices is associated with high-greenhouse gas (GHG) production (+ 125 % compared to slatted floor) and SC on straw is associated with high NH 3 emission (+ 15 % compared to slatted floor). Another important result from model building and first simulations is that farmer practices and the climate induce an intra-system (for a given infrastructure) variability of NH 3 and GHG emissions nearly as high as inter-system variability. For example, in deep-litter housing systems, NH 3 and N 2 O emissions from animal housing may vary between 6 % and 53 %, and between 1 % and 19 % of total N excreted, respectively Thus, the model could be useful to identify and quantify improvement margins on farms, more precisely or more easily than current methodologies...|$|R

40|$|INDICATOR {{bacteria}} {{concentrations in}} non-snowmelt runofffrom adjacent manured and non-manured watersheds were monitored for 4 years. Significant {{differences in the}} quality of runoff from the manured and non-manured cropland were not consistently observed. Hydrological conditions greatly affected bacterial concentrations. Heavy runoff under wet weather conditions resulted in water quality degradation irrespective of cropping or manuring activity. Under relatively dry weather conditions, runoff from both the manured and non-manured cropland often met the recommended bacterial quality criteria for water to be used for recreation or as a source of public water supplies. The relatively better quality of manured cropland runoff in our study compared to other studies was attributed mainly to the management practice of dry weather manure application followed by immediate plowdown and the mostly level topography of the watersheds. Much lower indicator bacteria concentrations in long-term <b>stored</b> <b>manure</b> than in relatively fresh manure suggested a lower potential for runoff pollution from land application of the former...|$|R
40|$|Manure in an {{inevitable}} {{byproduct of the}} production of meat and milk destined for human consumption. Excessive excretion of manure and manure nutrients represent inefficiencies which increase feed costs, increase {{the environmental impact of}} dairy farming, and increase the costs associated with moving and <b>storing</b> <b>manure.</b> Profitability can be enhanced when good feeding and management practices are used that reduce manure production per unit of milk produced. Furthermore, good environmental stewardship will maintain the generally good image the public has of dairy farming. Society is becoming increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of manure and manure nutrients. In response, the federal government and many states have developed environmental rules regulating certain dairy farms (EPA, 2003). Although regulations vary, the amount of P and N excreted via manure are of major regulatory importance. The selection of proper feed ingredients and diet formulation can affect the mass of manure produced and the amount of specific nutrients (e. g., N and P) that are excreted. MANURE PRODUCTIO...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse gas (GHG) and odour {{emissions}} were measured over {{a two-year period}} from a swine manure storage tank and from two swine manure treatment facilities (an aerobic-anoxic and a biofilter manure treatment system). Floating open chambers were used to collect air samples on top of the <b>stored</b> <b>manure.</b> GHG concentrations were either measured continuously, during two-week periods at different sea-sons by gas chromatography or determined from air samples collected using syringes and stored in eva-cuated glass containers. All GHG emissions data were expressed in terms of mass of CO 2 equivalent to allow direct comparisons and additions of the emissions for the three different GHG. Air bag samples were collected and odour concentrations (in OU m- 3) were measured using a dynamic dilution olfactometer. Odour intensities (in ppb equivalent of 1 -butanol) were measured on site using a suprathreshold dynamic dilution olfactometer. According to the results obtained in this project, manure treatment systems contribu-ted to reduce GHG and {{odour emissions}}...|$|R
40|$|The fate of two {{strains of}} L. monocytogenes {{and their ability}} to become viable but non-culturable (VBNC) was {{investigated}} in microcosms containing piggery effluents (two raw manures and two biologically treated <b>manures)</b> <b>stored</b> for two months at 8 °C and 20 °C. Levels of L. monocytogenes were estimated using the culture method, qPCR, and propidium monoazide treatment combined with qPCR (qPCRPMA). The chemical composition and the microbial community structure of the manures were also analysed. The strains showed similar decline rates and persisted up to 63 days. At day zero, the percentage of VBNC cells among viable cells was higher in raw manures (81. 5 - 94. 8 %) than in treated manures (67. 8 - 79. 2 %). The changes in their proportion over time depended on the temperature and on the type of effluent: the biggest increase was observed in treated manures at 20 °C and the smallest increase in raw manures at 8 °C. The chemical parameters had no influence on the behaviour of the strains, but decrease of the persistence of viable cells was associated with an increase in the microbial richness of the manures. This study demonstrated that <b>storing</b> <b>manure</b> altered the culturability of L. monocytogenes, which rapidly entered the VBNC state, and underlines the importance of including VBNC cells when estimating the persistence of the pathogens in farm effluents...|$|R

40|$|In most {{small-scale}} farms in sub-Saharan Africa, net negative balances of nutrients result when nutrients {{are removed from}} the farm by harvested crops, because farmers cannot afford inorganic fertilizers. A key resource that could be useful in reversing this trends is manure from livestock. The N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn contents of manures collected from six experimental stations and twenty {{small-scale farms}} in the Ethiopian highlands were analysed. The manures contained, on average 21. 3 g K, 18. 3 g N, 16. 4 g Ca, 5. 6 g Mg, 4. 5 g P, 10776 mg Fe, 777 mg Mn, 92 mg Zn and 24 mg Cu per Kg. Manures from experimental stations contained significantly more N, P, K, Mg, Cu and Zn than the manures from smallholder farms, probably {{due to differences in}} feed availability and quality. Fresh <b>manures</b> and <b>stored</b> (dry) <b>manures</b> were not significantly different in nutrient concentrations although <b>stored</b> <b>manures</b> had slightly higher nutrient concentrations, probably as a concentration effect after loss of carbon. Manures collected in Ginchi area, but, due to scarcity of fuel wood, farmers in Deneba use manures for fuel for domestic cooking and heating instead of applying it to the soil. Afforestation programmes, or other programmes that would ease the energy problem for domestic use, may be necessary if manures are to be applied to soils. Whether the amount of manure in the livestock-dense Ethiopian highlands is sufficient to support crop production is unknown. Research in other parts of Africa indicates that, although adequate manure may be applied to some fields, insufficient manure is available to support crop production at a wider scale...|$|R

In the 1970s it was used as a garage and for car repairs, a hole was opened in its facade and the basement was used as a garage. By 1990 it had fallen into disrepair, was vandalised and much was stolen including carved wood and gesso chimneypieces.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of beef cattle production systems {{in terms of}} diet, manure management and building design results in variation in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the opportunities to reduce them. Within this context, we studied {{the effect of the}} varying proportions of concentrate (37 - 85 % of DM) in the diet of Belgian Blue heifers on CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from a tie-stall system (barn and solid manure storage). Trials were conducted over two consecutive periods in which <b>manure</b> was <b>stored</b> mainly in winter and spring. Increasing the proportions of concentrate in the diet reduced the GHG (CH 4 +N 2 O) emissions from the barns from 8. 5 ± 1. 6 to 1. 9 ± 0. 4 kgCO 2 eq/kg live-weight gain, but had not significant influence on the emissions from the <b>stored</b> solid <b>manure.</b> Seasonal variation in gas emissions was observed, with lower emissions from <b>stored</b> solid <b>manure</b> in winter than in spring (159 ± 25 and 314 ± 49 mg CO 2, 0. 14 ± 0. 02 and 2. 47 ± 0. 78 mg CH 4, and < 0. 01 and 0. 24 ± 0. 09 mgN 2 O/kg of fresh manure stored/d of storage, respectively), indicating that manure storage in the warmer season should be avoided. The GHG (CH 4 +N 2 O) emissions from <b>stored</b> solid <b>manure,</b> however, were less than 11 % of the total emissions (barns+manure storage). The emphasis in these systems should therefore be on modelling and reducing direct CH 4 emissions from cattle but feed production impact should also be included. The GHG emissions were validated using nutrient (C, K, P and ash) balances including CO 2 and CH 4 emissions for the C balance. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the microbial community in swine manure can successfully acclimate to the psychrophilic operating conditions in ISPAD and develop robust anaerobic digestion. This was done in the laboratory by analyzing manure from a three-year old full-scale pilot ISPAD facility located in St. Francois Xavier, Quebec, Canada, along with fresh manure and manure from an uncovered storage tank. Biochemical methane production assays performed at the three temperatures were used to quantify the performance of the microbial community and its temperature dependence. The ISPAD microbial community produced methane, in terms of VS added, at rates of 44. 6, 9. 8 and 8. 5 dm 3 kg- 1 d- 1, at 35, 18 and 80 C, respectively.
