The size of schools like Oxy {{makes it possible for}} this support to take the form of very close collaboration between librarians and faculty. Both groups are dedicated to providing ?a total educational experience of the highest quality. *? As technology develops and the learning styles of students change, all of academia?including both classrooms and libraries?needs to adapt in order to continue to uphold an excellent standard of education. <b>This</b> <b>requires</b> <b>turning</b> a critical and innovative eye to new educational technologies as they become available. This presentation will address some already existing educational technologies, and some general concerns associated with them, before introducing The HyperCities Project, created by Todd Presner in 2005, {{as an example of a}} new direction for educational technology. Since its inception as an alternative to a textbook for UCLA History Course, it has exploded into a worldwide collection of historical and current information. As well as being an engaging and interactive program it provides an alternative organization of historical information: geographically, rather than linearly. I will demonstrate two very different applications for HyperCities and provide a guided tour of its general features. This demonstration will include a discussion of the process of using HyperCities as well as the pros and cons of being on the cutting edge of a new program. *Excerpted from the Library and Occidental College Mission Statement...|$|E

Closely related to this is the employment of energy budgeting, i. e., effective utilization of available and future energy resources without pushing a node towards the hazard of energy depletion. Therefore, reliable prediction of node lifetime in context of the available energy within a given time is <b>required.</b> <b>This</b> in <b>turn</b> <b>requires</b> self-calibration of the sensor nodes and their energy harvesting supply. In this paper, we explore and assess models for a supercapacitorbased harvesting supply.

Moreover, measurement results for a specific hardware platform are discussed and a roadmap for a self-calibration algorithm is presented. I...|$|R

To provide visual assessment and improve success of surgical treatment, a segmentation technique equipped with a reliable statistical shape model is <b>required.</b> <b>This</b> in <b>turn</b> <b>requires</b> reliable dense correspondences establishment.

Given a few easily identifiable land-mark correspondences, our technique obtains a much denser set of point correspondences across a set of 3 D aortic sources meshes to the target mesh. We proposes to use geodesic interpolation, a new mesh based similarity metric, and a two-stage local transformation to develop a better registration technique for 3 D aortic meshes. It results in better corre-spondences compared to existing work, shows an average Hausdorff distance of 3. 65 mm and point-to-mesh distance of 0. 41 mm.

Correct forwarding of pack-ets requires the prior exchange of information among routers, using the appropriate routing protocol. Valid construction of the routes requires that the exchanged information be received from a legitimate neighbor, and that it not be altered en route, i. e., the inter-router communication has to be secure. <b>This</b> <b>requires,</b> in <b>turn,</b> an architecture for managing the necessary security associations and keying material within an administrative region. After reviewing current work and existing security tools, a proposal is made for a novel architecture to manage the router updates. The operations within this architecture are detailed, and its advantages are explained. Index Terms—Routing; Security; Key Management I...|$|R

Because of the extreme environmental conditions (the displacement must be measured in vacuum and between two points at a temperature difference of about 300 degrees), no adequate existing monitoring system was found for this application. We describe here a novel optical sensor developed for our scope and we present results of measurements made during the cold test of the dipoles...|$|R

40|$|Reducing both {{project cost}} and time (duration) is {{critical}} in a competitive environment. However, a trade-off between project time and cost is <b>required.</b> <b>This</b> in <b>turn</b> <b>requires</b> contracting organizations to carefully evaluate various approaches to attaining an optimal time-cost equilibrium. Although several analytical models {{have been developed for}} time-cost optimization (TCO), they mainly focus on projects where the contract duration is fixed. The optimization objective in those cases is therefore restricted to identifying the minimum total cost only. With the increasing popularity of alternative project delivery systems, clients and contractors are targeting the increased benefits and opportunities of seeking an earlier project completion. The multiobjective model for TCO proposed in this paper is powered by techniques using genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed model integrates the adaptive weights derived from previous generations, and induces a search pressure toward an ideal point. The concept of the GA-based multiobjective TCO model is illustrated through a simple manual simulation, and the results indicate that the model could assist decision-makers in concurrently arriving at an optimal project duration and total cost. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
