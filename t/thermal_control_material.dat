40|$|Silverized Teflon (Ag/FEP) is {{a widely}} used passive <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> <b>{{material}}</b> for space applications. The material has a very low alpha/e ratio (less than 0. 1) for low operating temperatures and is fabricated with various FEP thicknesses (as the Teflon thickness increases, the emittance increases). It is low outgassing and, because of its flexibility, can be applied around complex, curved shapes. Ag/FEP has achieved multiyear lifetimes {{under a variety of}} exposure conditions. This has been demonstrated by the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), Solar Max, Spacecraft Charging at High Altitudes (SCATHA), and other flight experiments. Ag/FEP material has been held in place on spacecraft by a variety of methods: mechanical clamping, direct adhesive bonding of tapes and sheets, and by Velcro(TM) tape adhesively bonded to back surfaces. On LDEF, for example, 5 -mil blankets held by Velcro(TM) and clamping were used for thermal control over 3 - by 4 -ft areas on each of 17 trays. Adhesively bonded 2 - and 5 -mil sheets were used on other LDEF experiments, both for thermal control and as tape to hold other thermal control blankets in place. Performance data over extended time periods are available from a number of flights.

In the present study, La 1 -xSrxMnO 3 thin films were prepared on MgO(100) substrates by pulsed laser deposition, and the effect of Sr-doping (x = 0 ~ 0. 4) on the structure and infrared emissivity was investigated. Single-phased La 1 -xSrxMnO 3 films with (100) -orientation were obtained, which showed a dense texture with smooth surface. The ratio of Mn 4 +/Mn 3 + in the films was increased with increasing Sr doping, leading to the enhancement in double-exchange interaction and electrical conductivity.

Teflon ® FEP thermal control blankets (space-facing FEP) retrieved during the first servicing mission (SM 1) were found to be embrittled on solar-facing surfaces and contained microscopic cracks. During the second servicing mission (SM 2) astronauts noticed that the FEP outer layer of the multi-layer insulation (MLI) covering the telescope was cracked in many locations around the telescope.

This is particularly critical in the case of thermal control materials where the efficiency of the thermal control is dependent on the stability of the surface properties.

Four main techniques which all look at specific material properties are differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermomechnical analysis (TMA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The commercially available polyimide foils Kapton HN and Upilex S are often used as external <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> <b>material</b> on spacecraft. For missions to the inner part of the solar system, these materials need to withstand an elevated service temperature in combination with high intensity solar radiation, such as UV and protons. The thermal stability of Kapton and Upilex has been investigated at around 250 C for a mission to Venus and at 350 C for a mission to Mercury. Samples were aged at representative temperature levels, also in combination with high intensity UV and proton radiation. It was found that TMA and DMA revealed, in good detail, the environmental effects of the behavior of the materials. Both foils are known to be thermally stable materials. Assessment by TGA and kinetic modeling indicates a better stability of Upilex at 350 C. The DMA experiments of foils aged at 350 C for up to 3580 h prove that the glass transition of Kapton is largely affected and almost completely disappears. Upilex is also affected but remains more stable. The TMA assessment revealed annealing of residual stresses at elevated temperature that cause (partial) shrinking of the foils.

Because the SADA MLI had solar and anti-solar facing surfaces and was exposed to the space environment for a long duration, it provided a unique opportunity to study solar effects on the environmental degradation of Ag-FEP, a commonly used spacecraft <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> <b>material.</b> Data obtained included tensile properties, solar absorptance, surface morphology and chemistry. The solar facing surface was found to be extremely embrittled and contained numerous through-thickness cracks. Tensile testing indicated that the solar facing surface lost 60 % of its mechanical strength and 90 % of its elasticity while the anti-solar facing surface had ductility similar to pristine FEP. The solar absorptance of both the solar facing surface (0. 155 plus or minus 0. 032) and the anti-solar facing surface (0. 208 plus or minus 0. 012) were found to be greater than pristine Ag-FEP (0. 074). Solar facing and anti-solar facing surfaces were microscopically textured, and locations of isolated contamination were present on the anti-solar surface resulting in increased localized texturing. Yet, the overall texture was significantly more pronounced on the solar facing surface indicating a synergistic effect of combined solar exposure and increased heating with atomic oxygen erosion.

The erosion sensitivity of some materials such as FEP Teflon used as a <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> <b>material</b> on satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), is particularly important but difficult to determine. This is in large {{part due to the}} inability to hold all but one exposure parameter constant during a flight experiment. This is also difficult to perform in a ground based facility, because often the variation of the level of atomic oxygen or VUV radiation also results in a change in the level of the other parameter. A facility has been developed which allows each parameter to be changed almost independently and offer broad area exposure. The resulting samples can be made large enough for mechanical testing. The facility uses an electron cyclotron resonance plasma source to provide the atomic oxygen. A series of glass plates is used to focus the atomic oxygen while filtering the VUV radiation from the plasma source. After filtering, atomic oxygen effective flux levels can still be measured which are as high as 7 x 10 (exp 15) atoms/cm(exp 2) -sec which is adequate for accelerated testing. VUV radiation levels after filtering can be as low as 0. 3 suns. Additional VUV suns can be added with the use of deuterium lamps which allow the VUV level to be changed while keeping the flux of atomic oxygen constant.

They were selected from new materials which emerged from development programs during the 1978 - 1982 time frame. Included were materials described in the technical literature which were being considered or had been applied to satellites. Materials that had been exposed on previous satellite materials experiments were also included to provide data correlation with earlier space flight experiments. The objective was {{to determine the effects of}} the LDEF environment on the physical and optical properties of polymeric thin film <b>thermal</b> <b>control</b> <b>materials,</b> the interaction of the LDEF environment with silvered spacecraft surfaces, and the performance of low outgassing adhesives. Sixteen combinations of various {{polymeric film}}s, metallized and unmetallized, adhesively bonded and unbonded films were orbited on LDEF in the M 0003 - 5 experiment. The films were exposed in two separate locations on the vehicle. One set was exposed on the direct leading edge of the satellite. The other set was exposed on the direct trailing edge of the vehicle. The purpose of the experiment was to understand the changes in the properties of materials before and after exposure to the space environment and to compare the changes with predictions based on laboratory experiments. The basic approach was to measure the optical and physical properties of materials before and after long-term exposure to a low earth orbital environment comprised of UV, VUV, electrons, protons, atomic oxygen, thermal cycling, vacuum, debris and micrometeoroids. Due to the unanticipated extended orbital flight of LDEF, the polymeric film materials were exposed for a full five years and ten months to the space environment...|$|R
