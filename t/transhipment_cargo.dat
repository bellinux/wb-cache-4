The main work of this paper was to establish a logit-based port choice model for South China container cargo on the basis of historical data. However, the historical data used (shown in Fig. 2) included not only South China cargo, but also <b>transhipment</b> <b>cargo.</b> This made the model established problematic. Furthermore, all the results based on the model, which are discussed in Section 6, would become problematic, and one of the results suggesting that a new bridge project would not help Hong Kong Port could be misleading. It is possible that publication of such problematic results would adversely affect public policy making...|$|E

30|$|Obviously, the Bangkok and Penang Ports will {{experience}} significant benefits {{due to this}} mega project. In terms of the perspective of Malaysia, the Penang Port is still quite near to the canal and, perhaps, the effect may only be marginal. Also, Malaysia {{is still one of}} the target destinations to be called at by foreign going vessels. Although the port destination is expected to change due to the shifting of the route service but, Malaysia is still able to obtain economic benefits through the Penang Port. In current practice, most vessels prefer to call at Port Klang, Johor Port and Port of Tanjung Pelepas as hubs for the handling of import and export cargo as well as <b>transhipment</b> <b>cargo</b> compared to the Penang Port. However, after developing the Kra Canal, the geographical aspect of the Penang Port will be that it acts as the main gateway when entering Malaysia by sea. This situation will benefit the Penang Port from many perspectives, for instances, increases in 1) foreign going vessel ship calls, and 2) logistics and supply chain activities.|$|E

The regional characteristics of port development in terms of their geographical, functional and operational characteristics are discussed by analysing the port system 2 ̆ 019 s evolution. The case of Montevideo as {{the success or failure of}} a regional hub port development strategy is analysed in detail. Particular attention is given to the evolution and impact of the liner shipping service network in defining the role of a port within a regional port system. Further, the evolution of the port of Montevideo in terms of institutional and organisational and the related strategy are described, with focus on the effect on <b>transhipment</b> <b>cargo</b> in the port. The main findings are twofold. First, port development in Montevideo been driven proactively and under a clear strategy, but still faces a number of challenges. Second, economies of scale in transport, port infrastructure and connectivity are important determinants of port development, of which the latter is principally driven by external actors, the shipping lines. The paper shows that despite strong efforts Uruguay and its principal port Montevideo are highly dependent on external factors, particularly the level of connectivity, in their strategy to develop Montevideo as a regional hub. Thus the findings are relevant in relation to the discussion of Montevideo 2 ̆ 019 s development potentials as a hub on South America 2 ̆ 019 s East Coast in particular and the effects of external influences on port development from in general...|$|E
40|$|The ocean covers {{more than}} two third of the earth’s surface and this {{provides}} immense maritime opportunities in marine transportation and trade. Ships that ply the maritime domain are primary mode of transportation and carry about 80 % {{of the world trade}} volume (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD July 2003). Port Operations and ancillary services such as freight forwarding, shipping play an enormous role in generating economic growth. Seaborne trades through port terminal operations had attracted regional competitions for volume of cargo by sea. Ports such as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and also Malaysia are stepping up their efforts in improving port operations and increase efficiency in handling cargo in order to become world’s class port. The role of ports have been to facilitate efficient movement of goods in the global supply chain. Port Klang as national gateway has changed radically and dramatically into a major port not just handling a larger volume of national cargo but more significantly a port of international repute handling an increase volume of <b>transhipment</b> <b>cargo</b> as well. The hinterland logistics and infrastructures and synchronized supply chain will also need further attention as they play complementary and supporting role in Malaysia’s economy. Two of the exciting economy corridors had been launched notably the Northern Corridor Economic Region and Iskandar Development Region in December 2006 and July 2007 respectively (see appendix 2) These initiatives with commitment that involved more RM 100 billions of development projects over the few years will certainly propel the National Load Centre agenda into greater height. Today’s globalised trade where physical movement of good and services are seamless and reduction in trade barriers, has posed some challenges on how business should be efficiently and effectively operate. The competitions are stiff and companies are competing fiercely and as result turning the market place into some “red ocean” a terminology used in the “Blue Ocean” Strategy. “Red ocean” describes companies trying to beat competition on same limited terrain where competitive advantange and survival are intensified to gain market share. To be able to compete globally terminal operators, logistics and supply chain participants should achieve operational excellence through meticulous planning and continuous improvement in efficient handling and in the process to reduce costs in the whole supply chain logistics. Port Klang will have to adopt competitive business model in order to sustain growth and continue foreign direct investment. Iskandar Development Region (IDR) had attracted some USD 1. 2 billions investment from middle east investors. In addition, Dubai World is preparing its masterplan for their interest in 2, 255 acres of Tanjung Bin for industrial development as well as 500 acres near Port of Tanjung Pelepas for distripark and logistics (source [URL]. Whilst this has generated much hype of the mammoth project in IDR, it’s too early to celebrate when the excellence in operation and competitive business environment remain lacklustre and not in tandem with such implementations. This paper shall conclude on the IDR and NCER initiatives and how this can be launching pad for Port Klang National Load Centre to generate more local cargo volume. East Malaysia i. e Sabah and Sarawak will also play significant role as the feeder service and connectivity continue to be improved and with more vessels plying the South China seas, hinterland infrastructure connection seem to be pivotal in moving forward. It {{will be interesting to see}} Kuantan as the east gateway for connectivity to Port Klang for East bound trade...|$|E

40|$|With almost 100 {{million tons}} of cargo yearly, of which more than 80 {{millions}} pass through Québec ports, the St. Lawrence is an important artery of transport. The fluvial communications System, comprising gulf, estuary, river, and the Great Lakes, extends deep into the north American continent; Duluth, for example, is 2, 200 miles from the sea. Although the Seaway has opened the Great Lakes to ocean-going ships, the general increase in tonnage and draught of these vessels has allowed Québec ports, located at the break point between maritimes and Great Lakes traffic, to maintain their privileged position. Nevertheless, <b>transhipment</b> <b>cargoes</b> here are not particularly impressive (about 30 million tons yearly, mainly cereals) if one considers the enormous industrial capacity of the basin; {{this is because the}} Great Lakes-St. Lawrence network is in many ways an autonomous unit, essentially continental, and supplied from the interior rather than from the exterior, as is the case of the Rhine basin, for example. In Québec, cargoes originating from « secondary » industries scattered along the river and its tributaries (for example, the Saguenay) are relatively unimportant in terms of tonnage [...] . only 22 {{million tons of}} cargo from these industrial zones pass through Québec ports. Only 3. 9 % 0 of the 6, 539 factories located in cities touching on water, and only 13 % of the total industrial payroll in these cities, are directly related to the St. Lawrence. This « underuse »of the river can be explained by Québec s industrial structure, geared to the production of consumer goods for local markets ; in contrast, Ontario has much heavy industry tied directly to the St. Lawrence network...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the pricing policy of transhipment route for India to move cargo through Bangladesh from Kolkata port to the capital city of Tripura i. e. Agartala. Initially, Bangladesh was hesitating to allow India to provide transhipment facility for the north eastern region but India reciprocate it in right direction by providing similar facility to Bangladesh to reach the Himalayan landlocked countries like Nepal and Bhutan, thereby, actively participate in moving towards an integrated transport network for this region as a whole. The future opening of Myanmar route further gives some relief to India. Most of the cargo originates from Kolkata (Port) and terminates at Guwahati and distributed to various destinations of north eastern states. We try to investigate the pricing policy of such transhipment route for India in terms of a Bertrand type model with non homogeneous type cargo movement where the unit price of <b>cargo</b> <b>transhipment</b> taken as a proxy for such transhipment route. ...|$|R
