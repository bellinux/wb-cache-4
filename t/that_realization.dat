It sounds like a lovely, peaceful reverie – except that this is a junkie's reverie, and when <b>that</b> <b>realization</b> hits home, the gentle acoustic lullaby acquires a corrosive power." [...] In Time magazine's 1987 cover story on the band, Jay Cocks wrote that [...] "A U2 tune like 'Running to Stand Still', with a trancelike melody that slips over the transom of consciousness, insinuates itself into your dreams." [...] The Uncut magazine Ultimate Music Guide to U2 described the character sketch in the song as one of Bono's best.

2500|$|Klee's artistic {{breakthrough}} came in 1914 when he briefly visited Tunisia with August Macke and Louis Moilliet and {{was impressed}} by the quality of the light there. [...] He wrote, [...] "Color has taken possession of me; no longer do I have to chase after it, I know that it has hold of me forever... Color and I are one. I am a painter." [...] With <b>that</b> <b>realization,</b> faithfulness to nature faded in importance. Instead, Klee began to delve into the [...] "cool romanticism of abstraction". In gaining a second artistic vocabulary, Klee added color to his abilities in draftsmanship, [...] and in many works combined them [...] successfully, as he did in one series he called [...] "operatic paintings". One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is The Bavarian Don Giovanni (1919).|$|E

It was only when they counted back from Billy's story in the original game that they realized a prequel would coincide with that period of history. Once they made <b>that</b> <b>realization,</b> they embraced it, with Kopiński pointing out [...] "war and its aftermath bring out the worst in people, pushing them to their limits and pitting individuals against a new, transformed reality. War serves as a catalyst and an excuse for the McCall brothers. It sets in motion a chain of events that leads Thomas and Ray across America in their quest." [...] He also said the time period of the game allowed the developers to use specific groups of real life people in an historically accurate manner, such as the Apache, the Comanche, the Navajo and the Pinkertons.

2500|$|Steinberg {{dismissed}} many of Barr's views which favoured that Les Demoiselles D'Avignon {{could be}} reduced to a strictly formal figure composition. In particular that Barr argued that the intellectual observer would address the work was to view it in strictly formalistic qualities: the work was a triumph of form over content; to see it with intelligence was to see it resolved into abstract energies. Barr's methodology of addressing Picasso's work was not fundamentally challenged until Leo Steinberg’s article. Steinberg felt that by 1988 this method of critique had transformed from criticism to cliché and that reducing the work to a purely formal figure composition would make it a mere forerunner of things to come. Picasso had indeed abandoned the memento mori allegory but not the sexual thematics of the painting. Anna C. Chave for example in [...] "New Encounters with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: Gender, Race, and the Origins of Cubism" [...] addresses that the work had come to be understood to mark or even to have precipitated the demise of the old visual order and the advent of the new. A momentous act of destruction, the painting is also understood as one of creation. Designated the first Cubist painting [...] "the signal for the Cubist revolution" [...] in its full-fledged dismantling of representational conventions the painting is now more loosely considered a curtain raiser or trigger to Cubism. Others had pulled crucial triggers before Picasso. When Baudelaire told Manet, [...] "You are only the first in the decrepitude of your art," [...] he referred to the scandalously frank picture of a courtesan, Olympia (Manet), rendered with startling flatness in 1865. For that matter, a compressed or compromised female form, often that of prostitute or femme fatale, would come to serve almost as an avatar of modernism.’ Picasso, often lifted his imagery from the lexicon of European art and by revisiting works, jolted the viewer into reacting to it afresh.” If the disintegration of the great traditions of painting could already be detected in Olympia, the evidence of that decrepitude was plainly that much further advanced in Les Demoiselles. And insofar as it calls the very notion unified style, and so the possibility of finish, into question, the painting's ruptured aspect made it serve the purpose of signifying a moment of rupture particularly well. The evolution of Cubism was impelled by a realization of [...] "the conventional rather than the imitative nature of representation", as art history professor Christine Poggi succinctly phrases it; and a corollary of <b>that</b> <b>realization</b> was [...] "that style can be a kind of mask, to be worn at will", so that [...] "there was no reason to observe the law of unity".|$|E

She lay and thought how deep and rich life had become for her, as though in all this effort and struggle some unsuspected veil had been torn away.

But, I think, to-night, {{you should}} not let me close without {{requiring}} of me an answer on one vital point, namely, how far these imaginations of gods--which are vain to us--were vain {{to those who had}} no better trust? and what real belief the Greek had in these creations of his own spirit, practical and helpful to him in the sorrow of earth? I am able to answer you explicitly in this. The origin of his thoughts is often obscure, and we may err in endeavoring to account or their form of realization; but the effect of <b>that</b> <b>realization</b> on his life is not obscure at all. The Greek creed was, of course, different in its character, as our own creed is, according to the class of persons who held it. The common people's was quite literal, simple, and happy; their idea of Athena was as clear as a good Roman Catholic peasant's idea of the Madonna. In Athens itself, the centre of thought and refinement, Pisistratus obtained the reins of government through the ready belief of the populace that a beautiful woman, armed like Athena, was the goddess herself. Even {{at the close of the}} last century some of this simplicity remained among the inhabitants of the Greek islands; and when a pretty English lady first made her way into the grotto of Antiparos, she was surrounded, on her return, by all the women of the neighboring village, believing her to be divine, and praying her to heal them of their sicknesses.|$|E
