5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{expedition}} it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free Discovery from the ice. His insistence during {{the expedition}} on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent, many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903. Second-in-command Albert Armitage, a merchant officer, was offered <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home on compassionate grounds, but chose to interpret the offer as a personal slight, and refused. Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott's animosity rather than Shackleton's physical breakdown. Although there were later tensions between Scott and Shackleton, when their polar ambitions directly clashed, in public mutual civilities were preserved; Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the Nimrod Expedition, and the two were exchanging polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909–10.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United drew {{their first}} and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United, but made amends with a 3–2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers. Defensive frailties, most notably from Schmeichel, were on show away to Sheffield Wednesday as the team missed <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> top of the table. A brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk {{consigned}} Ferguson to his second defeat {{in the league and}} extended a barren run at Hillsborough; United had won only a single game in their last eight visits. On 29 November, Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant performance by the visitors looked to have gained them a draw, after going two goals down in the first half. A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the Red Devils and kept up the pressure on the challengers.|$|E

25|$|Durham {{came back}} from the Twenty20 Cup to play a Championship match against Lancashire and fell to their first defeat of the season - which was also the highest margin of defeat thus far in the County Championship, beating Durham's innings-and-216-run win over Leicestershire three months earlier. Meanwhile, they lost their National League lead without playing a game, as Sussex Sharks beat Kent Spitfires to go top - and six days later, when Durham had <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> past Sussex again, they lost to Warwickshire in a game {{featuring}} less than 300 runs in total. Durham rounded off the month with three matches without loss, however, as they beat Derbyshire in the League and Somerset in the Championship to have a 24.5-point lead {{at the end of the}} month. In the League, however, Warwickshire overtook them as they fell to third place.|$|E
25|$|Marseille are up {{to second}} in Ligue 1 after they emerged victorious over a ten-man Paris Saint-Germain in the 'classico'. Toulouse {{continued}} their string of strong results with a comprehensive win at home to Paris, their tenth victory in 14 matches in all competitions in 2009, to climb back to fourth place on the Ligue 1 table. Paris Saint-Germain beat Nice at the Parc des Princes to maintain their title challenge. Lille's goalless draw with visiting Paris {{was a case of}} two points dropped against an uninspired opposition and did little to help either side's fortunes, with both clubs leapfrogged by Toulouse, winners over Nantes. Paris Saint-German moved into fourth place as the club from the capital eased past bottom side Le Havre. Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain raised the curtain on a decisive weekend of football with a heart-stopping draw at the Stade Gerland which, in the end, suited neither side. Paris Saint-Germain missed out on <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> above Lyon into third as they were narrowly beaten by Rennes. Mateja Kezman's second league goal of the season gave Paris Saint-Germain a narrow win at Le Mans to keep them in contention for a top-three finish. Paris saw their chances of overtaking Lyon into third place and a Champions League qualifying spot dealt a blow as they succumbed to in-form Auxerre at the Parc des Princes. PSG's ambitions of European football were in the balance after they saw a stubborn Valenciennes side come from behind at the Stade Nungesser. Paris needed to win at home to Monaco to clinch fourth or fifth and a place in Europe next season, but a tepid display from Paul Le Guen's men in a goalless draw left them empty-handed after being tipped as potential title contenders throughout the season.|$|E

Their work ethic is unbelievable." [...] He noted how Jones would fall asleep on the board, waking up to answer a question. [...] "He works in the Alpha state a lot", Ingram added. Two of Jackson's sisters, Janet and La Toya, provided backing vocals in the guise of the P.Y.T.s. The two sisters sang [...] "na na na" [...] back at their brother {{towards the end of the}} song.

Julie turns Billy's life upside-down and forces him to face some shocking home truths. The storyline was introduced as executive producer Bryan Kirkwood, who took on the role earlier in 2010, wanted Billy to have a storyline that was not connected to existing characters.

On the call and {{response}} track, the Deal sisters sing over a heavy bassline, a funky drumbeat, and guitar sounds influenced by surf music and grunge. J.R. Moores wrote for Drowned in Sound that [...] "Somebody considers unleashing a guitar solo, yet its notes are few and the vocals kick back in before it has <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> anywhere. Is it a solo or a riff? Whatever it is, it flicks its middle finger at other solos and riffs, exposing them as absurd, flamboyant, shallow fripperies. I'm not part of that club, it says."

500|$|As {{they had}} no {{permanent}} drummer, McCartney looked for someone to fill the position, which was difficult, as Lennon later said that drummers were [...] "few and far between", because a set of drums was an expensive item. Harrison had seen Best playing with the Black Jacks in The Casbah Coffee Club (which was run by his mother, Mona Best). He {{was regarded as a}} steady drummer, playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar, which pushed the rhythm, and was known in Liverpool at the time as being [...] "mean, moody, and magnificent" [...] by female fans, which convinced McCartney he {{would be good for the}} group. After the Black Jacks broke up, McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg, telling him they would earn £15 per week each. Best had <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a teacher-training college, as he had passed his school exams, unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of theirs, but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move.|$|E
500|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} Daft Punk's singles {{led to a}} bidding war among record labels, resulting in the duo's signing to Virgin Records in 1996. Their departure was noted by Richard Brown of Soma, who affirmed that [...] "we were obviously sad to lose them to Virgin but they had <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> big, which they wanted, and it's not very often that a band has that chance after two singles. We're happy for them." [...] Virgin re-released [...] "Da Funk" [...] with the B-side [...] "Musique" [...] in 1996, a year before releasing Homework. Bangalter later stated that the B-side [...] "was never intended {{to be on the}} album, and in fact, 'Da Funk' as a single has sold more units than Homework, so more people own it anyways [...] than they would if it had been on the album. It is basically used to make the single a double-feature." [...] The album was mixed and recorded in Daft Punk's studio, Daft House in Paris. It was mastered by Nilesh Patel at the London studio The Exchange.|$|E

[...] Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post remarked that she [...] "exhibits far more personality and roguish charm in her few moments here than she did in all of the previous film.

[...] Canning stated that [...] "the best part of this episode by far was Tracy's paranoia over The Black Crusaders" [...] and he rated the episode 9.7 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote regarding Emily Mortimer's guest appearance that [...] "she's not the first thought for most sitcoms looking to fill a vacancy. But here, she's obviously relishing (as Isabella Rossellini did) <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> a bit bonkers. When she lapsed out of the accent, what fun." [...] Anna Johns of AOL's TV Squad wrote that she [...] "didn't find 'Cleveland' nearly as funny as the super-sized 'Fireworks' episode two weeks ago, {{but it was still}} pretty good. The best sources of humor in this show are Kenneth the Page and Tracy Jordan, neither of which had a very prominent role this week." ...|$|E
