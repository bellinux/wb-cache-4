The letters to this uncle are full of warm sentiments, more than would be expected of a dutiful correspondence. Other episcopal correspondents and friends included Roger de Pont L'Évêque, the Archbishop of York, Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, and William de Turbeville, the Bishop of Norwich, who became a regular correspondent after Foliot was <b>translated</b> <b>to</b> London.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester {{seems to}} have been the main seat of Æthelred's and Æthelflæd's power, and before 900 they founded a new minster there, {{dedicated}} to St Peter. In 909 a West Saxon and Mercian army raided Viking territory and seized the bones of the Northumbrian king and martyr, St Oswald, from Bardney in Lincolnshire. The bones were <b>translated</b> <b>to</b> the new Gloucester minster, which was renamed St Oswald's Priory in his honour. Both Æthelred and Æthelflæd were buried there. The historian Martin Ryan sees the new minster as something like a Mercian royal mausoleum, to replace the one at Repton destroyed by the Vikings.|$|E

He was later revered as a saint, with his feast day being 30 September.

In the 1120s his relics were still being venerated at St Augustine's.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by this position is widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact meaning is debated. The word is <b>translated</b> <b>to</b> Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E
5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is <b>translated</b> <b>to</b> protein. RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product.|$|E

Æthelflæd, {{and her husband}} Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia, were buried in the priory, and their nephew, King Æthelstan, was a major patron of Oswald's cult.|$|E
5|$|Others are obscure {{because of}} the damnatio memoriae {{surrounding}} the lives of antipopes, or because they were refused burial due to excommunication.
