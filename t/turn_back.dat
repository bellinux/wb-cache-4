5|$|The {{passengers}} and crew of both vessels consulted on whether to continue southwards or <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> and await better weather. According to one source, missionary W.P. Crook aboard Integrity, there was unanimity for continuing the voyage except for Captain Houstoun, who wished to <b>turn</b> <b>back.</b> As Houstoun was the nominal commander of the voyage his view prevailed and Integrity and Contest returned to Port Jackson together, arriving on 13 July.|$|E

5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared by both sides of the political spectrum – Cato had sought to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E
5|$|As {{the convoy}} of landing craft and other vessels ferried the Commandos across the English Channel; however, {{they had a}} chance {{encounter}} with a German tanker escorted by a number of armed trawlers which proceeded to fire upon them.

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2010, the {{television}} production company Wall to Wall filmed a series for BBC One in the town centre which was broadcast from 2 November 2010. Called <b>Turn</b> <b>Back</b> Time – The High Street, the series features a number of families running traditional bakers, butchers, grocers, and dressmakers shops, {{as well as a}} tea room, as they would have been during the Victorian and Edwardian eras, during World War II, and in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Relief efforts {{following}} the hurricane were mostly {{affected by the}} associated flooding. Trucks transporting food and medicine from the Jalisco state government were forced to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> because of flooded roads. The army then decided on an aerial transport. This effort was hampered because, after three federal helicopters and Air Force planes touched down at the local airport, the road into the city was still flooded, meaning the aid could not be distributed.|$|E
5|$|After spring thaw in 1852, {{the elderly}} Buffalo, Oshaga, Armstrong, and four others {{set out from}} La Pointe for Washington, D.C. by birch bark canoe. Along the way, they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, {{securing}} hundreds of signatures in support of their cause. At Sault Ste. Marie, they were held by the US Indian agent, who told them that no unauthorized Ojibwa delegations could go to Washington {{and they had to}} <b>turn</b> <b>back.</b> The men pleaded the urgency of their case and traveled to Detroit by steamship. There another Indian agent tried to stop them. Once allowed to proceed, they sailed through Lake Erie to Buffalo, New York and then on to Albany and New York City.|$|E

5|$|Alexios {{was able}} to recover a number of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the Catholic/Latin crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact set out on the road to Antioch but had been persuaded to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> by Stephen of Blois, who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E
5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how Marseille once ignored {{an order to}} <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{remained}} virtually stationary {{until the}} morning of September23 when it drifted very slowly to the west-southwest {{in response to the}} ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make a <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> around to the south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|By dawn of 26 August, {{advancing}} west {{along the}} coast with armoured support, the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company, 61st Infantry Battalion, around KB Mission. The Japanese force moved through the jungle {{at the edge of}} the coastal track, and was headed by two light tanks. Although they lacked anti-armour weapons, the Australians were able to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> the Japanese attack. At this stage, the Japanese suffered a serious setback when their base area was heavily attacked at daylight by RAAF Kittyhawks and a Hudson aircraft, along with B-25s, B-26s and B-17s from the US Fifth Air Force. As a result of the attack, a number of Japanese troops were killed, while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed, as were a number of the landing barges which were beached near the KB Mission. Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system, the destruction of the landing barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions. The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> due to bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. Finally, on the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{destruction}} of the Armada, the Spanish threat continued; the castles in Kent were kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign. In 1596 a Spanish invasion fleet carrying reportedly 20,000 soldiers set out for Pendennis, which was then garrisoned with only 500 men. The fleet was forced to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> due to bad weather, but Elizabeth reviewed the defences and significantly expanded Henry's original fortifications with more up-to-date bastions, designed by the engineer Paul Ive. By the end of the century, however, most of the Device Forts were typically out of date by European standards.|$|E

He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.|$|E
