5|$|Cape {{sold the}} US {{rights to the}} {{recently}} formed publishing house of Pascal Covici and Donald Friede. Friede had heard gossip about The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, {{would be the one}} prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> saw nothing wrong with the book.|$|E
25|$|During the 2004 provincial {{election}} campaign, Klein softened {{his stand}} somewhat, {{saying that he}} would accept same-sex marriage if Albertans <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> want it.|$|E
25|$|Shigeharu Matsumoto, the Shanghai bureau Chief of Domei News Agency, {{wrote that}} the Japanese reporters he interviewed all <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> saw between 2,000 and 3,000 corpses around the Xiaguan area and a reporter, Yuji Maeda, saw {{recruits}} executing Chinese prisoners-of-war with bayonets.|$|E
6000|$|The mate {{sat down}} on a locker and fought for breath. The cook, still pale, felt his small, black {{mustache}} and eyed him with triumphant malice. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> <b>they</b> was your orders," [...] he remarked.|$|R

25|$|Parker {{was aware}} that Presley needed a break from touring {{and the chance to}} deal with his addictions. He phoned Presley's father to suggest the break, but Vernon <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> couldn't afford to stop touring. Vernon also {{threatened}} to find a new manager if Parker wouldn't continue to tour Presley.|$|E
25|$|Heine {{told the}} 16-member National Academy of Sciences panel that {{producing}} {{the quantity of}} spores in the letters would have taken {{at least a year}} of intensive work using the equipment at the U.S. Army laboratory. Such an effort would not have escaped colleagues' notice, and laboratory technicians who worked closely with Dr. Ivins have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> saw no such work.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, Meucci and {{his friend}} Angelo Bertolino went to Edward B. Grant, Vice President of American District Telegraph Co. of New York (not Western Union as {{commonly}} related), to ask for help. Meucci asked him for permission to test his telephone apparatus on the company's telegraph lines. He gave Grant a description of his prototype {{and a copy of}} his caveat. After waiting two years, Meucci went to Grant and asked for his documents back, but Grant allegedly <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> had been lost.|$|E

50|$|The Detroit Lions {{selected}} Killebrew in {{the fourth}} round (111th overall) in the 2016 NFL Draft. After appearing in the senior bowl, the Detroit Lions' safeties coach, Alan Williams, and other representatives from the organization {{had a meeting with}} Killebrew and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>they</b> were not interested in him, he wasn't a right fit for the team, and that they did not want him at all. Once <b>they</b> drafted <b>him,</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>they</b> had said it to only see how he would respond.|$|R

25|$|Next was {{the pass}} of Scylla and Charybdis where he lost {{part of his}} ship's crew. The rest landed in the isle Thrinacia, sacred to Helios (the Sun) where he kept sacred cattle. Though Odysseus warned his men not to (as Tiresias had <b>told</b> <b>him),</b> <b>they</b> killed and ate some of the cattle after Zeus placed Odysseus in his sleep to test his crew. Under a threat from Helios to take the sun and shine it in the Underworld, Zeus shipwrecked the last ship and killed {{everyone}} except Odysseus.|$|E
25|$|Rubin {{started to}} shop the {{screenplay}} around to around 50 different producers. While many studios expressed interest, they <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't {{be able to}} film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a spec agent to help sell the script more. The script got to the hands of Richard Lovett in the Creative Artists Agency, {{who was able to}} get it to Harold Ramis around 1991, leading to Ramis offering to produce the film.|$|E
25|$|Warren {{was told}} that the Gravelly Run bridge was {{completed}} at 2:05a.m. Ayres's division arrived at Sheridan's position near dawn. As predicted by Warren, the effect of Bartlett's appearance threatening Pickett's flank was enough for Pickett to withdraw to Five Forks, which the Confederates had done by the time Ayres reach Dinwiddie Court House. One of Sheridan's staff officers met Ayres and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> should have turned on to Brooks Road, a mile back. Ayres returned to Brooks Road, where a lone Confederate picket promptly fled and Ayres's men settled down for a rest until 2:00p.m.|$|E
60|$|Charlie shook 'ands with 'im, but 'e said 'e wouldn't {{walk out}} with Mrs. Jennings for a fortune. And all that Ted could say made no difference. He stayed indoors {{of an evening}} reading the paper, or going for little walks by 'imseif, until at last Ted came 'ome one evening, smiling all over his face, and <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> <b>they</b> had both been making fools of {{themselves}} for nothing.|$|R

25|$|Takei entered {{architecture}} {{school at}} University of California, Berkeley, but told his parents during {{his freshman year}} {{that he wanted to}} become an actor. His parents <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> would support him if he first got a college degree, and he went on to obtain a degree in theater arts from UC Berkeley. Takei played a Japanese soldier wrongly accused of the murder of his fiancee at a production of Made in Japan at Playhouse 90. He received some acting advice from Harry Guardino during a live TV performance of the play. He went on to receive roles on Perry Mason and Return from the River Kwai, and in a civil rights play called Fly Blackbird!.|$|E
500|$|During {{grand jury}} {{testimony}} on December 4, 2003, Bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer, Greg Anderson, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis. This testimony, as reported by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, has frequently been misrepresented. Later reports on Bonds's leaked grand-jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using [...] "the cream" [...] and [...] "the clear".|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} his trial Garnet made a new statement, which he hoped would clarify his {{dealings}} with Tresham. He also wrote to the king, reiterating his stance on violence against a rightful monarch. When the government lied and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> had captured Tesimond, he wrote an apologetic letter to the priest regarding {{the nature of their}} conversation the previous year. [...] He also wrote a final letter to Anne Vaux, on 21 April, relating his lack of fortune over the previous few months.|$|E
60|$|Their {{first visit}} {{was to a}} hairdresser's shop. Rather to the astonishment of the proprietor, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>they</b> wished {{to speak to him}} in a private room; and still more to his astonishment, when the door was closed, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>they</b> wanted their hair dyed quite black. The hairdresser could hardly believe his ears. The boys had both brown, wavy hair--Percy's being the lightest--and that two young {{officers}} of the staff should, at such a time, desire to dye their hair struck the man almost dumb with astonishment.|$|R
60|$|After {{the first}} {{greetings}} and inquiries after his sister, {{whom he had}} been visiting, Laura <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>they</b> had been saying of {{the advantage of a}} scanty range of reading.|$|R
60|$|After that Barwell Dawson {{asked for}} more {{particulars}} concerning the boys, and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how <b>they</b> were situated. He {{was surprised to learn}} that Chet was practically alone in the world.|$|R
500|$|Ebert {{began his}} career as a film critic in 1967, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times. That same year, he met film critic Pauline Kael for the first time at the New York Film Festival. After he sent her some of his columns, she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "the best film {{criticism}} being done in American newspapers today". That same year, Ebert's first book, a history of the University of Illinois titled Illini Century: One Hundred Years of Campus Life, was published by the University's press. In 1969, his review of Night of the Living Dead was published in Reader's Digest.|$|E
500|$|On September 15, Delucchi {{continued}} his testimony, saying {{that some of}} his men <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> would obey all orders and perform all work except loading ammunition because they were afraid of it. Delucchi confirmed that a cook and a man with a broken wrist were among the 25 men in his division that now sat among the 50 accused. Delucchi added that the cook and a second man were sailors he did not consider [...] "up to par"; the cook in particular was prone to nervous attacks and was seen as a liability at the pier.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, John Myles, who had {{replaced}} Salt {{and who now}} led the Canningites, had been gathering witnesses who could claim they had seen Mary Squires {{in the vicinity of}} Enfield Wash. [...] One said he had seen two men dragging a woman towards Enfield early in January. [...] Others <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> had on 29January seen [...] "a miserable poor wretch" [...] travelling toward London. [...] Myles found witnesses who claimed they had seen Squires at Enfield Wash in December and January. [...] Myles unwittingly made Gascoyne aware of his investigation when he asked a John Cooper of Salisbury his opinion of seven of Gascoyne's witnesses, who claimed they had seen Squires in Coombe. [...] Cooper wrote back affirming the good character of Thomas Greville (who had testified for Squires at her trial), but later sent the same information to Gascoyne, offering his support.|$|E

500|$|Kaczynski's lawyers, {{headed by}} Montana federal defender Michael Donahoe and Judy Clarke, {{attempted}} to enter an insanity defense {{to avoid the}} death penalty, but he rejected this plea. On January 8, 1998, he requested to dismiss his lawyers and hire Tony Serra as his counsel; Serra had agreed to not use an insanity defense and instead base a defense on Kaczynski's anti-technology views. This request was unsuccessful and Kaczynski subsequently {{tried to commit suicide}} by hanging on January 9. Several, though not all, forensic psychiatrists and psychologists who examined Kaczynski diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz said Kaczynski was not psychotic but had a schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder. In his 2010 book Technological Slavery, Kaczynski said that two prison psychologists, who visited him frequently for four years, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> saw no indication that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and the diagnosis was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and a [...] "political diagnosis".|$|E
500|$|The Aid and Rescue Committee {{decided to}} ask Wisliceny whether the SS were, as Kasztner {{wrote in a}} later report, [...] "prepared to {{negotiate}} with the illegal Jewish rescue committee on an economic basis about the moderation of the anti-Jewish measures". Brand and Kasztner met Wisliceny on 5 April. They <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> were in a position to continue Fleischmann's negotiations and could offer $2 million with a down payment of $200,000. They asked that there be no deportations, mass executions or pogroms in Hungary, no ghettos or camps, and that Jews who held immigration certificates for Palestine (issued by the British mandatory government) be allowed to leave. Wisliceny accepted the $200,000, but indicated that $2 million might not be enough. He said there would be no deportations and no harm to the Jewish community while negotiations continued, and arranged for Aid and Rescue Committee exemptions from anti-Jewish laws to allow its members to travel and use cars and telephones.|$|E
500|$|Ross's (David Schwimmer) {{complaint}} that his divorce and eviction means {{he is having}} the worst Thanksgiving ever prompts the others to tell their stories. Chandler (Matthew Perry) reminds everyone of when his parents <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>they</b> were divorcing. Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) then tells of story from a past life {{when she was a}} nurse and lost an arm, though Ross objects, with the demand of only tales of present lives. Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) says she knows Monica's (Courteney Cox) story, but Phoebe interrupts with a story about the time Joey (Matt LeBlanc) had a turkey stuck on his head. Monica tells of Thanksgiving 1987. Monica and Rachel are eighteen years old and seniors in high school, and an overweight Monica spends time comforting Rachel, after Chip ended their relationship. When Ross learns of Rachel's breakup, he asks Chandler to stay overnight in the hope of getting a date, but Chandler refuses, claiming that he doesn't want to be stuck with [...] "your fat sister" [...] Monica. Overhearing the conversation from behind the door, Monica breaks down in tears and storms out.|$|E
