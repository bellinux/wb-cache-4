A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E

(Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft ork) by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short roo-oo) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|E

He believed that both [...] "passion and craft" [...] could be seen in her draughtsmanship, but that it also displayed [...] "a guilelessness <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> relate to in our post post-ironic moment". He also discussed her lost multi-coloured watercolour paintings that were featured in Harrington's The Wormwood Star, suggesting that they were akin to a storyboard for an unrealised film by the director Alejandro Jodorowsky.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Kids Can Say No! have {{generally}} been negative, with initial reviews doubting the benefit of showing the film to children and later reviews focusing on Harris' hypocrisy. In a 1985 Times review, Caroline Moorehead writes that the film's avoidance of an explicit discussion of sexual abuse was both a requirement and the film's greatest weakness. According to Moorehead, an explicit discussion might have terrified children and prevented parents from consenting to their children's viewing of the film; however, its oblique approach prevents children from understanding the issue. She calls the film's theme song [...] "catchy, one of those irritating snatches of music <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> forget".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the western}} world, {{distinct}} forms of paganism {{have been developed}} by and {{for members of the}} LGBT community. Margot Adler noted how there were many pagan groups whose practices revolved around the inclusion and celebration of male homosexuality, such as the Minoan Brotherhood, a Wiccan group that combines the iconography from ancient Minoan religion with a Wiccan theology and an emphasis on men-loving-men, and the eclectic pagan group known as the Radical Faeries. Similarly, there are also groups for lesbians, like certain forms of Dianic Wicca and the Minoan Sisterhood. When Adler asked one gay pagan what the pagan community offered members of the LGBT community, the reply was [...] "A place to belong. Community. Acceptance.

2500|$|Several critics {{praised the}} {{television}} series as a better {{adaptation of the}} books than the 2004 feature film, which starred Jim Carrey as Count Olaf. Kelly Lawler of USA Today felt the television format gave the stories more room to develop, the addition of Warburton as the fourth wall-breaking Snicket helped to convey some of the wordplay humor used in the books, and Harris's portrayal of Olaf was [...] "much more dynamic, and creepier" [...] than Carrey's version. The Verge Chaim Gartenburg said that the show follows the books much more faithfully than the film, and [...] "nails down the tone that made the stories so special". Los Angeles Times writer Robert Lloyd felt that the backgrounds of Sonnenfeld and Welch made them [...] "the right people for this job, set in a milieu <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> fix in time, except {{to say it is}} not now", in capturing the tones of the book compared to the feature film.|$|E
