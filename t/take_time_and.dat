5|$|December 1915 {{also saw}} {{concrete}} {{progress on the}} mission's Turco-German objective. The Emir informed von Hentig {{he was ready to}} discuss a treaty of Afghan-German friendship, but said it would <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> require extensive historical research. Work on the treaty began with drafts proposed by von Hentig. The final draft of ten articles presented on 24 January 1916 included clauses recognising Afghan independence, a declaration of friendship with Germany, and establishment of diplomatic relations. Von Hentig was to be accredited the Embassy Secretary of the German Empire. In addition, the treaty would guarantee German assistance against Russian and British threats if Afghanistan joined the war on the Central side. The Emir's army was to be modernised, with Germany providing 100,000 modern rifles, 300 artillery pieces, and other modern warfare equipment. The Germans were to be responsible for maintaining advisors and engineers, and to maintain an overland supply route through Persia for arms and ammunition. Further, the Emir was to be paid £1,000,000. Both von Hentig and Niedermayer signed this document which created—as von Hentig argued in a telegram to the Foreign Office—an initial basis to prepare for an Afghan invasion of India. Niedermayer explained that the Emir intended to begin his campaign as soon as Germany could make available 20,000 troops to protect the Afghan-Russian front, and asked for urgently for wireless sets, a substantial shipment of arms, and at least a million pounds initial funding. He judged conditions to be ideal for an offensive into India, and informed the general staff to expect the campaign to begin in April.|$|E

There was concern that the early announcement of the change would cause an Osborne effect, and there was the possibility that Intel could force Apple to use the Intel Inside branding. In addition, Apple had nurtured a feeling of animosity toward Intel among its loyal base. It would <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money to convince Apple's most loyal customers that Intel was acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Merrick Alpert and Attorney General Richard Blumenthal squared-off in a March 1 debate {{highlighting}} important issues. On healthcare, Alpert {{revealed that}} he supports a single-payer system. Blumenthal explained that pool-purchasing powers should be explored. Alpert presented information as to how insurance rates have skyrocketed in Connecticut since the Attorney General took office. On the topic of war, Blumenthal pledged his support of President Obama's current plan. Alpert expressed that, being a former peacekeeper in Bosnia, he understands what policies work and which ones do not. The current one does not. Alpert set out {{a plan for the}} withdrawal of troops from the current war in Afghanistan. On a question concerning relations with Cuba, Blumenthal explained that it would <b>take</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> that he would put together a panel of Cuban-American people to decide the best course of action. Alpert explained that he would vote on the issue that night.|$|E

500|$|The Austrian army, {{augmented}} by the Army of Condé under the prince's command, approached from Freiburg. [...] Charles {{had a couple}} of options open to him. [...] Any direct assault on the French position would be costly; Moreau had chosen an almost unassailable position, especially for his center. Any Habsburg force would have to cross the Kandern; in most cases, it would have to advance uphill into withering fire. [...] Charles could avoid a battle by leaving a force to keep the French occupied and directing a part of his army through the mountains {{to the left of the}} Kandern, descending into the valley to Wies and disrupt the French line with Hüningen. However, this operation would <b>take</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the roads were bad from the rain, making any such maneuver difficult.|$|E
