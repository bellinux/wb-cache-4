5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} differences between proto-globalization and archaic globalization was <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> inter-nation trading of rarities to the trading of commodities. During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain, silk and spices. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and other crops.|$|E
5|$|The GR1A is the {{reconnaissance}} variant {{used by the}} RAF and RSAF, {{fitted with}} the TIRRS (Tornado Infra-Red Reconnaissance System), replacing the cannon. The RAF ordered 30 GR1As, 14 as GR1 rebuilds and 16 as new-builds. When the Tornado GR1s were upgraded to become GR4s, GR1A aircraft were upgraded to GR4A standard. <b>The</b> <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> low-level operations to medium/high-level operations means that the internal TIRRS {{is no longer in}} use. As the GR4A's internal sensors are no longer essential, the RAF's Tactical Reconnaissance Wing operate both GR4A and GR4 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|From Spring 2007 to 2008 the {{messages}} were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling, but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala. <b>The</b> <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> Ruby to Scala and the JVM has given Twitter a performance boost from 200–300 requests per second per host to around 10,000–20,000 requests per second per host. This boost {{was greater than}} the 10x improvement that Twitter's engineers envisioned when starting the switch. The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls.|$|E

5|$|Salyut 6, {{launched}} on a Proton 8K82K rocket on 29 September 1977, marked <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> engineering development stations to routine operations, and united {{the most effective}} elements {{from each of the}} previous stations. Its navigation system, made up of the Delta semi-automatic computer to depict the station's orbit and the Kaskad system to control its orientation, was based on that used on Salyut 4, as was its power system, which consisted of a trio of steerable solar panels together producing a peak of 4kilowatts of power over 51m². The station's thermal regulation systems, which made use of a sophisticated arrangement of insulation and radiators, was also derived from that used on Salyut 4. In addition, Salyut 6 made use of environmental systems first used on Salyut 3, and controlled its orientation using gyrodynes first tested on that station.|$|E
5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. <b>The</b> <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E
5|$|The {{attraction}} originated as {{a concept}} created by Walt Disney, who drew inspiration from the ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad built in his backyard. The Disneyland Railroad first {{opened to the public}} at Disneyland's grand opening on July 17, 1955. Since that time, multiple alterations have been made to its route, including the addition of two large dioramas in the late 1950s and mid-1960s. Several changes have also been made to its rolling stock, including the conversion of one of its train cars into a parlor car in the mid-1970s, and <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> diesel oil to biodiesel to fuel its locomotives in the late 2000s.|$|E

40|$|Resistive-switching {{behaviors}} of Ni-rich nickel oxide thin films during {{the set and}} reset processes have been examined. In <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> a low-resistance state (LRS) to a high-resistance state (HRS), a preferable reset voltage is observed. In addition, resistance fluctuations can be also observed in a successful or unsuccessful reset switching. These observations suggest that both the formation and deformation of conductive filaments could be involved and compete in the reset process. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> HRS to the LRS in the set process is easier to occur with a higher pulse voltage, showing that the voltage promotes {{the formation of the}} filaments. © 2011 The Electrochemical Society. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> high-altitude to low-altitude flight {{profiles}} severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned {{to provide the}} desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.|$|E
5|$|Being Naughty Dog's first PlayStation 3 game, {{the project}} {{required}} {{the company to}} familiarize themselves with the new hardware, and resulted in several development mistakes. <b>The</b> <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> developing for the PlayStation 2 to the PlayStation 3 prompted the staff to implement changes to their development technology. Naughty Dog switched to the industry standard language C++ in order to participate in technology sharing among Sony's first-party developers—the company had previously used their own proprietary programming language GOAL, a Lisp-based language. In rewriting their game code, they decided to create new programming tools as well. This switch, however, delayed the team's progress in developing a prototype, as the new tools proved to be unreliable and too difficult to use. Ten months into full production, the team decided to recreate the game's pipeline, the chain of processing elements designed to progress data through a system. In retrospect, Naughty Dog's Co-President Evan Wells considered this the greatest improvement to the project. Additionally, the animation blending system was rewritten several times to obtain the desired character animations.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the Anacostia Station opened, WMATA said that a study of bus and rail {{ridership}} showed that the unaltered bus routes were costing the transit agency $200,000 a month in lost rail fares. To make up the lost revenue, WMATA {{said that it would}} run only two-car trains (the shortest on the system) on the Green Line during slow periods weekdays and evenings and on Sundays beginning in June 1992. In November 1992, WMATA reported that ridership at the Anacostia Station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. WMATA admitted that although riders had made <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>from</b> bus to rail, the lower ridership numbers were due to the recession and not because of continuing downtown bus service in the area. Metro said ridership on buses in the neighborhood was down significantly, and the transit agency reduced the number of buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>switching</b> {{behaviors}} of <b>the</b> resistive <b>switching</b> device based on Ni-rich nickel oxide thin film during {{the set and}} reset processes in the pulse voltage experiment have been examined. In <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> a high-resistance state (HRS) to a low-resistance state (LRS) during the set process, the formation of filament is the dominant process. <b>The</b> <b>switching</b> is easier to occur with a shorter off time between pulses, indicating that heat diffusion plays an important role. On the other hand, in <b>the</b> <b>switching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> LRS to the HRS during the reset process, there is a competition between the formation and deformation of filament, which is much stronger than that in the set process. The heat diffusion during the off time between pulses affects both the formation and deformation of filaments. Thus, there is no definite relationship in statistics between the off time and the occurrence of <b>the</b> reset <b>switching.</b> © 2012 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
