40|$|Using a {{principal}} components analysis of morphological data of 1, 759 specimens, we detected that the Bothrops neuwiedi complex (with 12 subspecies) is, actually, comprised of 7 full species, differing mainly by qualitative characteristics. One species was nominal. Five subspecies were elevated to the species level. Bothrops iglesiasi and the remaining B. neuwiedi subspecies entered in the synonymy of these six species. A new species is described. The new classificationincludes: Bothrops neuwiedi (synonyms: B. n. goyazensis, B. n. meridionalis, B. n. paranaensis and B. n. urutu), B. diporus, B. lutzi (synonyms: B. n. neuwiedi, B. n. piauhyensis and B. iglesiasi), B. mattogrossensis (synonym: B. n. bolivianus), B. pauloensis, B. pubescens, and the new species. This new species is characterized by stippled supralabials, instead of the conspicuous supralabial blotches present in other species of this complex. It is further characterized by an inconspicuous postorbital stripe and by 15 - 27 white-edged trapezoidal dorsolateral dark blotches throughoutthe body, 5 - 9 intersupraoculars (usually 7), 1 - 2 rows of small scales between the subocular and fourth supralabial, 8 - 9 supralabials (rarely 7 or 10), prelacunal separated from second supralabial, 9 - 13 infralabials (usually 10 - 11), 21 - 26 midbody dorsal scale rows (usually 23), 157 - 181 ventrals in males, 158 - 182 ventrals in females, 41 - 50 divided subcaudals in males, 37 - 47 in females. The pair of spots {{at the base of}} the dorsolateral blotches, typical of the B. neuwiedi complex, is generally diffuse, conferring to the whole blotch the aspect of a <b>transverse</b> <b>saddle.</b> The stippled aspectof the supralabials also appears in other scales throughout the rest of the body. This color pattern and the diffuse borders of the blotches confer a marbled pattern to this snake. We compare the new species with all related congeners, provide comments upon its distribution, and present an artificial identification key for the species of B. neuwiedi complex...|$|E
50|$|The {{pattern on}} the neck and head is {{different}} in the two subspecies. In the nominate subspecies, Rhynchocalamus melanocephalus melanocephalus, there is no separation between the neck pattern and the head pattern. The upper surface {{of the head and}} neck is ash-black. Only the labials, the nasals, and the rostal are white. In R. melanocephalus satunini the neck carries a black semi-collar, and the head pattern consists of three <b>transverse</b> black <b>saddles.</b> The first one is on the rostral. The second spreads over the postnasal, supraorbital, and frontal, and partially over the prefrontal shields from eye to eye. The third saddle covers the parietal shields and some of the surrounding scales. The spaces between the black saddles are white, which makes Rhynchocalamus visually identifiable from similar looking species of the genera Eirenis and Pseudocyclophis, which often occupy the same habitat.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} massive blowing {{rates on the}} steady laminar {{compressible}} boundary-layer flow with variable gas properties at a 3 -dim. stagnation point (which includes both nodal and saddle points of attachment) has been studied. The equations governing the flow have been solved numerically using an implicit finite-difference scheme {{in combination with the}} quasilinearization technique for nodal points of attachment but employing a parametric differentiation technique instead of quasilinearization for saddle points of attachment. It is found that the effect of massive blowing rates is to move the viscous layer away from the surface. The effect of the variation of the density- viscosity product across the boundary layer is found to be negligible for massive blowing rates but significant for moderate blowing rates. The velocity profiles in the <b>transverse</b> direction for <b>saddle</b> points of attachment in the presence of massive blowing show both the reverse flow as well as velocity overshoot...|$|R
