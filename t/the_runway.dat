5|$|ATC also {{advised that}} I-29 ran North and South just East {{of the airport}} they could land on if they didn't think they could make <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> The pilot opted to try for <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, {{the flight}} was cleared for the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} approach to the airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final approach to <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> As it continued its descent past the missed approach point– where <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. <b>The</b> <b>runway</b> is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. <b>The</b> <b>runway</b> was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> In 1989, parts of <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{purchased}} by Bernard Matthews, who constructed turkey sheds on <b>the</b> <b>runways.</b> <b>The</b> turkey farm is now operated by another farmer, but {{the construction of the}} sheds has preserved large sections of <b>the</b> <b>runways.</b>|$|R
50|$|Phoenix Deer Valley Airport in Phoenix, Arizona has a patio area facing <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> {{adjacent}} to <b>the</b> terminal building and {{a restaurant with}} a view of <b>the</b> <b>runways.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pecan Plantation {{features}} a 2,200 acre development that evolved around a two <b>runway</b> cropdusting airstrip. <b>The</b> development retained <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> allowing airpark homes {{with access to}} <b>the</b> <b>runways.</b>|$|R
5|$|Under {{the second}} phase of expansion, <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> would be {{lengthened}} to , allowing jet aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 to land at Mysore Airport. <b>The</b> <b>runway</b> cannot be extended to the west {{because of the presence of}} a railway line, while an extension to the east requires diverting National Highway 766. The State Government initially decided to hold off on this phase, preferring to wait until air traffic increased and the cost of diverting <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> was justified.|$|E

5|$|In April 2001 a Russian-made Antonov {{airplane}} {{broke in}} two after it skidded off <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> at Adaril, apparently {{due to a}} sandstorm.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that {{may have contributed to the}} accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E

5|$|On 20 March 2009, Emirates Airline Flight 407, an Airbus A340-500, {{was taking}} off from Melbourne Airport on Runway 16 for a flight to Dubai International Airport and failed to become {{airborne}} in the normal distance. When the aircraft was {{nearing the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> the crew commanded nose-up sharply, causing its tail to scrape along <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> as it became airborne, during which smoke was observed in the cabin. The crew dumped fuel and returned to the airport. The damage caused to the aircraft was considered substantial. The aircraft damaged a strobe {{light at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> as well as an antenna on the localiser, which led to the ILS being out of service for some time causing some disruptions to the airport's operation.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached {{two-thirds of the way}} down <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered off to the left of <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.|$|E

50|$|In 1981 {{a second}} east-west runway, 26L/8R, was built, necessitating {{the removal of}} <b>the</b> old NE-SW <b>runway</b> 4/22. Remnants of <b>the</b> 4/22 <b>runway</b> are visible in the present-day taxiways. With the {{completion}} of <b>the</b> new <b>runway,</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>runway</b> 25/7 became 26R/8L. In 1985, the city of Los Angeles acquired Ontario International Airport outright {{from the city of}} Ontario. In 1987, Runway 26R/8L was extended to the east to bring <b>the</b> two <b>runway</b> thresholds side by side, so aircraft would be higher over neighborhoods. 26R/8L became <b>the</b> main departing <b>runway</b> and 26L/8R <b>the</b> main arrival <b>runway.</b>|$|R
25|$|Today the {{airfield}} {{is home to}} a small number of warehouses however the original basic layout can still be made out, including <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> and a large amount of the perimeter track which used to connect <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> with <b>the</b> dispersal hardstandings and the technical site.|$|R
50|$|Albert Lea Municipal Airport was {{recently}} granted over $3 {{million in federal}} economic stimulus funds to relocate <b>the</b> main <b>runway,</b> which followed another announcement about a recent grant to rehabilitate <b>the</b> airport's crosswind <b>runway.</b> Work began in 2011 and was completed within one year. <b>The</b> old <b>runway</b> which parallels <b>the</b> new <b>runway</b> was converted to serve as <b>the</b> new <b>runway's</b> taxiway.|$|R

5|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's runway 22 for the takeoff, but used runway 26 instead. Runway 26 {{was too short}} for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun the end of <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> before it could become airborne. It crashed just past the end of <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> killing all 47 passengers {{and two of the}} three crew. The flight's first officer was the only survivor.|$|E
