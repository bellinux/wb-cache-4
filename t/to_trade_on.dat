5|$|Below Winsford, {{the course}} of the river has been altered several times, by the {{construction}} of cuts and locks, to enable small ships <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>on</b> it. The river formerly joined the River Mersey at Weston Marsh, but since the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, begun in 1887, it has flowed into the canal, from where surplus water enters the Mersey by the Weaver sluices, just upstream of the junction. The tidal river section below Frodsham has been bypassed by the Weston Canal since 1810, and is no longer navigable, as Frodsham Lock is derelict.|$|E

Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted.

5|$|The Sonderkommado were housed {{separately}} from other prisoners, in somewhat better conditions. Their {{quality of life}} was further improved by access to the goods taken from murdered prisoners, which Sonderkommandos were sometimes able to steal for themselves and <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>on</b> Auschwitz's black market. Hungarian doctor Miklós Nyiszli reported that the Sonderkommando numbered around 860 prisoners when the Hungarian Jews were being killed in 1944. Many Sonderkommandos committed suicide due to the horrors of their work; {{those who did not}} generally were shot by the SS in a matter of weeks, and new Sonderkommando units were then formed from incoming transports.

25|$|Bill Lair {{retired from}} the CIA as a GS-16, the civil service {{equivalent}} of a brigadier general. He was 53 years old, with two grown children in college.

Refusing <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>on</b> his old friendships overseas, he instead became a long haul trucker.

25|$|Plans for {{a railway}} {{from the south}} to Aberdeen were {{announced}} in 1844, and later that year, there were proposals to continue the line norhtwards, to reach Inverness. This would be called the Great North of Scotland Railway, and in 1845, they approached the canal company, to explore whether they could buy the canal and use it for their track bed. The canal had received £1,659 from tolls in 1844, and the passenger boats had made a profit of £200. The company predicted that revenues for 1845 would be around £200 higher than in 1844. Although the railway looked at an alternative plan, with the railway {{some distance from the}} canal, this was not needed, as their offer of £36,000 was accepted. The railway would inherit the privileges and liabilities of the canal company, and would therefore compensate several companies who had built granaries, sheds and wharfs to enable them <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>on</b> the canal. The £36,000 was to be transferred on 1 April 1848, but the railway company were unable to complete the transaction, due to the state of the money market. The canal company agreed to the delay, but began adding interest at 5.5 per cent to the capital sum.|$|E
500|$|Italian cuisine is {{the most}} popular Mediterranean cuisine in England. In its current form, with plenty of pizza and pasta, {{inspired}} by Elizabeth David, its rise began after 1945. There were some Italian restaurants before World War II, but they mostly served a generalised haute cuisine. Soon after the war, Italian coffee bars appeared, the first places <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>on</b> their Italianness; they soon started to sell simple and cheap Italian food such as minestrone soup, spaghetti bolognese and pizza.

500|$|The episode {{received}} many positive reviews. John Preston, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called the episode an [...] "undiluted triumph". Opening his review, he said [...] "last night's episode {{struck me as}} being as close to 50minutes of pure pleasure as you're likely to get on television". He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said [...] "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of The Stage lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a [...] "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only kicking in when the character looks down", comparing it to Wile E. Coyote and Chuck Jones, which [...] " [...] a nice little touch in an episode... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that [...] "David Tennant finally has a partner who is approaching an equal". [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that Tate was [...] "not right for this role" [...] and [...] "too hysterical, too comedy, not cool enough", and felt her inclusion was an attempt <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>on</b> the popularity of her own series and [...] "broaden the appeal of [...] still further". He also found the music [...] "a bit oppressive" [...] but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was [...] "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of Metro gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, [...] "she isn't that bad". His review of the Adipose was positive, citing them as a reason {{of the quality of}} the show. Closing, he said [...] "it split [...] sides".|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{was one of}} Hollywood's most {{respected}} character actors; Hutchinson described him as [...] "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars". Yet for Hutchinson, Steiger remained [...] "out of sympathy with Hollywood" [...] during his career, believing that accomplished actors often struggle to find challenging films as they got older. Steiger was an [...] "effusive talent" [...] according to Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times, and was particularly noted for his intense portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. After On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger became somewhat typecast for playing tough characters and villains, and grew increasingly frustrated playing the [...] "Mafia heavy or a near-psychopath" [...] during the 1970s, roles which he could play menacingly, but provided little opportunity for him to showcase his talent. Gossip columnist Louella Parsons hailed him as [...] "the Screen's No.1 Bad Man", while the newspaper London Evening News referred to him as [...] "the man you would love to hate {{if you had the}} coverage". A 1960 publication by Dean Jennings of The Saturday Evening Post referred to Steiger as an [...] "angry, hot-tempered newcomer of prodigious acting talents, [...] works best only at emotional white heat", and remarked that he found it [...] "stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life". Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he [...] "often seems to take over a picture even when he isn't in the lead". The journal Films and Filming, surveying his career in 1971, noted that his talent [...] "developed steadily through films good and bad", and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded, citing a 1956 interview where he said [...] "I pity the player who can't keep his feet on the ground. It's too easy <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>on</b> success and forget that no performer can stand still." ...|$|E

2500|$|Further {{empirical}} {{work has}} highlighted the impact transaction costs {{have on the}} concept of market efficiency, with much evidence suggesting that any anomalies pertaining to market inefficiencies are the result of a cost benefit analysis made by those willing to incur the cost of acquiring the valuable information in order <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>on</b> it. Additionally the concept of liquidity is a critical component to capturing [...] "inefficiencies" [...] in tests for abnormal returns. Any test of this proposition faces the joint hypothesis problem, where it is impossible to ever test for market efficiency, since to do so requires the use of a measuring stick against which abnormal returns are compared —one cannot know if the market is efficient if one does not know if a model correctly stipulates the required rate of return. Consequently, a situation arises where either the asset pricing model is incorrect or the market is inefficient, but one has no way of knowing which is the case.|$|E

In particular, the ‘Prospectus Directive’ seeks to improve market efficiency through the issue of a single approved prospectus and enables issuers to raise capital across the EU without further approval. More precisely, this directive applies to public offers of securities and admission of securities <b>to</b> <b>trading</b> <b>on</b> a regulated market; also, the ‘Prospectus Directive’ only applies to transferable securities, defined by reference to the MiFID Directive. Specifically, the European Commission has introduced a new regime of ‘private placements’ concerning the exemptions on issuers making a public offer of securities or seeking an admission <b>to</b> <b>trading</b> <b>on</b> a regulated market. Finally, the ‘Prospectus Directive’ aims to ensure that investors are provided with clear and comprehensive information when making investment decisions...|$|R
