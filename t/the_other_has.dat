5|$|Although no {{complete}} recording exists of the opera, {{there are}} two performances available of the study By the Vaar. One features the original soloist Charlie Haden (Point Music 454 126-2); <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> Bryars himself as the bassist (GB Records BCGBCD12). This work has been performed in venues in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E
5|$|There are two iTunes versions: one has {{the above}} track listing and a digital booklet, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> only the 13 tracks from the CD version and {{does not include the}} digital booklet.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{scored the}} cantata for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, and a Baroque {{instrumental}} ensemble of two alto recorders (Fl), two oboes (Ob), {{first and second}} violins (Vl), violas (Va) and basso continuo (Bc). There are two sets of continuo parts from 1726: one is a score transposed for positive organ with figuration added by Bach {{in the first three}} movements; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> annotations by the copyist for violoncello and double bass.|$|E

5|$|By morning, the UFO {{crash site}} has been sealed {{off by the}} government, who has put out a cover-story that claims a Taco Bell is being built. Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting {{to blow up the}} town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E
5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become {{as large as}} the original. Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a polyp broadens and then divides its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth divides and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton. Transversal division occurs when polyps and the exoskeleton divide transversally into two parts. This means one has the basal disc (bottom) and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Villa {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart Patricia González, {{who had also}} been a footballer in her teenage years. Together they have three children: Zaida, Olaya — named after the wife of Fernando Torres, who is {{a close friend of}} Patricia — and Luca. The names of his children are engraved on his personalised Adidas F50 boots; while one boot bears the Spanish flag, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> the flag of Asturias.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower {{used was}} a massive self-supporting delta pylon, or waist pylon, which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped insulator.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service. In co-operative, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to open them. Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start {{far away from the}} main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> to find and revive the partner's corpse to bring it back to life.|$|E

5|$|When two {{distinct}} types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., one plant parent has red flowers, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> white, and the hybrid, pink flowers). Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent {{or the other}} (e.g., a bird hybrid might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).|$|E
5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the campaign mode, Perfect Dark Zero features a multiplayer where a maximum of 32 players may compete in numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games via split-screen, system link, or Xbox Live. The multiplayer offers two main modes with their own customisable options: DeathMatch and DarkOps. DeathMatch is a standard gametype where players spawn in rooms, collect weapons that {{are available on the}} map itself, and continue to the actual map. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from Killcount or Team Killcount, where the goal is to kill as many opposing players as possible, to objective-based games such as Capture the Flag and Territorial Gains. DarkOps, on the other hand, is a slower-paced and team-only gametype where weapons must be purchased from a player's stock of credits and credits are earned by killing enemies and completing objectives. Scenarios in this mode include Eradication, where the last team with any members left alive wins; Infection, where players score points by either infecting others or surviving infection; Sabotage, where the team that causes the most damage to the other team's property wins; and Onslaught, where one team must defend a base while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> to attack it.|$|E

5|$|Planets {{also have}} {{varying degrees of}} axial tilt; they lie {{at an angle to}} the plane of their stars' equators. This causes the amount of light {{received}} by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices. Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt {{as a result of their}} proximity to their stars.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} suspension span carries northbound traffic for Interstate 295, {{whereas the}} newer span carries the southbound traffic. Crossover lanes {{on each side}} of the bridge can allow for two-way traffic on one span if <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> to be closed for an extensive period of time.|$|E

25|$|This sound {{change was}} incomplete, in that all Baltic and Slavic {{languages}} have instances where PIE palatovelars appear as *k and *g, often in doublets (i.e. etymologically related words, where {{one has a}} sound descended from *k or *g and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> a sound descended from *ś or *ź).|$|E
25|$|PPIs can {{be split}} into two groups based on their basic structure. Though all have a {{substituted}} pyridine part, one group has it linked to various benzimidazoles but <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>has</b> it linked to a substituted imidazopyridine. All marketed PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, etc.) are in the benzimidazole group.|$|E
