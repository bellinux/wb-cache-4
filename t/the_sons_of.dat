The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering.

5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs.

Therefore, {{it is in the}} queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not <b>the</b> <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|E

A notable member of this group was Prince William, later William IV, who served as a midshipman from 1780–1785.
