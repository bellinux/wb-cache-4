5|$|Some {{had said}} that the {{database}} might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where children from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the database would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The sheer size of the database could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate {{of the cost of the}} database. The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the database to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the database would do nothing to prevent child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{set-point}} model, {{levels of}} positive and negative affects are more or less fixed within each individual, hence, after a positive or negative event, people's moods <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to the pre-set level. According to the set-point model, extraverts experience more happiness because their pre-set level of positive affect is set higher than the pre-set point of positive affect in introverts, therefore extraverts require less positive reinforcement in order to feel happy.|$|E
25|$|After use Dutch ovens are {{typically}} cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with {{boiling water and}} a brush, and no soap. After the oven has been dried, it {{should be given a}} thin coating of cooking oil to prevent rusting. Whether that should be a vegetable fat or an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> rancid more quickly. If the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest temperature resistance, which would be conducive to cooking.|$|E

25|$|From 1950 to 2005, the municipality's {{population}} grew from 9,226 to 19,493 people, representing a {{growth rate of}} 0.8%. Birthrates are high and mortality rates are low, however, since the 2000s, the municipality has experienced significant migration out. Without this migration, the growth rate would have been about 1.5%. From 2000 to 2005, the population has decreased to 18,905. It is estimated about 32% of the working age population of the municipality has emigrated to look for employment. Most from Landa migrate to Texas, especially Houston. However, those from certain communities <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to certain places in the United States. For example, those who are from La Lagunita generally go to Corpus Christi, while those from La Vuelta go to Austin or Dallas and those from the municipal seat <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Florida, Indiana, Michigan or Georgia. Many from Tilaco go to Houston, although {{at least a few}} have gone as far north as Nebraska and Michigan. The money these migrants send back to their families is extremely important to the economy. Landa and other municipalities hold a yearly event at Christmastime in Jalpan de Sierra to honor those migrants from the U.S. who are visiting families. At the beginning of December, many of these migrants come back for the feast of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, often driving down in pickup trucks and wearing cowboy clothing. The event often features musical styles popular in Texas and also honors these migrants.|$|E
25|$|In {{properly}} trained hands, {{some medical}} lasers {{are used to}} remove flat moles level with {{the surface of the}} skin, as well as some raised moles. While laser treatment is commonly offered and may require several appointments, other dermatologists think lasers are not the best method for removing moles because the laser only cauterizes or, in certain cases, removes very superficial levels of skin. Moles <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> deeper into the skin than non-invasive lasers can penetrate. After a laser treatment a scab is formed, which falls off about seven days later, in contrast to surgery, where the wound has to be sutured. A second concern about the laser treatment is that if the lesion is a melanoma, and was misdiagnosed as a benign mole, the procedure might delay diagnosis. If the mole is incompletely removed by the laser, and the pigmented lesion regrows, it might form a recurrent nevus.|$|E
25|$|Cask ale in pubs {{is usually}} {{served with a}} beer engine or handpump, {{which is used to}} siphon the beer from the cellar. The beer engine is a , {{sometimes}} , airtight piston chamber; pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half pint of beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> stale overnight, so the first beer of the day pulled through will be thrown away. Most pubs will pull through at least a pint of beer on each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of beer on that pump. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with long, smooth, slow pulls of the pump handle, plus a short final pull to make sure the glass is full.|$|E

25|$|Students {{enrolled}} {{in one of}} the undergraduate programs of the Faculty of Social Sciences can earn a degree with a certification through one of the collaborative programs with local colleges. There are 11 Collaborative programs in which social science majors can choose from; Behavioural Science, Child and Youth Workers, Contemporary Labour Studies, Emergency Management, Film Studies, Geomatics, Journalism, Paralegal, Policing and Criminal Justice, Public Relations and Yukon College. Applications must be submitted after completion of their first year of study maintaining a 70% average. Students spend their first, second and fourth year at Brock while their third is spent at the preferred local college. For example, Media and Communication students can enrol in their third year of study in the Public Relations collaborative program with Mohawk College. This allows students to end their undergraduate with a certification of Public Relations and a Bachelor of Arts in four years rather than five if done consecutively. Students who complete this program <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the government sector, private agencies, corporations and/or non-profit.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Belldandy was generally well received {{and has a}} large number of fans, as evidenced when she was voted the second most popular female character in a 2001 poll in Newtype. In addition, Belldandy topped the Animage character polls for many months and was placed third on the all time Best Character list at the 17th Anime Grand Prix held in 1993. Nevertheless, as reviewer Zac Bertschy described the situation: [...] "People <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> either way on the Belldandy character; either she's an obnoxious, archaic fantasy girl for men who prefer their women to act like indentured servants, or she's the archetype of perfection, a flawless example of graceful femininity".|$|E

500|$|ILM's {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Scott Farrar said that [...] "not {{only were the}} film's effects ambitious, they also had to be designed for 3-D", and explained the company's solutions for the new perspective: [...] "We did make sure things are as bright as possible; Michael called up theatre owners {{to make sure they}} keep the lamps bright in the theatres... make everything a little sharper, because we know that through the steps, no matter what, {{when you get to the}} final screening things <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> less sharp." [...] On the last weekend of ILM's work on Dark of the Moon, the company's entire render farm was being used for the film, giving ILM more than 200,000 hours of rendering power a day—or equivalent to 22.8 years of rendering time in a 24-hour period. Farrar embraced the detail in creating giant robots for 3-D, making sure that in close-ups of the Transformers' faces [...] "you see all the details in the nooks and crannies of these pieces. It's totally unlike a plain surface subject like a human head or an animated head." [...] The supervisor said that Bay's style of cinematography helped integrate the robots into the scenes, as [...] "Michael is keen on having foreground/midground/background depth in his shots, even in normal live-action shots. He'll say, ’Put some stuff hanging here!' It could be women's stockings or forks and knives dangling from a string out of focus – it doesn't matter, but it gives you depth, and focus depth, and makes it more interesting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Controlled {{burns on}} far north Australian savannas {{can result in}} an overall carbon sink. One working example is the West Arnhem Fire Management Agreement, started to bring [...] "strategic fire {{management}} across 28,000 km² of Western Arnhem Land". Deliberately starting controlled burns early in the dry season results in a mosaic of burnt and unburnt country which reduces the area of burning compared with stronger, late dry season fires. In the early dry season there are higher moisture levels, cooler temperatures, and lighter wind than later in the dry season; fires <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out overnight. Early controlled burns also results in a smaller proportion of the grass and tree biomass being burnt. Emission reductions of 256,000 tonnes of CO2 have been made as of 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the wide}} range of styles, Chardonnay has the {{potential}} to be paired with a diverse spectrum of food types.

Instead, those wines <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> better with smoked fish, spicy southeast Asian cuisine, garlic and guacamole dips.
