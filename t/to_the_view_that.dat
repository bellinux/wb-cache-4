Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet I sincerely love and value their talent.|$|E
5|$|After {{a week of}} shooting, {{the film}} was shelved due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> such a story might not succeed in Telugu; the {{production}} company instead produced Shanti, which became a failure. D.L. Narayana then decided to revive Devadasu as an independent producer. Janaki, who was originally chosen for the character of Parvati, was replaced by Savitri.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service, but was told that men of his age, thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months.

5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events {{were thought to}} have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted {{over a period of}} 800,000 years spanning the K–Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events {{were thought to}} have started around 68million years ago and lasted for over 2 million years. However, {{there is evidence that}} two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 66million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.|$|E
5|$|Having ruled {{himself out}} of the race when the news of Macmillan's illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by {{changing}} his mind. Macmillan quickly came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He {{let it be known that}} if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> science {{rests on}} foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified {{by being a}} part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposal}} for {{a new type of}} submarine to replace the Oberon class of diesel-electric submarines began in July 1978, when the RAN director of submarine policy prepared a paper detailing the need to start considering a replacement for the ageing Oberons. The paper also raised the suggestion {{that the majority of the}} submarines be constructed in Australia and that the number of submarines be increased beyond the six Oberons. Building the submarines in Australia was initially met with reactions predicting an impossible task because of the poor state of the Australian shipbuilding industry, and Australian industry in general, although campaigning by several figures in Australian industry who thought it could be done came to the attention of those spearheading the project to design the Oberon-class replacement, and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> it was both possible and feasible. The campaign to build submarines in Australia was also met with support from the Australian Labor Party and several trade unions.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow a currency war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a currency war to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries but against market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> {{it was best to}} leave the running of their economies to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E
