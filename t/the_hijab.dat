Still, in the South Sudan in 2006, the local government was indicating their support of women's football. By 2009, women's football programmes had been established in the Sudan. That year, there were ten senior women's teams, a school-based competition and a regional competition established. Young girls informally play the game in refugee camps in the Darfur region.

The MMH reinforces their commitment to Allah and communicates their religious beliefs to others. The fabric preferences for MMH are softness, drapability, lightweight, and breathability.

40|$|Reina Lewis {{examines}} Muslim women’s hijab (i. e., veiling) as ‘fashion’, {{a phenomenon}} that prevails in the contemporary global consumer culture. Her central argument is that <b>the</b> over-politicization of <b>hijab,</b> particularly in <b>the</b> West, has deterred not only the public but also academics from understanding a plethora of dynamics that both influence and are influenced by hijab as fashion. While this overlook is largely related to the post- 9 / 11 signification of hijab as Islamism, Lewis holds Orientalism equally accountable for <b>the</b> underrepresentation of <b>hijab</b> in <b>the</b> fashion discourse. As the author argues, traditionally, fashion {{has been associated with}} Western modernity, assuming no place for fashion among Muslims and confining hijab to ethnicity and religiosity. Following the recent rise of Islam’s visibility in <b>the</b> West, <b>hijab</b> has been largely viewed as exclusion from and/or opposition to a progressive modernity, manifested in the West-centric consumer culture...|$|R
