The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and observes that the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an approach}} of using engineeringoriented design <b>theories</b> <b>to</b> build bridges between software engineering and human [...] computer interaction. The main {{thrust of the}} approach is to try <b>to</b> use design <b>theories</b> <b>to</b> create "boundary objects", which are intellectual tools that are shared by both disciplines and enable cooperation. The approach is illustrated and supported by relating it to ongoing domain-bridging work which is exploring the application of cognitive support <b>theories</b> <b>to</b> SE research problems. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Functional interpretations are {{interpretations of}} non-constructive {{theories}} in functional ones. Functional interpretations usually proceed in two stages. First, one [...] "reduces" [...] a classical <b>theory</b> C <b>to</b> an intuitionistic one I. That is, one provides a constructive mapping that translates the theorems of C to the theorems of I. Second, one reduces the intuitionistic <b>theory</b> I <b>to</b> a quantifier free theory of functionals F. These interpretations {{contribute to a}} form of Hilbert's program, since they prove the consistency of classical <b>theories</b> relative <b>to</b> constructive ones. Successful functional interpretations have yielded reductions of infinitary <b>theories</b> <b>to</b> finitary <b>theories</b> and impredicative <b>theories</b> <b>to</b> predicative ones.|$|R
30|$|Our {{study has}} both {{theoretical}} and managerial contributions, as {{it contributes to}} the diverse stakeholders as well as management in SA countries relating to environmental investment decisions and policy regulations. Theoretically speaking, we used different sets of <b>theories</b> <b>to</b> connect corporate governance with environmental information disclosure decisions. Prior studies generally used agency and resource dependency <b>theories</b> <b>to</b> better explain corporate governance and stakeholders, and legitimacy <b>theories</b> <b>to</b> discuss disclosure practices. The political cost theory also {{was used in the}} explanation of corporate ESRP. As a theoretical contribution, this study is the first to document five sets of <b>theories</b> <b>to</b> describe the relationship between corporate governance and ESRP. Specifically, we find that companies are engaging more in ESRP to reduce political costs and increase their competitive advantage.|$|R

5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a quantum field <b>theory</b> <b>to</b> {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This {{is one of the}} motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E
5|$|Geometry was {{a second}} field in which groups were used systematically, {{especially}} symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program. After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged, Klein used group <b>theory</b> <b>to</b> organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.|$|E

5|$|A similar <b>theory</b> <b>to</b> Syme's {{has been}} put forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} {{two and a half}} centuries, Io {{remained}} an unresolved, 5th-magnitude point of light in astronomers' telescopes. During the 17th century, Io and the other Galilean satellites served a variety of purposes, including early methods to determine longitude, validating Kepler's third law of planetary motion, and determining the time required for light to travel between Jupiter and Earth. Based on ephemerides produced by astronomer Giovanni Cassini and others, Pierre-Simon Laplace created a mathematical <b>theory</b> <b>to</b> explain the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede.

5|$|Many of the {{applications}} of Hilbert spaces exploit {{the fact that}} Hilbert spaces support generalizations of simple geometric concepts like projection and change of basis from their usual finite dimensional setting. In particular, the spectral theory of continuous self-adjoint linear operators on a Hilbert space generalizes the usual spectral decomposition of a matrix, and this often {{plays a major role}} in applications of the <b>theory</b> <b>to</b> other areas of mathematics and physics.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{problems}} in modern physics {{is the problem of}} quantum gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated within the framework of classical physics. However, nongravitational forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum <b>theory</b> <b>to</b> the force of gravity.|$|E
