5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for <b>the</b> <b>goddess</b> Vimala. <b>The</b> <b>goddess</b> is described {{to survive on}} the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter. The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad {{and a plate of}} khichdi that is offered to <b>the</b> <b>goddess,</b> the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of the}} temple.|$|E

5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to <b>the</b> <b>goddess,</b> who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to <b>the</b> <b>goddess,</b> and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the young mother of carelessness and began to believe she might be a witch who ate her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the young mother decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the cat in the act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There she saw her sons playing around Shashthi as <b>the</b> <b>goddess</b> held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal and told her to ask pardon of the cat. The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised <b>the</b> <b>goddess</b> that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children and spread the worship of <b>the</b> <b>goddess,</b> who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E
5|$|A shrine {{dedicated}} to Chhinnamasta {{was built by}} a Tantric sadhu in the Durga Temple complex, Ramnagar, near Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, where tantrikas worship her using corpses. Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, has a shrine of <b>the</b> <b>goddess</b> that is open only three days a year, around Chaitra Navaratri. Her shrines are also situated in the Kamakhya Temple complex, Assam and Basukinath temple complex, Jharkhand along with other Mahavidyas.

5|$|Another form of <b>the</b> <b>goddess</b> in the Tantrasara {{describes}} her seated {{in her own}} navel, formless and invisible. This form {{is said to be}} realised only via a trance.

40|$|<b>The</b> Great <b>Goddesses</b> held {{real power}} in the Ancient World, whether in goddess-dominated {{religions}} or god-dominated religions, where <b>the</b> <b>goddesses</b> played subordinate roles. The feminine principle was always present, unlike in the three patriarchal religions under study: Judaism, Christianity and Buddhism. What happened to <b>the</b> <b>Goddesses</b> in these religions? The gods and male founders of these religions appropriated <b>the</b> Great <b>Goddesses</b> 2 ̆ 7 powers of creating and sustaining life, and <b>the</b> Great <b>Goddesses</b> 2 ̆ 7 powers over the process of death and renewal/regeneration/rebirth. They debased or subordinated <b>the</b> <b>Goddesses</b> 2 ̆ 7 key symbols [...] the serpent, the tree, the earth, and the moon. By comparing goddess-dominant myths or religions with Judaism, Christianity and Buddhism {{it becomes clear that}} a gender shift occurred in the dominant deity, and that the new male deities or religious founders assumed <b>the</b> Great <b>Goddesses</b> 2 ̆ 7 powers, {{while at the same time}} attempting to exclude <b>the</b> <b>Goddesses</b> and a feminine principle from the new religions. Upon close examination, vestiges of these Great Goddesses can be discovered in Judaism, Christianity and Buddhism. Dept. of Religious Studies.
