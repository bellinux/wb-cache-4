500|$|In 1993 and 1994, Thunder Run {{was cited}} by Amusement Business as the [...] "Most Terrifying Roller Coaster" [...] on a top 10 list. The American Coaster Enthusiasts' Inside Track {{magazine}} ranked Thunder Run as the [...] "fourth best {{of its kind}} in the nation". In 2007, the Lexington Herald-Leader described the ride as having [...] "a few nice drops and that jerky, clicking wooden coaster feel that some people love, but it never gets too wild". Tim O'Brien, formerly of Amusement Business, rode the inaugural run of the ride in 1990, as well as the first cycle of the refurbished ride in 2013. O'Brien describes the updated ride as [...] "a better ride <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> back then", commending the ride's ability to give a classic wooden roller coaster feel, yet run smoothly. He states Thunder Run [...] "is one of the top wooden roller coasters in the world".|$|E
500|$|The Wii {{version of}} Ōkami has {{received}} generally similar praise to the PlayStation 2 version, with GameSpot {{stating that the}} support for widescreen and the Wii controls [...] "make it even more relevant <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 2006". The use of the Wii Remote for the Celestial Brush was well received; in GameSpots review, they noted that the Wii functionality with the Brush [...] "improves {{the pace of the}} game". However, other aspects to the controls were found to be weaker, particularly in combat. In their review, Nintendo Power recommended the PlayStation 2 version of the game over the Wii, stating that [...] "Though you can overcome the drawing and attacking issues with practice (and by sticking to whip-style weapons), it's a hurdle you shouldn't have to leap." [...] The Wii version was given the Game of the Month award from IGN for April 2008. It was a nominee for multiple awards from IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best Artistic Design and Best Use of the Wii-Mote.|$|E

2500|$|Anal sex {{being more}} common among heterosexuals <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{previously}} {{has been linked to}} the increase in consumption of anal pornography among men, especially among those who view it on a regular basis. Seidman et al. argued that [...] "cheap, accessible and, especially, interactive media have enabled many more people to produce as well as consume pornography", and that this modern way of producing pornography, in addition to the buttocks and anus having become more eroticized, has led to a significant interest in or obsession with anal sex among men.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1940 article [...] "Dickens: Two Scrooges", Edmund Wilson states, [...] "Our Mutual Friend, {{like all}} these later books of Dickens, is more {{interesting}} to us <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to Dickens's public. Certainly the subtleties and profundities that are now discovered in it were not noticed by the reviewers." [...] As a whole, modern critics of Our Mutual Friend, particularly those of the last half century, have been more appreciative of Dickens's last completed work than his contemporary reviewers. Although some modern critics find Dickens's characterisation in Our Mutual Friend problematic, most tend to positively acknowledge the novel's complexity and appreciate its multiple plot lines.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Fars News Agency, Fajr-5 (long range Iranian) rockets have a warhead of 150–200kg. According to Theodore Postol, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Gazan artillery rocket warheads contain 10- to 20-pound explosive loads. Postol states that this fact makes bomb shelters more effective for protection. Mark Perry states that the [...] "vast majority of the rockets are unsophisticated Qassams, with a 10-20 kg warhead and no guidance system". He also stated that [...] "Hamas’ arsenal is considerably weaker <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 2012". Regarding the Fajr-5, he stated that Iran had not transferred full-fledged rockets to Hamas, it only transferred technology to manufacture them. He also stated that [...] "its guidance system was crude, at best, and its warhead nearly non-existent." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{focus of}} {{attachment}} {{research has been}} on the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called [...] "day care wars" [...] of the late 20th century, during which the deleterious effects of day care were stressed. As a beneficial result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues and the need for relationship-building through techniques such as assignment of a child to a specific care provider. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to follow through on these considerations, nevertheless a larger number of infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than {{was the case in the}} past, and emotional development of children in nonparental care may be different <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the 1980s or in Bowlby's time.|$|E
2500|$|Richie Unterberger of AllMusic {{offers a}} less {{favourable}} opinion of Is This What You Want?, describing Lomax as [...] "a passable but unarresting singer and songwriter". Unterberger identifies the best moments as the [...] "Beatlesque" [...] songs [...] "Is This What You Want?" [...] and the [...] "uncommonly tender" [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes". Discussing the 2004 reissue in Record Collector, Terry Staunton described Lomax's style as [...] " [...] the same seam as Joe Cocker, albeit {{with a voice}} neither as distinctive or as powerful" [...] and singled out the [...] "gentle balladry" [...] of [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes" [...] and [...] "Baby You're A Lover" [...] as highlights. Staunton concluded that Lomax's only Apple album was [...] "a fairly pleasing blue-eyed soul set, which is probably more revered <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> 35 years ago". Writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin says that next {{to the list of}} celebrated contributors, Lomax's [...] "stylish compositions and superb voice were equal to such esteemed company".|$|E
2500|$|Considerable media {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the ideology and pathology of Zehaf-Bibeau. Along with Martin Couture-Rouleau and Justin Bourque, he has been labelled a [...] "lone-wolf terrorist". Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were [...] "both self-radicalized and adrift in their lives and connected in their sympathy to radical Islamic ideology." [...] Other opinions diverged from simply calling Zehaf-Bibeau a terrorist. Vancouver Sun columnist Ian Mulgrew commented on how the incident, as well as a failed bombing attempt in Victoria by persons motivated similarly to Zehaf-Bibeau, showed 'gaping holes' in the social security net. [...] "These incidents are examples not of Muslim extremism but of the lack of community support for the dysfunctional of any faith who, with a lack of proper attention or the wrong catalyst, become dangerous. I know which approach would make me feel safer, what I would call real security measures: a social safety net that caught those in obvious need before they went postal, people like Zehaf-Bibeau." [...] Green Party leader Elizabeth May said in the House of Commons: [...] "I would put money on these being the acts of isolated, disturbed and deeply troubled men who were drawn to something crazy. I do not believe that it was a vast network, or that the country is more at risk <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> last week. However, that is my opinion. I can be wrong...I am undoubtedly going to be wrong again, but what I would like to suggest is that we wait for answers from the police before we make assumptions, and that we speak calmly, truthfully and openly to all Canadians." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} tango are unclear because {{historical}} documentation from that era hardly exists.

2500|$|Lucas's 1923 {{review of}} The Waste Land, much reprinted {{in the decades}} since his death, was omitted from his Authors Dead and Living (1926), a {{collection}} of New Statesman pieces, probably because he had ended by saying the poem {{should be left to}} sink. Remarks elsewhere confirm that he had not changed his opinion. Described by F. W. Bateson as [...] "brilliantly wrong-headed", the review is better known <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> during Lucas's lifetime. His only other comment on the poem occurs in his essay 'English Literature' in the volume University Studies: Cambridge 1933, where he contested I. A. Richards' view of it in Science and Poetry (1926): [...] "The Waste Land is praised [...] for its 'complete severence' from all beliefs', when it is really a yearning cry for them, and at its close some sort of faith is so clearly impending that it has been praised by others as a great religious poem (such are the triumphs of obscurity)." [...] The Letters of T. S. Eliot [...] includes correspondence between Eliot and Lucas but no reference to the review. Historians of The New Statesman have regretted that Desmond MacCarthy invited Lucas to review modern poetry, one of them declaring Lucas [...] "a disastrous choice" [...] for a Waste Land review. (Disastrous, that is, for the journal's avant-garde image.) After 1923, though attacking obscurantism in general terms, Lucas largely ignored Eliot's poetry, aside from a retrospective dig in 1942 at 'The Hollow Men' ("hollow men whimpering under prickly pear trees, conceited still amid their grovellings because a prickly pear remains an exotic and highly intellectual plant" [...] ) and at 'Sweeney among the Nightingales' ("the nightingales of Aeschylus now exhibit to a ravished public their 'droppings'; for to the sewer all things are sewer" [...] ). On the later Eliot he was silent. He had no time for mystical poetry, regarding religion as an aberration of the human mind.|$|E
