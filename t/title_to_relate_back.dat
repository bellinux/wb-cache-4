Performance assessments using traditional I/O system and component benchmarks are difficult <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> application I/O requirements.

We show a procedure for selecting IOR parameters to match the I/O patterns of the selected applications and show it can accurately predict the I/O performance of the full applications. We conclude that IOR is an effective replacement for full-application I/O benchmarks and can bridge the gap of understanding that typically exists between stand-alone benchmarks and the full applications they intend to model. ...|$|R
