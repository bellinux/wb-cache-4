5|$|Other highly {{specialized}} feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The lower <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> particularly sharp. Although {{they have never been}} observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.|$|E

50|$|The <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> dated by dating nearby stalagmites. The stalagmites were {{dated to}} at least 80,000 years. Since the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> found under rock over which the stalagmites had grown, the <b>teeth</b> must <b>be</b> older than 80,000 years old.|$|R
5|$|Tiger shark <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> unique {{with very}} sharp, {{pronounced}} serrations and an unmistakable sideways pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the sharks life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> considerably shorter {{than those of}} a great white shark, however they are nearly as broad as the root as the great whites teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the primary}} set of teeth, {{there are two}} types of incisors – centrals and laterals, and two types of molars – first and second. All primary <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} later replaced with their permanent counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Shark <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove {{on the inside of}} the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
50|$|Hound's <b>Tooth</b> <b>is</b> a {{peak in the}} Purcell Mountains of the Columbia Mountains {{in southeastern}} British Columbia, Canada. Hound's <b>Tooth</b> <b>is</b> a rock {{pinnacle}} {{at the end of}} Marmolata Mountain's northeast ridge. Both mountains are Nunataks, sticking up {{from the middle of the}} Bugaboo Glacier. The Hounds' <b>Tooth</b> <b>is</b> composed of a coarse, fractured granite.|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} {{is thought to}} be due to trauma or possibly a delay in tooth eruption relative to bone remodeling gradients during the period in which <b>tooth</b> <b>is</b> forming. The result is that the position of the calcified portion of the <b>tooth</b> <b>is</b> changed and the remainder of the <b>tooth</b> <b>is</b> formed at an angle.|$|R
40|$|Presence of {{supernumerary}} <b>teeth</b> <b>is</b> well-recognized clinical phenomenon. However, it is {{uncommon to}} find multiple supernumeraries in individuals {{with no other}} associated disease or syndrome. Presence of multiple supernumerary <b>teeth</b> <b>is</b> thought to have genetic component. We report a rare case where multiple supernumerary <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> seen without presence of any other syndrome in 3 generations; father, son, and two grandsons. We also present a review of similar cases published in literature till date. The role of genetics in development of supernumerary <b>teeth</b> <b>is</b> highlighted...|$|R
5|$|The blacknose shark has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} long, rounded snout and large eyes. There is a well-developed flap of skin {{in front of each}} nostril, defining the inflow and outflow openings. Twelve to 13 and 11 to 12 tooth rows occur {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively, with one or two teeth at the symphysis (middle). The <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> triangular and oblique, with serrated edges; the upper <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> stouter than the lower teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the creek}} whaler is {{spindle-shaped}} and rather stocky. The long snout has a narrowly parabolic shape and large nostrils preceded by small, nipple-shaped flaps of skin. The eyes are circular and of medium size, and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The arched mouth has very short furrows at the corners. There are 30 upper and 28–30 lower tooth rows. The upper <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> long and triangular with strongly serrated edges, and become increasing angled towards {{the sides of the}} jaw. The lower <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> slender and upright with finely serrated edges. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark has an elongated, cigar-shaped {{body with}} a short, bulbously rounded snout. The {{nostrils}} have a very short flap of skin in front. The large, oval, green eyes are placed forward on the head, though not {{so that there is}} extensive binocular vision. Behind the eyes are large spiracles, positioned on the upper surface of the head. The mouth is short, forming a nearly transverse line, and is surrounded by enlarged, fleshy, suctorial lips. There are 3037 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2531 tooth rows in the lower jaw, increasing with body size. The upper and lower <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> extremely different: the upper <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> small, narrow, and upright, tapering to a single, smooth-edged cusp. The lower <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> also smooth-edged, but much larger, broader, and knife-like, with their bases interlocking to form a single saw-like cutting edge. The five pairs of gill slits are small.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tooth</b> loss <b>is</b> {{a process}} in which one or more teeth come loose and fall out. <b>Tooth</b> loss <b>is</b> normal for {{deciduous}} teeth (baby <b>teeth),</b> when they <b>are</b> replaced by a person's adult teeth. Otherwise, losing <b>teeth</b> <b>is</b> undesirable and is the result of injury or disease, such as dental avulsion, tooth decay, and gum disease. The condition of being toothless or missing one or more <b>teeth</b> <b>is</b> called edentulism.|$|R
30|$|All <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> cycled in a {{demineralization}} {{solution and}} artificial saliva for 15  days [18]. The <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> {{immersed in the}} demineralizing solution (calcium nitrate 0.4723  g, potassium dihydrogen phosphate 0.2722  g, acetic acid 4.5083  g) for 8  h/day [19]. Then, the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> rinsed with tap water and putted in artificial saliva solution (sodium azide 0.75  g, potassium monohydrogen phosphate 0.804  g, sodium chloride 1.02  g, calcium chloride 0.166  g, magnesium chloride 0.059  g) for 30  min [20]. Each <b>tooth</b> <b>was</b> cleaned by using electronic dental brush (Oral-B, Braun GmbH, Germany) and Crest cavity protection toothpaste (1450  ppm F) for 2  s. Again, all <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> rinsed with water {{and placed in the}} artificial saliva for approximately 15  h until the cycle was repeated.|$|R

5|$|The {{kitefin shark}} has a {{moderately}} elongated {{body with a}} very short, rounded snout. The eyes and spiracles are large. The lips are thick with pleats or fringes, though are not modified to be suctorial. There are 1621 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 1720 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> small and spike-shaped, curving slightly towards {{the corners of the}} mouth. The lower <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> very large, knife-shaped, and serrated, with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface.|$|E
5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each nostril is extended into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval in shape and equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> narrow and angled, with coarsely serrated edges. The lower <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> more slender and upright in shape, and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|E
5|$|The smalltail shark is a slender-bodied {{species with}} a fairly long, pointed snout. The leading margin of each nostril is {{enlarged}} into a narrow, pointed lobe. The large, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes, and behind them {{are a series of}} prominent pores. The mouth bears short furrows at the corners and contains 13–15 tooth rows on either side of both jaws (usually 14 upper and 13 lower). The upper <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> tall and triangular with strong serrations, becoming increasing oblique towards the sides. The lower <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> comparatively narrower and more upright, with finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell of}} Pupilla bigranata {{is smaller than}} Pupilla muscorum, whorls are {{slightly}} more rounded, cervical callus <b>is</b> strong, palatal <b>tooth</b> <b>are</b> more strongly developed and parietal <b>tooth</b> <b>is</b> also prominent.|$|R

25|$|There were {{abrasions}} on Kaede's {{hands and}} feet, {{and several of}} her <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> missing. It was assumed that the abrasions and removal of the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> made post-mortem by the suspect.|$|R
5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth row at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{replacement}} - <b>Teeth</b> <b>are</b> replaced once or (as in toothed {{whales and}} murid rodents) not at all, {{rather than being}} replaced continually throughout life.|$|E
5|$|A {{vampire bat}} has front teeth that are {{specialized}} for cutting {{and the back}} <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> much smaller than in other bats.

40|$|Sixty intact, non-carious and unrestored teeth {{extracted}} due to {{periodontal disease}} {{were used to}} determine the most effective method of sterilisation. The <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> divided into six groups, each containing 10 teeth. Group 1 <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> immersed in 10 &#x 0025; formalin for seven days, group 2 <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> immersed in 3 &#x 0025; hydrogen peroxide for seven days, group 3 <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> immersed in 2. 6 &#x 0025; sodium hypochlorite for seven days, group 4 <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> boiled in water at 100 &#x 00 B 0;C for 20 minutes, group 5 <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> autoclaved at 121 &#x 00 B 0;C at 15 lbs psi for 30 minutes, and group 6 <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> immersed in normal saline for seven days. After the treatment, the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> individually inoculated into trypticase soy broth and incubated for 48 hours. A questionnaire survey was also conducted to determine the awareness of dental students regarding infection due to extracted human teeth and the common disinfection/sterilisation methods used. Autoclaving at 121 &#x 00 B 0;C, 15 lbs psi for 30 minutes and immersion in 10 &#x 0025; formalin for seven days were effective in disinfecting/sterilising extracted human teeth. Chemicals such as 2. 6 &#x 0025; sodium hypochlorite, 3 &#x 0025; hydrogen peroxide and boiling in water were not effective. The results indicate that autoclaving for 30 minutes or immersion in 10 &#x 0025; formalin for seven days could be effectively used for disinfection/sterilisation of extracted human teeth...|$|R
40|$|The {{orthodontic}} {{records of}} 685 patients referred for surgical exposure of an unerupted impacted maxillary canine <b>tooth</b> <b>were</b> examined. The condition was {{more common among}} females than males, slightly less than 2 : 1. The impacted teeth had a palatal-labial ratio of 3 : 1. All of the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> exposed using the open surgical technique and in 98 % of cases the <b>tooth</b> erupted and <b>was</b> orthodontically aligned. In 2 % of cases ankylosis occurred and the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> subsequently extracted. The presence of peg-shaped lateral incisors associated with the impacted maxillary canine <b>tooth</b> <b>was</b> 3. 4 % {{of the total number}} of impacted teeth and congenital absence was found in 1. 7 % of impacted teeth...|$|R
50|$|Yildirim et al. (2008) {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the smear layer on apical microleakage in teeth obturated with MTA. Fifty single-rooted central maxillary <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> used in this study. The selected <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> instrumented and randomly divided into 2 groups. In the first group (smear +), the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> irrigated with only 5.25% NaOCl. In the second group (smear -), the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> irrigated with EDTA (17%) and NaOCl (5.25%) to remove the smear layer. The <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> then filled with MTA. The computerized fluid filtration method was used for evaluation of apical microleakage. The quantitative apical leakage of each <b>tooth</b> <b>was</b> measured after 2, 30, and 180 days. It was found that {{there was no difference between}} the groups after 2 days but removal of the smear layer caused significantly more apical microleakage than when the smear layer was left intact after 30 and 180 days. It was concluded that the apical microleakage of MTA is less when the smear layer is present than when it is absent.|$|R
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E
5|$|Males have {{relatively}} small testes {{compared to other}} lemurs, and their canine <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> {{the same size as}} those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of nipples.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> widest {{at their}} midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped <b>teeth</b> <b>are</b> unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} factor {{is whether the}} involved <b>tooth</b> <b>is</b> to be extracted or retained. Although the pulp is usually still vital, a history of recurrent periodontal abscesses and significantly compromised periodontal support indicate that the prognosis for the <b>tooth</b> <b>is</b> poor {{and it should be}} removed.|$|R
40|$|Fusion of <b>teeth</b> <b>is</b> {{the union}} {{of two or more}} <b>tooth</b> germs, which <b>are</b> usually separated. Depending upon the stage of odontogenesis, it can be {{complete}} or incomplete. The present case describes fusion between the maxillary primary right central and lateral incisor with a supernumerary tooth. Clinical and radiographic examination revealed the presence of fused triple teeth. The fused <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> extracted, sectioned and were visualized under stereomicroscope at three levels and the diagnosis of fusion of three <b>teeth</b> <b>was</b> confirmed histologically...|$|R
30|$|At {{the end of}} day 28, the TS and CS <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> {{extracted}} atraumatically {{to avoid}} damage to the root cementum. The <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> processed by immersing extracted them in a solution of sterilised deionised water (Milli-Q; Millipore, Bedford, Mass). Then, the <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> treated for 10  min in an ultrasonic bath to remove residual PDL and soft tissue fragments [29]. The remaining visible PDL was manually cleaned using a damp gauze swab before final disinfection using 70 % alcohol for 30  min. Finally, the disinfected <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> stored in Milli-Q at room temperature (23 [*]±[*] 1  °C) with 50 %[*]±[*] 10 % relative humidity before scanning.|$|R
