It also discusses the motivation and applications of a sequence of numbers {{more closely related to}} number theory than probability; these Bernoulli numbers bear his name today, and are one of his more notable achievements.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{provided}} many of <b>the</b> <b>foundational</b> {{documents for}} reformed churches, including documents on the catechism, the liturgy, and church governance.

The Belgic Confession of 1561, a Dutch confession of faith, was partly based on the Gallic Confession.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{influence}} of Vivekananda, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are nowadays considered as <b>the</b> <b>foundational</b> scripture of classical yoga, a status which it only acquired in the 20th century. Before the twentieth century, other works were considered as the most central works, such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Vasistha, while Tantric Yoga and Hatha Yoga prevailed over Ashtanga Yoga.|$|E
5|$|After {{he gained}} Kevala Jnana, Mahavira taught that the {{observance}} of the vows ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) {{is necessary to}} spiritual liberation. He gave the principle of Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called Jain Agamas. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but {{are believed to have}} been largely lost by about the 1stcentury when they were first written down. The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of <b>the</b> <b>foundational</b> texts of Jainism.|$|E
5|$|Although Gilbert wrote much of <b>the</b> <b>foundational</b> {{code for}} Maniac Mansion, the {{majority}} of the game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee David Fox. Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game only for a month, but he remained with the team for six months. With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' dialog and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to add new elements to the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to place a hamster inside the kitchen's microwave.|$|E

5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) {{was founded}} on 28 December 1924, when about 75 {{linguists}} met to select officers, ratify a constitution, and present papers {{in order to facilitate}} communication within the field of linguistics. <b>The</b> <b>foundational</b> members included 31 women, most of whom worked as educators rather than as scholars at research institutions. By 1935, half of the female foundational members had left the society—a rate similar to that of male members—largely due to the professionalization of the field of linguistics that disproportionately affected women as most worked outside of academia.|$|E
5|$|The Shaiva Puranas, {{particularly}} the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the {{various aspects of}} Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (Tirtha) associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider soul within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, dvaita), are <b>the</b> <b>foundational</b> texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (monism, advaita), and that Shiva is the soul, the perfection and truth within each living being. In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty four monism Agama texts.|$|E
5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because <b>the</b> <b>foundational</b> movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep <b>the</b> <b>foundational</b> movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a federally-supported {{residential}} school system relied on the expert advice of several prominent Canadian and British statesmen. Sir Peregrine Maitland, a British soldier and colonial administrator, first proposed boarding schools in 1820, believing that civilizing Indigenous children, rather than adults, {{was the best way}} to influence cultural change. Residential schools focused on imparting industry and knowledge were proposed again in 1845 in a report that had been commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot, entitled Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada. Referred to as the Bagot Report, it is seen as <b>the</b> <b>foundational</b> document for the federal residential school system. It was supported by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies, and Egerton Ryerson, who was then the Chief Superintendent of Education in Upper Canada.|$|E
5|$|The first hospices are {{believed}} to have originated in the 11th century, when {{for the first time the}} terminally ill were permitted into places dedicated to treatment by Crusaders. In the early 14th century, the order of the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem opened the first hospice in Rhodes, meant to provide refuge for travelers and care for the ill and dying. The hospice practice languished until revived in the 17th century in France by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and, later, by the Irish Sisters of Charity, who opened St Joseph's Hospice in London, England in 1902. In the 1950s at St. Joseph's, Cicely Saunders developed many of <b>the</b> <b>foundational</b> principles of modern hospice care. She later founded St Christopher's Hospice in London.|$|E
