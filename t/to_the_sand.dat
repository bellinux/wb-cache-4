5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> tiger shark than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since sand tiger sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large sand tiger shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|E

5|$|The Anzac Mounted Division {{had been}} ordered to cut the road linking Jaffa to Jerusalem by {{capturing}} Ramleh and Ludd. This was the only main road from the coast through Ramleh up the Vale of Ajalon to Jerusalem. During the morning Meldrum's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade crossed the river close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> dunes with 1st Light Horse Brigade on its right. By 09:00 El Kubeibeh had been occupied by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade before pushing on towards the Wadi Hunayn. Here Ottoman rearguards were encountered in the orange groves and on the hills between El Kubeibeh and the sand dunes. About noon the 1st Light Horse Brigade drove an Ottoman rearguard from a ridge facing Yibna where the Anzac Mounted Division had bivouaced {{the night before and}} occupied the village of Rehovot also called Deiran. At the same time the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade fought off a strongly entrenched rearguard at Ayun Kara. After conceding considerable ground the Ottoman soldiers made a vigorous counterattack but were finally defeated.|$|E

25|$|The {{coloured}} sands {{found at}} Rainbow Gorge, The Cathedrals, The Pinnacles and Red Canyon {{are examples of}} where the sand has been stained over thousands of years due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> conglomerating with clay.

25|$|The eel-tailed catfish inhabits {{slow moving}} streams, lakes and ponds with {{fringing}} vegetation. It swims close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> or gravel bottoms. This species is more abundant in lakes than in flowing water. Though {{they are usually}} solitary, juveniles may form aggregations. The eel-tailed catfish is found in most freshwater habitats of the Murray-Darling river system except for the upland, sub-alpine and alpine headwaters of southern tributaries. It is also present in speciated but undescribed forms in several east coast systems in northern New South Wales due to natural river capture events.|$|E
25|$|After excavation, {{hot water}} and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) is added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> and the {{resulting}} slurry is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and the oil skimmed from the top.

The bitumen froth floats {{to the top of}} separation vessels, and is further treated to remove residual water and fine solids.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in February 1799, Bonaparte entered Palestine, first occupying Gaza {{and then}} moving {{north along the}} coastal plain, where {{eventually}} laid siege to Jaffa. Jaffa was defended by al-Jazzar's troops, but they surrendered during the siege in return for French promises {{that they would not}} be killed. However, in custody al-Jazzar's troops were not given food or shelter, and after several days French forces marched them, 3,000 or 4,000 in all, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> dunes of Jaffa's shore and executed them by bayonet over the course of several days. Simultaneous with the execution of al-Jazzar's troops, a plague afflicted Bonaparte's troops, resulting in numerous deaths.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} morning {{of the first day}} of battle, small parties of Indians dashed up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> bar on horseback several times, but they did little damage to the scouts. The scouts killed their horses for breastworks and dug pits into the soft sand behind them. When the scouts opened fire, the Indians {{attacked}} the island on both sides. Later they crawled through the grass and shot through the grass. Several scouts who were killed or wounded were hit by the Indian snipers hidden in the grass. The Indians surrounded the island and repeatedly attacked the Scouts. Three scouts hidden in hole on the riverbank shot several Indians from the shore.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 it was {{set apart}} by the State {{division}} of Fish and Game as a Marine Protected Area, a term used generically to describe any marine area that had {{some or all of}} its resources protected. In Hanauma Bay's case everything became protected, from the fish to the reef, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> itself. A volunteer group set up a booth at the beach and began teaching visitors about conservation of the reef and fish who lived there. More changes in the 1970s by the City cleared more area in the reef for swimming, made an additional parking lot, and shipped in white sand from the North Shore, leaving Hanauma Bay increasingly more attractive to visitors.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made by history, {{environmental}} conditions, auscultation of the ventral abdomen, radiographs, ultrasound, or fecal examination (See Diagnosis). Historically, medical {{treatment of the}} problem is with laxatives such as liquid paraffin or oil and psyllium husk. More recently veterinarians treat cases with specific synbiotic (pro and prebiotic) and psyllium combinations. Psyllium is the most effective medical treatment. It works by binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> to help remove it, although multiple treatments may be required. Mineral oil is mostly ineffective since it floats {{on the surface of the}} impaction, rather than penetrating it. Horses with sand or dirt impaction are predisposed to Salmonella infection and other Gi bacteria, so antibiotics are often added to help prevent infection. Medical management usually resolves the colic, but if improvement doesn't occur within a few hours then surgery must be performed to flush the colon of any sand, which procedure that has a 60–65% survival rate. Horses that are not treated, or treated too late after the onset of clinical signs, are at risk of death.|$|E
25|$|She {{intended}} the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, {{to be the}} last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually went in for the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|The advance {{was taken}} over by the Yeomanry Mounted Division which crossed the railway north of Junction Station, and the Anzac Mounted Division which pressed the {{retreating}} Ottoman Army northwards near the coast. The Anzac Mounted Division had been ordered capture Ramleh and Ludd, and cut the only road linking Jaffa to Jerusalem. During the morning Meldrum's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade crossed the Wadi es Surar/Nahr Rubin close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> dunes with 1st Light Horse Brigade on its right, and by 09:00 had occupied El Kubeibeh. They pushed on towards the Wadi Hunayn where Ottoman rearguards were encountered in the orange groves and on the hills between El Kubeibeh and the sand dunes. About noon the 1st Light Horse Brigade drove an Ottoman rearguard from a ridge facing Yibna and occupied the village of Rehovot also known as Deiran. At the same time the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (commanded by Brigadier General William Meldrum) ran into a determined and well entrenched Ottoman rearguard near Ayun Kara, which they attacked. Fierce close quarter fighting against the Ottoman 3rd Infantry Division continued during the afternoon. Although severely threatened, the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade eventually prevailed and they occupied Jaffa two days later, unopposed. The official New Zealand historian concluded in 1922 that the engagement at Ayun Kara demonstrated the ability of the New Zealand mounted rifles regiments to rapidly attack and reinforce successive positions on horseback. During this intense engagement, the attacking power of the mounted rifle arm, against a strongly entrenched infantry position was comprehensively proven.|$|E
