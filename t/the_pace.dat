40|$|Background: Shensong Yangxin (SSYX), a {{traditional}} Chinese herbal medicine, {{has long been}} used clinically to treat arrhythmias in China. However, the mechanism of SSYX on atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown. In this study, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} effect of SSYX on the progression of paroxysmal AF is correlated with the regulation of autonomic nerve activity. Methods: Eighteen mongrel dogs were randomly divided into control group (n = 6), pacing group (n = 6), and pacing + SSYX group (n = 6). The control group was implanted with pacemakers without pacing; <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> group was implanted with pacemakers with long-term intermittent atrial pacing; <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> + SSYX group underwent long-term intermittent atrial pacing and SSYX oral administration. Results: Compared to <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> group, <b>the</b> parameters of heart rate variability were lower after 8 weeks in <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> + SSYX group (low-frequency [LF] component: 20. 85 ± 3. 14 vs. 15. 3 ± 1. 89 ms 2, P = 0. 004; LF component/high-frequency component: 1. 34 ± 0. 33 vs. 0. 77 ± 0. 15, P < 0. 001). The atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was shorter and the dispersion of the AERP was higher after 8 weeks in <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> group, while <b>the</b> changes were suppressed by SSYX intake. The dogs in <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> group had more episodes and longer durations of AF than that in <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> + SSYX group. SSYX markedly inhibited the increase in sympathetic nerves and upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin- 6 expression in <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> + SSYX group. Furthermore, SSYX suppressed the decrease of acetylcholine and α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor protein induced by long-term intermittent atrial pacing. Conclusions: SSYX substantially prevents atrial electrical remodeling and the progression of AF. These effects of SSYX may have association with regulating the imbalance of autonomic nerve activity and the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{pattern of}} <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> lead/myocardium interface can be simplified as a resistor R with, in parallel, a capacitor C and a resistor r.

5|$|Most of Thistle's {{residents}} were railroad employees sent {{to live in}} the town, but there were some who had settled before the railroads arrived. The first Europeans were part of the Mormon migration to Utah, and the first of these was <b>the</b> <b>Pace</b> family, who migrated from Nauvoo, Illinois, reaching Thistle in 1848. Fifth-generation descendants of <b>the</b> <b>Pace</b> settlers continued to operate a family-owned cattle ranch until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to homestead fertile ground on Billies Mountain, on the north wall of the canyon. Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of the railroads, the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some mining activity in the region, including a vein of asphaltum that was mined between 1892 and 1914.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify how {{myocardial}} perfusion is impaired by asynchronous contraction. Background. False septal hypoperfusion is noted in some patients with left bundle branch block. Methods. Eight dogs were examined with epicardial <b>pacing</b> at <b>the</b> left ventricular posterior wall, the right ventricular anterior wall and, as a control, the right atrial appendage. <b>The</b> <b>pacing</b> rate was 80, 110 and 150 beats/min (bpm). Myocardial perfusion was assessed by contrast echocardiography. Results. Left ventricular pacing at 80 and 110 bpm did not change systolic wall thickening or contrast intensity at <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> site, although an early excitation notch was noted at <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> site. However, at 150 bpm, systolic thickening was impaired (23. 3 ± 4. 2 % vs. 37. 0 ± 2. 6 % during atrial pacing, p < 0. 05), and the peak intensity ratio of <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> site to <b>the</b> ventricular septum was significantly decreased (24. 1 ± 5. 7 % vs. 37. 0 ± 2. 8 % at a pacing rate of 80 bpm, p < 0. 01). The peak intensity ratio correlated with systolic wall thickening at <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> site (y = 0. 413 × − 0. 028, r = 0. 81, p < 0. 0001). However, right ventricular pacing did not change either systolic thickening or the peak intensity ratio at any pacing rate, although an early excitation notch was noted on the ventricular septum. Conclusions. Wall motion abnormalities after early excitation vary depending on <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> mode. When tachycardia induces regional wall motion abnormalities, the ventricular wall of <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> site is functionally hypoperfused. (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 29 : 1632 – 8...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of three electronic apex locators (EAL), electric pulp tester (EPT) and diathermy on pacemaker function in vitro. Materials and Methods: Three EALs: Root ZX (J. Morita Co., Tustin, CA, U. S. A.), Propex (Dentsply), Mini Apex locator (SybronEndo, Anaheim, CA, USA), EPT (Parkell pulp vitality tester Farmingdale, NY, USA) and Diathermy (Neomed 250 B) were tested for any interference with one pacemaker (A medtronic kappa KVDD 901 -serial number: PLE 734632 S). Directly connecting the pacemaker lead with the EAL/EPT/diathermy operating on a flat bench top, the telemetry wand was held directly over the pacemaker to monitor <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> pattern for a period of 30 s. Pacemaker activity was continuously recorded on the telemetric programmer and electro gram (EGM) readings examined for pacer inhibition, noise reversion or inappropriate pacemaker pulses. Results: All the three apex locators showed no pacing interference or background noise during its function or at rest. The EGM readings of EPT showed varying levels of background noise in between pacing however, this did not affect <b>the</b> normal <b>pacing</b> pattern and <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> interval remained constant. EGM readings of diathermy showed an increase in <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> interval (irregular pacing pattern) followed by complete inhibition of <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> system. Conclusion: <b>The</b> tested EALs do not interfere with cardiac pacemaker function. The tested EPT showed varying levels of background noise but does not interfere with cardiac pacemaker function. Use of Diathermy interfered with <b>the</b> normal <b>pacing,</b> leading to complete inhibition of <b>the</b> <b>pacing</b> system...|$|R
