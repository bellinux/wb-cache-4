5|$|In 2015 {{the legacy}} of the crew was brought to the {{forefront}} again when Ryan Goslings new movie 'Lost River' included Bill Aken's (aka Zane Ashton) 1961 hit record of 'He Was A Mean Dragon' as part of the film score. The record featured the early gathering of 'First Call' musician's including Ray Pohlman, Al Casey, Earl Palmer, etc. backing up their youngest member of the group. Glen Campbell volunteered to be the voice of 'The Dragon' on the end of <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>and</b> the interplay between Glen and Bill was hilarious.|$|E
5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>and</b> their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E

5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on <b>the</b> <b>record,</b> <b>and</b> its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what {{make a person}} unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. Take Me Home garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
5|$|The album, {{like their}} {{previous}} record Rings Around the World, was simultaneously released on CD, vinyl and DVD. The DVD featured a surround sound {{mix of the}} album along with animations, commentary by Mario Caldato Jr. (who mixed <b>the</b> <b>record)</b> <b>and</b> remixes. The majority of these remixes were re-released as the album Phantom Phorce in 2004. Phantom Power was well received, with many critics suggesting {{it was the best}} album of the band's career.|$|E

As a whole, the performances {{featured on the}} collection range in year recorded from 1955 to 1989. A condensed version of the box set titled Highlights from Just for the Record was released sometime in 1992. It includes 24 of the songs from Just for <b>the</b> <b>Record...</b> <b>and</b> was priced {{significantly lower than the}} original collection.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the well-preserved rocks of the dry, {{central part of the}} Andes, the record that defines the southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from <b>the</b> <b>record,</b> <b>and</b> concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock.|$|E
5|$|Just Be Free is a demo album {{released}} by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American recording artist Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on The New Mickey Mouse Club, a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera {{the opportunity to}} use a recording studio and presented her with demo music {{with the understanding that}} they could use the material for their own purpose, but also claiming they would not commercially release the recordings. Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>and</b> Just Be Free has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States.|$|E

He then became an assistant producer for On <b>the</b> <b>Record,</b> <b>and</b> in 1993 was promoted to deputy editor of Panorama, a position he held for three years. In 1995, whilst Robinson was at Panorama, he wrote an internal BBC memorandum questioning how an interview with Prime Minister John Major could be defended {{in the run-up to the}} Scottish local elections. When leaked, this gained attention from the Labour Party, which perceived it as the legitimised denial of equal time in the run-up to local elections.|$|E

5|$|Shankar's {{original}} {{hope was}} to raise $25,000 through a benefit concert of his own, compered perhaps by actor Peter Sellers. With Harrison's commitment, and <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>and</b> film outlets {{available to him}} through the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation, the idea soon grew to become a star-studded musical event, mixing Western rock with Indian classical music, and {{it was to be}} held at the most prestigious venue in America: Madison Square Garden, in New York City. According to Chris O'Dell, a music-business administrator and former Apple employee, Harrison got off the phone with Shankar once the concept had been finalised, and started enthusing with his wife, Pattie Boyd, and herself about possible performers. Ringo Starr, Lennon, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Jim Keltner, Voormann, Billy Preston and Badfinger were all mentioned during this initial brainstorming.|$|E
