40|$|Competition law is an {{area which}} is going through changes over time, {{especially}} EC competition law {{in regard to the}} ongoing process of market integration. The definition of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market</b> within EC competition law is of importance to define, both in case law and for undertakings and their businesses, as the law should be predictable. Before Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits abusive behaviour by undertakings, is applicable <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market</b> has to be defined. As is the case with the Merger Regulation, <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market</b> has to be defined to make an assessment of the undertakings’ activities. The definition of the geographic market is then used as a tool in the analysis of the assessment of competition and the effects of measures carried out by undertakings which restrain competition. Thus, the definition of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market</b> is crucial for the purposes of Community competition law. The definition of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market</b> can be said to be an area where “the objective conditions of competition applying to the product in question must be the same for all traders” as established in United Brands. In Deutsche Bahn it was clarified that “ [...] . the definition of the geographical market does not require the objective conditions of competition between traders to be perfectly homogenous”. It is enough if they are similar, therefore areas in which the objective conditions of competition are different, are not considered to be a uniform market. In the Commission Notice on <b>the</b> definition of <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> for <b>the</b> purposes of Community competition law the Commission’s work to define <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market</b> is described as well as the evidence the Commission contemplates in its assessment. The substitutability test is relied on by the Commission. In case law from the European Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance, and the Commission, different factors are scrutinized to establish <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market.</b> Such factors are e. g., the undertakings’ activities, barriers to trade, and barriers to entry. The significance of the evidence and the factors used in the definition of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market</b> are debatable. The factors considered vary on a case to case basis and they need to differ to make a correct assessment of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market</b> in every case within EC competition law...|$|R

50|$|Furthermore, {{many economists}} have noted an {{important}} pitfall {{in the use}} of demand elasticities when inferring both the market power and <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market.</b> The problem arises from the fact that economic theory predicts that any profit-maximizing firm will set its prices at a level where demand for its product is elastic. Therefore, when a monopolist sets its prices at a monopoly level it may happen that two products appear to be close substitutes whereas at competitive prices they are not. In other words, it may happen that using the SSNIP test one defines <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> too broadly, including products which are not substitutes.|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{evaluate}} the degree of competition in the dairy industry, in <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> of Ultra High Temperature (UHT) milk and pasteurized milk, by means of price transmission and marketing margin behavior. The empirical analysis {{is based on the}} model formerly proposed by Houck (1977) and latter detailed by Carman and Sexton (2005). This model analyzes separately the effects of input price increases and reductions on consumer prices, allowing for estimations of price transmission and margin behavior. Cepea-USP and Fipe provide, respectively, weekly input prices and consumer prices, both for the period of December 1999 to December 2005. As a major result, the degree of competition in <b>the</b> UHT <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> was found to be robustly different from the pasteurized milk market. Whereas in the first price transmission corroborates the hypothesis of competitive market, in the pasteurized milk market there is evidence of imperfections both in price transmission and margin behavior. The outstanding increase of UHT milk consumption has fostered competition and liquidity in the dairy industry and milk distribution, allowing for faster price transmission throughout the production chain. Nevertheless fixed markup pricing found in <b>the</b> UHT <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> shows that dairy industry and milk distribution have some degree of market power so as nominal changes in input prices are passed through consumers in a larger magnitude. competition, price transmission, dairy industry., Agribusiness, L 11, Q 13,...|$|R
