5|$|Ebert {{occasionally}} accused some {{films of}} having an unwholesome political agenda, such as claiming that the 1971 film Dirty Harry had a fascist moral position. He was wary of films passed off as art, but which he saw as lurid and sensational. He leveled <b>this</b> <b>charge</b> against such films as The Night Porter.|$|E
5|$|Although characterised at {{the time}} and since as actions against piracy, <b>this</b> <b>charge</b> has been disputed by historians and archivists in the UAE in particular, notably the current Ruler of Sharjah, HH Dr Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi in his book 'The Myth of Arabian Piracy in the Gulf'. The {{counter-argument}} is that the Al Qasimi, a strong and independent maritime force, were the subject of British aggression in an attempt to stamp its authority - and that of its Omani allies - on trade routes thought of as important to Iraq and India.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{the horses}} were nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, {{assembled}} in the reserve, entered the melee, but their light horses were {{no match for the}} French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During <b>this</b> <b>charge,</b> d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E
5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still {{in pursuit of the}} Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. <b>This</b> <b>charge</b> broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E
5|$|Henry had Anne {{investigated}} for high treason in April 1536. On 2 May {{she was arrested}} {{and sent to the}} Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers – which included Henry Percy, her former betrothed, and her own uncle, Thomas Howard – and found guilty on 15 May. She was beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of <b>this</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E
40|$|Charging {{methodology}} is {{one important}} scheme in the deregulated {{environment in the}} way that it can be utilized to recover the investment cost from network users according to their different impact on the network. The long-run incremental cost (LRIC) pricing methodology developed by University of Bath in conjunction with Western Power Distribution (WPD, UK) and Ofgem (the office of gas and electricity markets, UK) has drawn lots of attention from industry and academic circles and found its application in practice. Compared with the existing long-run cost pricing methodologies, <b>this</b> <b>charging</b> model can produce forward-looking charges that reflect both the extent of the network needed to serve the generation/demand {{and the degree to which}} the network is utilized. This paper examines the practical issues concerning implementation of <b>this</b> <b>charging</b> model in order to assist its utilization in the future. Firstly, the calculation and selection of the parameters, load growth rate, contingency factor, asset costs, that would impact charge evaluation are discussed, followed by the focus on some particular issues concerning them. Thereafter, the technical problems which might appear while applying <b>this</b> <b>charging</b> model to large-scale practical systems are dressed and a few feasible solutions are provided. <b>This</b> <b>charging</b> model, at last, is demonstrated on a practical system taken from the U. K. network...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{large-scale}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations, we propose a new charging method {{that should be}} capable of charging a Lithium-ion battery in {{a fraction of the}} time needed when using traditional methods. <b>This</b> <b>charging</b> method uses an additional applied oscillatory electric field. Our simulation results show that <b>this</b> <b>charging</b> method offers a great reduction in the average intercalation time for Li+ ions, which dominates the charging time. The oscillating field not only increases the diffusion rate of Li+ ions in the electrolyte but, more importantly, also enhances intercalation by lowering the corresponding overall energy barrier.

40|$|This work is {{a design}} and {{construction}} solution for an inteligent charger of Li-Ion battery system. The system consists of an accumulator, built out of individual cells (serial-parallel sequence), protective and monitoring circuits and charger with control circuits. These control circuits of <b>this</b> <b>charger</b> collaborate with monitoring circuits. The base of <b>this</b> <b>charger</b> is a switching source (singlemode buck converter with transformer). The charger allows to supply relatively high power while sustaining small dimensions. (20 A with 28 V that´s 560 W) Use of DC/DC converter is a base of charger and also delivers other benefits, such as high efficiency and easy control of output current...|$|R
5|$|As {{the trial}} progressed however, Le Gris' {{testimony}} suffered several blows. The unwavering accusations directed at him by Marguerite and the shame such accusations brought to her were, {{in the eyes}} of the court, a powerful reason why the charges were not invented. Then, even as the trial progressed, one of the men providing Le Gris' alibi, named Jean Beloteau, was arrested in Paris and charged with rape. <b>This</b> <b>charge</b> seriously undermined Beloteau's testimony and Le Gris' defence. Finally, Carrouges himself offered counter-testimony in court that a healthy, strong man with long experience of horsemanship and a stable full of horses like Le Gris could certainly have made the 50mile trip without difficulty, even accounting for the snow.|$|E
5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further {{demanding}} that the League condemn Italy's and Germany's decision to recognise the Nationalists. He pointed {{to the risk of}} the Spanish war spreading, and suggested that the Non-Intervention Committee was ineffective. <b>This</b> <b>charge</b> was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard Viénot, the British and French representatives respectively, who appealed to the League to endorse the mediation plan. The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation. It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee. The mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 1837, Rajendra's {{youngest}} son, Devendra Bikram Shah, {{an infant}} of six months, died suddenly. It {{was at once}} rumored that the child had died of poison intended for his mother the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi Devi: given at the instigation of Bhimsen, or someone of his party. On <b>this</b> <b>charge,</b> Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated. The physicians Ekdev and Eksurya, being Brahmins, were severely tortured but spared, while Bhajuman Baidya was impaled and killed. Under torture, Ekdev confessed, and thus confirmed a widely circulated rumor, that he was directed by Bhimsen to poison not just Devendra, but King Girvan as well.|$|E

5|$|Seydlitz {{rejoined the}} King in 1758 and on 25 August, at the Battle of Zorndorf, Seydlitz's cavalry again secured the victory. He led thirty-six squadrons into {{a mass of}} Russian cavalry mingled with infantry. <b>This</b> <b>charge</b> broke the Russian right wing and sent them running for the woods. At the Prussian debacle at Hochkirch, on 14 October 1758, he covered the Prussian retreat with 108 squadrons, and in the {{disaster}} of Kunersdorf, on 12 August 1759, he received another severe wound in a hopeless attempt to storm a hill held by the Russians; his 8th Cuirassiers {{was one of the}} few intact regiments at the end of the battle. While recuperating in Berlin, he helped organize a defense of the city during the Austro-Russian raid (October 1760). Although he was unable to prevent the Russians from briefly occupying the city, Frederick later praised Seydlitz for his conduct.|$|E
5|$|All figures quoted for {{the losses}} of the cavalry brigades {{as a result}} of <b>this</b> <b>charge</b> are estimates, as {{casualties}} were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole. Some historians, Barbero for example, believe the official rolls tend to overestimate the number of cavalrymen present in their squadrons on the field of battle and that the proportionate losses were, as a result, considerably higher than the numbers on paper might suggest. The Union Brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed (including its commander, William Ponsonby, and Colonel Hamilton of the Scots Greys) and wounded. The 2nd Life Guards and the King's Dragoon Guards of the Household Brigade also lost heavily (with Colonel Fuller, commander of the King's DG, killed). However, the 1st Life Guards, on the extreme right of the charge, and the Blues, who formed a reserve, had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties. On the rolls the official, or paper strength, for both Brigades is given as 2,651 while Barbero and others estimate the actual strength at around 2,000 and the official recorded losses for the two heavy cavalry brigades during the battle was 1,205 troopers and 1,303 horses.|$|E
5|$|Bessières and Nansouty led {{these men}} forward, through {{a hail of}} cannonballs and case-shot, with the carabiniers-à-cheval at the front. Finding a weaker spot in the Austrian line, they pierced it and stormed past the enemy {{infantry}} formed in squares, sabering the Georger Grenzer battalion as they went along their way. However, many of the French cavalry did not manage to penetrate through the formidable masses of Austrian infantry, so Nansouty was now commanding a much diminished force. Showing great skill in handling his men, Nansouty then wheeled right and charged Liechtenstein's artillery line. However, the Austrian cavalry promptly intervened, spearheaded by the Rosenberg chevaulegers and the Kronprinz cuirassier regiments, which caught the carabiniers-à-cheval in flank and repulsed them, pursuing {{them back to their}} lines. The costly repulse of Nansouty's division did not dishearten Bessières, who was preparing another rapid charge, now with the support of elements of the Guard cavalry. <b>This</b> <b>charge</b> never came, as the Marshal's horse was killed by a cannonball, with Bessières also hit and carried unconscious behind the lines. With his commander presumed dead, Nansouty did not know what the Emperor's orders were and thus promptly decided to pull back his men, to avoid further damage to his already battered division.|$|E

40|$|The superconformal {{index is}} an {{important}} invariant of superconformal field theories. In this note we refine the superconformal index by inserting the charge conjugation operator C.
