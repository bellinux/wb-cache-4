40|$|Cochlear implant (CI) {{recipients}} {{suffer from}} the inability to understand speech in adverse listening conditions like reverberant rooms or noisy environments but achieve good speech intelligibility (SI) performance in quiet environments. One approach to increase SI in CI patients is to enhance signal by applying noise reduction techniques or distorting the speech envelope {{in a way to}} improve SI. We follow the latter approach by enhancing <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speech envelope to improve <b>the</b> access <b>of</b> CI users to this acoustical landmarks that were shown to be important for speech understanding in normal – hearing listeners. Therefore, an onset envelope enhancement strategy was developed that amplifies <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speech signal in each frequency band. In this feasibility study, we investigated <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> enhancement by comparing <b>the</b> EE with the reference advanced combined encoder (ACE) strategy with 6 CI users in stationary speech shaped noise (SSN) and in a competitive talker situation. <b>The</b> extraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> is done on the clean speech signal and <b>the</b> amplified <b>onsets</b> are than added to <b>the</b> noisy mixture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal. Hence, a priori knowledge is only used for the peak extraction. Additionally to <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> extraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target speaker signal, <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competitive talker were also extracted from the clean interfering talker signal for the competitive talker task. Results of subjective listening tests with the Dutch LIST sentences showed an increase in speech intelligibility in comparison to the ACE strategy for all CI users in stationary SSN. An alaysis with a repeated measures ANOVA revealed that a significant effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factor strategy occurred. There were no other significant main or interaction effects obtained. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competitive talker task, where a female speaker was used as a target speaker and a male as interfering speaker, showed an increase in the speech reception threshold for three different <b>onset</b> enhanced conditions: <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target speaker, <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target and interfering speaker,and <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noisy mixture enhanced. The increase in SI demonstrated <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> cues for CI listeners on SI in adverse listening conditions. Due to the fact that <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> extraction was done on the clean speech signal, further research has to be done to extract <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> cues from <b>the</b> noisy mixture to make the algorithm applicable in noise. The competitive talker situation results suggest that there is a margin for errors in <b>the</b> <b>onset</b> extraction and enhancing the contrast to some extend between the target signal and the background is sufficient to increase SI. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Models of {{connected}} speech {{production in}} Mandarin Chinese must specify how lexical tone, speech segments, and phrase-level prosody are integrated in speech production. This study used tongue twisters to test predictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two different models of word form encoding. Tongue twisters were constructed from 5 sets of characters that rotated pairs of initial segments or pairs of tones, or both, across format (ABAB, ABBA), and across position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters in four-character tongue twister strings. Fifty two native Mandarin Chinese speakers read aloud 120 tongue twisters, repeating each one {{six times in}} a row. They made a total of 3503 (2. 34 %) segment errors and 1372 (. 92 %) tone errors. Segment errors occurred on <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first and third characters in the ABBA but not ABAB segment-alternating tongue twisters, and on <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second and fourth characters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tone-alternating tongue twisters.
