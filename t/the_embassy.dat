5|$|The Office of Military Cooperation, {{just one}} and a half blocks from <b>the</b> <b>embassy,</b> {{required}} evacuation. Despite its proximity to <b>the</b> <b>embassy,</b> an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest. A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and SEALs left <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> at 8:47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the OMC (four Americans, a Filipino, and 17 Kenyans). This was the only excursion outside <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> by the security detail. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats contacted <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> desiring to be evacuated; the US welcomed these requests, but required all of them to find their own transportation to <b>the</b> <b>embassy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Armed looters were {{observed}} entering <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> compound {{as the final}} wave departed. The doors of the chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by RPGs within two hours of the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of Somalia. Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> {{with their families and}} about 30 were hired as guards and protected <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> throughout the ordeal. Local banks had been closed for some time and <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had gathered around <b>the</b> <b>Embassy,</b> while some 2,500 evacuees were in <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use of buses for transporting evacuees from <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> to the DAO Compound for evacuation and <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible evacuees now had to make themselves known to the Marine guards or Embassy staff manning the walls and were then lifted over the walls and into <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> compound. Among those arriving at <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare and refugee resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E

5|$|Inside <b>the</b> <b>Embassy,</b> the {{evacuees}} {{had found}} whatever space was available inside <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> compound and evacuees and some staff proceeded to take alcohol from the Embassy's stores.

5|$|No threats {{came upon}} <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> during the day, {{although}} truckloads of armed Somalis frequently drove by <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> along Afghoy Road. Only one incident seemed to directly target <b>the</b> <b>embassy.</b> A sniper and a spotter were positioned on the embassy's water tower (the highest {{structure in the}} compound) and came under fire; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower.|$|E

5|$|At Nhu's request, Tung was {{reported}} to have been planning an operation under the cover of a government-organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy, Saigon.

Another target was the Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang, who had been given asylum in <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> after being targeted in the pagoda raids.

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{negotiations}} in the U.S. embassy, Chen did not request asylum in the United States or considered leaving China, but instead demanded to remain {{there as a}} free man. However, soon after leaving <b>the</b> <b>embassy,</b> Chen feared that Chinese authorities would renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members. While in the hospital, Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him. Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> by threatening his family. U.S. negotiators stated that while in <b>the</b> <b>embassy,</b> Chen {{had been told by}} Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States, his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong. However, they maintained that they had not heard of the threats from local officials that his family would be beaten, and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen. On 3 May, Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving <b>the</b> <b>embassy,</b> and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China.|$|E

Two LZs were now available in <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> compound, the rooftop for UH-1s and CH-46 Sea Knights and the new parking lot LZ for the heavier CH-53s. Air America UH-1s began ferrying evacuees from other smaller assembly points throughout the city and dropping them on the Embassy's rooftop LZ. At 15:00 the first CH-53s were sighted heading towards the DAO Compound at Tan Son Nhut. Major Kean contacted the Seventh Fleet to advise them of his airlift requirements, until that time the fleet believed that all evacuees had been bussed from <b>the</b> <b>Embassy</b> to the DAO Compound and that only two helicopters {{would be required to}} evacuate Ambassador Martin and the Marines from <b>the</b> <b>Embassy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> several years earlier. Plans for entering <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January, several incidents, {{including}} a couple exchanges of gunfire, {{suggested that the}} embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers, at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January. <b>The</b> <b>embassy</b> had just six Marine guards, whose job was limited to protecting the chancery. Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> to defend it until the ships arrived. The request was denied, but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> the following morning.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 January, a 60-person Marine and Navy SEAL {{security}} detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters to secure <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> and prepare for the main evacuation.

Throughout the day, foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at <b>the</b> <b>embassy.</b> Four waves of five CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> compound shortly after midnight on 6 January. The evacuees were transported to Muscat, Oman, where they disembarked on 11 January. In total, 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated, including 12 heads of missions (eight ambassadors and four chargés d'affaires).|$|E
5|$|Police {{arrived at}} <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> almost {{immediately}} after the first reports of gunfire, and, within ten minutes, seven DPG officers were on the scene. The officers moved to surround <b>the</b> <b>embassy,</b> but retreated when a gunman appeared at a window and threatened to open fire. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Dellow arrived nearly 30 minutes later and took command of the operation. Dellow established a temporary headquarters in his car before moving it to the Royal School of Needlework further down Princes Gate and then to 24 Princes Gate, a nursery school. From his various command posts, Dellow coordinated the police response, including the deployment of D11, the Metropolitan Police's marksmen, and officers with specialist surveillance equipment. Police negotiators made contact with Oan via a field telephone passed through one of <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> windows, and were assisted by a negotiator and a psychiatrist. At 15:15 Oan issued the DRFLA's first demand, the release of 91 Arabs held in prisons in Khūzestān, and threatened to blow up <b>the</b> <b>embassy</b> and the hostages if this were not done by noon on 1 May.|$|E
