This kind of chassis is {{commonly}} used in open cast mines for mobile <b>transfer</b> <b>conveyor</b> or for bucket wheel excavators. In each machine the chassis consist of 6 to 12 caterpillar tracks, which some are steered. Existing models used for analytical calculations are based on simplified relations taken from quasistatic equations of stability and geometrical connections. The complex research was conducted on mobile <b>transfer</b> <b>conveyor,</b> which is used in open cast mine. The aim of measurements was to identify the value of force that acts on elements of chassis during the steering and driving the machine. The measurements were taken during the drive in different directions, with different positions of center of gravity.

40|$|As {{discrete}} element modelling (DEM) {{becomes more}} widely {{used as a}} design tool, its suitability to modelling belt conveyor applications including <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> and <b>conveyor</b> trajectories is becoming more recognised. The accuracy of the data inputted for both the system geometry and particle perspective are vital if the outputs obtained from DEM simulations are to be considered valid.

This paper focuses on two such parameters; coefficient of rolling friction and shear modulus. A series of sensitivity analyses have been undertaken to determine the impact of varying the values for these parameters on the final outcomes of DEM simulations. These simulation outcomes will be compared to experimentally measured data from conveying iron ore through a <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> research facility which has been commissioned at the University of Wollongong...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} factor {{in the design of}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> is the ability for material to flow at a velocity as close to that of the conveyor belt as possible. If particle velocity increases too much issues such as particle attrition, dust generation, chute wear and excessive noise can arise, whereas if particle velocity were to decrease, stagnation zones could develop, resulting in issues such as spillage or chute blockage. There are numerous methods available in which to analyse particle flow through a <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer,</b> including; continuum based analytical methods, the discrete element method (DEM) and experimental analysis. This paper will detail the validation process for these three methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if either analytical methods or numerical discrete element modelling could be used with accuracy to design <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers.</b> This goal was achieved using two test materials, polyethylene pellets and corn, which were selected for their different particle and bulk properties and also for a third product, iron ore, but to a lesser extent due to test rig limitations. The design of <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> has traditionally been based on either trial and error or previous experience and seen as a “black art” rather than a science, as such very few design guides are available. The design of <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> can be based on experimental investigations, although this method can be costly to companies, taking vital resources away from the key goal of continuous production. The analytical models have existed for some time and have become widely accepted design tools; however, there is limited validation of these to determine their overall performance (both advantages and disadvantages). The analytical models are two dimensional in application and their accuracy with respect to the three dimensional nature of transfer chutes is not clear. This is an area which needs further investigation. The design of transfer chutes has undergone an evolution since the advent of discrete element modelling (DEM) as well as increases in computer processing power. The potential to simulate and predict the behaviour of a transfer chute design before it is constructed can be highly desirable with the prospect of saving substantial time and money. This being said, there has been little validation published on the application of DEM in industrial applications, although in recent years this has started to increase with the realisation that companies need to be convinced this is a legitimate design tool. Additional DEM validation is warranted with respect to <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers.</b> An experimental test program was undertaken following the design and commissioning of a novel <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> research facility. This experimental work focussed on two main areas; investigation of particle flow of material through a <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> hood and spoon and the generation of conveyor trajectories. From these areas, ‘real’ data was obtained for a range of granular free-flowing products, using a combination of high-speed video capture and still photography, for the purposes of validation. The effect of belt speed, material feed rate and the positioning of the transfer hood and spoon were considered in these investigations. Additional to this experimental work was the testing and collection {{of a wide range of}} particle and system characteristics for use in the analytical modelling and discrete element modelling components of this research. Two analytical models were then used to predict the particle flow of the test materials through the <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> hood and spoon. Belt speed, material feed rate and positioning of the transfer hood and spoon were all considered as part of this analysis to provide direct comparisons with the data obtained from the experimental testing. Prediction of the conveyor trajectories was performed using seven trajectory models available in the literature. These comparisons investigated the effect of belt speed and mass flow rate on the trajectory profiles, again providing a direct link with the experimental data. The discrete element method was used to generate three dimensional simulations of the material flow through the <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> hood and spoon and also conveyor trajectories, based on 3 D CAD models of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> research facility. These simulation outputs were then compared to both the experimental data and data obtained from the analytical models. Two software packages were used, Chute MavenTM and EDEM. Chute MavenTM was used to produce the initial transfer chute and trajectory simulations using spherical particles. High material feed rates corresponding to those tested experimentally could not be simulated and so EDEM was employed to develop further simulations. The fact that EDEM has the ability to model both spherical and shaped (clustered) particles was utilised to investigate the effect of shape on simulation output. A critical aspect of any discrete element modelling is whether the outputs are realistic. To minimise any potential issues, a wide range of bench-scale calibration experiments and simulations were also completed to validate both DEM packages used. It can be concluded that the analytical models for <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> provided close approximations from a two dimensional perspective, however, there were some slight over-predictions evident in some situations. For conveyor trajectories, the models presented a substantial variation in prediction, however, one method stood out as being accurate under all conditions for the materials tested experimentally. Findings from the discrete element modelling showed the dynamic behaviour mimics that of the experimental testing and there was a general agreement with both the experimental investigations and analytical models for the <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> comparisons. With respect to conveyor trajectories, the DEM results agreed with the results seen experimentally and also predicted the same trajectory path as the one “stand out” analytical trajectory method mentioned above. The importance of DEM calibration and validation has also been documented and shown to be an absolute necessity in the successful simulation of industrial applications...|$|R

A benefit of a rock box over other transfer types (e. g. soft loading chutes and impact plates) is their ability to capture material {{in such a way that}} it is only the initial feed of material which contacts chute walls or liners, with build-up of material creating a dominance of particle-particle interactions, thus reducing wear of the system and hence cost.

40|$|From {{transportation}} of bulk materials in underground and open-cut mines to applications in power stations and processing plants to name but a few, belt conveyors {{are widely used}} as an economical continuous conveying method. Most of these industries rely strongly on <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> to divert material from one conveyor to another {{at some point in}} their system. The unfortunate reality is that some companies will be driven by cost minimisation for the short-term rather than planning for the long-term. This will result in bad decisions being made and the incorrect <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> being installed with flow-on effects such as downtime for modifications or even replacement. There are many facets to the design of a successful transfer chute including minimising product impact, degradation, chute wear, noise, dust and spillage while maximising the material velocity to allow the product to leave the chute at or near the speed of the receiving conveyor. Fully understanding the behaviour of a material is paramount to designing a successful transfer chute. Accurately determining the material discharge and trajectory from the head pulley is the first step in this design process. This paper will focus on the determination of the material trajectory as it leaves the belt conveyor head pulley. This process will also determine the point at which the material leaves the belt, referred to as the discharge angle. There are numerous methods available in the literature focusing on the modelling of material discharge and trajectory, including C. E. M. A. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], M. H. E. A.
