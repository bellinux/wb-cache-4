Ginsburg developed adult education and young singles programs, and improved standards in the synagogue's children's education programs. Geoffrey Goldberg followed him as rabbi from 1987 to 1988.|$|E
5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{flanked by}} areas prone to {{flooding}} between <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> enters Schuylkill County and its mouth. The tributary Stony Run also flows through some areas prone to flooding and a few areas near Trexler Run are susceptible to flooding as well.

5|$|The armed forces' third arm, the Liberian National Coast Guard, was {{established}} in 1959. Throughout the Tubman period the coastguard {{was little more than}} a few sometimes unserviceable patrol craft manned by ill-trained personnel, though its training improved in the 1980s to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was considered the best trained of the armed services.|$|E
5|$|Carrols Corporation {{was founded}} in 1960 as a {{franchisee}} of the Tastee Freeze Company's Carrols Restaurants division by Herb Slotnick under the name Carrols Drive-In Restaurants of New York, and by 1968 the company had grown to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> purchased the chain from Tastee Freeze. By 1974 Carrols owned and operated over 150 Carrols Club restaurants in the Northeast United States and abroad. In 1975 the company entered into a franchise agreement with Burger King and converted its existing Carrols restaurants in the US into BK locations, closed those stores that {{were not able to}} be updated and sold off its international operations.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E
5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again {{this is due to}} the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first practical jet engines in the late-World War II period led to calls for new jet-powered versions of practically every aircraft then flying. Among these was {{the design of a}} replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito, at that time among the world's leading light bombers. The Mosquito had been designed with the express intent of lightening the aircraft in order to improve its speed as much as possible, a process that led to the removal of all defensive armament, improving performance to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was unnecessary anyway. This high-speed approach was extremely successful, and a jet-powered version would be even more difficult to intercept.|$|E

5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output {{of only a handful of}} canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E

5|$|Like their German counterparts, Soviet {{divisions}} {{were also}} seriously understrength. For example, {{divisions in the}} 40th Army averaged 3,500–4,000 men each, while the 69th Army fielded some divisions which could only count on 1,000–1,500 soldiers. Some divisions had as little as 20–50 mortars to provide fire support. This shortage in manpower and equipment led Vatutin's Southwestern Front to request over 19,000 soldiers and 300 tanks, while {{it was noted that}} the Voronezh Front had only received 1,600 replacements since the beginning of operations in 1943. By the time Manstein launched his counteroffensive, the Voronezh Front had lost so much manpower and had overextended itself to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> could no longer offer assistance to the Southwestern Front, south of it.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Jefferson's presidency, the United States {{had paid}} tribute {{to a number of}} Arab states in the Mediterranean to prevent attacks on its shipping. By the time Jefferson assumed office, the United States Navy had been {{developed}} to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> might adequately defend American shipping interests. Jefferson consequently refused to pay tribute in 1801 to Yusuf Karamanli, the ruler of Tripoli, after which the Tripolitans began attacking and seizing American merchant vessels. In a cabinet discussion held in early 1801 to formulate a response, it was suggested that the President declare war on Tripoli. Lincoln pointed out that only Congress had the authority to declare war, {{but the rest of the}} cabinet was intent on taking some sort of action. The matter was tabled until May 1801, when the cabinet voted to send a naval squadron to the area to defend the country's merchant interests. Jefferson never asked for or received from Congress a formal war declaration against the Barbary states.|$|E
5|$|The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran A178, foundered on the Ve Skerries 3miles {{northwest}} of Papa Stour, {{on the evening}} of 28 March 1930 while {{on her way to the}} village of Scalloway to land her catch. When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw, and reported the wreck. By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers (there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time), weather conditions had deteriorated to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was impossible to approach the skerries. A request had been made for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney, only 120miles away, to launch, but the request was made too late to be of help. All 9 crew perished in the wreck. Only 3 bodies were recovered, that of James Mitchell, which was returned to Aberdeen, and the bodies of J. Cormack and J.R. Insh, which were buried in Scalloway.|$|E
50|$|Benedicaria is Italian Folk Catholicism that, in its purest form, is {{completely}} {{in line with}} the teachings of the Catholic Church.
