5|$|In December 1887, Woodford {{contracted}} septicaemia from an untreated foot injury. He died on 23 December. He {{is seen as}} {{a pioneer}} of the Authentic school of masonic research, applying proper historical methodology in place of carelessly repeated fable. He earnestly collected and studied early masonic manuscripts, writing the introduction for Hughan's published collection. He contributed greatly <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enigmatic history of the York lodges in the eighteenth century. His lasting legacy may be seen in the continued activity and influence of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and the rational approach to masonic history.|$|E
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Maiden Castle has {{provided}} inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John Cowper Powys. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. In the 1930s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations {{were carried out}} under Niall Sharples, which added <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site and repaired damage caused {{in part by the}} large number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is maintained by English Heritage.|$|E

At the same time, he also associated with like-minded scholar officials, with whom he regularly exchanged ideas on philosophy and literary modes. He preferred guwen (Ancient Prose) from an early age.

25|$|Czartoryski was {{disappointed}} when his hopes held {{as late as}} the Congress of Vienna, that Alexander's might undertake reforms, failed to materialize. His subsequent thoughts were distilled in a book, completed in 1827 but published only in 1830, Essai sur la diplomatie (Essay on Diplomacy). This book, according to the historian Marian Kamil Dziewanowski, is indispensable <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prince's many activities conducted in Paris following the ill-fated Polish November 1830 Uprising. Czartoryski wanted to find a place for Poland in the Europe of the time. He sought to interest western Europeans in the adversities facing his stateless nation which he still considered to be an indispensable part of the European political structure.|$|E

500|$|Central <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painting, {{as well as}} {{the entire}} series, is the {{relationship}} the Brancaccis and the city of Florence had with the papacy in Rome. Florence was at the time at war with Milan, and needed the support of the Pope. The Brancacci frescos must therefore be seen {{in the context of a}} pro-papal policy, and as an attempt to legitimise the Roman see through its association with Saint Peter [...] the first bishop of Rome, and first pope.|$|E
500|$|According to Sarmiento, these {{elements}} are crucial <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Argentine Revolution, in which Argentina gained independence from Spain. Although Argentina’s war of independence {{was prompted by}} the influence of European ideas, Buenos Aires was the only city that could achieve civilization. Rural people participated in the war to demonstrate their physical strengths rather than {{because they wanted to}} civilize the country. [...] In the end, the revolution was a failure because the barbaric instincts of the rural population led to the loss and dishonor of the civilized cityBuenos Aires.|$|E
500|$|Sometime between 1869 and 1874, Jaussen {{worked with}} Metoro to {{decipher}} {{four of the}} tablets in his possession: A Tahua, B Aruku kurenga, C Mamari, and E Keiti. A list of the glyphs they identified was published posthumously, along with a complete account of the chants for A and B. This is the famous Jaussen list. Though at first taken for a Rosetta Stone of rongorongo, it has not led <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> script. It has been criticized for, among other inadequacies, glossing five glyphs as [...] "porcelain", a material not found on Easter Island. However, this is a mistranslation: Jaussen glossed the five glyphs as , French for both [...] "cowrie" [...] and the cowrie-like Chinese ceramic which is called porcelain in English. Jaussen's Rapanui gloss, pure, means specifically [...] "cowrie".|$|E

500|$|Soon after, Johanna Weber and Dietrich Küchemann at the RAE {{published}} {{a series of}} reports on a new wing planform, known in the UK as the [...] "slender delta" [...] concept. The team, including Eric Maskell whose report [...] "Flow Separation in Three Dimensions" [...] contributed <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical nature of separated flow, worked with the fact that delta wings can produce strong vortexes on their upper surfaces at high angles of attack. The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by Chuck Yeager in the Convair XF-92, but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.|$|E
500|$|Authors such as Keith Critchlow {{argue that}} Islamic {{patterns}} are created {{to lead the}} viewer <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying reality, rather than being mere decoration, as writers interested only in pattern sometimes imply. David Wade states that [...] "Much {{of the art of}} Islam, whether in architecture, ceramics, textiles or books, is the art of decoration – which is to say, of transformation." [...] Wade argues that the aim is to transfigure, turning mosques [...] "into lightness and pattern", while [...] "the decorated pages of a Qur’an can become windows onto the infinite." [...] Against this, Doris Behrens-Abouseif states in her book Beauty in Arabic Culture that a [...] "major difference" [...] between the philosophical thinking of Medieval Europe and the Islamic world is exactly that the concepts of the good and the beautiful are separated in Arabic culture. She argues that beauty, whether in poetry or in the visual arts, was enjoyed [...] "for its own sake, without commitment to religious or moral criteria".|$|E
500|$|Drax is {{physically}} abnormal, as {{are many of}} Bond's later adversaries. He has very broad shoulders, a large head and protruding teeth with diastema; his face is badly scarred from a wartime explosion. According to the writers Kingsley Amis and Benson—both of whom subsequently wrote Bond novels—Drax is the most successful villain in the Bond canon. Amis considers this to be [...] "because the most imagination and energy has gone into his portrayal. He lives in the real world... his physical presence fills Moonraker. The view is shared by Chancellor, who considers Drax [...] "perhaps the most believable" [...] of all Fleming's villains. The cultural historian Jeremy Black writes that as with Le Chiffre and Mr Big—the villains {{of the first two}} Bond novels—Drax's origins and war history are vital <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character. Like several other antagonists in the Bond canon, Drax was German, reminding readers of a familiar threat in 1950s Britain. Because Drax is without a girlfriend or wife he is, according to the norms of Fleming and his works, abnormal in Bond's world.|$|E
