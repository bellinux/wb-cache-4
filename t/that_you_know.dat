I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E

25|$|Davidson's work is {{well noted}} for its unity, as he has brought a similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E
25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

500|$|The BBC {{commissioned}} a second series {{based on the}} studio audience reactions during recordings. As development on series two had reached a relatively late stage when the first had received negative reviews upon transmission, {{it was too late}} to cancel the production. The cast and crew, then, had to work on a show which they knew was widely disliked. Moffat reflects on the experience: [...] "There's no feeling on earth like working on a show <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> is doomed and already tanking." ...|$|E

Egoyan {{assembled}} many Canadian actors he had worked with in prior films, including Bruce Greenwood, Gabrielle Rose and Sarah Polley. Egoyan explained the benefit of working with a familiar cast, saying [...] "When you’re working on a limited production schedule, it’s a comfort to know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the personalities involved, {{you know what they}} need as opposed to having to discover that and be surprised by that." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the film}} leaves it mysterious, early script drafts {{made clear that}} HAL's {{breakdown}} is triggered by authorities on Earth who order him to withhold information from the astronauts about {{the purpose of the}} mission (this is also explained in the film's sequel 2010). Frederick Ordway, Kubrick's science advisor and technical consultant, stated that in an earlier script Poole tells HAL there is [...] "...something about this mission that we weren't told. Something {{the rest of the crew}} knows and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> We would like to know whether this is true", to which HAL responds: [...] "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know." [...] HAL then falsely predicts a failure of the hardware maintaining radio contact with Earth (the source of HAL's difficult orders) during the broadcast of Frank Poole's birthday greetings from his parents.|$|E
500|$|Jackson Benson {{believes}} Hemingway used autobiographical {{details as}} framing devices {{about life in}} general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E
500|$|Joyner {{stated the}} episode uses [...] "the {{idea of having}} what the viewers are led to believe as reality exposed as a sham". Alexander affirmed this could be {{interpreted}} as questioning [...] "the assumptions we bring to the things we see – we can capture nearly any issue from all angles and pin it to virtual glass forever, but still only own a piece of the story, the unknowable remainder filled in by our own preconceptions". Alasdair Stuart of Bleeding Cool commented it [...] "builds on this idea of the reflection <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> is fake but can't look away from and internalizes it". With the plot twist, Stuart said, [...] "we're shown exactly what's been a reflection of the truth all along; everything". He also affirmed it questions [...] "our own fundamental need to be the hero or heroine of our own story".|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News, Beyoncé talked {{about the meaning of}} the song: [...] "It basically talks about how a guy inspires you... You want to make him happy and you want to cater to him.

[...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from Destiny Fulfilled. It was first released in the US as an extended play (EP) consisting of the audio version of the song along with four remixes on June 14, 2005. On July 19 another EP was released containing the original version and six remixes. Six days later an extended play of the single was released in Italy.

500|$|Stewart served {{not only}} as host {{but also as a}} writer and {{executive}} producer of the series. [...] He recalls that he initially struggled with the Kilborn holdover writers to gain control of the show and put his own imprint on the show's voice, a struggle that led to the departure of a number of the holdover writers. Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of The Onion Ben Karlin who, along with fellow Onion contributor David Javerbaum, joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things [...] " [...] to take shape". Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, [...] "The main thing, for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> they don't believe." ...|$|E
500|$|Another game mode {{included}} in Backbreaker is the mini-game [...] "Tackle Alley." [...] In this game, the player controls {{a running back}} who starts in their own endzone. The player then attempts to score a touchdown by running up the field and evading a wave of defenders to score points. Special moves such as jukes and spins create a [...] "combo chain," [...] which multiply the player's score by an amount depending {{on the length of}} the combo chain. After a player scores, they advance to the next wave of defenders and must repeat the process. If a player is tackled before reaching the endzone, they must start over the wave and lose a [...] "life." [...] The game ends when all of the player's lives are depleted or the player passes all 100 of the waves, which become harder as the mode progresses. According to NaturalMotion, only 0.88 percent of all Backbreaker players have managed to clear all 100 levels of [...] "Tackle Alley." [...] Game producer Rob Donald states that the mini-game was meant to add an arcade feel to the game. [...] "It {{was meant to be a}} complete diversion from the more realistic main game, a complete arcade challenge...Everything about it was meant to replicate the pressure and the frustration of playing a cabinet <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> is stacked against you," [...] said Donald in an interview.|$|E
