5|$|In the Republic of India, a {{governor}} is the constitutional head {{of each of}} the twenty-nine states. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>is</b> appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>is</b> de jure head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name.

Over the years, the exercise of these discretionary powers have given rise to conflict between the elected chief minister and the central government–appointed governor.|$|E
