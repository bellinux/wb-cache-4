40|$|The article {{contains}} a welfare economic analysis of <b>road</b> <b>transport's</b> external effects. First, we discuss the definition of external effects. Applying this definition, it is concluded that <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> activities {{give rise to a}} wide range of external costs. However, there are no external benefits associated with individual <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> activities which might compensate for such effects. Therefore, <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> volumes will in general be beyond the optimal levels. Second, we describe a conceptual framework for the analysis of environmental external costs. It is explicitly recognized that not only the externality as such, but also the induced outlays on defensive and abatement activities should play an important role in welfare economic analyses of external effects. Then, this framework is used for the evaluation of the existing empirical work on <b>road</b> <b>transport's</b> environmental external costs (i. e., noise and air pollution). It is concluded that most of the studies carried out in that field will provide an underestimation of <b>road</b> <b>transport's</b> external costs by definition. Finally, some attention is paid to empirical estimates of <b>road</b> <b>transport's</b> accident costs. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose- The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the role of <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in logistics operations, and to investigate and analyze how IKEA China does operate on <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in logistics operations. Design/methodology/approach- A single case study has been conducted at IKEA China, including semi-structured interviews and review of internal documents. Along with the case study, literature reviews have been conducted within the areas of efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in logistics operations.   Findings- The IKEA China case suggests that the logistics operations should have strong link to the efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in a manner optimized logistics operations can provide efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> with less cost.   Research limitations/implications- This thesis is limited to one representative company, and the authors just focus on a study of efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in logistics operations for narrowing down the thesis. So the solutions and proposals about efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> might not be adopted by other companies or be applied {{to other parts of the}} supply chain. Additionally, a study of efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> can be discussed, analyzed and studied from a lot of different perspectives, even much better in a holistic viewpoint. Here, the authors just choose a few primary perspectives as research objectives to support this study, which concerns the data and information collected from IKEA China. Finally, because of the limitation of time and personal knowledge, the data collected from IKEA China may neither abundant enough nor deep enough in a manner without exploiting and expanding into all the issues and challenges refers to efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in logistics operations.   Practical implication- This research provides suitable solutions for a company towards efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in logistics operations. Consequently, it will facilitate companies to achieve the purpose of efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> by optimizing their logistics operations in a manner improve the outcomes of insouring/outsourcing, merge-in-transit, consolidation point and packaging.   Originality/value- This research combines five theoretical fields in terms of sourcing strategy, merge-in-transit, consolidation point, packaging as well as economics scale of trucking cost to contribute proposals to efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in logistics operations.   Keywords Efficient <b>road</b> <b>transport,</b> Logistics operations, cos...|$|R
