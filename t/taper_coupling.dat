Optical fiber coupled to a resonator consists in a mini disc with whispering gallery modes at its circumference. We choose to work with three materials and design compact miniresonators. Fused silica is found to be suitable for these applications thanks to its hardness in the range 6 - 7 and the behavior to mechanical shocks, despite its sensitivity to water pollution.

40|$|Trapping {{and cooling}} {{macroscopic}} objects using light has attracted great interest recently {{as it may}} enable us to see quantum mechanical features in large systems. A microsphere pendulum is one such system to put it to test. This thesis work is devoted to solving many of the steps necessary for future trapping and cooling works of a microsphere pendulum using a whispering gallery mode (WGM) cavity-based photonic molecule scheme. In the course of implementing this scheme, microcavity devices, such as microspheres and microbubbles were studied for topics as diverse as optomechanics, photonics, laser tuning and spectroscopy. The WGMs in the microsphere pendulum sense its mechanical mode through fibre <b>taper</b> <b>coupling</b> of light. Its properties in the evanescent light fields and its optomechanical transduction characteristics were investigated. This system is highly dissipative - a feature which {{could prove to be}} very useful for cavity cooling applications. Owing to its pressure tuning capability, a microbubble cavity {{can be used as a}} means of finding co-resonances as needed to achieve a photonic molecule and mode splitting. By locking a laser to a WGM of a microbubble resonator, linear tuning and stability characteristics of the WGM via pressure were studied. A fast method of sensing and estimation of dissipation and dispersion individually in an optomechanical system with minimal invasion was required. In this regard, cavity-ringup spectroscopy (CRUS) was investigated by simply measuring the peak height of the CRUS signal, enabling ultrafast sensing applications. Finally, a coupled, two cavity system, known as a photonic molecule, was studied for its optomechanical transduction properties in CMIT, ATS and their intermediate regimes making way for understanding the trapping capabilities of such a system. The range of studies in this thesis also illustrate the versatility of WGM-based resonators in optics measurements extending from fundamental optomechanics to applied photonics...|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies {{optical fiber}} <b>taper</b> <b>coupled</b> {{dielectric}} microsphere resonators and their applications. Fundamental properties including ideal coupling and critical coupling in an optical fiber taper to fused silica glass microsphere coupling system is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A symmetrical dual-taper coupling configuration is proposed to obtain highly efficient power transfer from the taper coupler to the microsphere resonator. Applications as channel add/drop filters and microsphere lasers are also demonstrated. The physical {{essence of the}} fiber taper to silica microsphere is analyzed using a two-dimensional model. The relationship between the coupling strength and the cavity loss is unveiled. Adiabatic tapers and high-quality microspheres are fabricated and used to demonstrate actual coupling systems. Perfect agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical prediction is presented. Power transfer from the taper to a microsphere resonator has been significantly improved by employing a dual-taper symmetrically coupling configuration. Up to - 28 dB extinction at the central resonant wavelength has been measured. We then propose a device application of the taper-sphere-taper structure as a channel add/drop filter in the wavelength division multiplexing systems. For a filter with a bandwidth of 3. 8 GHz and a dropping channel isolation of 26 dB, the bit-error-rate measurement shows no power penalty at 2. 5 Gbit/s. A 1. 5 µm wavelength single-frequency fiber laser is also demonstrated using a single <b>tapered</b> fiber <b>coupling</b> to a highly doped erbium:ytterbium phosphate glass microsphere. The fiber taper serves the dual purpose of transporting optical pump power into the sphere and extracting the resulting laser emission. As low as 60 µW pump threshold and fiber-coupled output power as high as 3 µW with single mode operation are obtained. Imaging of photoluminescence from the sphere at visible wavelengths reveals the pump power is resonantly coupled into semiclassical orbits due to the strong absorption damping in the phosphate glass. A bi-sphere laser system consisting of two microspheres attached to a single fiber taper is also demonstrated. Finally, a novel hybrid fiber taper, made {{from a combination of}} a 980 nm single mode fiber and a 1550 nm single mode fiber, is proposed and demonstrated as the micros ph ere laser coupler. Both the pump wave and laser emission are found to be more efficiently coupled to and from, respectively, the sphere modes.

Well defined photonic structures families in the sub-micrometer range obtained by this deep UV-light process are clearly confirmed through scanning electron microscopy. In order to evaluate and quantify {{the efficiency of the}} sub-micrometer coupling, the recirculation of the light {{and the quality of the}} optical resonance aspects, a global study including top view intensity imaging, spectral measurements and Fast Fourier Transform analysis is performed for all these devices based on single and multiple family resonators.

Closed form expressions for the propagator and the coupling efficiency of symmetrically tapered graded-index waveguide sections are presented in this thesis for the first time. The tapered waveguide geometries considered are the general power-law geometry, the linear, parabolic, inverse-square-law, and exponential tapers. Closed form expressions describing the propagation of a centred Gaussian beam in these tapers have also been derived. The approximate propagator of two parallel, coupled graded-index waveguides has also been derived in closed form. An expression for the beat length of this system of coupled waveguides has also been obtained for the cases of strong and intermediate strength coupling. The propagator of two coupled waveguides with a variable spacing was also obtained in terms of an unknown function specified by a second order differential equation with simple boundary conditions. The technique of path integration is finally used to study wave propagation in a number of dielectric media whose refractive index has a random component. A refractive index model of this type is relevant to dielectric waveguides formed using a process of diffusion, and is thus of interest in the study of integrated optical waveguides.
