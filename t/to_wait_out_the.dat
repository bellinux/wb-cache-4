5|$|As night approaches, the {{brothers}} {{have not been}} able to find Gordon. Dean decides to go after Gordon while Sam stays hidden, but Sam refuses. He then confronts Dean about his reckless behavior since his deal with a Crossroads Demon, which left him only a year to live. Dean claims that he is not scared of his impending death, but Sam challenges this. Dean eventually relents, agreeing to behave more like his old self again. The two then prepare <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> night.|$|E
5|$|Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} King Charles I of Spain, on whose behalf he left Seville on 10 August 1519, with {{a squadron of}} five ships, {{in search of a}} western route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. Success depended on finding a strait or passage through the South American land masses, or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|The initial Abbasid {{invasion}} {{was led by}} Ishaq ibn Kundaj, {{appointed as}} the nominal governor of Syria and Egypt, and another general, Muhammad ibn Diwdad Abu'l-Saj. After receiving encouragement from al-Muwaffaq, who promised to send them reinforcements, the two commanders marched into Syria in mid-884. The Tulunid governor of Damascus soon defected to their side, {{and they were able}} to take control of Antioch, Hims and Aleppo. Upon learning of the Abbasid advance, Khumarawayh sent troops to Syria. The Tulunid army first proceeded to Damascus, where they succeeded in forcing its rebel governor to flee, and then advanced to Shayzar on the Orontes. The onset of winter, however, resulted in a lull in hostilities, and both sides remained in their camps <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> season.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{days out}} of Delaware Bay, Bonnet entered the estuary of the Cape Fear River and {{anchored}} {{near the mouth of}} a small waterway now known as Bonnet's Creek. The Royal James had begun to leak badly and was in need of careening. Shortly afterwards, a small shallop entered the river and was captured. Bonnet had the shallop broken up to help repair the Royal James. The work of careening was done, in whole or in part, by the prisoners Bonnet had captured. Bonnet threatened at least one man with marooning if he did not work with the slaves to repair the Royal James. Bonnet remained in the Cape Fear River for the next 45 days. According to Bonnet's boatswain, Ignatius Pell, the pirates intended <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> hurricane season there.|$|E

[...] The injury kept him <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> line-up for his entire senior year. [...] In November 2003, sports writer Donnie Webb wrote a feature story on Dumas' hard-luck story. Webb wrote, [...] "He is frustrated. He is exasperated. He is resigned <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm.

25|$|Bangladesh won the toss in {{the first}} of three matches, and under cloudy skies they chose to bowl first, putting faith in his newly {{composed}} seam bowling attack of Tapash Baisya and Syed Rasel with the new ball. However, the pair leaked runs during the first eight overs, and the score was 51 for 0 when Baisya ran in to bowl his fifth over of the day and Bangladesh's ninth. However, Sanath Jayasuriya was bowled by an inswinging delivery from Baisya for 25, and that slowed Sri Lanka down. Baisya even bowled a maiden over as the Sri Lankans chose <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> middle overs and set the platform for big hitting at the end - which worked perfectly.|$|E
25|$|The Beatles' {{flight to}} Tokyo stopped in Anchorage, Alaska late on 27 June, local time, and was {{grounded}} there {{due to the}} presence of a typhoon over Japan.

50|$|By late 1971, {{the band}} was {{concerned}} with Knight's managerial style and fiscal responsibility. This growing dissatisfaction led Grand Funk Railroad to fire Knight in early 1972. Knight sued for breach of contract, {{which resulted in a}} protracted legal battle. At one point, Knight repossessed the band's gear before a gig at Madison Square Garden. In VH1's Behind the Music Grand Funk Railroad episode, Knight stated that the original contract would have run out in about three months, and that the smart decision for the band would have been <b>to</b> just <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> time. However, at that moment, the band members felt they {{had no choice but to}} continue and fight for the rights to their careers and name.|$|R
25|$|The next day, Balao {{investigated}} smoke on the horizon, {{found two}} cargo ships, tracked {{them through a}} rain squall, and as she passed into clear weather, found the convoy in perfect position for her torpedoes. She fired four stern tubes at the leading ship, but heard no explosions. The torpedoes were duds or had again passed underneath. As the escorts actively pursued the submarine, Balao submerged <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> inevitable depth charges. When the submarine surfaced again, all trace of the convoy was gone, and she set course for Langemak Bay, New Guinea, with all her torpedoes expended. On 7 March, Balao moored alongside Coucal and took on fuel and provisions. She got underway again on the following morning, bound for Pearl Harbor where she arrived for refit on 19 March.|$|E
25|$|Balao {{began the}} year 1944 with a contact {{that turned out}} to be a very large steamer and two escorts. The weather impeded her efforts to close the convoy, but also offered {{protection}} when a rain squall covered Balao while she fired six torpedoes. The submarine counted three explosions and then went deep <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> inevitable depth charge attack by the escorts. When Balao surfaced the next morning, the convoy had disappeared. Certain that the freighter had been sunk, Balao resumed her patrol of the shipping lanes. She later sighted a convoy of a damaged freighter and two escorts and moved in for an attack only to discover that the freighter was her target of 1 January. The escorts drove Balao off, and on 7 January, she was ordered back to Brisbane, still without a confirmed kill under her belt.|$|E
25|$|Captain Scott sighted what he {{believed}} to be Parker Point (the southernmost tip of Rottnest Island) and ordered his crew to adjust the ship's heading towards Fremantle through Rottnest Island's southern channel. Moments later, Lady Elizabeth struck a reef in Bickley Bay. The ship lost control and swung to the south when Captain Scott ordered the port anchor be dropped. At 10:30pm, Lady Elizabeth began listing to starboard and the water started coming over the decks. Captain Nash, a pilot on Rottnest Island saw the blue distress signal flares {{but was unable to}} reach Lady Elizabeth due to the weather. He was forced <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> storm. By morning, weather conditions improved to launch a rescue of Lady Elizabeth's crew. Over {{the course of the next}} few months, the sandalwood that was stored in the ship's cargo hold broke free and washed up on shore. Most of the cargo was scattered between Rottnest Island and Bunbury.|$|E

25|$|The {{plants are}} as highly adapted in their methods of {{surviving}} seasonally inclement conditions {{as they are}} in their structure and feeding habits. Temperate perennials can require a winter period in which they die back each year, and they will weaken in cultivation if they are not given it; tropical and warm-temperate species, on the other hand, require no dormancy. Floating bladderworts in cold temperate zones such as the UK and Siberia can produce winter buds called turions at the extremities of their stems: as the autumnal light fails and growth slows down, the main plant may rot away or be killed by freezing conditions, but the turions will separate and sink {{to the bottom of the}} pond to rest beneath the coming ice until the spring, when they will return to the surface and resume growth. Many Australian species will grow only during the wet season, reducing themselves to tubers only 10mm long <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> dry season. Other species are annual, returning from seed each year.|$|E
25|$|On 30 January, the Duke of Cumberland {{arrived in}} Scotland to take {{command of the}} {{government}} forces after the previous failures by Cope and Hawley. Cumberland decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> winter, and moved his troops northwards to Aberdeen. Around this time, the army was increased by 5,000 Hessian troops. The Hessian force, led by Prince Frederick of Hesse, took up position to the south to cut off any path of retreat for the Jacobites. The weather had improved {{to such an extent}} by 8 April that Cumberland again resumed the campaign. The government army reached Cullen on 11 April, where it was joined by six battalions and two cavalry regiments. Days later, the government army approached the River Spey, which was guarded by a Jacobite force of 2,000, made up of the Jacobite cavalry, the Lowland regiments and over half of the army's French regulars. The Jacobites quickly turned and fled, first towards Elgin and then to Nairn. By 14 April, the Jacobites had evacuated Nairn, and Cumberland camped his army at Balblair just west of the town.|$|E
25|$|The ridge southward to Swirl How {{is named}} Top of Broad Slack, Broad Slack being a ferociously steep grass slope {{climbing}} out of Greenburn between the crags. This {{is the site of}} a wartime aircrash and bears the sad remains of a Royal Canadian Air Force Handley Page Halifax bomber. The undercarriage, together with a wooden cross and memorial cairn is {{on the top of the}} ridge with the rest of the wreckage spread down Broad Slack. During a night time navigation exercise in 1944, the RCAF Halifax from RAF Topcliffe became lost in thick cloud while over the north west of England. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> blanket of grey, they circled in hope the cloud would clear, ultimately becoming hopelessly lost. To try to get a visual fix for the navigator, the pilot dropped the bomber out of the cloud base, with no knowledge of what was below him. Unfortunately, for both him, the crew and the aircraft, they were greeted by the great rising fells of Swirl How and Great Carrs. With no time to react, the aircraft hit the mountainside killing all on board. Despite the crew perishing in the impact, the bomber remained largely intact and, to prevent other aircraft from spotting it and reporting it repeatedly, the wreckage was cut into a number of smaller, moveable pieces and discarded down Broad Slack, where parts of it are still visible today. Over the years, two of the four Rolls-Royce engines were recovered from the crash site by an RAF helicopter, one of which is now on display at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston. In contrast to the craggy scarp of the east face, the western slope of the ridge descends over grass to the col of Fairfield, forming a tilted triangular plateau. Across Fairfield is the rocky top of Grey Friar.|$|E
