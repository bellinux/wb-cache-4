5000|$|Cyclists in some {{countries}} are also given separate rules and light phases at traffic signals and cyclist-specific traffic lights. For instance, in Germany and elsewhere at junctions with segregated facilities all the traffic in a given direction (motorists, pedestrians and cyclists) may get a green signal at the same time. [...] <b>Turning</b> <b>motor</b> traffic is obliged to wait for cyclists and pedestrians to clear the junction before proceeding. In this situation all the transport modes get equal green time. In contrast, UK and Irish practice restricts pedestrians to a dedicated signal phase, separate from and usually much shorter than the green phase for motorists (e.g. 6-12 seconds, vs. signal cycle times of up to 120 seconds). [...] If cyclists were to be segregated and treated {{in a similar manner}} this would imply a significant reduction in green time for cycle traffic at every junction. In the English city of Cambridge the use of cyclist-specific traffic signals is reported to have resulted in increased delays for cyclists, leading some to ignore the cycle-facilities and stay on the road. [...] A similar example occurred in a Parisian bikepath scheme in 1999. Cyclists faced twice the number of traffic signals as motorised traffic and were expected to wait over one minute to get seven seconds of green time. Conversely, in Copenhagen cyclist-specific traffic signals on a major arterial bike lane have been linked to provide [...] "green waves" [...] for rush hour cycle-traffic, which time the lights so cyclists going an average speed {{are much more likely to}} encounter green lights on their trip.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Automatic {{guidance}} of tractors in the mechanized farming practice {{has taken the}} attention of agricultural engineers {{in the last two}} decades. For this to be truly practical on the farm, it should be economical, simple to operate and entirely contained on the vehicle. Different types of steering systems such as leader- cable, laser- controlled, radio- operated and contactor- type have been developed for automatic guidance. The automatic leveling system is used on hillside machines to keep the separator level when operating on hillsides. This system has three parts: fluid level system, electrical system and hydraulic system. The fluid level system consists of fluid reservoir and a leveling control switch box. The fluid level system actuates the electrical system of the leveling unit. The electrical system which actuated by the fluid system consist of four micro switches in the leveling control switch box, two micro switches in the limit control box, a solenoid in the hydraulic control level, manual leveling control switch, and a leveling limit warning light. The hydraulic system maintains the level of the separator when the machine is operating on a hillside. The present study was aimed to develop a reliable, versatile and easy to maintain system to fit our economy and low technology level of farmers for hillside- range development or fallow farming. The automatic guidance system has been implemented successfully on agricultural vehicles on the basis of three components, i. e. sensors, processors and actuator elements. The study site (N, latitude; E, longitude; and 1810 m above sea level) was located at the Agricultural Research Center, Shiraz University, 15 km northwest of Shiraz, Fars Province, Iran. MF- 399 agricultural tractor manufactured by ITMCO, Tabriz, Iran was used for doing the experiments. Materials and Methods:The Level Sensing System: The biaxial tilt industrial sensor (ZCT 245 AL- China) with digital output can be connected to the computer and received angular position in x and y coordinates. An assumed degree could be considered as basis degree and the measured frequency was adjustable. The tilt sensor located along the axial length of tractor and leads the angles which are created by longitudinal axle transverse axle of the tractor in related to horizontal level. It was used for contour lines detecting. The potentiometer located on the steering wheel of the tractor and pressure sensor which used with goniometer sensor used keeping uniformly of leveling points in tractor motion. The pressure sensor (SN-SCP 1000 - South Korea) which is used in leveling system can detect the elevation changes. In this way, by defining a limitation of altitude for system, it would be able to stop steering <b>turning</b> <b>motor</b> which was coupled to tractor steering rod automatically. By resetting, the tractor could be able to live in a new level position. To avoid excessive left and right steering wheels deviation and interfering with other lines of travel, potentiometer was used. The deviation degree for steering rod from center to left or right was selected 120 degrees. Accordingly, the wheels {{would not be able to}} move more than 10 degrees to each direction. The Processing System: The electrical circuit graphically designed and simulated by software (Altium Designer, 2009) and installed on the tractor. The components of this circuit are as follows: Electrical board, two relays which control the electrical pathway in both directions, a battery with 12 volts of electric potential as electrical power supply, ATmeGA 32 microcontroller which was made by Atmel company as main core for information processing, RS 232 protocol was used for making correlation between serial port (COM) and the microcontroller and two capacitors for reducing noises. The Actuator System: The output signals from the a processing system, were lead in the actuator system would order and indicative of left- turn or right- turn command, were introduced to actuator- units include an electric- gearbox motor that stimulate the steering wheel shaft of the tractor by chain and sprocket and conduct the tractor in leveling traces at the desired speed. Before hitching any implements such as row planter behind the tractor, the system was successfully tested on average slopes of 14. 5...|$|E

40|$|Motor neuron {{death as}} seen in {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS) {{is likely to be}} a non-cell autonomous process. One cell type that may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease is the astrocyte.

In addition, they determine some of the functional characteristics of <b>motor</b> neurons. In <b>turn,</b> <b>motor</b> neurons affect the functional characteristics of astrocytes. Recent evidence suggests that activation of astrocytes in a degenerative disease like ALS leads to a disturbance of this crosstalk between astrocytes and motor neurons, and that this may contribute to the death of motor neurons.
