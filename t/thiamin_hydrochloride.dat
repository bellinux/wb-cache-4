40|$|Objective: {{to analyze}} the {{interactions}} that could indicate the potential pharmacological properties of the molecules of thiamin, thiamine disulfide, and others. Material and methods. The investigators simulated the properties of thiamine disulfide (bistiamin) versus those of the reference molecules of <b>thiamin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and benfotiamine. The study was performed using chemoreactomic simulation that is the newest area in post-genome pharmacology. Results and discussion. Chemoreactomic analysis has shown that thiamine disulfide can inhibit the molecular receptors involved in blood pressure regulation: adrenoceptors, vasopressin receptor, and angiotensin receptor. Thiamine disulfide can inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, increase its levels, inhibit benzodiazepine receptor and dopamine reuptake, and enhance neuronal acetylcholine release {{to a large extent}} than benfotiamine. These molecular effects are consistent with the sedative and anticonvulsant action profile of thiamine disulfide. Simulation has indicated that thiamine disulfide has neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, normolipidemic, and antitumor activities. Conclusion. The simulation results are confirmed by the available clinical and experimental findings and indicate the virtually unstudied molecular mechanisms of action of thiamine disulfide, benfotiamine, and <b>thiamin</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b>  </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{double blind}} study ofpartial thiamin {{restriction}} was undertaken in 19 volunteer male medical {{students for a}} period of 4 to 5 weeks. Each day the subjects followed a diet supplying 500 g thiamin and took I capsule randomly assigned to contain 5 mg <b>thiamin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or thiamin placebo. This capsule also supplied physiological doses ofother vitamins. At {{the end of the study}} all were repleted with <b>thiamin</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> Ten thiamin-depleted subjects were correctly identified by low urinary thiamin excretion, decreasing erythrocyte transketohase activity, and elevation of the thiamin pyrophosphate effect. The remaining nine subjects were controls. The degree of thiamin depletion induced varied between individuals and had no measureable ill effect on health as assessed by subjective feelings, physical fmdings, psychological testing, nerve conduc-tion studies, and work performance. Subclinical thiamin deficiency is defined from this study as the presence of a low urinary thiamin level (27 tg thiamin/g creatinine) together with a thiamin pyrophosphate effect above 14. 2 % and below 35. 4 %. However, when urinary thiamin excretion is unknown, the data indicate that a thiamin pyrophosphate effect above 9 % and below 41. 6 % is likely but not certain to represent subclinical thiamin deficiency. These guidelines, developed under experimental conditions, are a reference framework for assessment of thiamin status in populatio...|$|E
40|$|Drugs with {{different}} water-solubility and molecular weights were microencapsulated in cellulose acetate phthalate, using an emulsion-solvent evaporation technique with a continuous oil-phase. The mean {{size of the}} particles was approximately 600 mum, and they were non-porous. The capacity of the microspheres to retain the drugs was evaluated by in vitro release studies in acidic medium. For low molecular weight compounds the release rates increased with solubility: for <b>thiamin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and phenacetin, a highly and a poorly soluble compound respectively, the percentages released at 60 min were 90 and 10 %. Drugs with molecular weights above approximately 700 Da were retained in the microspheres. The above dependence on solubility was corroborated by release studies in ethanol, and by modelling the release of phenacetin in acidic media. Microspheres with a different polymer matrix, Eudragit RS PO, were also prepared by a similar technique, and these particles prolonged the release of thiamin for over 6 h, under simulated GI conditions...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{artificial}} neural networks (ANN) and partial least squares (PLS) regression {{were applied to}} UV spectral data for quantitative determination of <b>thiamin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (VB 1), riboflavin phosphate (VB 2), pyridoxine hydrochloride (VB 6) and nicotinamide (VPP) in pharmaceutical samples. For calibration purposes, commercial samples in 0. 2 mol L- 1 acetate buffer (pH 4. 0) were employed as standards. The concentration ranges used in the calibration step were: 0. 1 - 7. 5 mg L- 1 for VB 1, 0. 1 - 3. 0 mg L - 1 for VB 2, 0. 1 - 3. 0 mg L- 1 for VB 6 and 0. 4 - 30. 0 mg L- 1 for VPP. From the results {{it is possible to}} verify that both methods can be successfully applied for these determinations. The similar error values were obtained by using neural network or PLS methods. The proposed methodology is simple, rapid and can be easily used in quality control laboratories...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} the thesis is {{dedicated}} to the description of the pharmacokinetics of thiamin after a single oral administration of either 100 mg thiamin nitrate or 100 mg S-benzoylthiamin-O-monophosphate (BTMP), a synthetic thiamin prodrug. In each case, ten patients with terminal renal insufficiency received the test dose after an overnight fast. Pharmacokinetic parameters are given (AUC, Cmax, tmax, oral and renal clearance). A complex representation of the distribution and interaction of thiamin and its phosphoric acid esters in blood, plasma, and erythrocytes was achieved with the aid of an open multi-compartment model including submodels. The apparent volumes of distribution, the mean residence time and the distribution and/or elimination rate constants were derived from the model. In another paragraph, the relative bioavailability of thiamin after a single intramuscular injection of 100 mg <b>thiamin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and/or a single oral application of 150 mg BTMP in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid is described. In context of a post-marketing surveillance study, forty-two patients of a neurological hospital unit were given the test dose...|$|E
