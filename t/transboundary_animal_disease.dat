FMD is a major threat to production and productivity, and livestock economy. Countries having FMD are more prone to food insecurity. Being an important <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>disease,</b> it has the potential of a bioterrorism agent for the countries free from it. The disease is a major hurdle to livestock trade, as countries having it face trade barrier by the countries free from it. The disease causes reduced availability of milk, meat, and their products in the local and global market. Occurrence of the disease in the South Asian region (SAARC) is the major reason for loss in milk production (up to 80 %) in dairy sector. Direct loss due to loss in milk production and draught power, cost of treatment and bio-security, and calf mortality is estimated to be more than Rs. 23, 000 crores per year.

40|$|Summary: Animal {{diseases}} {{continue to}} be a serious impediment to economic progress in most countries in Africa and the situation is likely to worsen if timely appropriate steps are not taken. As is the case with other regions of the world, it is becoming increasingly evident that the public veterinary sector in Africa will not be capable of fulfilling this function alone and that private veterinarians, veterinary para-professionals (technicians) and farmers will be called upon to play an important role. All authors agree that epidemiology is a procedure or activity associated with disease control. Surveillance is defined as “The systematic ongoing collection, collation, and analysis of data, and the timely dissemination of information to those who need to know so that action can be taken”. Physical components of epidemio-surveillance are enlisted as: official Veterinary Services, the diagnostic laboratory, the herder and herds and the computer database. There are many factors impeding running a proper epidemio-surveillance. These include financial, logistical and technical constraints. The evidence collected and the analyses used to reach any conclusion should be reliable enough for the results to be acceptable to both the managers of the monitoring and surveillance systems and the assessors.

40|$|Abstract Background Non-invasive {{sampling}} techniques {{based on}} the analysis of oral fluid specimen have gained substantial importance {{in the field of}} swine herd management. Methodological advances have a focus on endemic viral diseases in commercial pig production. More recently, these approaches have been adapted to non-invasive sampling of wild boar for <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>disease</b> detection for which these effective population level sampling methods have not been available. In this study, a rope-in-a-bait based oral fluid sampling technique was tested to detect classical swine fever virus nucleic acid shedding from experimentally infected domestic pigs. Results Separated in two groups treated identically, the course of the infection was slightly differing in terms of onset of the clinical signs and levels of viral ribonucleic acid detection in the blood and oral fluid. The technique was capable of detecting classical swine fever virus nucleic acid as of day 7 post infection coinciding with the first detection in conventional oropharyngeal swab samples from some individual animals. Except for day 7 post infection in the 2 ̆ 01 cslower onset group 2 ̆ 01 d, the chances of classical swine fever virus nucleic acid detection in ropes were identical or higher as compared to the individual sampling. Conclusions With the provided evidence, non-invasive oral fluid sampling at group level can be considered as additional cost-effective detection tool in classical swine fever prevention and control strategies. The proposed methodology is of particular use in production systems with reduced access to veterinary services such as backyard or scavenging pig production where it can be integrated in feeding or baiting practices...|$|E
40|$|African horse {{sickness}} is a devastating, <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>disease,</b> that is ‘listed ’ by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). Although attenuated, inactivated and subunit vaccines {{have been}} developed for African horse sickness virus (AHSV), these are serotype-specific and their effective deployment therefore relies on rapid and reliable identification of virus type. AHSV serotype is controlled by the specificity of interactions between neutralising antibodies, and components of the outer-capsid, particularly protein VP 2 (encoded by AHSV genome segment 2 (Seg- 2)). We report the development and evaluation of novel gel based reverse transcription-PCR (RT–PCR) assays targeting AHSV Seg- 2, which can be used to very significantly increase the speed and reliability of detection and identification (compared to virus neutralisation tests) of the nine serotypes of AHSV. Primer sets were designed targeting regions of Seg- 2 that are conserved between strains within each of the AHSV serotype (types 1 to 9). These assays were evaluated using multiple AHSV strains from the orbivirus reference collection at IAH (www. reoviridae. org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/AHSV-isolates. htm). In each case the Seg- 2 primers showed a high level of specificity and failed to cross-amplify the most closely related heterologous AHSV types, or other related orbiviruses (such as bluetongue virus (BTV), or equine encephalosis virus (EEV)). The assays are rapid and sensitive, and can be used to detect and type viral RNA in blood, tissue samples, or cultivated viral suspensions within 24 h. They were used to identify AHSV strains from recent outbreaks in sub-Saharan African countries. Thes...|$|E

This severe respiratory disease of cattle {{is the second most}} important <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>disease</b> in Africa after rinderpest. CBPP is caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC (small colony bovine biotype) and it is endemic disease in many African countries including Ethiopia. This paper systematically reviews prevalence report at herd and individual animal level for the last 20 [*]years (1996 – 2016) with main aim of making comprehensive document regarding the seroprevalence and distribution of CBPP in Ethiopia. The paper is therefore helpful in knowing the past and current disease status and also to forecast the future and possible prevention option in the country. So far, the seroprevalence that ranges from 0. 4 to 96 % was reported from different export quarantine centers and production areas in Ethiopia. The reported seroprevalence is significantly associated with different agro-ecology of the country and the highest was reported from lowland in which 40 % of livestock population was kept. The recent seroprevalence studies report from different areas of the country also indicated as CBPP is posing a major threat to cattle production {{in many parts of the}} country, thereby causing considerable economic losses through morbidity and mortality. This disease also causes restriction on the trade of animals and animal products internationally and accounts for a loss of over 8. 96 million US dollars per year in Ethiopian situation. Thus, a great attention should be given both at production areas and the quarantine stations as its occurrence may affect the export earnings of the country, thereby threatening the livelihood of pastoralists and national economy of the country...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this poster paper is to {{evaluate}} the cost-effectiveness of alternative control strategies {{for a number of}} simulated outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD) in four agriculturally diverse Irish regions, examining for the first time, the potential role of emergency vaccination in the country. With the increasing threat of <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases</b> due to globalisation, wider market integration and increased animal movement it is important that such an evaluation of control and eradication strategies be undertaken and contingency plans be put in place. The new EU Directive (2003 / 85 /EC) on FMD control permits the use of emergency vaccination as part of an FMD control strategy. The slaughter of infected animals and "dangerous contacts" (susceptible animals on epidemiologically linked holdings) remains the principal tool for tackling an outbreak, but the potential use of vaccination as an adjunct to the basic culling policy is now being considered. Using an integrated approach, combining an epidemiological model and an economic model, alternative control strategies are compared here during hypothetical outbreaks using a computer-simulation model and their cost-effectiveness assessed. The study provides outputs in terms of a range of epidemiological, economic and resource requirement measures under a wide range of different scenarios for each of the alternative control strategies.

40|$|Peste des petits {{ruminants}} (PPR) is {{a highly}} contagious <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>disease</b> of economic importance {{in the developing world}} and infects small ruminants like sheep and goat. It is caused by a single stranded RNA virus namely peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) belonging to the genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. Since initial reports in 1942, PPR has infected a large population of small ruminants across Asia and Africa causing huge economic losses, therefore, Office International des Epizooties (OIE) has declared it as list-A disease. In Pakistan, a loss of more than US 342. 15 million occurs annually due to this disease. Lack of sensitive diagnosis and control of free animal movement are major reasons for the unnoticed spread of disease in the country which may lead to further evolution of the underlying virus. For sensitive diagnosis, molecular methods are preferred over conventional serological assays as the former have higher sensitivity and additional benefit of molecular characterization. In this context, this bi-partite study on PPRV was designed: the first part included establishment of sensitive and efficient molecular detection methods; the second parts focused on molecular characterization of PPRV in Pakistan and its comparison with other lineages of the virus. In the first part, two molecular methods of PPRV detection including reverse-transcription PCR (RTPCR), real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) were established for sensitive laboratory diagnosis while RT-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for sensitive on-site diagnosis. During the study, a total of 448 clinical samples were collected from 25 places of 11 districts in Pakistan and subjected to molecular detection and analysis of the suspected underlying virus. A newly developed cell line designated as CHS- 20 that express sheep signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) were used for isolation of PPRV in clinical samples. For comparative analysis of PPRVs from Pakistan with those of lineages, 192 clinical samples from two Asian (Pakistan and Bangladesh) and seven African countries (Benin, Côte d´Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Cameroon, Kenya and South Sudan) were processed for phylogenetic investigation.

40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease (FMD) {{presents}} the greatest economic threat to U.

S. economy extending far beyond animal agriculture. The structure of modern animal agriculture in the U. S., including extremely large herds and extensive intraand inter‐state movement of animals and animal products will make it nearly impossible to control an FMD outbreak in livestock dense areas without the rapid use of tens of millions of doses of FMD vaccine. The amount of antigen in the North American FMD Vaccine Bank is far below what would be needed to provide vaccine for a single livestock dense state. It would take many months to produce/obtain the volume of vaccine needed. Without sufficient vaccine to aid in the response, FMD could rapidly spread across the U. S., resulting in the destruction and disposal of potentially millions of animals, and become an endemic disease in livestock with spread potentially facilitated by deer, feral swine or other freeliving animals. It would then require a much more extensive control program and could take many years to eradicate. Agriculture is critical infrastructure in the U. S. and cash receipts for livestock and poultry often exceed $ 100 billion per year. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a plan to ensure that adequate supplies of FMD vaccine with multiple strains of FMD virus are rapidly available {{in the event of an}} accidental or intentional introduction of FMD virus into the U.

Emerging small-scale pig farmers (ESSPF) are being encouraged to establish operations and spread in South Africa; however, for these farmers to perform optimally, they need to understand the basics of animal agriculture and contribute to enhancing biosecurity and efficient production systems. In the present study, the limitations to efficient production amongst ESSPF were evaluated and some improvements were suggested. It was found that the ESSPF are dominated by males and include a large percentage of older persons. A total of 26. 54 % of these farmers have postmatriculation qualifications. Undefined and indigenous breeds still dominate their animal genetics. The animal health technicians are the preferred channels by which farmers report diseases to the authorities (52. 47 %) and only one out of five (20. 37 %) will preferably report a disease situation direct to a veterinarian. These farmers do not vaccinate their stock, and knowledge of biosecurity is poor. Antimicrobials, especially tetracyclines, are abused. Animals that are slaughtered within the community or sold at local sale points, pension pay stations and auction markets are likely candidates for disease spread. It is recommended that the younger generations are retained and incentivised in animal agriculture. Improved training on management, health, biosecurity and better market access must be provided for the ESSPF, whilst efforts should made to consolidate these farmers into small cooperatives. The current government agricultural support system will need to be reworked to benefit the resource-poor farmers. Collaborative efforts in disease reporting and management among veterinarians, animal health technicians and extension officers will become necessary. Finally, the creation of a progressive quality grading system for ESSPF should be planned by the industry and this should be attached to a reward system that will encourage these farmers to target good farming practice.

The results suggest that information related to cattle diseases circulates widely between cattle farmers, including between different sociocultural groups, using English and vernacular languages. Most respondents had an accurate perception of the epidemiology of diseases affecting their livestock, and their perception of the potential role played by wildlife species was usually in agreement with current state of veterinary knowledge. However, we found significant variations in the cultural importance of livestock diseases between sites, and owners' perceptions were not directly related with the local abundance of wildlife.

40|$|A case is {{made for}} greater {{emphasis}} {{to be placed on}} value chain management as an alternative to geographically based disease risk mitigation for trade in commodities and products derived from animals. The geographic approach is dependent upon achievement of freedom in countries or zones from infectious agents that cause so-called <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases,</b> while value chain-based risk management depends upon mitigation of <b>animal</b> <b>disease</b> hazards potentially associated with specific commodities or products irrespective of the locality of production. This commodity-specific approach is founded on the same principles upon which international food safety standards are based, viz. hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP). Broader acceptance of a value chain approach enables <b>animal</b> <b>disease</b> risk management to be combined with food safety management by the integration of commodity-based trade and HACCP methodologies and thereby facilitates ‘farm to fork’ quality assurance. The latter is increasingly recognized as indispensable to food safety assurance and is therefore a pre-condition to safe trade. The biological principles upon which HACCP and commodity-based trade are based are essentially identical, potentially simplifying sanitary control in contrast to current separate international sanitary standards for food safety and <b>animal</b> <b>disease</b> risks that are difficult to reconcile. A value chain approach would not only enable more effective integration of food safety and <b>animal</b> <b>disease</b> risk management of foodstuffs derived from animals but would also ameliorate adverse environmental and associated socio-economic consequences of current sanitary standards based on the geographic distribution of animal infections. This is especially the case where vast veterinary cordon fencing systems are relied upon to separate livestock and wildlife {{as is the case in}} much of southern Africa. A value chain approach would thus be particularly beneficial to under-developed regions of the world such as southern Africa specifically and sub-Saharan Africa more generally where it would reduce incompatibility between attempts to expand and commercialize livestock production and the need to conserve the subcontinent’s unparalleled wildlife and wilderness resources.

The Charter gives quasi-legal status, defining terms of reference; objectives of the network; membership; chairmanship; organizational structure, operational procedures, internal and external communication and prescriptions for funding. This charter is considered by the members of the network as an essential institutionalization tool for facilitating the development of cohesive programmes, maintaining transparency and creating trust among all members, providing information on the network to partners; mobilizing technical and financial resources, and engaging in cooperation agreements with international organizations. In essence the charter is one of the keys element considered fundamental for the sustainability of this regional network. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases</b> (TADs) in the southern African region is foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). In this region, a pathway for spread of FMD virus is contacts between cattle and certain species of wildlife. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate contacts between cattle and wildlife in the Kruger National Park (KNP) and the adjacent Limpopo province for the time periods October 2006 to March 2007 and April to September 2007. In this study, 87 livestock owners and 57 KNP field rangers were interviewed. Fifteen (17 %) livestock owners reported contacts between wildlife and cattle. More livestock owners reported observing contacts between cattle and all wildlife species during October-March than April-September (p = 0. 012). However, no difference was found between these periods for contacts between cattle and individual wildlife species. A total of 18 (32 %) field rangers reported contacts between cattle and wildlife. The most common species-specific contacts were between cattle and buffalo (63 /year), cattle and impala (17 /year) and cattle and lion (10 /year). There were no significant differences in rangers reporting observed contacts between cattle and wildlife during October-March versus April-September or between rangers reporting observed contacts outside versus within the KNP. Overall, there was no evidence of higher contact rates between cattle and wildlife in the study area during October-March compared to April-September. Contact data collected in this study can be used to better understand the transmission of FMD virus in this region. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNewcastle disease (ND) is an OIE listed disease {{caused by}} virulent avian {{paramyxovirus}} type 1 (APMV- 1) strains, which affect {{many species of}} birds and may cause severe economic losses in the poultry sector. The disease has been officially and unofficially reported in many African countries and still remains the main poultry disease in commercial and rural chickens of Africa. Unfortunately, virological and epidemiological information concerning ND strains circulating in the Western and Central regions of Africa is extremely scarce. In the present study, sequence analysis, pathotyping and detailed genetic characterization of virulent ND strains detected in rural poultry in West and Central Africa revealed the circulation of a new genetic lineage, distinguishable from the lineages described in the Eastern and Southern parts of the continent. Several mismatches were observed in the segment of the matrix gene targeted by the primers and probe designed for the molecular detection of APMV- 1, which {{were responsible for the}} false negative results in the diagnostic test conducted. Furthermore, deduced amino acid sequences of the two major antigens eliciting a protective immune response (F and HN glycoprotein) revealed protein similarities < 90 % if compared to some common vaccine strains. Distinct mutations located in the neutralizing epitopes were revealed, indicating the need for detailed assessment of the efficacy of the current vaccines and vaccination practices in Africa. The present investigation provides important information on the epidemiology, diagnosis and control of NDV in Africa and highlights the importance of supporting surveillance in developing countries for <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{matrix system}} was {{developed}} {{to aid in the}} evaluation of the technical amenability to eradication, through mass vaccination, of <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases</b> (TADs). The system involved evaluation of three basic criteria - disease management efficiency, surveillance and epidemiological factors - each in turn comprised of a number of elements (17 in all). On that basis, 25 TADs that have occurred or do occur in southern Africa and for which vaccines are available, in addition to rinderpest (incorporated as a yardstick because it has been eradicated worldwide), were ranked. Cluster analysis was also applied using the same criteria to the 26 diseases, creating division into three groups. One cluster contained only diseases transmitted by arthropods (e. g. African horse sickness and Rift Valley fever) and considered difficult to eradicate because technologies for managing parasitic arthropods on a large scale are unavailable, while a second cluster contained diseases that have been widely considered to be eradicable [rinderpest, canine rabies, the Eurasian serotypes of foot and mouth disease virus (O, A, C & Asia 1) and peste des petits ruminants] as well classical swine fever, Newcastle disease and lumpy skin disease. The third cluster contained all the other TADs evaluated with the implication that these constitute TADs that would be more difficult to eradicate. However, it is acknowledged that the scores assigned {{in the course of this}} study may be biased. The point is that the system proposed offers an objective method for assessment of the technical eradicability of TADs; the rankings and groupings derived during this study are less important than the provision of a systematic approach for further development and evaluation.

40|$|Pig {{production}} {{is one of}} the most important animal agricultural activities in South Africa, and plays a definite role in providing food security for certain population groups in the country. As with all animal production systems, it is subject to the risk of outbreak of transboundary diseases. In the present overview, evaluations of the perceived risk of selected <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases</b> of pigs, as collated from the willing participants from the provincial veterinary services of South Africa, are presented. A scenario tree revealed that infected but undetected pigs were the greatest perceived threat. The provincial veterinary services, according to participants in the study, face certain difficulties, including the reporting of disease and the flow of disease information amongst farmers. Perceived strengths in surveillance and disease monitoring include the swiftness of sample despatch to the national testing laboratory, as well as the ease of flow of information between the provincial and national agricultural authorities. The four factors were identified that were perceived to most influence animal health-service delivery: transport, access, livestock policy and resources. African swine fever was perceived to be the most important pig disease in South Africa. Because the decentralisation of veterinary services in South Africa was identified as a potential weakness, it is recommended that national and provincial veterinary services need to work together and interdependently to achieve centrally controlled surveillance systems. Regionally-coordinated surveillance activities for certain transboundary diseases were identified as needing priority for the southern African region. It is proposed that an emergency preparedness document be made available and regularly revised according to the potential risks identified on a continuous basis for South Africa. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Outbreaks of <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases</b> (TADs) {{have the}} {{potential}} to cause significant detriment to animal, human, and environmental health; severe economic implications; and national security. Challenges concerning data sharing, model development, decision support, and disease emergence science have recently been promoted. These challenges and recommendations have been recognized and advocated in the disciplines intersecting with outbreak prediction and forecast modeling regarding infectious diseases. To advance the effective application of computation and risk communication, analytical products ought to follow a collaboratively agreed common plan for implementation. Research articles should seek to inform and assist prioritization of national and international strategies in developing established criteria to identify and follow best practice standards to assess risk model attributes and performance. A well-defined framework to help eliminate gaps in policy, process, and planning knowledge areas would help alleviate the intense need for the formation of a comprehensive strategy for countering TAD outbreak risks. A quantitative assessment that accurately captures the risk of introduction of a TAD through various pathways can be a powerful tool in guiding where government, academic, and industry resources ought to be allocated, whether implementation of additional risk management solutions is merited, and where research efforts should be directed to minimize risk. This review outlines a part of a process for the development of quantitative risk analysis to collect, analyze, and communicate this knowledge. A more comprehensive and unabridged manual was also developed. The framework used in supporting the application of aligning computational tools for readiness continues our approach to apply a preparedness mindset to challenges concerning threats to global biosecurity, secure food systems, and risk-mitigated agricultural economies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases</b> {{can have}} very severe {{socio-economic}} impacts when introduced into new regions. The history of disease incursions into the European Union suggests that initial outbreaks were often initiated by illegal importation {{of meat and}} derived products. The European Union would benefit from decision-support tools to evaluate the risk of disease introduction caused by illegal imports in order to inform its surveillance strategy. However, due to the difficulty in quantifying illegal movements of animal products, very few studies of this type have been conducted. Using African swine fever as an example, this work presents a novel risk assessment framework for disease introduction into the European Union through illegal importation of meat and products. It uses a semi-quantitative approach based on factors that likely influence the likelihood of release of contaminated smuggled meat and products, and subsequent exposure of the susceptible population. The {{results suggest that the}} European Union is at non-negligible risk of African swine fever introduction through illegal importation of pork and products. On a relative risk scale with six categories from negligible to very high, five European Union countries were estimated at high (France, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom) or moderate (Spain) risk of African swine fever release, five countries were at high risk of exposure if African swine fever were released (France, Italy, Poland, Romania and Spain) and ten countries had a moderate exposure risk (Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Sweden and United Kingdom). The approach presented here and results obtained for African swine fever provide a basis for the enhancement of risk-based surveillance systems and disease prevention programmes in the European Union...|$|R
40|$|The {{epidemiological}} {{aspects of}} Theileria orientalis in Pakistan are unknown; therefore, investigations using sensitive and precise molecular techniques are required. This study reports the first molecular characterisation of T. orientalis detected from imported (Bos taurus) and native cattle (Bos indicus×Bos taurus) and buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) selected from four districts of Punjab, Pakistan. DNA samples from blood (n= 246) were extracted and tested using conventional PCR utilising the major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) gene and multiplexed tandem PCR (MT-PCR). Theileria orientalis DNA was detected (15 %; 22 / 147) only in imported cattle by conventional PCR, whereas 24. 5 % (36 / 147), 6 % (3 / 50) and 6. 1 % (3 / 49) of the imported cattle and native Pakistani cattle and buffaloes, respectively were test-positive for T. orientalis using MT-PCR. Using MT-PCR, {{the prevalence of}} T. orientalis was significantly higher (P< 0. 0001) in imported cattle {{compared to that of}} detected in native Pakistani bovines. The prevalence of T. orientalis and DNA copies of chitose and ikeda were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in imported cattle than those detected in native Pakistani bovines. DNA sequencing of amplicons of the conventional PCR revealed the presence of buffeli, chitose and ikeda genotypes of T. orientalis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the MPSP sequences of buffeli, chitose and ikeda from imported cattle were closely related to those sequences reported previously from Australia and other regions. This study provides the first survey of T. orientalis infection in imported and native bovines in Pakistan, and highlights the need for future studies to understand the spread of <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases.</b> embarg...|$|R
40|$|Limited {{resources}} {{are one of}} the major constraints in effective disease monitoring and control in developing countries. This paper examines the pig and poultry market chains of four targeted Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) : Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu and combines them with a risk pathway analysis to identify the highest risk areas (risk hotspots) and risky practices and behaviours (risk factors) of <b>animal</b> <b>disease</b> introduction and/or spread, using highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) as model diseases because of their importance in the region. The results show that combining a market chain analysis with risk pathways is a practical way of communicating risk to animal health officials and improving biosecurity. It provides a participatory approach that helps officials to better understand the trading regulations in place in their country and to better evaluate their role as part of the control system. Common risk patterns were found {{to play a role in}} all four PICTs. Legal trade pathways rely essentially on preventive measures put in place in the exporting countries while no or only limited control measures are undertaken by the importing countries. Legal importations of animals and animal products are done mainly by commercial farms which then supply local smallholders. Targeting surveillance on these potential hotspots would limit the risk of introduction and spread of <b>animal</b> <b>diseases</b> within the pig and poultry industry and better rationalize use of skilled manpower. Swill feeding is identified as a common practice in the region that represents a recognized risk factor for dissemination of pathogens to susceptible species. Illegal introduction of animals and animal products is suspected, but appears restricted to small holder farms in remote areas, limiting the risk of spread of <b>transboundary</b> <b>animal</b> <b>diseases</b> along the market chain. Introduction of undeclared goods hidden within a legal trade activity was identified as a major risk pathway. Activities such as awareness campaigns for pig and poultry farmers regarding disease reporting, biosecurity measures or danger of swill feeding and training of biosecurity officers in basic animal health and import-associated risks are recommended to prevent and limit the spread of pathogens within the PICTs...|$|R
