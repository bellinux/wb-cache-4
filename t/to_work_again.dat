25|$|In May 1961, Coltrane's {{contract}} with Atlantic was bought {{out by the}} newly formed Impulse! Records label. An advantage to Coltrane recording with Impulse! {{was that it would}} enable him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again</b> with engineer Rudy Van Gelder, who had taped both his and Davis' Prestige sessions, as well as Blue Train. It was at Van Gelder's new studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey that Coltrane would record most of his records for the label.|$|E
25|$|In January 1994, Dostum joined an {{alliance}} with Hekmatyar and conducted bombardment of Kabul during that period, but were eventually repelled by Massoud's forces who also bombarded the city to gain control. In late 1994, bombardment of the capital came to a temporary halt. These forces took steps to restore law and order. Courts started <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again,</b> convicting individuals inside government troops who had committed crimes. Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process {{with the goal of}} national consolidation and democratic elections, also inviting the Taliban to join the process but the idea was rejected by them. By 1995 the university opened its doors once again.|$|E

25|$|On 11 June, it was {{discovered}} that the water level in the spent fuel pool was only one third of normal, and only part of the fuel rods were covered with water. This was probably the cause of the high radiation levels measured. This pool has also been used to dump equipment. On Sunday 19 June, the pool was refilled, to minimize the radiation and making it possible <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again</b> at this place. On 21 June, the first stage of strengthening at the second floor in the building under the pool was finished: 32 steel columns 8 meters long with a weight of 40 tons each were placed at the second floor. By 30 July, the concreting of the supporting columns was completed.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged by {{his friend}} and ex-Birdman compadre Chris Masuak, Deniz came back to Australia in 1991, intent on {{renewing}} himself musically. He began extensive touring in 1992 and, following a near career destroying disaster on the Take It To The Vertical tour of 1992 initiated a line-up that became known as The Deniz Tek Group. This line-up spent {{the next few years}} touring Europe, Australia and the USA, while releasing an EP and several albums (Outside, 444 The Number Of The Beat, La Bonne Route) Geographical difficulties became untenable in late '96 and the group split up. Deniz then continued with US based lineups and recorded albums with Wayne Kramer(MC5)(Dodge Main), skateboard stars Art and Steve Godoy (Golden Breed, The Last Of The Bad Men), a Montana-based trio (Equinox), an experimental electronic duo with Jimi Hendrix's sidekick and amplifier designer Dave Weyer (Glass Insects), east coast hard rockers (Deep Reduction and DR2 featuring Rob Younger), and live work including tours and live albums with the Rationals' Scott Morgan (Three Assassins, Powertrane) and surviving members of Sonic's Rendezvous Band (Getting There Is Half The Fun). Deniz and wife Angie Pepper (Passengers) recorded her album Res Ipsa Loquitor in 2001. Deniz continued to record and tour extensively in the late '90s, while Radio Birdman reunified and began <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gainey {{accepted}} the role despite knowing nothing about it; his sole motivation {{was a chance}} <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again</b> with Lost producer Carlton Cuse. Speculation over Tom's sexuality arose when he commented to Kate that she was [...] "not [...] type". Gainey began playing the character as such, and in season four Tom is shown kissing another man on the cheek. Lost producer Damon Lindelof commented that this revelation was [...] "not subtle, to say the least". Tom was received positively by critics, particularly in his first appearance.|$|E

500|$|Shortly before {{completing}} {{his contract with}} Atlantic in May 1961, John Coltrane joined the newly formed Impulse! label, with whom the [...] "Classic Quartet" [...] would record. It is generally assumed that the clinching reason Coltrane signed with Impulse! {{was that it would}} enable him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again</b> with recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder, [...] who had taped his Prestige sessions, as well as Blue Train. It was at Van Gelder's new studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey that Coltrane would record most of his records for the label.|$|E
500|$|Since Grohl {{felt the}} songs were {{different}} from the band's previous input and [...] "had {{the potential to be}} something great", he considered that instead of doing something like the last three albums, the band had to go out of [...] "our own comfort zone" [...] and [...] "needed someone to push us out of there". So Grohl decided <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again</b> with Gil Norton, who produced the band's second album The Colour and the Shape, citing how Norton taught the band of the importance of pre-production and refining the composition, and claiming Norton's [...] "unconventional" [...] approach [...] "seems to capture the best of this band", considering that with him [...] "we're not going to do a straightforward AC/DC record, he's gonna make it different".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the loss}} in the court case, Tamizhselvi {{requests}} Sivaji out of fear not to come for her again. Sivaji is reduced to utter poverty. Realising that the methods he used are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again,</b> he decides {{to play the game}} his own way. Sivaji, {{with the help of his}} uncle Arivu, acquires evidence of 2billion worth of illegal earnings in Adiseshan's possession and uses the documents to blackmail Adiseshan into giving him half the money. He further obtains details on people who have illegal earnings across Tamil Nadu, and blackmails them to give him half of their illegal wealth. He then transfers the money to the bank accounts of his friends around the world by [...] "hawala" [...] forgery. They then deposit the money as donations to Sivaji Foundation, making the money usable and legitimate.|$|E

500|$|On 16 October 1554, {{according}} to the diary of Henry Machyn, Day was caught {{and sent to the}} Tower of London for printing [...] "naughty books". In the Book of Martyrs, Foxe records statements made in prison to Day by the future martyr John Rogers, [...] "spake being then in prison, to the Printer of this present booke, who then also was layd up for lyke cause of religion". Perhaps because the flight of foreign Protestant workers under Mary was causing a shortage of printers, Day was released the next year and allowed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again,</b> but only as a jobbing printer. He reunited with Seres (also recently released from prison) to produce works of Catholicism for Catholic printer John Wayland, {{a far cry from the}} Protestant polemics he printed prior to imprisonment. He also served as the official printer of the City of London for two years.|$|E
500|$|Ray Davies' marital {{problems}} {{during this period}} began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was [...] "fucking sick of the whole thing", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness {{as well as his}} depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies [...] "decided <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again</b> ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's been a different person ever since." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} TV Guide if he would've {{remained}} on General Hospital had the show's producers [...] "tried harder" [...] to accommodate his personal life, Burton stated: [...] "I don't {{want to point}} fingers. I {{know there are a}} lot of disappointed fans. They don't really understand what goes on behind the doors. They don't understand why I wouldn't go back to play Jason if I'm ready <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again.</b> But what happens at GH should stay at GH." [...] Phelps dismissed rumors that she has [...] "lured" [...] Burton away from General Hospital. While clarifying rumors about him leaving General Hospital because of Phelps' appointment as executive producer of The Young and the Restless, Burton described them as [...] "interesting". He told On-Air On-Soaps that he knew people would try to put [...] "two and two together", but it was never his intention to leave General Hospital purposely, as he just couldn't reach a contractual agreement with the show. [...] "It’s just like a sports player...when a deal does not work out with his team, there might be another team out there that might want him," [...] Burton said. During the week Burton debuted on the series as Dylan, the show experienced an increase of over 105,000 viewers, averaging 4.7 million viewers. Michael Fairman, during an interview with Burton, noted the [...] "significant increase" [...] in viewers, which Burton was a [...] "big reason" [...] for.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>again</b> in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I think you should do it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
