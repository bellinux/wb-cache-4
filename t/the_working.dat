5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the cylinder {{capacity in the}} USA. It {{is a measure of}} the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and <b>the</b> <b>working</b> pressure of a cylinder. If <b>the</b> <b>working</b> pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.|$|E
5|$|A {{hydrostatic}} test involves pressurising the cylinder to its test pressure (usually 5/3 or 3/2 of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> pressure) and measuring its volume {{before and after}} the test. A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means the cylinder fails the test and must be permanently removed from service.|$|E
