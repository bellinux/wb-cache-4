With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>incredible</b> love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

Bossy was also noted for his clean play, never resorting to fighting (and being one of the first players to speak out against violence on the ice), and winning the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play three times: 1983, 1984, and 1986.|$|E

25|$|On November 28, 2011, Ohio State {{announced}} that Urban Meyer {{was hired as}} head coach. Despite the program being on probation for NCAA violations and prohibited from appearing in a bowl for the 2012 season, the Buckeyes overcame a rash of injuries on defense in a season reminiscent of 2002 and completed a perfect 12–0 season with a victory over Michigan on November 24, 26–21. In one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>incredible</b> performances in college football history, Ohio State won the first ever College Football Playoff, with its third-string quarterback, Cardale Jones, after the starter and second-string quarterback were out to injury. Jones had never started in a college game. His first 3 starts were in the B1G Championship Game, the Sugar Bowl, and the National Championship Game. He went 3-0 to win the national championship. Many credit Urban Meyer with this being the best coaching job in college football history.. The next season brought with it expectations of a repeat championship as Ohio State returned many of its starters from the previous year. Ohio State {{would go on to}} compile a 13-1 record, with a crucial loss to Michigan State keeping them out of the College Football Playoff. In 2016, in spite of having the fewest returning starters of any team in the country, Ohio State would go on to win 11 games, but ultimately losing to Penn State in the regular season and Clemson in a crushing 31-0 defeat in the College Football Playoff Semifinal.|$|E

Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time.

[...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing.

The club swiftly appointed Alan Pardew, last of third-tier Southampton, although Newcastle fans were suspicious due to alleged links with the club's unpopular owners. Despite the club's form still being reasonable, the owner's unpopularity increased after the transfer deadline day sale of local hero Andy Carroll for £35 million to Liverpool.

500|$|In 2002, {{the band}} co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day. The tour was {{conceived}} by Blink-182 to echo the famous Monsters of Rock tours; {{the idea was}} to have, effectively, a Monsters of Punk tour. The tour, from the band's point of view, had been put together as a show of unity in the face of consistent accusations of rivalry between the two bands, especially in Europe. Instead, Green Day's Tré Cool acknowledged in a Kerrang! interview that they committed to the tour as an opportunity to regain their reputation as a great live band, as they felt their spotlight had faded over the years. [...] "We set out to reclaim our throne as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>incredible</b> live punk band from you know who," [...] said Cool. Cool contended that [...] "we heard they were going to quit the tour because they were getting smoked so badly... We didn't want them to quit the tour. They're good for filling up the seats up front." [...] Several reviewers were unimpressed with Blink-182's headlining set following Green Day. [...] "Sometimes playing last at a rock show is more a curse than a privilege... Pity the headliner, for instance, that gets blown off the stage by the band before it. Blink-182 endured that indignity Saturday at the Shoreline Amphitheatre," [...] a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in 2002.|$|E

At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as [...] "The King", Presley gestured toward Fats Domino, who was taking in the scene. [...] "No," [...] Presley said, [...] "that's the real king of rock and roll." [...] The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million. Newsweek commented, [...] "There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>incredible</b> is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars." [...] Rolling Stone called Presley [...] "supernatural, his own resurrection." [...] In November, Presley's final non-concert film, Change of Habit, opened. The double album From Memphis To Vegas/From Vegas To Memphis came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. [...] "Suspicious Minds" [...] {{reached the top of the}} charts—Presley's first U.S. pop number one in over seven years, and his last.|$|E
500|$|Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton {{describe}} de Lucía as a [...] "titanic {{figure in}} the world of flamenco guitar", highlighting his [...] "astounding technique and inventiveness" [...] and his broad range of musical ideas from other styles, such as Brazilian music and jazz. He is noted for his innovation and colour in harmony and his remarkable dexterity, technique, strength and fluidity in his right hand, capable of executing extremely fast and fluent picados. A master of contrast, he often juxtaposes picados with rasgueados and other techniques and often adds abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. Bill Milkowski of Down Beat described him as [...] "the portrait of studied concentration and pristine perfection: stiff backed and stern faced, with a distinguished air about him that some might misread as haughtiness. He's proud and majestic, like a regal Arabian steed prancing with grace and elegance, yet able to reveal great power." [...] Craig Harris of AllMusic noted his [...] "deeply personal melodic statements and modern instrumentation." [...] Atlanta magazine said, [...] "The guitar, when used properly, {{can be one of the}} most haunting and beautiful instruments to create sound... when he brushes his fingers across the strings, [...] can create some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>incredible</b> music. It's almost like a lullaby." [...] José Luis Acosta, president of the Spanish Artists and Editors Society stated that [...] "Paco was and will be a universal artist, who took the guitar and flamenco sentiment to the heart of the whole world." [...] In 2015, Billboard magazine named de Lucía as one of The 30 Most Influential Latin Artists of All Time, an editor writes: [...] "The virtuoso intrumentalist popularized flamenco worldwide, and brought the Spanish sound to the forefront of avant-garde jazz.". In the same year, he was posthumously inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame for his contributions to flamenco music. On December 21, 2016, Google commemorated the anniversary of de Lucia's birth with a Google Doodle shown in Spain, Mexico, and several South American nations.|$|E

And then, of course, holographic images that materialize in thin air and communicate with each other using artificial intelligence, indistinguishable from human consciousness.
