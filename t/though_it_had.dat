No injuries resulted but the crash delayed construction by a number of weeks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> large {{nostrils}} and a fleshy snout, Nigersaurus had an underdeveloped olfactory region of its brain and thus {{did not have}} an advanced sense of smell. Its brain-to-body-mass ratio was average for a reptile, and smaller than those of ornithischians and non-coelurosaurian theropods. The cerebrum comprised about 30% of the brain volume, as in many other dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of auxins in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can be applied as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of seedlings of various species of plants, including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it was used as a folk cure for tuberculosis, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> no effect. In more recent times, it has been found that L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} word planet, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> yet to be defined, had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in the Solar System. After 1992, however, astronomers began to {{discover}} many additional objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly large enough to be stars, while others were smaller than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a planet could be.|$|E
5|$|Even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{weakened}} to {{a depression}} when it moved inland, Cindy's effects were still significant across the final {{portion of its}} track. The day after its landfall in southeastern Louisiana, Tropical Depression Cindy reached central Alabama. There its rainbands produced heavy rainfall and eight tornadoes. Damage was mostly limited to trees and powerlines, but an F1 tornado in Macon county injured one man, destroyed an auto-repair shop, and damaged several nearby cars. About 35,000 residences in Alabama and 7,000 in both Florida and Mississippi were left without power following the storm.|$|E

5|$|In 1996 Canberra {{became the}} first {{city in the world}} to set a vision of no waste, proposing an ambitious target of 2010 for completion. The {{strategy}} aimed to achieve a waste-free society by 2010, through the combined efforts of industry, government and community. By early 2010, it was apparent that <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> reduced waste going to landfill, the ACT initiative's original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1658 Charles X and {{his forces}} reached Valby hill (current day Frederiksberg) {{from where they}} could {{overlook}} the Danish capital. His arrival was expected and the Danish king Frederick III had already ordered every building outside the city walls burnt, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> housed {{a third of the}} population of the city. That same day the city gates were closed and would not open again for another 22 months. A Swedish fleet of 28 ships blocked the harbor, preventing resupply by sea. The siege had begun.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{beryllium}} metal did {{not become}} readily available until 1957, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified magnesium. The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The Liberian Air Force was {{formally}} dissolved in 2005 {{as part of}} the armed forces demobilization programme, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> effectively ceased to exist during the civil war. For many years only the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) operated military aircraft in Liberia - Mi-8 transport and Mi-24 attack helicopters from Roberts International Airport with several subsidiary locations. With the reduction in strength of UNMIL ahead of its anticipated closure of operations in March 2018, these services were wound down.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Marine Corps F-4B-18-MC Phantom II, Bureau Number (BuNo) 151458, coded '458', {{had been}} in {{operation}} since April 15, 1964. At {{the time of the}} accident it was assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323, Marine Aircraft Group 11, 3rd Marine Air Wing, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been operated by various squadrons prior to that. The fighter plane was piloted by 1st Lt. James R. Phillips, age 27. The Radar Intercept Officer was 1st Lt. Christopher E. Schiess, age 24. The jet and its crew were based at MCAS El Toro.|$|E
5|$|The games {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Most critics {{praised the}} addition of Wi-Fi features and felt that the gameplay, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> not received much updating from previous games, was still engaging. Reviewers were divided on the graphics, however, and the audio was criticized as being primitive. The games enjoyed more commercial success than their Game Boy Advance predecessors: with around 18 million units sold worldwide, Diamond and Pearl have sold over 2 million more units than Ruby and Sapphire and almost 6 million more units than FireRed and LeafGreen, while outselling their successors, Black and White, by over 2 million copies.|$|E

5|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 30, 1910. The film saw a wide national release, with advertisements in Kansas, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nebraska, Arizona, and Oklahoma. The film was also shown by the Province Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been released years prior to its examination by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures, the film was approved without need any modifications or censoring.|$|E
5|$|The wordless novel genre had flourished {{primarily}} {{during the}} 1920s and 1930s, {{but by the}} 1940s even the most prolific practitioners had abandoned it. Hyde was familiar with some such works by Lynd Ward, Otto Nückel, and the form's pioneer Frans Masereel. The high-contrast artwork of Southern Cross features dynamic curving lines uncommon in wood engraving and combines abstract imagery with realistic detail. It has gained appreciation in comics circles as a precursor to the Canadian graphic novel, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> no direct influence.|$|E
5|$|While {{the library}} {{building}} {{dates to the}} early 20th century the move toward intellectual outreach in Oregon started years before. The first Oregon library was organized in 1872, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> no building of its own. Before the library had its own building, library books were stored in a drug store {{and then in the}} County Treasurer's office. Eventually the Oregon Library occupied rented office space in the First National Bank building. This situation persisted until 1905 when Oregon voters voiced their collective opinion on the library's future.|$|E

To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Anderson met Todd and Quantrill on September 24, 1864; {{although}} they had clashed in the past, they agreed to work together. Anderson suggested that they attack Fayette, Missouri, targeting the 9th Missouri Cavalry, which was based at the town. Quantrill disliked the idea because the town was fortified, but Anderson and Todd prevailed. Clad in Union uniforms, the guerrillas generated little suspicion {{as they approached the}} town, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> received warning of nearby guerrillas. However, a guerrilla fired his weapon before they reached the town, and the cavalry quickly withdrew into their fort while civilians hid. Anderson and Todd launched an unsuccessful attack against the fort, leading charge after futile charge without injury. The defeat resulted in the deaths of five guerrillas but only two Union soldiers, further maddening Anderson.|$|E
5|$|At 2045 hrs, {{another person}} on {{duty in the}} control tower {{received}} a call to track the mysterious craft on radar. For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons storage area, when it suddenly vanished, as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> landed or dropped below the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve miles to the east. Messages {{were sent to the}} National Military Command Center, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued to remain on a high state of alert until the following morning, as efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.|$|E
