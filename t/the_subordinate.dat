5|$|Alyssa {{is given}} no {{weaponry}} during {{the majority of}} the game, other than a limited supply of holy water, which can be used to temporarily stun pursuing Subordinates. Within each level, <b>the</b> <b>Subordinate</b> can appear in any location after a set period of time, but also randomly or if Alyssa makes noise. They also appear in certain set locations. When one appears, it immediately begins to chase Alyssa, attempting to kill her. The player must either hide from or evade it. Evasion can only be accomplished in certain places, and each evasion point can only be used once. Using an evasion point does not kill <b>the</b> <b>Subordinate,</b> but instead renders them unconscious for a set time. The primary means of eluding one, however, is by hiding. There are multiple hiding points throughout each level, and each one can be used multiple times. However, hiding places are ineffective if <b>the</b> <b>Subordinate</b> sees Alyssa enter them.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prerogative orders, the equitable remedy of a declaration {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. In contrast to the prerogative orders which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between private parties. Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases; although <b>the</b> <b>Subordinate</b> Courts are generally empowered by <b>the</b> <b>Subordinate</b> Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action {{in which there is}} no claim for any sum of money.|$|E

5|$|The contemporative mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if the subject of <b>the</b> <b>subordinate</b> clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative {{can also be used}} to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.|$|E
5|$|The participial mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} a subordinate clause describing its subject {{in the state of}} carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix clause and <b>the</b> <b>subordinate</b> clause have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as relative clauses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the US Army {{considered}} new {{options for}} the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected. <b>The</b> <b>subordinate</b> brigades of the divisions did not activate so they could not be deployed as divisions, however their active duty status would allow the headquarters to focus on the national guard units under them full-time.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>subordinate</b> clause the subject, if {{different}} from the subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative clauses) usually require that if the subject is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Cold War, the US Army {{considered}} new options for the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment.

5|$|No {{definite}} conclusion as to {{the date}} of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus.

5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and <b>the</b> <b>subordinate</b> arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E
5|$|Syntactic {{coordination}} and subordination {{is done by}} combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in <b>the</b> <b>subordinate</b> moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context. The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to pragmatic concerns.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{mathematics}} of probability, a subordinator {{is a concept}} related to stochastic processes.

The vice commander is also an assistant of the wing commander, serving as the coordinator of various special projects.

5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which <b>the</b> <b>subordinate</b> tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E
