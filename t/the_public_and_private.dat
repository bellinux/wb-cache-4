Both <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> have been reconstituted as spheres of information and symbolic content that are largely detached from physical locales and increasingly interwoven with evolving technologies of communication, creating a very fluid situation in which <b>the</b> boundaries between <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> are blurred, porous, contestable and subject to constant negotiation and struggle.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a core city by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, {{the city has been}} looking towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (station area renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 is an example of cooperation between <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> sectors, with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E
