At present, the {{automotive}} industry standard, material standards stipulate battery life {{is not less than}} 500 times to use during charging and discharging the battery every 1 to 2 times, the battery should be scrapped after 2 to 3 years.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{single-phase}} reconfigurable battery charger for Electric Vehicle (EV) that operates {{in three different}} modes: Grid-to-Vehicle (G 2 V) mode, in which <b>the</b> <b>traction</b> <b>batteries</b> are charged from the power grid; Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) mode, in which <b>the</b> <b>traction</b> <b>batteries</b> deliver part of the stored energy back to the power grid; and in Traction-to-Auxiliary (T 2 A) mode, in which the auxiliary battery is charged from <b>the</b> <b>traction</b> <b>batteries.</b> When connected to the power grid, the battery charger works with sinusoidal current in the AC side, for both G 2 V and V 2 G modes, and also regulates the reactive power. When the EV is disconnected from the power grid, the control algorithms are modified and the full-bridge AC-DC bidirectional converter works as a full-bridge isolated DC-DC converter {{that is used to}} charge the auxiliary battery of the EV, avoiding the use of an additional charger to accomplish this task. To assess the behavior of the proposed reconfigurable battery charger under different operation scenarios, a 3. 6 kW laboratory prototype has been developed and experimental results are presented.

50|$|The {{hybrid system}} {{includes}} a new high-voltage battery and inverter, {{and a smaller}} auxiliary 12 volt battery. Both batteries are housed underneath the rear passenger bench seat, and are easily accessible to service personnel, yet are protected from possible collision damage by a welded tubular steel cage which also acts as support for the rear seat.

40|$|This article investigates {{charging}} {{strategies for}} plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) {{as part of}} the energy system. The objective was to increase the combined all-electric mileage (total distance driven using only <b>the</b> <b>traction</b> <b>batteries</b> in each PHEV) when the total charging power at each workplace is subject to severe limitations imposed by the energy system. In order to allocate this power optimally, different input variables, such as state-of-charge, battery size, travel distance, and parking time, were considered. The required vehicle mobility was generated using a novel agent-based model that describes the spatiotemporal movement of individual PHEVs. The results show that, in the case of Helsinki (Finland), smart control strategies could lead to an increase of over 5 % in the all-electric mileage compared to a no-control strategy. With a high prediction error, or with a particularly small or large battery, the benefits of smart charging fade off. Smart PHEV charging strategies, when applied to the optimal allocation of limited charging power between the cars of a vehicle fleet, seem counterintuitively to provide only a modest increase in the all-electric mileage. A simple charging strategy based on allocating power to PHEVs equally could thus perform sufficiently well. This finding may be important for the future planning of smart grids as limiting the charging power of larger PHEV fleets will sometimes be necessary as a result of grid restrictions.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} the INSTAR system: a high-power, cost-effective energy storage system designed to improve HEV regenerative braking capabilities by combining chemical batteries with an electromechanical flywheel. This combination allows the regenerative braking system in hybrid vehicles to recapture more available braking energy at a lower battery pack charging current, increasing vehicle energy efficiency while also potentially increasing battery life. A prototype flywheel energy storage system and electric vehicle test platform were built to test the design.
