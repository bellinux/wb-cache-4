50|$|Typically, {{polyurethane}} or vinyl {{materials are}} used to make <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> A tube shaped bag is open at both ends. The piece, or pieces to be glued are placed into <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> and <b>the</b> ends sealed. One method of sealing the open ends of <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> is by placing a clamp on each end of <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> A plastic rod is laid across the end of <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> is then folded over the rod. A plastic sleeve with an opening in it, is then snapped over the rod. This procedure forms a seal {{at both ends of}} <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> when <b>the</b> vacuum is ready to be drawn.|$|R
40|$|The method {{involves}} {{inserting a}} bag (1) through a patient opening i. e. naked incision, in an abdominal wall. Tissue is delivered into a bag opening (2) of <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> opening is withdrawn {{back through the}} patient opening. <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> is sealed. <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> is inflated to create an artificial pneumoperitoneum that extends an abdomen and provides an additional working and viewing space. Laparoscopic procedure is carried out on the tissue located in <b>the</b> inflated <b>bag</b> by sealably inserting a morcellator into <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> <b>The</b> tissue is retrieved by pulling <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> out through <b>the</b> patient opening...|$|R

5|$|The twins {{had been}} in Ireland before {{travelling}} to England and boarding a coach for London at Liverpool. Their odd behaviour after exiting the coach at a service station on the M6 – including not allowing <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> they were clutching to be searched – caused the driver not to allow them back on the coach. The two were later seen on the central reservation of the M6. When Highways Agency Traffic Officers arrived to assist the women, they ran across the busy motorway. Ursula managed to dodge traffic; Sabina was first struck by a SEAT León.|$|E
5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E
5|$|However, out at {{the site}} of the accident, it was {{discovered}} that <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E

The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees.

5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. <b>The</b> <b>bags</b> were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E
5|$|John Halifax, Gentleman is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is the first film adaptation of Dinah Maria Mulock Craik's popular novel John Halifax, Gentleman and stars Martin Faust as John Halifax. The film focuses on John Halifax, an orphan who is taken in by a rich Quaker, Abel Fletcher. After a period of five years, John has becomes a foreman and he and Fletcher's invalid son, Phineas, have become good friends. Despite Fletcher's objections, John takes Phineas to the theatre. The trip {{is too much for}} Phineas and John carries him home, Fletcher becomes irate and drives John out of the house. Fletcher is soon confronts a mob of workers after closing the mill and throws <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> of grain into the river. John saves the life of Fletcher and his son and marries Ursula, the daughter of the richest man in town. The production credits are unknown, but the film was not directed by Theodore Marston. The film was released on December 2, 1910 and was met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
50|$|A rod {{connecting}} to <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> {{is powered by}} a motor. This provides motion to remove caked-on particles. The speed and motion of the shaking depends on the design of <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> and composition of the particulate matter. Generally shaking is horizontal. The top of <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> is closed and the bottom is open. When shaken, the dust collected on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> is freed. During the cleaning process, no dirty gas flows through a <b>bag</b> while <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> is being cleaned. This redirection of air flow illustrates why baghouses must be compartmentalized.|$|R
50|$|Like other bagworms, L. omnivora {{caterpillars}} {{construct and}} live within a small, mobile, tapering bag of silk, which provides camouflage and protection to <b>the</b> caterpillar. <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> is lengthened at the broad or mouth end as the caterpillar grows.
