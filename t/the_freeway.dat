5|$|After {{crossing}} Golden Avenue, I-194 curves to {{the northwest}} to meet the M-96 (Columbia Avenue) interchange. <b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> runs underneath the Columbia Avenue overpass before running parallel {{to the west bank}} of the Kalamazoo River. <b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> crosses the river at the southern end of Lower Mill Pond. Curving back around to the northeast, I-194 meets Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94, Dickman Road). Here the AADT counts average 24,400vehicles a day. <b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> ends at an at-grade intersection with Hamblin Avenue, and continuing north of the intersection, the highway becomes just M-66. BLI-94 runs east of <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> end on Hamblin Avenue to connect to Michigan Avenue. All of I-194 is listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways, and it is concurrent with M-66 for the length of <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> {{continues}} northward through rural Central Michigan farmlands. <b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> passes {{near the}} Looking Glass River near DeWitt. At Price Road, Bus. US127 splits off to connect into St. Johns while <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> bypasses {{the city to}} the east. US127 intersects M-21 due east of downtown St. Johns before <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> curves west and then north to intersect the northern end of the business loop. North of this interchange, for about , US127 follows an expressway segment. It is a four-lane divided highway with some local driveway access and cross traffic through at-grade intersections.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> {{was first}} built in Indiana in the 1960s, {{although}} plans in Michigan {{date back to}} the 1950s. Indiana completed its portion of <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> in 1998, while Michigan has opened its last segment in 2003. Further plans, if completed, would extend <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> from the current end to the north. The ultimate end will either be at the interchange between Interstate 196 (I-196) and I-94 as originally planned, or another interchange immediately to the southwest. Environmental and other issues have forced a re-evaluation of the original 1981 plans for the northern end of <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b>|$|E
50|$|Freeways {{that were}} built {{throughout}} the 1960s and 1970s included the South Eastern Arterial (now part of <b>the</b> Monash <b>Freeway),</b> <b>the</b> Tullamarine <b>Freeway,</b> <b>the</b> Lower Yarra <b>Freeway</b> (now West Gate <b>Freeway)</b> and <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Freeway.</b>|$|R
50|$|From <b>the</b> Harbor <b>Freeway</b> to its {{intersection}} with <b>the</b> Long Beach <b>Freeway</b> {{in northern}} Long Beach, SR 91 is named <b>the</b> Gardena <b>Freeway.</b> Between <b>the</b> Long Beach <b>Freeway</b> and its intersection with <b>the</b> Santa Ana <b>Freeway</b> at <b>the</b> Fullerton-Anaheim border, it is named <b>the</b> Artesia <b>Freeway.</b> From <b>the</b> Santa Ana <b>Freeway</b> to its eastern terminus {{at the intersection}} of the Pomona, Moreno Valley, and Escondido Freeways, it is named <b>the</b> Riverside <b>Freeway.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between <b>the</b> Santa Ana <b>Freeway,</b> Interstate 5 (I-5), in Buena Park and <b>the</b> 91 <b>Freeway's</b> eastern {{terminus}} at a junction with Interstate 215 and State Route 60 in Riverside, <b>the</b> 91 <b>Freeway's</b> assigned name is <b>the</b> Riverside <b>Freeway.</b> Past <b>the</b> I-215/CA-60/CA-91 junction, <b>the</b> Riverside <b>Freeway</b> {{continues as}} I-215.|$|R
5|$|US219 and US220 both overlap I-68 in Garrett County, and Cumberland, respectively, and US40 {{overlaps}} with <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> from Keysers Ridge {{to the eastern}} end of <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> at Hancock.|$|E
5|$|A partial stack {{interchange}} involving I-80, Redwood Road, and {{the access}} road to Salt Lake City International Airport is next. <b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> loses one lane {{in each direction}} as the interstate passes the airport to the east. Two diamond interchanges at 700North and 2100North occur as <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> approaches Davis County. Past 2100North, <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> enters rural Salt Lake County, and the road curves to the northwest. An interchange at Legacy Parkway gives northbound I-215 motorists and southbound Legacy Parkway motorists their respective connections. The road turns east and loses one lane in each direction. There is a diamond interchange at SR-68 before the highway merges into northbound I-15 in North Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> opened, traffic volumes along {{parallel}} roads like 44th, 56th and 68th streets dropped 40–50%. At the same time, roads with interchanges along <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> saw increased traffic. Wilson Avenue experienced a 120% increase and sections of Byron Center Avenue jumped 100% in traffic levels {{a month after}} M-6 opened. Property values in the townships surrounding <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> increased 11.3–12.4% by 2006 {{as a result of}} development attached to <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b> Local officials credited <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> for increased access to the area, driving housing starts as residents flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life. In 2007, the Metro Health Village, a commercial development centered around the Byron Center Avenue exit and the hospital opened. Described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant, the village features restaurants, shops, offices and a hotel. Metro Health relocated from Grand Rapids to the location in Wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location. Since opening, even though <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> was officially named for Paul Henry, the original South Beltline name is still in use.|$|E
50|$|In Mainland China, two-wheel {{motorcycles}} driven on <b>the</b> <b>freeways</b> may {{not carry}} passengers. A vehicle must {{be capable of}} maintaining a speed of 70 km/h to be driven on <b>the</b> <b>freeways.</b> However, in many Chinese provinces, motorcycles cannot use expressways at all.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Ventura <b>Freeway</b> {{suffers from}} severe congestion. Its {{intersection}} with <b>the</b> San Diego <b>Freeway,</b> in Sherman Oaks, is consistently rated {{as one of}} the five most congested interchanges in the nation. Where it meets <b>the</b> Hollywood <b>Freeway</b> at <b>the</b> Hollywood Split junction, it is also notably congested. During events at the Rose Bowl, <b>the</b> <b>freeway's</b> eastern portions often resemble a parking lot.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Redondo Beach <b>Freeway</b> (SR 91) {{would have}} linked <b>the</b> Pacific Coast <b>Freeway</b> in Redondo Beach or <b>the</b> San Diego <b>Freeway</b> (I-405) in Torrance to <b>the</b> Long Beach <b>Freeway</b> (I-710). Opposition by Redondo Beach and Torrance {{led to its}} {{truncation}} to its current terminus at <b>the</b> Harbor <b>Freeway</b> (I-110) in Gardena; the California legislature subsequently renamed it <b>the</b> Gardena <b>Freeway.</b>|$|R
5|$|An {{intermediate}} interchange with US50 provides {{access to}} southern Jackson County, and to Raytown to the north via Route 350, a former alignment of US50 before the construction of I-470. Plans for a southern freeway were first published in 1955, and the first portions of I-470 were completed in 1970. By 1983 the entire freeway was open to traffic. Since construction two new interchanges have been constructed, along with {{the expansion of the}} US50 cloverleaf. In 2010, part of <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> was closed by the Grandview Triangle due to a landslide underneath <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b> Between about 38,000 and 75,000vehicles use <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> on an average day.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the M-76 {{designation}} was decommissioned in 1973, most of the overall highway had been converted to freeway. It started southwest of Standish at an interchange with US23 in southern Arenac County. <b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> ran northward through fields to a junction with M-61 where it turned northwesterly. M-76 passed to the southwest of Sterling and over {{a tributary of the}} Tittabawassee River as <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> approaches Alger through a forested area. In Ogemaw County, the trunkline ran south and west of Greenwood and continued to the West Branch area. There, M-76 met the southeastern end of its business loop that ran north into downtown. <b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> bypassed the town to the southwest, passed over M-30 without an interchange and then met the northwestern end of the business loop. While M-76 was still an active highway designation, this second business loop junction marked the end of <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> in the area. M-76 turned west, merging onto M-55 to run concurrently along a two-lane highway.|$|E
5|$|By 1974, the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> that US-64 was to occupy in Tulsa was complete, and it was relocated onto the completed portion of <b>the</b> <b>freeway.</b> Only the portion in the downtown {{section of the city}} was yet to be completed. The remainder of <b>the</b> <b>freeway,</b> the concurrency with Interstate 444, was not completed until about 1983. The next and final major modification to the designation of US-64 took place when it was moved from its route through eastern Tulsa onto the newly constructed Creek Turnpike over the first half of 1992. The route has undergone only minor changes since then.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>freeway's</b> western {{terminus}} is {{a hybrid}} interchange, combining a Full Y interchange with <b>the</b> Mitchell <b>Freeway,</b> an exit to James Street, and an entrance ramp from and exit ramp to Loftus Street. The interchange also incorporates a partial Y interchange that connects Charles Street to <b>the</b> Mitchell <b>Freeway.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the major}} source of {{resistance}} to <b>the</b> <b>freeway's</b> construction was community opposition and the side effects of these demands. By the early 1970s, most of the areas in <b>the</b> <b>freeway's</b> path (and thus slated to be demolished) were predominantly African-American. Resentment over previous freeway projects' effects on other black communities resulted in significant modifications to the original route. Most cities along the way, weary of the noise and visual blight created by elevated <b>freeways,</b> demanded that <b>the</b> route be built far below grade in a [...] "trench." [...] Also another source for resistance to <b>the</b> <b>freeway's</b> construction was that much of the areas along the I-105 path was going to be built in low income, high crime neighborhoods, which also delayed <b>the</b> <b>freeway's</b> construction until <b>the</b> crime in the areas went down.|$|R
50|$|The San Gabriel Valley {{is served}} by several major <b>freeways,</b> {{including}} <b>the</b> San Bernardino <b>Freeway</b> (Interstate 10), Foothill Freeway (I-210), San Gabriel River <b>Freeway</b> (I-605), and <b>the</b> Long Beach <b>Freeway</b> (I-710). State highways include <b>the</b> Orange <b>Freeway</b> (State Route 57), <b>the</b> Pomona <b>Freeway</b> (State Route 60), Ventura Freeway (State Route 134), and <b>the</b> Pasadena <b>Freeway</b> (State Route 110).|$|R
5|$|Construction {{began on}} the {{southern}} portion of SR75 in mid-1974. In January 1976, the part of SR75 between I-805 and Otay Mesa Road was opened to traffic. On April 6, the next portion of <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> opened. However, there were concerns about what to call <b>the</b> <b>freeway,</b> citing confusion with the northern portion of SR75. The entire cost {{of the project was}} $6.3million. SR117 was extended east to SR125, replacing the southerly segment of SR75, by the Legislature in 1976; this took effect at the beginning of 1977. Estimates for completing <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> ran from $13.8million to $28.5million.|$|E
5|$|I-94/US25 ran northeasterly through {{rural areas}} of Macomb County, {{intersecting}} {{the southern end of}} M-19 near New Haven. <b>The</b> <b>freeway</b> crossed into rural southern St. Clair County south of Richmond and continued northeastward to Marysville, where it turned northward, crossing Gratiot Avenue. A business loop, Business US25 (Bus. US25) ran northeasterly from <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> along Gratiot Avenue to run parallel to the St. Clair River. From Marysville, <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> skirted the western side of the Port Huron area, intersecting the M-21 freeway immediately east of the city before turning eastward to curve around the north side of town. After <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> crossed the Black River, US25 turned northward to separate from I-94.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, RIDOT {{reviewed}} {{plans for}} an eastern extension of Route 37. The department conducted planning studies on two proposed freeway alignments that would extend Route 37 into Downtown Warwick.

50|$|I-210's western {{terminus}} {{is at its}} junction with <b>the</b> Golden State <b>Freeway</b> (I-5), near <b>the</b> Sylmar {{district of}} Los Angeles. From that point, <b>the</b> <b>freeway's</b> alignment is generally diagonal as it heads southeast through the northeastern San Fernando Valley and the Crescenta Valley. After leaving Los Angeles, it enters northern Glendale and meets with <b>the</b> Glendale <b>Freeway</b> (State Route 2) before turning due south towards the junction with <b>the</b> Ventura <b>Freeway</b> (State Route 134) in Pasadena. At this interchange, <b>the</b> Foothill <b>Freeway</b> shifts its alignment and direction, becoming an east-west <b>freeway.</b> From <b>the</b> north, the primary through lanes of I-210 become the unsigned northern stub of unfinished I-710, while from the east, the through lanes of <b>the</b> Ventura <b>Freeway</b> become I-210 as <b>the</b> Ventura <b>Freeway</b> reaches its official eastern terminus. After intersecting the northern terminus of I-605 (the San Gabriel River Freeway), I-210 then continues east to <b>the</b> Orange <b>Freeway</b> (State Route 57) in Glendora. Heading east from <b>the</b> Orange <b>Freeway</b> interchange, until its eastern terminus at I-10 in Redlands, 210 is currently signed as a state route.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, MDOT {{announced}} a construction project along the US23/US223 freeway in southern Monroe County what would rebuild the northbound lanes of <b>the</b> <b>freeway</b> between exits1 and 5 {{in addition to}} improving the interchange ramps in the area.
