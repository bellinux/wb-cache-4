5|$|The {{earliest}} accurate {{method to}} measure {{the value of the}} Avogadro constant was based on coulometry. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> {{to measure the}} Faraday constant, F, which is the electric charge carried by one mole of electrons, and to divide by the elementary charge, e, to obtain the Avogadro constant.|$|E

25|$|In fluid dynamics, Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{states that}} {{an increase in}} the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> named after Daniel Bernoulli who published it in his book Hydrodynamica in 1738.|$|E
25|$|It {{explains}} {{that there is}} a cause for every effect, and an effect for every cause.

50|$|<b>The</b> Rochdale <b>Principles</b> <b>are</b> {{a set of}} ideals for the {{operation}} of cooperatives. They were first set out in 1844 by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in Rochdale, England and have {{formed the basis for}} <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> on which co-operatives around the world continue to operate. The implications of <b>the</b> Rochdale <b>Principles</b> <b>are</b> a focus of study in co-operative economics. <b>The</b> original Rochdale <b>Principles</b> <b>were</b> officially adopted by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) in 1937 as <b>the</b> Rochdale <b>Principles</b> of Co-operation. Updated versions of <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>were</b> adopted by <b>the</b> ICA in 1966 as <b>the</b> Co-operative <b>Principles</b> and in 1995 as part of the Statement on the Co-operative Identity.|$|R
25|$|The {{creeping}} flow {{results can}} be applied in order to study the settling of sediments near the ocean bottom and the fall of moisture drops in the atmosphere. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> also applied in the falling sphere viscometer, an experimental device {{used to measure the}} viscosity of highly viscous fluids, for example oil, parrafin, tar etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of linguistic relativity {{holds that the}} structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition. Popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, or Whorfianism, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> often defined to include two versions. The strong version says that language determines thought, and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories, whereas the weak version says that linguistic categories and usage only influence thought and decisions.|$|E
25|$|Galileo Galilei lampooned {{the misuse}} of Occam's razor in his Dialogue. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> {{represented}} in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from {{a small number of}} entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.|$|E

25|$|The {{fluidized}} bed filter (FBF) is a biological reactor only. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> to direct water through a sand (or similar media) bed from below {{so that the}} sand becomes fluidized – behaves like a fluid. This mechanism is seen in liquefaction, quick sand, and industrial processes including municipal sewage treatment. The combined surface of all sand particles in the filter is very large, {{and so there is}} a large surface for aerobic denitrification bacteria. Therefore, the size of the filter can be modest.|$|E
25|$|By {{use of a}} {{permanent}} magnet in the magnetic circuit, a relay {{can be made to}} respond to current in one direction differently from in another. Such polarized relays are used on direct-current circuits to detect, for example, reverse current into a generator. These relays can be made bistable, maintaining a contact closed with no coil current and requiring reverse current to reset. For AC circuits, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> extended with a polarizing winding connected to a reference voltage source.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as {{a working}} fluid, have been {{proposed}} and occasionally used. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to that used}} in a fireless locomotive, but with ammonia as the working fluid, instead of steam or compressed air. Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by Goldsworthy Gurney in the UK and the St. Charles Avenue Streetcar line in New Orleans in the 1870s and 1880s, and during World War II ammonia was used to power buses in Belgium.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Principles</b> <b>were</b> {{drafted by}} <b>The</b> Hague Institute for Global Justice, and {{launched}} at the centenary celebrations of the Peace Palace on August 28, 2013. <b>The</b> <b>principles</b> <b>were</b> presented to King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in the Palace’s Great Hall of Justice. <b>The</b> Hague Approach <b>Principles</b> have subsequently <b>been</b> endorsed by {{current and former}} UN and global leaders including San-Hyun Song, Judy Cheng-Hopkins and Jan Eliasson.|$|R

25|$|An {{absolute}} pacifist {{is generally}} {{described by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation as one who believes that human life is so valuable, that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> described as difficult to abide by consistently, due to violence not being available {{as a tool to}} aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} of <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> {{to be found}} in the work of George Berkeley (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against materialism, stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find solipsism itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.|$|E
25|$|Antibodies from Lymphocyte Secretion or Antibody in Lymphocyte Supernatant or ALS Assay is an {{immunological}} assay {{to detect}} active diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid etc. Recently, ALS assay nods {{the scientific community}} as it is rapidly used for diagnosis of tuberculosis. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> based on the secretion of antibody from in vivo activated plasma B cells found in blood circulation {{for a short period}} of time in response to TB-antigens during active TB infection rather than latent TB infection.|$|E
50|$|Certain <b>principles</b> may not <b>be</b> {{applicable}} to different displays or situations.

25|$|Philidor's defense {{can also}} be used with the black rook on the fourth rank, if White's king and pawn have not reached that rank. If this defense is used, the black king should be on the second rank. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> the same: Black keeps his rook on the fourth rank, keeping the white king from {{advancing}} to that rank. If the pawn advances to that rank, Black moves the rook to the eighth rank and checks the king from behind.|$|E
25|$|Müllerian mimicry. Müller's great {{discovery}} {{concerned the}} resemblance between {{two or more}} unpalatable species which are protected from predators capable of learning. The protection is often a noxious chemical, perhaps gained from the larva eating a particular plant; {{or it may be}} a sting or other defence. It is an advantage for such potential prey to advertise their status in a way clearly perceptible to their predators; this is called aposematic or warning coloration. <b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> of wide application, but in Muller's case the prey were butterflies, and the predators usually birds or reptiles.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>is</b> {{to allow}} water to {{evaporate}} {{at the top}} of a tower, either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water. Evaporation cools the incoming air, causing a downdraft of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building. Airflow can be increased by using a solar chimney on the opposite side of the building to help in venting hot air to the outside. This concept has been used for the Visitor Center of Zion National Park. The Visitor Center was designed by the High Performance Buildings Research of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).|$|E
