5|$|Scalia doesn't {{come into}} oral {{argument}} all secretive and sphinxlike, feigning indecision on <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> {{the case before}} him. He comes in like a medieval knight, girded for battle. He knows what the law is. He knows what the opinion should say. And he uses the hour allocated for argument to bludgeon his brethren into agreement.|$|E
5|$|Whether playing Dixieland, bebop, or avant-garde jazz, in big bands or {{in small}} groups, Manne's self-professed goal {{was to make the}} music swing. His fellow musicians attested to his {{listening}} appreciatively to those around him and being ultra-sensitive to the needs and <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> the music played by the others in the band, his goal being to make themand the music as a wholesound better, rather than calling attention to himself with overbearing solos.|$|E
5|$|Working as an {{additional}} producer, Don Was helped keep Weiland's {{and the rest of}} the band's separate recording sessions in sync by bringing them together to perform live. When the band performed together, they would do so acoustically, so each member could hear <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> the songs. Weiland credited Was for helping Stone Temple Pilots re-learn how to play together again. Was also worked closely with Weiland during the recording of the vocals.|$|E

5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, and they would often go through <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. He suggests that Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that he took from a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E

25|$|The second {{purpose of}} the 8LMQs is to {{transition}} ‘teaching’ from ‘teacher centred activities’ to a more responsive ‘student-centred learning' approaches.

25|$|Many psychotherapists {{believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> {{psychotherapy}} cannot {{be captured by}} questionnaire-style observation, and prefer to rely on their own clinical experiences and conceptual arguments to support the type of treatment they practice.

The rhythm is no longer as slow as in earlier generations. Nowadays, dhakis opt for faster rhythms. Earlier, different beats were used for specific aspects of Durga Puja, as for example chokhhu daan (eye presentation), patha bali (goat sacrifice), bisarjan (immersion ceremony), sandhya arati (evening offerings), sandhipuja (worshiping at the conjunction of two phases), and so on.|$|E

She also was granted access to CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and was able to personally consult with the female CIA officer whom the Carrie Mathison character was loosely based on.|$|E
25|$|Each one of Poussin's {{paintings}} told a story. Though he {{had little}} formal education, Poussin became very knowledgeable in <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> religious history, mythology and classical literature, and, usually after consulting with his clients, took his subjects from these topics. Many of his paintings combined several different incidents, occurring at different times, into the same painting, in order to tell the story, and the affetti, or facial expressions of the participants, showed their different reactions. Aside from his self-portraits, Poussin never painted contemporary subjects.|$|E

25|$|Another ethical {{issue of}} some concern is how virtual reality is use by clinicians in that clinicians should be {{certified}} to use virtual reality for their clients/patients. Due {{to the relative}} newness of virtual reality exposure, {{there may not be}} many clinicians who have experience with <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> virtual reality exposure and the therapy that virtual reality exposure is meant to be used for. According to Rizzo et al. (2003), virtual reality technology should only be used as a tool for qualified clinicians instead of being used to further one's practice or garner an attraction for new clients/patients.|$|E
25|$|Formal {{logic is}} the study of {{inference}} with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. The works of Aristotle contain the earliest known formal study of logic. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle. In many definitions of logic, logical inference and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> natural language.|$|E
25|$|Nadal won the 2013 French Open {{after beating}} Djokovic in the {{semifinal}} and Ferrer in the final, breaking {{the record for}} the most match wins in the tournament in the process with his 59th match victory. His match with Djokovic was widely considered one of the greatest clay court matches ever played, as Nadal came back from down a break in the fifth set to take out a hard-fought 4-hour, 37-minute victory. However, because of <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> how rankings are calculated (including an improvement in performance by the then world No. 5 David Ferrer at the French Open), Nadal's world ranking dropped from No. 4 to No. 5, with Ferrer replacing him at No. 4.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>nuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court's holding, {{consider this}} explanation: Congress decides {{to implement a}} uniform tax on all coal mining. The tax so implemented distinguishes between different grades of coal (e.g., anthracite versus bituminous versus lignite) and exempts one of the grades from taxation. Even though the exempted grade could potentially be defined by where it is geographically produced, the tax itself is still geographically uniform.|$|R
50|$|Plurals formed morphologically, however, have <b>the</b> added <b>nuance</b> <b>of</b> distribution, e.g. babbalasang ("each/every young woman"). Neither {{method of}} pluralization is exclusive. Plural {{articles}} commonly occur with morphological plurals.|$|R
5000|$|This {{widespread}} use of variations implies a level of ambiguity carried by <b>the</b> <b>nuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third constraint term and of course a level of value in {{the flexibility of the}} Triangle Model. This ambiguity allows blurred focus between a project's output and project's process, with the example terms above having potentially different impetus in the two contexts. Both [...] "Cost" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] represent the top level project's inputs.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} said that <b>the</b> <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> the term {{reasonable}} may have allowed the UK courts to deal with the merits of grievances rather than questions of legality, and hence to engage in judicial policy-making. However, it seems that Singapore courts have so far avoided substituting their opinion for that of decision-makers in applying the Wednesbury test. In Lines International, the High Court clearly noted that in considering Wednesbury unreasonableness courts are not entitled to substitute their views of how the discretion should be exercised, nor is unreasonableness established if the court is of the view that the policy or guideline may not work as effectively as another. This principle has been adopted and emphasized in subsequent cases. In City Developments the court declined to interfere with the Chief Assessor's assessment of the annual value of the applicant's real property for property tax purposes, finding his explanations logical and commonsensical. The courts came to similar conclusions in Chee Siok Chin and Kang Ngah Wei.|$|E
