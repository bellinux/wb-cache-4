The only article which might be {{designated}} furniture was the stove, and for this the men were frank in displaying their preference. Upon half of the floor pine boughs had been cast; above this were spread the sleeping-furs, beneath lay the winter's snowfall. The remainder of the floor was moccasin-packed snow, littered with pots and pans and the general impedimenta of an Arctic camp. The stove was red and roaring hot, but only a bare three feet away lay a block of ice, as sharp-edged and dry as when first quarried from the creek bottom. The pressure of the outside cold forced the inner heat upward. Just above the stove, where the pipe penetrated the roof, was a tiny circle of dry canvas; next, with the pipe always as centre, a circle of steaming canvas; next a damp and moisture-exuding ring; and finally, the rest of the tent, sidewalls and <b>top,</b> <b>coated</b> with a half-inch of dry, white, crystal-encrusted frost.|$|E

30|$|A TBC is a {{multilayer}} {{coating system}} {{that consists of}} an insulating ceramic outer layer (<b>top</b> <b>coat)</b> and a metallic inner layer (bond coat) between the ceramic and the substrate. The function of the ceramic <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> is to insulate the metallic substrate from high surface temperature, thereby lowering the component’s temperature and reducing the oxidation and hot corrosion of bond coatings while simultaneously reducing cyclic thermal strains (Gurrappa and Sambasiva 2006). Recently, Kitazawa et al. (2010) have reported that a temperature gradient of 150 °C {{can be achieved by}} using a ceramic TBC (Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 <b>top</b> <b>coat)</b> on superalloy components. In most cases, the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> and bond coats are applied by plasma spraying; however, sputtering and electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD) are also used. The commonly used method of thermal spraying of TBCs on developed metal surfaces involves a metallic bond coating either by cold spraying (CS) or by low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) followed by deposition of a ceramic <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> by either air plasma spraying (APS) or EBPVD.|$|R

40|$|Due to a {{manufacturing}} issue {{within the company}} the {{lack of knowledge of}} a key material is highlighted. Research into the material is conducted under seal testing and mechanical properties. The material is multilayered, with aluminium foil as its core plus is <b>top</b> <b>coated</b> and has a sealant layer as its bottom coating. Background literary review commences with a chronological assessment of packaging down through the ages and culminates with details on multilayered materials, concentrating on the type of material being researched. A test plan details the research requirements. Seal testing consists of burst and peel testing of the material in its final package configuration and utilises two blister package sizes. A test on the variation of the actual burst tester itself is also undertaken. The mechanical properties include basic measurement analysis, tensile testing and puncture resistance. These tests are conducted where appropriate on two versions of the multilayered material whose only difference is the thickness of the aluminium foil. All results are analysed using a mixture of statistical as well as graphical techniques. Discussion on the results includes the statistics and leads to a number of conclusions on what effects seal strength, which blister produces the easier peel and where cost savings can be made with the current configuration. The conclusions also highlight further work that may lead to future cost savings by changing to different configurations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental approach for fabricating super hydrophobic coatings {{based on a}} dual roughness structure composed of zinc oxide nanorod arrays coated with a sputtered zinc oxide nano layer. The ZnO nanorod arrays were grown {{by means of a}} low temperature electrochemical deposition technique 75 C on FTO substrates. The ZnO nanorods show a 002 orientation along the c axis, and have a hexagonal structure, with an average length of 710 nm, and average width of 156 nm. On the other hand, the crystallite size of the top coating sputtered ZnO layer is of 30 nm. The as deposited ZnO nanorod arrays exhibited a hydrophobic behavior, with a surface water contact angle of 108, whereas the dual scale roughness ZnO nanorods coated with sputtered ZnO exhibited a super hydrophobic behavior, with a surface water contact angle of 157 and a high water droplet adhesion. The photo catalytic activity of the samples was investigated against the degradation of methylene blue under UV A irradiation 365 nm. The ZnO nanorod arrays showed good photocatalytic activity whereas the superhydrophobic ZnO nanorod arrays <b>top</b> <b>coated</b> with sputtered ZnO showed minimal activity regarding the degradation of methylene blue.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is an {{ubiquitous}} signaling molecule {{of intense}} interest in many physiological processes. Nitric oxide {{is a highly}} reactive free radical gas {{that is difficult to}} deliver with precise control over the level and timing that cells actually experience. We describe and characterize a device that allows tunable fluxes and patterns of NO to be generated across the surface upon which cells are cultured. The system is based on a quartz microscope slide that allows for controlled light levels to be applied to a previously described photosensitive NO-releasing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Cells are cultured in separate wells that are either NO-releasing or a chemically similar PDMS that does not release NO. Both wells are then <b>top</b> <b>coated</b> with DowCorning RTV- 3140 PDMS and a polydopamine/gelatin layer to allow cells to grow in the culture wells. When the waveguide is illuminated, the surface of the quartz slide propagates light such that the photosensitive polymer is evenly irradiated and generates NO {{across the surface of the}} cell culture well and no light penetrates into the volume of the wells where cells are growing. Mouse smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) were grown in the system in a proof of principle experiment, whereby 60 % of the cells were present in the NO-releasing well compared to control wells after 17  h. The compelling advantage of illuminating the NO-releasing polymers with the waveguide system is that light can be used to tunably control NO release while avoiding exposing cells to optical radiation. This device provides means to quantitatively control the surface flux, timing and duration of NO cells experience and allows for systematic study of cellular response to NO generated at the cell/surface interface in a wide variety of studies...|$|E

A numerical heat flow model has been used to explore the stress state under isothermal and thermal gradient conditions. Sintering proceeds faster at higher temperature, but is retarded by the presence of tensile stresses (from differential thermal expansion between coating and substrate) within the <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> Sintering occurs preferentially near the free surface of the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> under gradient conditions, {{not only because of the}} higher temperature, but also because the in-plane stress is more compressive in that region...|$|R
40|$|Advanced and {{baseline}} {{thermal barrier}} coatings (TBCs) were thermal cycle tested in air at 1163 C until delamination or spallation of the ceramic <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> The <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> {{of the advanced}} TBC s consisted of ZrO 2 with various amounts of Y 2 O 3, Yb 2 O 3, Gd 2 O 3, or Nd 2 O 3 dopants.

A NiCrAlY or NiCoCrAlY bond coat was deposited by low pressure plasma spraying onto a single-crystal, Ni-base superalloy. The TBC lifetime for the baseline coatings was approximately 190 cycles (45 minutes at 1163 C per cycle) while the lifetime for the advanced coatings was as high as 425 cycles.

40|$|Thermal spray {{coatings}} (TSCs) have complex microstructures {{and they}} often operate in demanding environments. Plasma sprayed (PS) thermal barrier coating (TBC) is one such ceramic layer that is applied onto metallic components where a low macroscopic stiffness favors stability by limiting the stresses from differential thermal contraction. In this paper, the Young’s modulus of TBC <b>top</b> <b>coat,</b> measured using different techniques, such as four-point bending, indentation and impulse excitation is reported, along with {{a brief description of}} how the techniques probe different length scales. Zirconia-based TBC <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> were found to have a much lower global stiffness than that of dense zirconia. A typical value for the as-sprayed Young’s modulus was ~ 23 GPa, determined by beam bending. Indentation, probing a local area, gave significantly higher values. The difference between the two stiffness values is thought to explain the wide range of TBC <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> Young’s modulus values reported in the literature. On exposure to high temperature, due to the sintering process, detached <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> exhibit an increase in stiffness. This increase in stiffness caused by the sintering of fine-scale porosity has significant impact on the strain tolerance of the TBC. The paper discusses the different techniques for measuring the Young’s modulus of the TBC <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> and implications of the measured values...|$|R

XRD and SEM/EDX were used to analyze the changes in the coatings after oxidation at 1000 degreesC for 72 hours in dry or humidified (containing 50 % H 2 O) O- 2 atmosphere, with or without Na 2 SO 4 deposited on the <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> When oxidized in oxygen, bond coat oxide regions, consisting of almost pure aluminum oxide, were formed at the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> / bond coat and bond coat / substrate interfaces and in the bond coat around the splat lines. When water vapor was present, the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> / bond coat interface oxide was marginally thicker and included small regions with more chromium, cobalt and nickel. The addition of the salt deposits resulted in some destabilization in the outermost regions of the <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> The salt deposits also caused the formation of thicker oxide comprising two regions, though this formation was observed only at the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> / bond coat interface. The first type was a thin inner (i. e. bordering the bond coat) oxide that was mostly aluminum oxide.
