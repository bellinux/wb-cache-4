25|$|Arriving at James' office 20 minutes early, he apologised to the {{receptionist}} {{and said he}} was happy to wait until the appointed time. The receptionist nevertheless phoned James, who promptly came out of his office, welcomed Epstein and quickly got down to business. Epstein played the single and James remarked that it was a number one record. Epstein replied that if James could achieve that then he would be prepared to offer him a long-term publishing deal. James then phoned Philip Jones, producer of ITV television show Thank Your Lucky Stars, played the song down the telephone to him and gained The Beatles a slot on the next edition of the programme.

500|$|To {{create the}} effect of the Angels rocking the TARDIS Mulligan and Robertson threw {{themselves}} around the ship's set. The camera's operator <b>then</b> <b>shook</b> the camera in the opposite direction that Mulligan and Robertson threw themselves. The scene wherein the Doctor talks to Sally via a DVD extra was created by writing a conversation, removing Sally's lines, then having David Tennant record his lines. Moffat felt that this one-way filming made the performance more convincing. Moffat initially wrote placeholder dialogue in the script for the scene where the Doctor tells Sally that he can hear her in the DVD shop, because he knew the lines that appeared would have to play [...] "double duty later on" [...] and be authentic and fresh both times. Gold called the sequences [...] "the heart of the Chinese puzzle".|$|E

2500|$|A later source {{alleged that}} the three assailants were not college boys, but actor Wallace Beery, {{producer}} Albert R. Broccoli, and Broccoli's cousin, agent/producer Pat DiCicco. While there is no documentation in contemporaneous news reports that either Beery or DiCicco was present, Broccoli admitted that he was indeed involved in a fist fight with Healy at the Trocadero. [...] He later modified his story, stating that a heavily intoxicated Healy had picked a fight with him, the two had briefly scuffled, <b>then</b> <b>shook</b> hands and parted ways. In other reports, Broccoli admitted to pushing Healy, but not striking him.|$|E
2500|$|Maudgalyāyana {{was able}} to use his powers of mind-reading in order to give good and fitting advice to his students, so they could attain results quickly. He is {{described}} as using his psychic powers to discipline not only monks, but also devas and other beings. Once some monks were making noise as they were sitting in the same building as the Buddha. Maudgalyāyana <b>then</b> <b>shook</b> the building, to teach the monks to be more restrained. But the most-quoted example of Maudgalyāyana's demonstration of psychic powers is his victory over the dragon (naga) Nandopananda, which required mastery of the jhānas (states in meditation). Many of his demonstrations of psychic powers were an indirect means of establishing the Buddha as a great teacher. People would ask themselves, if the disciple had these powers, then how spiritually powerful would his teacher be? ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in September 2011 when Busch {{was racing}} at the fall Richmond race {{after he and}} Johnson were told to settle down after Pocono; Busch accidentally made contact that {{resulted}} with Johnson spinning out in smoke. Almost 60 laps later, Johnson waited for Busch to come back around the track and intentionally retaliated by making contact resembling the previous spin. Although it looked like Busch would avoid the result of crashing, Busch was spun around when avoiding another car during the contact. Johnson was black-flagged for several laps because radio communications proved that Busch's first contact with Johnson was not intentional. After the race Busch, satisfied with his top-five finish, called Johnson [...] "A five time chumpion" [...] {{and said he was}} in Johnson's head always. He <b>then</b> <b>shook</b> hands with Johnson during the post-race ceremonies to put the incident behind both of them.|$|E
