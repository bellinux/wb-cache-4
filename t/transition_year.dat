30|$|Since the {{communist}} regime’s fall in December 1989, Romania has experienced profound political, democratic, and economic transformations. The labor market is one arena that has experienced the most market economy shocks, including the official birth of unemployment and its social implications, the restructuring process {{of almost all}} big industrial companies and the entire agricultural sector, {{the expansion of the}} private sector, the composition of employment, and a decentralized system of wage setting. All of these changes open up {{the question of whether the}} “planned equality” of {{the communist}} regime transformed into a “market inequality” during the <b>transition</b> <b>years.</b> Using data from cross-sectional household surveys conducted during the <b>transition</b> <b>years</b> in Romania, which include unique retrospective information about starting wages and occupations since the 1960 s, our results show that the unexplained part of the gender wage gap was lower during the communist regime and higher during the <b>transition</b> <b>years.</b>|$|R

In the playoffs the Colts would lose their first-round playoff series to the Brampton Battalion in six games. Eric Himelfarb, and Luc Chiasson who the Colts acquired in the off-season led the team in scoring with 75 and 66 points respectively. Second year Colt Nick Lees finished slightly behind Chiasson with 61 points. Throughout the season several moves were made in an effort to make the Colts a younger team. Players such as Dan Speer, and Chad Thompson were brought in, and would both remain Colts for the next few seasons.|$|E
40|$|Grades seven, {{eight and}} nine {{students}} in the French Section of the Kent County Roman Catholic Separate School Board served as the focal group in this research study which {{examined the relationship between}} the implementation of the <b>Transition</b> <b>Years</b> 2 ̆ 7 Pilot Project from 1990 to 1993 and the retention rate of its Francophone students, as calculated from 1986 to 1993. The Ontario Ministry of Education suggested that the pilot schools concentrate their action plans on the following eleven areas of focus: career education, community involvement, core curriculum, facilitating transitions, gender equity, guidance and special education, innovative in-service, remediation and enrichment, school organization, student assessment and technological studies. The retention rate of Francophone adolescents remaining in the French as a First Language School program increased, therefore supporting the claim that the successful implementation of the eleven areas of focus of the <b>Transition</b> <b>Years</b> 2 ̆ 7 Pilot Project had a positive effect. If the retention rate for Francophone students increases by implementing the eleven areas of focus targeted by the <b>Transition</b> <b>Years</b> 2 ̆ 7 initiative, it suggests that students in majority settings may want to remain in school longer as well in response to the <b>Transition</b> <b>Years</b> 2 ̆ 7 initiatives.
