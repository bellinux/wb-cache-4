40|$|Understanding the {{structure}} of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) {{is one of the}} primary challenges in solar astrophysics. White-light coronagraphs make images of line-of-sight projections of the CME electron density (Ne). The combination of the coronagraphs on the STEREO and SOHO spacecraft provides three simultaneous viewpoints that vary in angle with time, according <b>to</b> the spacecraft <b>orbits.</b> <b>Three</b> viewpoints are not enough to permit tomographic reconstruction via classical methods, but we argue here that recent advances in image processing methods that take into account prior information about the CME geometry may allow one to determine the CME density structure with only three viewpoints. The prior information considered here is that the CME is separated from a known (or simple) background by a closed surface, which may be described by a level set. We propose an alternating iterative procedure in which the surface is evolved via geometric partial differential equations in one step and the interior (and exterior) Ne values are determined in the next step. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|After {{the flight}} of Vostok 1, Sergei Korolev took a short {{vacation}} in Crimea where he began working out the flight plan for the next mission. There were considerable arguments over {{the duration of the}} mission as flight doctors argued for no more than <b>three</b> <b>orbits.</b> The flight of Korabl-Sputnik 2 nine months earlier had carried two dogs on a six orbit mission, during which the animals had experienced convulsions and thus all subsequent Vostok missions were limited <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>orbits</b> maximum. Although dogs and humans were very different physiologically, the doctors were worried about the risks posed on a longer flight. There was also the purely practical aspect of spacecraft recovery. If Vostok 2 flew <b>three</b> <b>orbits,</b> reentry and landing would take place in the wide open steppes of southern Russia, the landing site moving steadily further west with each orbit. Orbits 8-13 would drop the capsule into the Pacific Ocean, after which landing would again occur in Soviet territory, but in the remote, frozen wastes of Siberia. Thus, it was necessary to spend a full 24 hours in space before it would be once again possible to land in the prime recovery area in southern Russia. The <b>three</b> <b>orbit</b> limit thus would not only make landing easy, but minimize risks to the cosmonaut posed by prolonged weightlessness.|$|R
40|$|Around {{the year}} 2011, the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) will be {{launched}} {{and on its}} way <b>to</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>three</b> of Jupiter s planet-sized moons. The mission goals for the JIMO project revolve heavily around gathering scientific data concerning ingredients we, as humans, consider essential: water, energy and necessary chemical elements. The JIM 0 is an ambitious mission which will implore propulsion from an ION thruster powered by a nuclear fission reactor. Glenn Research Center {{is responsible for the}} development of the dynamic power conversion, power management and distribution, heat rejection and ION thrusters. The first test phase for the JIM 0 program concerns the High Power AC Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) Test Bed. The goal of this testing is to support electrical performance verification of the power systems. The test bed will incorporate a 2 kW Brayton Rotating Unit (BRU) to simulate the nuclear reactor as well as two ION thrusters. The first module of the PMAD Test Bed to be designed is the Main Power Distribution Unit (MPDU) which relays the power input to the various propulsion systems and scientific instruments. The MPDU involves circuitry design as well as mechanical design to determine the placement of the components. The MPDU consists of fourteen relays of four different variations used to convert the input power into the appropriate power output. The three phase system uses 400 Vo 1 ts(sub L-L) rms at 1000 Hertz. The power is relayed through the circuit and distributed to the scientific instruments, the ION thrusters and other controlled systems. The mechanical design requires the components to be positioned for easy electrical wiring as well as allowing adequate room for the main buss bars, individual circuit boards connected to each component and power supplies. To accomplish creating a suitable design, AutoCAD was used as a drafting tool. By showing a visual layout of the components, it is easy to see where there is extra room or where the components may interfere with one another. By working with the electrical engineer who is designing the circuit, the specific design requirements for the MPDU were determined and used as guidelines. Space is limited due to the size of the mounting plate therefore each component must be strategically placed. Since the MPDU is being designed to fit into a simulated model of the spacecraft systems on the JIMO, components must be positioned where they are easily accessible to be wired to the other onboard systems. Mechanical and electrical requirements provided equally important limits which are combined to produce the best possible design of the MPDU...|$|R

A newly developed method called Gauss Pseudospectral method {{is applied to}} the nonplanar trajectory optimization problem with VASIMR engine. Three representative trajectory optimization problems are solved. The first is an orbit raising problem from LEO to GEO; the second is a transfer from LEO <b>to</b> Sun synchronous <b>orbit</b> with large inclination change; the third is a transfer from LEO <b>to</b> Molniya <b>orbit.</b> These <b>three</b> problems demonstrate the ability of VASIMR and Gauss Pseudospectral method to deal with different kind of trajectory optimization problems. The results show that VASIMR engine can greatly increase the payload ratio for its large specific impulse and can be applied in different kinds of orbital transfer problems. It also demonstrates the Gauss Pseudospectral method is a powerful and effective method to deal with complicated trajectory optimization problems.

In this paper, we apply this method to more complicated cases. For two partite system, Alice and Bob each make one of $d$ possible measurements, each measurement has $n$ outcomes. The Bell inequalities based on the choice of two orbits are derived. The classical bound is only dependent {{on the number of}} measurements $d$, but the quantum bound is dependent both on $n$ and $d$. Even so, when $d$ is large enough, the quantum bound is only dependent on $d$. The subset of probabilities for four parties based on the choice of six orbits under group action is derived and its violation is described. Restricting the six <b>orbits</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> parties by forgetting the last party, and guaranteeing the classical bound invariant, the Bell inequality based on the choice of four orbits is derived.
