500|$|Meanwhile, {{even the}} minds of reformers like Gogel had become {{receptive}} {{to the need for}} change. The frustrations of the stalemate between unitarist reformers and democratically elected federalist obstructionists had caused a certain disillusionment with democratic politics in <b>the</b> <b>former</b> (<b>the</b> <b>latter</b> were already convinced). An alliance was therefore forming between the would-be reformers, who would like to finally push their reforms through, by [...] "Bonapartist" [...] means, if necessary, and the people who wished to restore the old federal order, {{in the hands of the}} old regent class. Director Besier in particular was amenable to a project that would extend executive power (and curtail that of the Assembly), and revert the constitution to federal devolution. With the help of Sémonville he now started to push a project of constitutional reform that followed the French Constitution of the Year VIII in important respects: a bicameral legislature would be appointed by a [...] "National College" [...] (akin to the French Senate) from a list of names produced by a convoluted system of national elections. This met with little enthusiasm by two of the other Directors François Ermerins and Jean Henri van Swinden, and by the Representative Assembly, that rejected the project on 11 June 1801, by fifty votes to twelve.|$|E
2500|$|The Académie Royale (the Paris Opéra) and the Comédie Italienne {{had been}} ordered to organise a joint opera season for the court {{in the autumn of}} 1783 at the palace of Fontainebleau. A new work by Piccinni, Didon, had long been in preparation. Sacchini was persuaded to hurry the {{composition}} of the second of the three works stipulated in his contract with the Opéra. As mentioned above, he chose to take his subject from Corneille's tragedy Le Cid. The two new operas were placed in direct competition: Didon was to be performed on 16 October and Chimene on 16 November 1783. To level the playing field, the new prima donna of the Opéra, Antoinette Saint-Huberty, was to take the title role in both works and both pieces were due to have two performances each. Didon, probably Piccinni's masterpiece in the field of serious opera, enjoyed a triumphant reception, while Chimène was more of a succès d'éstime and was performed only once, because the [...] "king himself, although he was no music lover, wanted to hear Didon a third time. 'I think this opera', he said, 'is as good as a beautiful tragedy.'" [...] Nevertheless, both Piccinni and Sacchini were [...] "presented to the king, and, as he had just granted a pension of six thousand livres to <b>the</b> <b>former,</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> was given the same sum; unlike his rival, Sacchini also had the precious honour of being presented to the king by the queen herself." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{enthusiastic}} discontent so {{manifest in}} the Robbers has by some been in part attributed to Schiller's intercourse with Schubart. This seems as wise as the hypothesis of Gray's Alderman, who, after {{half a century of}} turtle-soup, imputed the ruin of his health to eating two unripe grapes: 'he felt them cold upon his stomach, the moment they were over; he never got the better of them.' Schiller, it appears, saw Schubart only once, and their conversation was not of a confidential kind. For any influence this interview could have produced upon <b>the</b> <b>former,</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> could have merited no mention here: it is on other grounds that we refer to him. Schubart's history, not devoid of interest in itself, unfolds in a striking light the circumstances under which Schiller stood at present; and may serve to justify the violence of his alarms, which to the happy natives of our Island might otherwise appear pusillanimous and excessive. For these reasons we subjoin a sketch of it.|$|E

6000|$|The {{preparations}} being complete, the two private soldiers {{stepped aside}} and each drew away the plank upon {{which he had}} been standing. The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace. These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth. This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties.

5000|$|The earmarks of Congregationalism can {{be traced}} back to the Pilgrim {{societies}} of the United States in the early 17th century.
