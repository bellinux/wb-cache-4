50|$|LAWC-T has a {{ballistic}} {{protection of}} NATO STANAG 4569 Level 4, providing immunity against 14.5mm {{heavy machine gun}} ammunition. The well-sloped glacis plate and the vertical hull sides allow additional armor to be <b>fitted</b> <b>if</b> <b>required.</b> The Standard mine protection meets STANAG 4569 Level 3a.|$|R
50|$|The base L-ATV {{does not}} have a {{standard}} armament, however it can be fitted with a selection of weapons including light, medium, and heavy machine guns, automatic grenade launchers, or anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) depending on user requirements. The weapons can be operated from ring mounts or a remote weapon station. Smoke grenade launchers for self-defence can also be <b>fitted</b> <b>if</b> <b>required.</b>|$|R
25|$|Floppy {{disk drives}} are rarely fitted to modern {{computers}} and are obsolete for normal purposes, although {{internal and external}} drives can be <b>fitted</b> <b>if</b> <b>required.</b> Floppy disks may be the method of choice for transferring data to and from very old computers without USB or booting from floppy disks, {{and so they are}} sometimes used to change the firmware on, for example, BIOS chips. Devices with removable storage like older Yamaha music keyboards are also dependent on floppy disks, which require computers to process them. Newer devices are built with USB flash drive support.|$|R
40|$|Computational {{modeling}} {{is increasingly}} used {{to understand the}} function of neural circuits in systems neuroscience. These studies require models of individual neurons with realistic input-output properties. Recently, {{it was found that}} spiking models can accurately predict the precisely timed spike trains produced by cortical neurons in response to somatically injected currents, <b>if</b> properly <b>fitted.</b> This <b>requires</b> fitting techniques that are efficient and flexible enough to easily test different candidate models. We present a generic solution, based on the Brian simulator (a neural network simulator in Python), which allows the user to define and fit arbitrary neuron models to electrophysiological recordings. It relies on vectorization and parallel computing techniques to achieve efficiency. We demonstrate its use on neural recordings in the barrel cortex and in the auditory brainstem, and confirm that simple adaptive spiking models can accurately predict the response of cortical neurons. Finally, we show how a complex multicompartmental model can be reduced to a simple effective spiking model...|$|R
2500|$|Traditionally, Albatros had {{constructed}} fuselages with wood frames but the L.66 marked a departure, with a welded steel tube longeron and strut framework covered with fabric. The sides were flat and almost airfoil shaped, with a blunt, rounded nose and taper aft. The nose mounted engine, driving a two blade propeller, was raised above the fuselage with a fairing behind it, enclosing the oil tank {{and with the}} instrument panel attached to its rear. The fuel tank was in the wing centre section, feeding the engine by gravity. Further aft, pilot and passenger {{sat side by side}} in the [...] wide fuselage; tandem controls could be <b>fitted</b> <b>if</b> <b>required.</b> The empennage was simple in shape and action as there were no fixed surfaces only an all-moving rudder and elevator. Both control surfaces were balanced. [...] The conventional undercarriage was also very simple, with the mainwheels attached to a single axle which passed through the fuselage, sitting the L.66 close to the ground. [...] The tailskid was linked to the rudder for steering on the ground ...|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{construction}} was employed throughout {{the majority of}} the P.1121; using a thick lightweight alloy skin placed on top of tightly spaced frames and stringers, while steel was used for some highly stressed components. The fuselage was split into three major sections; the front fuselage contained the radome, cockpit, radio, and equipment bay, the centre section housed the engine, air intake, belly-mounted air brake, nosewheel, 2-inch rocket launching fixtures, and a total of five nylon bag fuel tanks. The rear fuselage section was occupied by the reheat pipe, final nozzle, the main undercarriage a pair of rear air brakes, and two further bag-type fuel tanks. The P.1121 was furnished with a four-spar wing, covered by a 0.3-inch thick alloy skin, which was similarly shaped to the wing of the preceding Hawker Hunter. The spars were attached to steel booms at the inboard end, which were in turn fixed onto the four main frames of the centre fuselage section. The structural box of the wing also contained an integral fuel tank, containing up to 420 gallons of fuel in addition to the 1,055 gallons held within the fuselage fuel tanks. Up to four additional underwing external fuel tanks could also be <b>fitted</b> <b>if</b> <b>required.</b>|$|R
