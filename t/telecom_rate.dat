From 2001 to 2005, a U.S. telecommunications firm funneled $800,000 in bribes, laundered to Duperval and other Téléco officials, {{in exchange for}} which they were provided with special <b>telecom</b> <b>rates,</b> reduced payments, and other advantages, all of which deprived Haiti of revenue.|$|R

40|$|This Symposium {{has been}} a {{wonderful}} forum for identifying a number of challenges that Law and Development will face going forward. Like many of the contributors, I have thought about these issues as both an academic and as a practitioner/government adviser. I {{have concluded that the}} Law and Development movement suffers from both an inability to get good results (if we could figure out what “good” results actually are) and a lack of follow up regarding implementation efforts. As to the former, it is not clear to me that {{those of us in the}} field actually know what results we want to achieve—or that we can actually (and accurately) measure them. Mariana Prado noted that in some areas it is easy to gauge success, such as in antitrust or telecoms. If telecom prices go down, Prado suggests, the antitrust suit is successful. I would argue that quantifying success is not so easy, even in these areas. In many cases, looking at easily quantifiable measures such as case counts or the number of successful prosecutions does not in fact measure success. Agencies might bring lots of small but unimportant antitrust cases to raise their number of wins. Moreover, agencies might bring a “winning” case even if the underlying economics behind the case do not mesh with any real consumer loss. For example, in a given developing world country, competitors might push the agency to bring a series of vertical restraints cases against efficient competitors. Finally, even if lower <b>telecom</b> <b>rates</b> result from an antitrust win, is such a win really a success of Law and Development? We have serious endogeneity issues in trying to attribute reduced <b>telecom</b> <b>rates</b> to a particular technical assistance intervention. It could be that rates would have gone lower regardless of the antitrust case. Foreign entrants, changes in technology across platforms (such as voice over internet or wimax), or a change in tariff policy by the telecom regulator may have affected <b>telecom</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Machine {{learning}} {{techniques have}} proven very efficient in assorted classification tasks. Nevertheless, processing time-dependent high-speed signals {{can turn into}} an extremely challenging task, especially when the signals have been nonlinearly distorted. Recently, analogue hardware concepts using nonlinear transient responses have been gaining significant interest for fast information processing. Here, we introduce a simplified photonic reservoir computing scheme for data classification of severely distorted optical communication signals after extended fibre transmission. To this end, we convert the direct bit detection process into a pattern recognition problem. Using an experimental implementation of our photonic reservoir computer, we demonstrate an improvement in bit-error-rate by of two orders of magnitude, compared to directly classifying the transmitted signal. This improvement corresponds to {{an extension of the}} communication range by over 75 %. While we do not yet reach full real-time post-processing at <b>telecom</b> <b>rates,</b> we discuss how future designs might close the gap...|$|R

40|$|South Africa‟s high {{telecommunication}} {{costs are}} attributed partly to high interconnection rates. High costs negatively impact developmental objectives. This paper analyses the processes engaged in by ICASA in regulating interconnection rates, {{using a qualitative}} case study methodology. Enabling legislation, regulatory administration and rules and the bringing to bear of regulatory rules on institutions are stages of regulatory processes that are examined. Perspectives are taken from processes executed by TRAI, India‟s regulatory authority. South Africa followed a market review process which contrasts with India‟s cost-based process. South Africa‟s process although arduous did not achieve the desired result of establishing cost based rates. The root cause is attributed {{to a combination of}} factors that include an onerous market review process prescribed by the ECA, institutional problems at ICASA and a politically driven process that ran alongside and engulfed the process managed by ICASA. India‟s process meanwhile has yielded some of the cheapest <b>telecoms</b> retail <b>rates</b> in the world. Gaps exist between processes in the two countries and lessons learnt provide an improved understanding of South African shortcomings...|$|R
40|$|Four-wave mixing can be stimulated or occur spontaneously: {{the latter}} effect, {{also known as}} {{parametric}} fluorescence, can be explained only {{in the framework of}} a quantum theory of light, and it is at the basis of many protocols to generate nonclassical states of the electromagnetic field. In this work we report on our experimental study of spontaneous four wave mixing in microring resonators and photonic crystal molecules integrated on a silicon on insulator platform. We find that both structures are able to generate signal and idler beams in the <b>telecom</b> band, at <b>rates</b> of millions of photons per second, under sub-mW pumping. By comparing the experiments on the two structures we find that the photonic molecule is an order of magnitude more efficient than the ring resonator, due to the reduced mode volume of the individual resonators. © 2013 SPIE...|$|R
40|$|The year 2002 {{was remarkably}} {{difficult}} on many fronts for most financial markets. For the high yield bond market, {{it was again}} a year of record amounts of defaults which contributed to low recovery rates and slightly negative absolute returns. The default rate registered a massive 12. 8 %, based on $ 757 billion outstanding. Despite these record default totals and rates, the market’s decline was orderly with little panic and actually ended the year with reduced defaults and highly positive returns in the fourth quarter. Default amounts registered its fourth consecutive record year and almost topped $ 100 billion ($ 97. 9 billion) for the first time. This total was more than 52 % higher than last year’s record. Combined with a near record low recovery rate of 25 cents on the dollar, weighed down by <b>Telecom’s</b> average recovery <b>rate</b> of 16 %, loss rates from defaults reached record levels of about 10 % [...] even adjusted for fallen angel default recoveries. The pervasive influence of WorldCom’s massive default {{had a profound effect}} on both the default and recovery rates. Without WorldCom, the year’s default rate would have been 9. 27 % [...] a differential of about 3. 5 %. This report documents and comments upon the high yield bond market’s risk and return performance over the period 1971 - 2002. We will present traditional, dollar-denominated default rates as well as our own mortality rate statistics. Default rate analysis will be complemented by discussion on corporate bankruptcies and the immense impact of fallen angels on the high yield market. We conclude with our annual estimate of the size of the distressed debt market and our forecast for defaults in 2003. Our analysis will include an update on our default recovery forecasting model which was extremely accurate in estimating 2002 ’s recovery rate of about 25 %. Based on the fourth quarter’s reduction in default rate to 1. 82 % and our aging-mortality conceptual framework, we are predicting a reduction in the dollar denominated default rate to 7. 5 - 8. 0 %, as much as 5 % less than 2002 (but still far above the average rate). This should help provide a more attractive environment for high yield debt new issues and returns in 2003. In 2002, there was $ 65. 6 billion in new high yield bond issuance, down from 2001 ’s $ 88. 2 billion. We expect new issuance in 2003 to escalate unless the economic/political scene motivates another flight to quality in our financial markets. ...|$|R
