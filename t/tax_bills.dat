As a gesture of his goodwill and as incentive to sell the club, Davies promised to wipe over £125m of debt owed to him when the club was sold, which wiped {{a significant proportion of}} debt the club owed.|$|E
5|$|The {{net effect}} of all Reagan-era <b>tax</b> <b>bills</b> was a 1% {{decrease}} in government revenues when compared to Treasury Department revenue estimates from the Administration's first post-enactment January budgets.

5|$|Due to the state's {{worsening}} economy, {{the primary}} issue facing the legislature for the session was a $456 million budget shortfall. Expanded gambling was again proposed {{as a possible}} source of revenue, and a bill to allow slot machines at the state's racetracks passed the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, but died in the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee. Speaker Stumbo expressed doubt that he had enough votes to pass the measure {{even if it were}} brought to the House floor. Instead, the Assembly passed a series of <b>tax</b> <b>bills</b> to deal with the shortfall. The Assembly also began the process of reforming the state's system of school accountability testing, a move advocated by Beshear. Other bills passed during the session revised the state road plan to allocate newly available federal stimulus funds, created a program to divert accused substance abusers to treatment before their trials, and created a statewide database for tracking payday loans.|$|E

Earlier court decisions had stated the legislature also had no power to amend the constitution, effectively creating a narrow and difficult path for amendment. The decision ended the attempted imposition of new taxes but started a movement that succeeded in later years.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{during the}} early 1960s, there were several scandals in California {{involving}} county assessors. These assessors were found rewarding friends and allies with artificially low assessments, with <b>tax</b> <b>bills</b> to match. These scandals led {{to the passage of}} AB 80 in 1966, which imposed standards to hold assessments to market value. The return to market value in the wake of AB 80 could easily represent a mid-double-digit percentage increase in assessment for many homeowners. As a result, a large number of California homeowners experienced an immediate and drastic rise in valuation, simultaneous with rising tax rates on that assessed value, only to be told that the taxed monies would be redistributed to distant communities. The ensuing anger started to form into a backlash against property taxes which coalesced around Howard Jarvis, a former newspaperman and appliance manufacturer, turned taxpayer activist in retirement.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment hit {{a low of}} 5.3% in 1988 after peaking at over 10% in 1982. Real GDP growth {{recovered}} throughout Reagan's term, averaging +3.5% per year, with a high of +7.3% in 1984. The {{average annual}} GDP growth during Reagan's presidency was the fifth highest since the Great Depression and the highest of any Republican president. Inflation decreased significantly, falling from 13.6% in 1980 to 4.1% by 1988, and 16 million new jobs were created. The net effect of all Reagan-era <b>tax</b> <b>bills</b> resulted in a 1% decrease of government revenues (as a percentage of GDP), with the revenue-shrinking effects of the 1981 tax cut (-3% of GDP) and the revenue-gaining effects of the 1982 tax hike (~+1% of GDP), while subsequent bills were more revenue-neutral. However, tax revenue itself nominally increased massively by 103.1% from 1981 through 1989, {{largely as a result}} of more loopholes abolished than tax rates lowered.|$|E
25|$|Australia and New Zealand have a {{dividend}} imputation system, wherein companies can attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax {{paid by the}} company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 - company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders {{who are able to}} use them, apply these credits against their income <b>tax</b> <b>bills</b> at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.|$|E
