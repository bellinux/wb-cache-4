The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number of unintended ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a reactionary response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of patriarchy) but in ways no one can anticipate. Beckett said much of {{the latter part of}} the novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and force people to make sacrifices they do not wish to make.|$|E

Gromyko entered the Politburo in 1973 and, from there on, gradually took over the decision making of Soviet foreign policy. During his peak of personal influence Gromyko's policy was being built on the very same qualities which had underpinned his early career.

Those first few episodes, originally planned for release on television, were then woven together to form the theatrical release.

Warner Bros. had tracked the series' development from the beginning, and Lucas decided on a theatrical launch after viewing early footage declaring [...] "This is so beautiful, why don't we just go and use the crew and make a feature?" [...] Lucas described the film was [...] "almost an afterthought." [...] Howard Roffman, president of Lucas Licensing, said of the decision, [...] "Sometimes George works in strange ways."

According to review aggregator website Metacritic, the album received an average critic score of 72 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated, [...] "They demonstrate a focused concentration throughout this tight album -- it's only 47 minutes yet covers more ground than X and arguably A Rush of Blood to the Head -- that turns Viva la Vida into something quietly satisfying." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly magazine rated the album [...] "A-" [...] {{and called it}} their best album, while Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, wrote a mixed review explaining [...] "Viva la Vidas mild tinkering with the formula represents a failure of imagination: perhaps it's hard to <b>think</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> when the box {{is the size of}} the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena. Equally, however, there's a genuine conviction about its contents, a huge advance both on its predecessor and their legion of imitators." [...] Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that [...] "Coldplay's desire to unite fans around the world with an entertainment they can all relate to is the band's strength, and a worthy goal. But on Viva la Vida, a record that wants to make strong statements, it's also a weakness. Sometimes, to say what needs to be said, you need to risk pissing people off." [...] Melodic magazine's critic Kaj Roth gave the album 4/5 and felt that [...] "the typical Coldplay trademark is there too with beautiful atmospheric melodies that will embrace the heart". Spin magazine's critic Mikael Wood said in a positive review of the album, [...] "For all of Coldplay's experimentation, though, there's no doubting that Viva la Vida, with its sturdy melodies and universal themes -- think love, war and peace -- is an album meant to connect with the masses (arenas have been built for less than the climax of [...] "Death and All His Friends"). The band's triumph lies in how exciting they make that prospect seem". IGN gave the album 9.3/10 and Q said [...] "...So some habits die hard, but on every other level Viva La Vida...is an emphatic success...radical in its own measured way but easy to embrace..." [...] Robert Christgau gave it a one-star honorable mention (...) , saying, [...] "Applying all his powers, Chris Martin successfully dilutes Radiohead, with--what else?--pleasant results." ...|$|E
