The main aim is to find methods which enable transfer of spot measurements of precipitation to spatially distributed estimation and consequently comparison of results of these methods and evaluation of their differences and accuracy. For better understanding of this problematic, precipitation and its characteristics, origin and types are described. Factors which precipitation influence are also listed further in the text. The main part of this thesis is description of methods of spatial precipitation distribution and their application in a small catchment area. Methods are listed from the most common ones (Arithmetic mean method, <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon</b> method, Isohyetal method) to those most recent and least applied (Hypsometric method, Inverse distance weighted method, Kriging). <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon</b> method and Isohyetal method are described in detail and joined by figure for better understanding.

40|$|AUTOMATIC STATISTICAL AREA DEFINITION IN ALGÉS PARISH. Portugal, {{along with}} many other countries, conducts a {{population}} census every 10 years. This way of counting the population offers a detailed photography of the country where many socio-economic variables are captured. In this study, it is assumed that census will be the way of population data collection and therefore the discussion deals with the issue of geographical aggregation of individuals and households enumerated. In this context, a methodological proposal for an automatic census area creation in the parish of Algés is described. The minimum geographic unit for completing the aggregations is the building since it was the smallest and stable unit for this purpose. The building layer was obtained in the municipal GIS of Oeiras and is based on large scale cartography (1 : 1000). Mainly, because the building layer is not contiguous, the study starts with the construction of a <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon</b> layer. This layer is drawn with the buildings layer centroids and having the master plan classes as barriers. The <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon</b> layer associated with the building attributes assumed a key role in this process and considering the range of possible data aggregation alternatives the zone boundaries are drawn concerning with some principles of consistence and homogeneity. To achieve a measurement of homogeneity for the statistical areas the variables used were the number of households, floors and type of building (residential, commercial, both). The automatic statistical area definition deals with the aggregation of the basic geographic units (<b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon</b> layer), seeking for new optimized areas, considering the characteristics of the building and having a reference number of households around 100. To demonstrate the methodology used for the automatic statistical area definition, three simulation results are presented in this article...|$|E

40|$|The {{design values}} of the areal {{precipitation}} are needed for engineer to manage vital elements of our infrastructure. The areal precipitation can be generated by different interpolation methods. The problem involves choosing the interpolation method that we should use to estimate the extreme event. This work aimed at analyzing the effects of different interpolation methods on the estimate of extreme events of daily areal precipitations at catchment scale. The extreme rainfalls were estimated using areal daily rainfall interpolated by several interpolation methods (<b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon,</b> Inverse Distance Weighting, Ordinary Kriging, Universal Kriging, Kriging with an External Drift and Ordinary Cokriging). We used thirty-years-long daily time series and different density of rain gages (from 4 to 70 rain gages). Our study {{is located in the}} Ourthe and Ambleve catchment area (2908 km²) {{in the southern part of}} Belgium). Spatial interpolation with the geostatistical and Inverse Distance Weighting algorithms outperformed considerably interpolation with the <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon.</b> Kriging with an External Drift and Ordinary Cokriging presented the highest Root Mean Square Error between the geostatistical and Inverse Distance Weighting methods. Ordinary Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighting were considered to be the best methods, as they provided smallest Root Mean Square Error for nearly all cases. However, it’s not really the case of extreme estimates for particular return period. The extreme daily rainfall, corresponding to return periods of 25, 50 and 100 years, were computed by fitting of a statistical model to the series of maximum annual precipitation. These estimates were conducted using HYFRAN which allows us to fit 16 different statistical models, in 2 or 3 parameters. The most known are the models of Gumbel, Gamma, Weibull, exponential, Pareto, lognormale, Pearson III and GEV. Our results showed that the behaviour of extreme daily areal rainfall in this area was best described via the Gumbel and lognormal distributions. Using 70 rain gages, little differences in extreme rainfall were observed between the interpolation methods. The estimates from these methods were in the area of 95 % confidence intervals of the estimates using the <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon.</b> However, when the number of rain gages diminishes, the Universal Kriging and Kriging with External drift methods produced extreme estimates outside the area of 95 % confidence intervals of the estimates using the <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon</b> with all available stations. The analysis described here provides a means to choose the interpolation method in view to calculate extreme events. It shows to engineers or hydrologists the need for a particular care when working in the regions of sparse data. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Application of such distributed parameter models to large watersheds {{has given rise}} to many problems [...] three problems were examined in this work. The effect of watershed representation detail on runoff simulation results was studied. Simulations were conducted on 7 watersheds with different levels of representation detail. Results indicate that improved accuracy could be obtained either by finer discretization of the watershed into sub-basins or by choosing smaller land use and soil thresholds so that more combinations of soil and land use are simulated. A threshold configuration seems to exist with little or no increase in accuracy beyond that level of discretization. A simple method is proposed to determine the threshold configuration. The second problem examined is selection of weather data for each subbasin within the watershed. Four methods for selection of weather data have been studied, the first being the <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon</b> average of all gages within the basin. The second is the use of the <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon</b> average of each subbasin. The third method is the use of the gage closest to centroid of the subbasin for each subbasin, and fourth the use of the gage closest to the centroid of the whole basin as the gage to use for all subbasins. These methods were applied to 7 watersheds and the results indicate that the <b>Thiessen</b> <b>polygon</b> average over the whole basin was the best method for all basins analyzed. Finally, the calibration of large watersheds with numerous subbasins has been examined. Calibration is complicated due to interaction between parameters in different subbasins because of flow routing. A new calibration procedure was designed and implemented which applies the Golden Section Search Procedure for finding the calibration parameters in an optimal fashion, starting upstream and moving downstream to avoid parameter interaction problems. The procedure was demonstrated on two watersheds using the basin scale model SWAT, and results are presented. Calibration using this approach provided runoff simulation results that improved considerably over uncalibrated simulations. ...|$|E

Rain gauge data are usually interpolated across a model domain using various methods including the <b>Thiessen</b> <b>Polygon</b> methodology, which may be data-sparse in some areas and overly data-dense in others. However, rain gauge data are generally very easy to use in hydrologic model development, often requiring little to no data processing. NEXRAD data have the potential to improve hydrologic runoff estimates due to the increased spatial resolution of the data: but has its own issues regarding accuracy, false precipitation indications, and difficulties due to data processing. Previous studies have investigated the value of NEXRAD input versus traditional rain gauge data inputs for hydrologic studies; however, results are inconclusive as to which precipitation source provides more accurate results. Limited work has been done to compare the value of these datasets at multiple spatial scales, especially in Florida, a study area dominated by low topographic drive and sub-tropical weather.
