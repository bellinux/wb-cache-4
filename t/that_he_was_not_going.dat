5|$|When Dave Toschi met Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt, the {{director}} told him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{to make another}} Dirty Harry (which had been loosely based on the Zodiac case). Toschi was impressed with {{their knowledge of the}} case and afterwards, he realized that he had learned a lot from them. In addition, the Zodiac's two surviving victims, Mike Mageau and Bryan Hartnell were consultants on the film.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season Hašek {{injured his}} groin after playing just 14 games. On January 9, {{he and the}} team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek privately told general manager Ken Holland {{that he would not}} accept any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management. He eventually revealed that he refused about $3 million of his $6 million salary. In April 2004, he underwent groin surgery in Prague, and returned to his hometown of Pardubice to recuperate.|$|E

60|$|No {{one asked}} Sanders to stay. Bell could <b>not,</b> for she <b>was</b> but the servant, and T'nowhead {{knew that the}} kick his wife had given him meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> to do so either. Sanders whistled to show <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> uncomfortable.|$|R
5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{with the}} doping {{allegations}} still ongoing, Ullrich {{was diagnosed with}} burn-out, and avoided public appearances for a few months. When Lance Armstrong announced his comeback as a professional cyclist, Ullrich made clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to do the same.|$|E
25|$|After the controversy, Strefa Walk {{announced}} {{a fight between}} Emelianenko and Strikeforce champion Alistair Overeem, which Bas Boon, head of Golden Glory, confirmed to a Polish MMA website {{that it was in}} negotiations, but a few days later Overeem announced on Twitter <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to fight Emelianenko.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 Nicolaescu {{declared}} {{in an interview}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> happy with his decision of going into politics. <b>He</b> felt <b>that</b> the politics took too much from his precious time and because of <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> able to do as many films as before the Revolution.|$|R

25|$|When {{his form}} slumped in 2006, Sreesanth {{had tried to}} change his luck by {{changing}} his name to Sreesunth, on numerological advice. He later stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to change the name due to sentimental reasons. The word 'santh' in his name is derived from his father's name Santhakumaran Nair.|$|E
25|$|On March 29, 2017, the Lightning head coach, Jon Cooper, {{said that}} after the team's {{upcoming}} game against the Detroit Red Wings Stamkos would be considered day-to-day. Stamkos said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to put any dates on his return, however, {{he did say that}} he was very pleased and excited with how his knee was feeling. Stamkos did not return to the lineup for the Lightning that season.|$|E
25|$|Foley {{was born}} in Heckscherville, Pennsylvania to Irish immigrants, Edward and Catherine McDonald Foley. At a young age he decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to work the coal mines as his father had done. He joined the United States Marine Corps in 1888 {{for a period of}} five years. In 1893, he re-enlisted and, in 1898, he was sent to Cuba during the Spanish–American War where he {{received}} his first taste of military action. He also participated in the Philippines Campaign.|$|E
5000|$|When man {{experiences}} {{the conditions of}} power, the imputation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> their cause, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> responsible for them [...] - [...] they come without being willed, consequently we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> their author: the will that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> free (i.e., the consciousness {{that we have been}} changed without having willed it) needs an external will.|$|R
50|$|This uncertainty, {{plus the}} fact that Constantine {{remained}} uncrowned means <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always counted among Byzantine Emperors. Therefore, the convention {{when it comes to}} Constantine Laskaris <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> usually assigned a numeral. If <b>he</b> <b>is</b> counted as Constantine XI, then Constantine XI Palaeologus, the last Emperor, is counted as Constantine XII.|$|R
50|$|Hawn {{announced}} in March 2014 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> running for re-election.|$|R
25|$|On February 27, 2008, Bloomberg {{announced}} that he would not run for president in 2008, and that he would endorse a candidate who takes an independent and non-partisan approach. He had also stated unequivocally, live on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, December 31, 2007, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to run for president in 2008. Despite prior public statements by Bloomberg denying plans for a presidential run, many pundits believed Bloomberg would announce a campaign at a later date. On January 7, 2008, he met at the University of Oklahoma with a bipartisan group, including (now former) Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, both of whom had been frequently mentioned as possible running mates – to pressure the major party candidates to promote national unity and reduce partisan gridlock. Speculation that Bloomberg would choose this forum to announce his candidacy proved to be unfounded.|$|E
25|$|Codrington's Asia (84) was {{anchored}} between Ottoman admiral Capitan Bey's flagship, Fahti Bahri (74), and Egyptian Moharram Bey's frigate Guerrière (60). Capitan Bey opened fire, but Moharram Bey {{sent word}} to Codrington <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to attack. This enabled Asia to concentrate its fire on Fahti Bahri, {{which was in}} a poor condition and inadequately manned. Asias deadly fire shortly disabled her. Codrington then sent an interpreter, Greek P. Mikelis, to parley with Moharram Bey; but Mikelis was shot dead as he went aboard. Guerrière then opened fire, but {{was reduced to a}} burning wreck within 20 minutes by crushing broadsides from Asia and Azov. However, Asia suffered severe casualties and damage due to a concentration of heavy fire from smaller Ottoman boats {{in the second and third}} lines of the Ottoman formation: as Letellier had planned, these boats fired through the gaps in the front line. Codrington also believed that Asia had taken serious hits by mistake from sister Genoa.|$|E
25|$|UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz, referee John McCarthy {{and a team}} {{of lawyers}} were in court until 4:30p.m. {{on the day of the}} fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state. An {{ultimatum}} was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts. The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up his mind <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a torn lateral meniscus, a partially torn ACL, a broken nose, and cracked ribs. His injuries combined with the rule change, he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him. Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example. If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial monetary damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to go on with the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.|$|E

25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} started, Woo {{told his}} actors <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{to make the}} film as stylish as his previous films, but to have it be more of an [...] "edgy thriller". The role of Teresa Chang was originally made for actress Michelle Yeoh who had a long relationship with producer Terence Chang.

500|$|The next morning, 25 January, Overton {{was summoned}} {{to the office of}} his wing commander, Colonel John W. Mitchell. There, Colonel David C. Jones of the Fifth Air Force command staff {{determined}} he had crossed the Yalu river into China for each of his five victories. Violating Chinese airspace was officially prohibited. The next day Mitchell told him he was being grounded and sent home, and [...] "made clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> home a hero."

500|$|Jay-Z was {{initially}} skeptical about signing Rihanna after he felt [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] {{was too big}} for her, saying [...] "when a song is that big, it's hard [...] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists". The audition resulted in Rihanna signing a six-album record deal with Def Jam Recordings in February 2005, {{on the same day}} of the audition, with Jay-Z saying [...] "There's only two ways out. Out the door after you sign this deal. Or through this window ...", meaning <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to let her leave without signing a record deal.|$|E
500|$|In January 2017, Sounders' coach Brian Schmetzer told Geoff Baker of The Seattle Times that Steve Zakuani {{had been}} {{training}} {{with the team}} for some time: [...] "He was asked whether Zakuani’s status fell somewhere between a 'trial' with the Sounders and just pure training. 'I would say that’s fair,' he replied." [...] But just as the team was approaching its 2017 preseason, the 29-year-old forward fully realized <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{to be able to}} make it back to his former level of play: Zakuani officially announced his retirement one final time, with a lengthy and heart-felt Instagram post to his fans (included in full in the MLS post cited below).|$|E
