40|$|Organization of transgenes in rice {{transformed}} {{through direct}} DNA transfer strongly suggests a two-phase integration mechanism. In the “preintegration” phase, transforming plasmid molecules (either intact or partial) are spliced together. This {{gives rise to}} rearranged transgenic sequences, which upon integration do not contain any interspersed plant genomic sequences. Subsequently, integration of transgenic DNA into the host genome is initiated. Our experiments suggest that the original site of integration acts as a hot spot, facilitating subsequent integration of successive transgenic molecules at the same locus. The resulting <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> may have plant DNA separating the transgenic sequences. Our data indicate that transformation through direct DNA transfer, specifically particle bombardment, generally results in a single <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> {{as a result of}} this two-phase integration mechanism. Transgenic plants generated through such processes may, therefore, be more amenable to breeding programs as the single <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> will be easier to characterize genetically. Results from direct DNA transfer experiments suggest that in the absence of protein factors involved in exogenous DNA transfer through Agrobacterium, the qualitative and/or quantitative efficiency of transformation events is not compromised.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{creating}} transgenic varieties are labor and time intensive, comprised {{of the generation}} of hundreds of plants with random DNA insertions, screening for the few individuals with appropriate transgene expression and simple integration structure, and followed by a lengthy breeding process to introgress the engineered trait into cultivated varieties.

The problem with an assortment of independently developed improvements is that they do not integrate seamlessly into a single transformation system.

40|$|Integration of {{transgenic}} DNA {{into the}} plant genome {{was investigated in}} 13 transgenic oat (Avena sativa L.) lines produced using microprojectile bombardment {{with one or two}} cotransformed plasmids. In all transformation events, the transgenic DNA integrated into the plant genome consisted of intact transgene copies that were accompanied by multiple, rearranged, and/or truncated transgene fragments. All fragments of transgenic DNA cosegregated, indicating that they were integrated at single gene loci. Analysis {{of the structure of the}} <b>transgenic</b> <b>loci</b> indicated that the transgenic DNA was interspersed by the host genomic DNA. The number of insertions of transgenic DNA within the transgene loci varied from 2 to 12 among the 13 lines. Restriction endonucleases that do not cleave the introduced plasmids produced restriction fragments ranging from 3. 6 to about 60 kb in length hybridizing to a probe comprising the introduced plasmids. Although the size of the interspersing host DNA within the transgene locus is unknown, the sizes of the transgene-hybridizing restriction fragments indicated that the entire transgene locus must be at least from 35 – 280 kb. The observation that all transgenic lines analyzed exhibited genomic interspersion of multiple clustered transgenes suggests a predominating integration mechanism. We propose that transgene integration at multiple clustered DNA replication forks could account for the observed interspersion of transgenic DNA with host genomic DNA within <b>transgenic</b> <b>loci...</b>|$|R

The non-Mendelian inheritance of a transgene has been recorded with a frequency between 10 % and 50 % in transgenic plants produced either by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation or through particle bombardment.

40|$|In Neurospora crassa, the {{introduction}} of a transgene can lead to small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of homologous genes. siRNAs can also guide locus-specific methylation of Lys 9 of histone H 3 (Lys 9 H 3) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we tested the hypothesis that transgenically derived siRNAs may contemporaneously both activate the PTGS mechanism and induce chromatin modifications at the transgene and the homologous endogenous gene. We carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation using a previously characterized albino- 1 (al- 1) silenced strain but detected no alterations in the pattern of histone modifications at the endogenous al- 1 locus, suggesting that siRNAs produced from the <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> do not trigger modifications in trans of those histones tested. Instead, we found that the <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> was hypermethylated at Lys 9 H 3 in our silenced strain and remained hypermethylated in the quelling defective mutants (qde), further demonstrating that the PTGS machinery is dispensable for Lys 9 H 3 methylation. However, we found that a mutant in the histone Lys 9 H 3 methyltransferase dim- 5 was unable to maintain PTGS, with transgenic copies being rapidly lost, resulting in reversion of the silenced phenotype. These results indicate that the defect in PTGS of the Δdim- 5 strain is due to the inability to maintain the transgene in tandem, suggesting a role for DIM- 5 in stabilizing such repeated sequences. We conclude that in Neurospora, siRNAs produced from the <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> are used in the RNA-induced silencing complex-mediated PTGS pathway and do not communicate with an RNAi-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing complex to effect chromatin-based silencing...|$|E
40|$|Background: RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR 6) and SUPPRESSOR of GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS 3) are {{required}} for DNA methylation and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mediated by 21 -nt siRNAs produced by sense transgenes (S-PTGS). In contrast, RDR 2, but not RDR 6, is required for DNA methylation and TGS mediated by 24 -nt siRNAs, and for cellto-cell spreading of IR-PTGS mediated by 21 -nt siRNAs produced by inverted repeat transgenes {{under the control of}} a phloem-specific promoter. Principal Findings: In this study, we examined the role of RDR 2 and RDR 6 in S-PTGS. Unlike RDR 6, RDR 2 is not required for DNA methylation of transgenes subjected to S-PTGS. RDR 6 is essential for the production of siRNAs by transgenes subjected to S-PTGS, but RDR 2 also contributes to the production of transgene siRNAs when RDR 6 is present because rdr 2 mutations reduce transgene siRNA accumulation. However, the siRNAs produced via RDR 2 likely are counteractive in wildtype plants because impairement of RDR 2 increases S-PTGS efficiency at a <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> that triggers limited silencing, and accelerates S-PTGS at a <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> that triggers efficient silencing. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that RDR 2 and RDR 6 compete for RNA substrates produced by transgenes subjected to S-PTGS. RDR 2 partially antagonizes RDR 6 because RDR 2 action likely results in the production of counteractiv...|$|E

Therefore, we introduced a 90 -kb large BAC clone carrying a 10 -copy tandem array of kafirin storage protein genes from sorghum linkage group J, mixed with a selectable marker gene, directly into maize cells using the particle bombardment method. Transgenic plants were regenerated and seeds from eight different transgenic lines were produced. One such transgenic plant was selected that had the entire kafirin gene cluster on a single continuous DNA fragment spanning more than 45 kb integrated into its genome. When alcohol-soluble proteins from individual T 2 and T 3 seeds of this event were analyzed, significant levels of kafirin were found {{in addition to the}} endogenous zein storage proteins, demonstrating that the large exogenous DNA segment is stably integrated into the maize genome and expressed at high levels in subsequent generations. Therefore, we could provide a new utility of plant transformation by the particle bombardment method for functional genomics of multigene families and the modification of the nutritive quality of cereal grains. Despite a tandem array of highly homologous sequences at the <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus,</b> no gene silencing was observed, probably owing to the effects of co-transformed flanking sequences.

40|$|International audienceParamutation was {{initially}} described in maize and {{was defined as}} an epigenetic interaction between two alleles of a locus, through which one allele induces a heritable modification of the other allele without modifying the DNA sequence [1] and [2]. Thus it implies that the paramutated allele conserves its new properties on the long term over generations {{even in the absence}} of the paramutagenic allele and that it turns paramutagenic itself, without undergoing any changes in the DNA sequence. Some epigenetic interactions have been described in two non-vertebrate animal models, which appear to exhibit similar properties. Both systems are linked to trans-generational transmission of non-coding small RNAs. In Drosophila melanogaster, paramutation is correlated with transmission of PIWI-Interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that repress mobile DNA in the germline. A tandem repeated <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> producing abundant ovarian piRNAs can activate piRNA production and associated homology-dependent silencing at a locus that was previously stably devoid of such capacities. The newly converted locus is then perfectly stable in absence of the inducer locus (> 100 generations) and becomes fully paramutagenic. In Caenorhabditis elegans, paramutation is correlated with transmission of siRNAs, which are produced by transgenes targeted by piRNAs in the germline. Indeed, a <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus,</b> targeted by the piRNA machinery, produces siRNAs that can induce silencing of homologous transgenes, which can be further transmitted in a repressed state over generations despite the absence of the inducer <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus.</b> As in fly, the paramutated locus can become fully paramutagenic, and paramutation can be mediated by cytoplasmic inheritance without transmission of the paramutagenic locus itself. Nevertheless, in contrast to flies where the induction is only maternally inherited, both parents can transmit it in worms. In addition, a reciprocal phenomenon – (from off toward on) – appears to be also possible in worms as some activated transgenes can reactivate silent transgenes in the germline, and this modification can also be transmitted to next generations, even so it appears to be only partially stable. Thus, in a given system, opposite paramutation-like phenomena could exist, mediated by antagonist active pathways. As in plants, paramutation in flies and worms correlates with chromatin structure modification of the paramutated locus. In flies, inheritance of small RNAs from one generation to the next transmits a memory mainly targeting loci for repression whereas in worms, small RNAs can target loci either for repression or expression. Nevertheless, in the two species, paramutation can play an important role in the epigenome establishment...|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} RNA-guided {{endonuclease}} (RGEN) -mediated gene editing, specifically via CRISPR/Cas 9, has spurred intensive {{efforts to improve}} the efficiency of both RGEN delivery and targeted mutagenesis. The major viral vectors in use for delivery of Cas 9 and its associated guide RNA, lentiviral and adeno-associated viral systems, have the potential for undesired random integration into the host genome. Here, we repurpose Sendai virus, an RNA virus with no viral DNA phase and that replicates solely in the cytoplasm, as a delivery system for efficient Cas 9 -mediated gene editing. The high efficiency of Sendai virus infection resulted in high rates of on-target mutagenesis in cell lines (75 – 98 % at various endogenous and <b>transgenic</b> <b>loci)</b> and primary human monocytes (88 % at the ccr 5 locus) {{in the absence of any}} selection.

40|$|Post-transcriptional gene {{silencing}} (PTGS) pathways {{play a role}} in genome defence and have been extensively studied, yet how repetitive elements in the genome are identified is still unclear. It has been suggested that they may produce aberrant transcripts (aRNA) that are converted by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) into double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the essential intermediate of PTGS. However, how RdRP enzymes recognize aberrant transcripts remains a key question. Here we show that in Neurospora crassa the RdRP QDE- 1 interacts with Replication Protein A (RPA), part of the DNA replication machinery. We show that both QDE- 1 and RPA are nuclear proteins and that QDE- 1 is specifically recruited onto the repetitive <b>transgenic</b> <b>loci.</b> We speculate that this localization of QDE- 1 could allow the in situ production of dsRNA using transgenic nascent transcripts as templates, as in other systems. Supporting a link between the two proteins, we found that the accumulation of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), the hallmark of silencing, is dependent on an ongoing DNA synthesis. The interaction between QDE- 1 and RPA is important since it should guide further studies aimed at understanding the specificity of the RdRP and it provides {{for the first time a}} potential link between a PTGS component and the DNA replication machinery...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTransposable element (TE) {{activity}} is repressed in the Drosophila germline by Piwi-Interacting RNAs (piRNAs), {{a class of}} small non-coding RNAs. These piRNAs are produced by discrete genomic loci containing TE fragments. In a recent publication, we tested {{for the existence of}} a strict epigenetic induction of piRNA production capacity by a locus in the D. melanogaster genome. We used 2 lines carrying a transgenic 7 -copy tandem cluster (P-lacZ-white) at the same genomic site. This cluster generates in both lines a local heterochromatic sector. One line (T- 1) produces high levels of ovarian piRNAs homologous to the P-lacZ-white transgenes and shows a strong capacity to repress homologous sequences in trans, whereas the other line (BX 2) is devoid of both of these capacities. The properties of these 2 lines are perfectly stable over generations. We have shown that the maternal transmission of a cytoplasm carrying piRNAs from the first line can confer to the inert <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> of the second, a totally de novo capacity to produce high levels of piRNAs as well as the ability to induce homology-dependent silencing in trans. These new properties are stably inherited over generations (n > 50). Furthermore, the converted locus has itself become able to convert an inert <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> via cytoplasmic maternal inheritance. This results in a stable epigenetic conversion process, which can be performed recurrently-a phenomenon termed paramutation and discovered in Maize 60 y ago. Paramutation in Drosophila corresponds to the first stable paramutation in animals and provides a model system to investigate the epigenetically induced emergence of a piRNA-producing locus, a crucial step in epigenome shaping.

To understand the origin of complex T-DNA loci, floral-dip and root transformation experiments were carried out in Arabidopsis thaliana with mixtures of A. tumefaciens strains, each harboring one or two different T-DNA vectors. Upon floral-dip transformation, 6 - 30 % of the transformants were co-transformed by multiple T-DNAs originating from different bacteria and 20 - 36 % by different T-DNAs from one strain. However, these co-transformation frequencies were too low to explain the presence of on average 4 - 6 T-DNA copies in these transformants, suggesting that, upon floral-dip transformation, T-DNA replication frequently occurs before or during integration after the transfer of single T-DNA copies. Upon root transformation, the co-transformation frequencies of T-DNAs originating from different bacteria were similar or slightly higher (between 10 and 60 %) than those obtained after floral-dip transformation, whereas the co-transformation frequencies of different T-DNAs from one strain were comparable (24 - 31 %). Root transformants generally harbor only one to three T-DNA copies, and thus co-transformation of different T-DNAs can explain the T-DNA copy number in many transformants, but T-DNA replication is postulated to occur in most multicopy root transformants. In conclusion, the comparable co-transformation frequencies and differences in complexity of the T-DNA loci after floral-dip and root transformations indicate that the T-DNA copy number is highly determined by the transformation-competent target cells...|$|R

The research reported here centres on the glutenin subunits 1 Dx 5 and 1 Dy 10 encoded by chromosome 1 D, and whose presence in hexaploid wheats is positively correlated with higher dough strength. In order to study the effects of stable expression of the 1 Dx 5 and 1 Dy 10 glutenin subunits in different durum wheat genotypes, four cultivars commonly grown in the Mediterranean area ('Svevo', 'Creso', 'Varano' and 'Latino') were co-transformed, via particle bombardment of cultured immature embryos, with the two wheat genes Glu-D 1 - 1 d and Glu-D 1 - 2 b encoding the glutenin subunits, and a third plasmid containing the bar gene as a selectable marker. Protein gel analyses of T(1) generation seed extracts showed expression of one or both glutenin genes in four different transformed durum wheat plants. One of these transgenic lines, DC 2 - 65, showed co-suppression of all HMW-GS, including the endogenous ones. Transgene stability in the transgenic lines has been studied over four generations (T(1) -T(4)). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of metaphase chromosomes from T(4) plants showed that the integration of transgenes occurred in both telomeric and centromeric regions. The three plasmids were found inserted at a single locus in two lines and in two loci on the same chromosome arm in one line. The fourth line had two <b>transgenic</b> <b>loci</b> on different chromosomes: one with both glutenin plasmids and a different one containing only the construct with the gene encoding the 1 Dy 10 glutenin subunit. Segregation of these two loci in subsequent generations allowed establishment of two sublines, one containing both 1 Dx 5 and 1 Dy 10 and the other containing only 1 Dy 10. Small-scale quality tests showed that accumulation of Dx 5, Dy 10 or both in transgenic durum wheat seeds resulted in doughs with stronger mixing characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic mice {{provide a}} {{remarkable}} experimental {{setting for the}} study of nuclear architecture. The three-dimensional localization and fine structure of a foreign DNA within the mouse genome can be conveniently followed by using high-resolution in situ hybridization. Foreign DNAs designed with specific characteristics, such as base bias, sequence motif(s), and size can stably integrate into finite positions on host chromosomes. Thus the relative importance of each of these characteristics in determining the three-dimensional nuclear position and the detailed morphology of the transgene can be evaluated in different cell types. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a transgene with sequence characteristics that might contribute to the de novo formation of heterochromatin in interphase nuclei. The structure of a phenotypically silent 11 -megabase transgene, containing tandem repeats of beta-globin-pBR sequences integrated into the peritelomeric region of both mouse chromosome 3 homologs, was determined in adult brain cells. Neurons that are largely euchromatic were especially informative in three-dimensional studies of transgene position. The two <b>transgenic</b> <b>loci</b> behaved much like centromeric or paracentromeric A + T-rich satellite DNAs of comparable length from a single chromosome; one or both transgene domains localized together with centromeric satellite DNA on the nucleolus. This is an unusual nuclear position for a telomeric or chromosome arm region that does not contain a substantial amount of constitutively heterochromatic satellite DNA. G + C richness did not prevent these regions from assembling as dense heterochromatic bodies of approximately 1 micron 3 in volume. Ultrastructurally, transgenic domains were often intimately connected with constitutive heterochromatin and were highly condensed. Labeled supercoils, formed by a discrete approximately 250 -nm-wide fiber, were observed in oblique thin sections through the center of the domain. The structural data were consistent with negligible transcriptional activity detected for this locus, as well as the predicted conformation of constitutive heterochromatin. Interestingly, in transgenic but not control mice, a substantial number of large neurons, including approximately 30 % of cerebellar Purkinje cells, showed excessive invaginations of the nuclear membrane...|$|R
40|$|Studying gene {{function}} in the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae {{is the key to}} understanding its biology and vector-parasite interactions. Existing tools to study {{gene function}} do not include gene targeting, which would allow insights into gene function by permitting a range of specific modifications to any gene of choice. Based on developments in Drosophila (RONG and GOLIC 2000) this PhD project proposes to establish a method for gene targeting in Anopheles by homologous recombination, using a linear targeting construct generated in vivo. To this end, a transgenic strain was generated that expresses FLP recombinase and I-SceI endonuclease {{under the control of the}} germline-specific vasa promoter. Together they were to excise and linearise a targeting molecule from a <b>transgenic</b> “donor” <b>locus.</b> Homology in the targeting construct would enable integration, via recombination in the germline, at a gene of interest, thereby permitting its targeted modification. Expression of vasa-driven I-SceI resulted in high cleavage activity in the germline. A systematic analysis using a variety of <b>transgenic</b> target <b>loci</b> revealed that homologous repair, rather than non-homologous end joining, was the predominant mechanism employed to repair the double stranded breaks generated by I-SceI. These findings offer encouraging prospects for population genetic engineering using homing endonuclease genes (BURT 2003). FLP activity was shown in Anopheles cell culture, yet in vivo excision via FLP at two independent loci in the germline was not observed, precluding the obtainment of a knock-out. After eliminating many possible sources of error, likely causes include antagonistic interference between I-SceI and FLP or unfavourable reaction kinetics of FLP. Examination of the ortholog of Drosophila yellow-g 1 as a target gene suggests it is required somatically for female fertility, making it a good candidate for vector population control with a genetic drive system based on homing endonuclease genes. Furthermore, the above finding that recombination is promoted by endonuclease activity driven by the vasa promoter augurs well for its use in mediating efficient drive in such a system.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the inserted transgenes and particularly the junction regions of transgenic events is a concern of food labeling, traceability and post release monitoring, as these regions are used for development of event-specific DNA-based detection methods. During the standard agricultural breeding practices, the transgenic lines can be exposed to completely different conditions {{than those in the}} laboratory environment. Some of these conditions have the potential to affect the {{stability of}} the <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> and the surrounding DNA. As tissue culture is recognized as a stressful and mutagenic factor, we have analyzed the effect of this process on the {{stability of the}} junction regions at nucleotide level in five Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic lines in comparison with the respective integration loci in ColO and C 24 ecotypes. No indication of any kind of alteration at nucleotide level of the junctions was found. The relevance of the stability of the plant-T-DNA junction regions for application of the DNA-based methods in commercial transgenic plants is discussed. JRC. I. 6 -Biotechnology and GMO...|$|E
40|$|The organophosphorus acid hydrolases {{represent}} a distinct class of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis {{of a variety}} of organophosphate substrates, including many insecticides and their structural analogues. The plasmid-borne opd gene of Pseudomonas diminuta strain MG specifies an organophosphorus acid hydrolase, a phosphotriesterase, that has been well characterized and can hydrolyze a broad spectrum of insect and mammalian neurotoxins. The in situ functioning of this enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates has been analyzed directly in insects by transferring the opd gene into embryos of Drosophila melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation. The chromosomal locations of this stably inherited <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus</b> differed from strain to strain and demonstrated various expressivity on the whole-insect basis. Transcriptional induction of opd in one of these strains under control of the Drosophila heat shock promoter, hsp 70, resulted in the synthesis of stable active enzyme that accumulated to high levels with repeated induction. The heat shock-induced synthesis of organophosphorus acid hydrolases in transgenic flies conferred enhanced resistance to toxic paralysis by the organophosphate insecticide paraoxon...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the tightly {{regulated}} tetracycline-sensitive Top 10 promoter system (Weinmann et al. Plant J. 1994, 5, 559 - 569) is functional in Arabidopsis thaliana. A pure breeding A. thaliana line (JL-tTA/ 8) was generated which expressed a chimeric fusion of the tetracycline repressor and the activation domain of Herpes simplex virus (tTA), from a single <b>transgenic</b> <b>locus.</b> Plants from this line were crossed with transgenics carrying the ER-targeted green fluorescent protein coding sequence (mGFP 5) under control of the Top 10 promoter sequence. Progeny from this cross displayed ER-targeted GFP fluorescence throughout the plant, indicating that the tTA-Top 10 promoter interaction was functional in A. thaliana. GFP expression was repressed by 100 ng ml- 1 tetracycline, {{an order of magnitude}} lower than the concentration used previously to repress expression in Nicotiana tabacum. Moreover, the level of GFP expression was controlled by varying the concentration of tetracycline in the medium, allowing a titred regulation of transgenic activity that was previously unavailable in A. thaliana. The kinetics of GFP activity were determined following de-repression of the Top 10 :mGFP 5 transgene, with a visible ER-targeted GFP signal appearing from 24 to 48 h after de-repression...|$|E
40|$|The Ig heavy (H) chain plays {{a pivotal}} role in the {{regulation}} of primary B cell development through its association with a variety of other proteins including Iga and Igb, the surrogate light chain components and bona fide L chains, to form transmembrane signaling complexes. Little is known about how alterations {{in the structure of the}} H chain variable region influence association with these proteins, or the signaling capacity of the complexes that form. Here we describe a line of VH ‘knockin’ mice in which the transgene-encoded VH region differs by eight amino acid residues from the VH region in a VH knockin line we previously constructed and characterized. The <b>transgenic</b> H chain <b>locus</b> in the line of mice we characterized earlier efficiently promotes H chain allelic exclusion and all phases of primary B cell development, resulting in the generation of mature B 1, marginal zone (MZ) and follicular (FO) B cell compartments. In contrast, the <b>transgenic</b> H chain <b>locus</b> in the new line fails to enforce allelic exclusion, as evidenced by the majority of peripheral B cells expressing two H chains on their surfaces. Moreover, this locus inefficiently drives bone marrow B lymphopoiesis and FO B cell development. However, this H chain locus does promote MZ B cell development, from precursors that appear to be generated during fetal and neonatal life. We discuss these data in the context of previous findings on the influence of Ig H chain structure on primary B cell development...|$|R
40|$|Antigenic {{variation}} of Plasmodium falciparum is mediated by a mutually exclusive expression mechanism that limits expression {{to an individual}} member of the multicopy var gene family. This process determines the antigenic and adhesive phenotype of the infected red blood cell. Previously, we showed that var gene switching is influenced by chromosomal position. Here, we address whether var gene transcription follows a general conserved pattern in long-term laboratory parasites and in recently culture-adapted field parasites. Activation of the var gene family was monitored in biological replicates in each parasite isolate every 3 – 5 generations for up to 3 months. We used transgenic parasites carrying a drug-selectable marker at a defined var locus to characterize var gene activation after the exclusive expression of the transgene. Transgenic parasites exhibited a repeatable hierarchy of var gene activation and a fluctuating transcriptional activity of the <b>transgenic</b> var <b>locus.</b> Transcriptional profiling of wild-type laboratory and field parasites showed a universal bias toward transcription of UpsC var genes and a fluctuating transcriptional activity of the dominant var promoter. The data suggest {{the existence of an}} intrinsic var gene transcription program that is independent of genetic background.

40|$|We have {{described}} an Ig-transgenic, autoreactive B cell clonotype that undergoes a novel tolerance pathway. Early in development this clonotype expresses average BCR levels, but these levels are progressively down-regulated as development proceeds efficiently to the mature, follicular compartment. This clonotype does not display conventional features of anergy {{and can be}} induced to undergo apoptosis and receptor editing in in vitro bone marrow cultures, but these pathways are not taken in vivo. These data suggested that autoantigen-driven down-regulation of BCR levels and, hence, avidity for autoantigen allows this clonotype to bypass conventional tolerance mechanisms. To test this idea, we enforced elevated levels of expression of BCR in this clonotype by making the <b>transgenic</b> Igh <b>locus</b> homozygous. This resulted in retarded clonotype development and L chain receptor editing in vivo. These data support a pivotal role for adaptive, autoantigen-induced adjustment of BCR expression levels in the regulation of primary B cell development and tolerance. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 182 : 398 – 407. Three mechanisms of B lymphocyte tolerance induction have been extensively described: clonal deletion, receptor editing, and anergy (1 – 5). These result in either physical or functional elimination of autoreactivity from the mature B cell population. This {{is consistent with the}} forbidden clone corollary to the clonal selection hypothesis (6). However, removal of all autoreactiv...|$|R
