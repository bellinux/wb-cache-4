On the same day the dissenting members of the commission submitted their report to the council, finding fault with the way the members of CACHE were selected, how <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected</b> and used, and a general feeling that the report was affected more by inputs from special interest groups and county staff than the citizens it was formed to represent. The report also included recommendations for the handling of homeless encampments and alternatives to them. [...] The council included the report in the record, and voted to direct the executive to consider its findings when drafting proposed legislation.|$|E

50|$|Secondary data is {{available}} from other sources and may already {{have been used in}} previous research, making it easier to carry out further research. It is time-saving and cost-efficient: <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected</b> by someone other than the researcher. Administrative data and census data may cover both larger and much smaller samples of the population in detail. Information collected by the government will also cover parts of the population that may be less likely to respond to the census (in countries where this is optional).|$|E
50|$|Inverse {{probability}} weighting is {{a statistical}} technique for calculating statistics standardized to a population {{different from that}} in which <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected.</b> Study designs with a disparate sampling population and population of target inference (target population) are common in application. There may be prohibitive factors barring researchers from directly sampling from the target population such as cost, time, or ethical concerns. A {{solution to this problem}} is to use an alternate design strategy, e.g. stratified sampling. Weighting, when correctly applied, can potentially improve the efficiency and reduce the bias of unweighted estimators.|$|E

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that Nassau Senior had written the report before <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected</b> - therefore evidence was used selectively to meet the pre-written report.

However, the inquiry was not supposed to be impartial, the commission wanted to change the existing system, and keeping the current system was not considered an option. The questionnaires used asked leading questions that were poorly framed leading to responses that were ambiguous or irrelevant.|$|E
