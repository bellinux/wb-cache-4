25|$|In metaphysics, Armstrong {{defends the}} view that {{universals}} exist (although Platonic uninstantiated universals do not exist). Those universals match up with the fundamental particles that science <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about.</b> Armstrong describes his philosophy {{as a form of}} scientific realism.|$|E
25|$|This {{consists}} {{of what the}} author <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> himself in the letter, either explicitly the author clearly identifies himself or implicitly provides autobiographical details. This evidence is important {{in spite of its}} problems. For example, because the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews never identified him or herself, scholars as early as Origen of Alexandria in the 3rd century suspected that Paul was not the author.|$|E

25|$|Using this Carnapian approach, Maher {{identifies}} {{a proposition}} which we intuitively (and correctly) {{know to be}} false, but which we easily confuse with the paradoxical conclusion. The proposition in question is the proposition that observing non-ravens <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the color of ravens. While this is intuitively false and is also false according to Carnap's theory of induction, observing non-ravens (according to that same theory) causes us to reduce our estimate {{of the total number}} of ravens, and thereby reduces the estimated number of possible counterexamples to the rule that all ravens are black.|$|E
25|$|Understanding the {{composition}} of Mars' crust and how it changed with time <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> many aspects of Mars' evolution as a planet, and is a major goal of CRISM. Remote and landed measurements prior to CRISM, and analysis of Martian meteorites, all suggest that the Martian crust is made mostly of basaltic igneous rock composed mostly of feldspar and pyroxene. Images from the Mars Orbiter Camera on MGS showed that in some places the upper few kilometers of the crust is composed of hundreds of thin volcanic lava flows. TES and THEMIS both found mostly basaltic igneous rock, with scattered olivine-rich and even some quartz-rich rocks.|$|E
25|$|Mainly {{known for}} his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times {{architecture}} was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, construction management, construction engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, materials engineering, mechanical engineering, military engineering and urban planning; architectural engineers consider him the first of their discipline, a specialization previously known as technical architecture. Frontinus mentions him {{in connection with the}} standard sizes of pipes. He is often credited as father of architectural acoustics for describing the technique of echeas placement in theaters. The only building, however, that we know Vitruvius to have worked on is one he <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about,</b> a basilica completed in 19 BC. It was built at Fanum Fortunae, now the modern town of Fano. The Basilica di Fano (to give the building its Italian name) has disappeared so completely that its very site is a matter of conjecture, although various {{attempts have been made to}} visualise it. The early Christian practice of converting Roman basilicae (public buildings) into cathedrals implies the basilica may be incorporated into the cathedral located in Fano.|$|E

500|$|The speech Against Neaera is {{significant}} {{as the best}} extant narrative {{of the life of}} a woman in the classical period.

500|$|Fraser Nelson, {{editor of}} The Spectator, {{suggested}} the programme had highlighted {{a section of}} society who have been forgotten by the politicians: [...] "These people are people who otherwise don’t have a voice. They don’t vote, so for many years they have just not mattered". Nelson's comments were echoed by Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail, who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically: [...] "The real scandal of Benefits Street, in fact, is what it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> a welfare system that abandons thousands of people – {{through no fault of}} their own – to a life without hope or ambition, effectively turning them into an underclass, dependent on the charity of the State." [...] Charlie Brooker also felt the programme had been [...] "broadly sympathetic" [...] to those it portrays. In the Daily Mirror, entrepreneur John Bird, founder of The Big Issue, wrote that although Benefits Street did not fully represent the spectrum of people who claim benefits, it did show what could happen to those forgotten by the system [...] "who get caught in a kind of social suicide".|$|E
