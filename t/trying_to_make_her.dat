5|$|The {{couple has}} three children. The eldest is Lindesfarne Dewclaw, an English {{hedgehog}} daughter Kevin adopted {{during his first}} marriage. The second eldest child is Rudy, Kell's son from her first marriage to a fox. Rudy, a talented artist, once challenged Kevin for the position of alpha male, unable to accept a rabbit {{as head of the}} household and as his stepfather. He has since matured and has {{come to terms with the}} marriage. The youngest child is Coney, a carnivorous rabbit and their only child by birth. Although only five years old, she is a capable hunter, though Kevin's mother, Dorothy, keeps <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> into an herbivore, as well having an artistic streak like her half-brother.|$|E

Later, Amy delivers Sethe's daughter on a small boat, and Sethe names the child Denver after her.|$|E
25|$|Donna, whom Kathy still {{refuses to}} accept, sinks into {{depression}} and overdoses on heroin and dies, leaving Kathy wrestling with guilt. Kathy attempts {{to move on}} and begins a relationship with market trader Laurie Bates (Gary Powell). Their relationship manages to survive the interference of Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright), who tries but fails to claim Laurie for herself. However, when Laurie begins buying Kathy extravagant clothing and jewellery, she questions his motives, thinking he's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> look like his late wife, and loses interest. Laurie takes her rejection badly and some tactless comments regarding her sexual abstinence makes Kathy believe he has deceived her of his true nature. She ends the relationship. Later in the year, Kathy begins dating Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). He patiently pursues her, but after a few dates, she becomes hesitant and after she sees him kissing Eibhlin O'Donnell (Mary Conlon) - his former girlfriend visiting from Ireland - their lukewarm romance ends.|$|E

So much so, in fact, that the Tuscan envoy reported to Florence that [...] "general opinion turns [...] {{in the direction of the}} Princess, Your Highness's daughter". France, too, was preparing for the Queen's imminent demise, putting forward as its candidate for James's new wife the Duke of Enghien's daughter. The Queen was then <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> brother, the Duke of Modena, marry the former, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici.|$|E
500|$|Aki's {{appearance}} was conceived by the lead animator of the project, Roy Sato, who created several conceptual designs for Sakaguchi to consider, and then used the selected design {{as a guide}} for her character model. Sato perceived Aki's original look as a [...] "supermodel", and subsequently removed her make-up and shortened her hair in order to give her a more intelligent look that would [...] "convince people that she's a scientist." [...] In an interview, Sato described actively <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> appear as realistic as possible, making her similar to himself in as many ways as he could in the animation, including elements of his personality through facial expressions. He concluded that Aki ended up being similar to him in almost every way, with the exception that [...] "she's a lot cuter". The model for Aki was designed to closely follow human appearance, with Sakaguchi commenting in an interview [...] "I think it's OK to look at Aki and be convinced that she's a human." ...|$|E

500|$|Glenn Close, who was {{directed}} by Josh Weinstein, was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks. Mona Simpson was designed in a way {{so that she would}} somewhat resemble Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Mona Simpson's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns. The character was named after Richard Appel's wife at the time, the novelist Mona Simpson. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say [...] "d'oh!" [...] properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{thought the}} moral {{message of the}} {{original}} tale was inappropriate, and decided to [...] "put a spin on it" [...] by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great solution, but eventually becoming a problem. Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not – both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble pretending to be different people, and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine, who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is. [...] Being [...] "imprisoned" [...] is also presented, a fate that occurs {{to most of the}} characters – Aladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles, Genie is attached to his lamp, and Jafar to the Sultan – and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace, and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees. Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess, being rebellious against the royal life and the social structure, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> own way, unlike the princesses who just wait for rescue.|$|E
500|$|Another {{departure}} from history comes during Victoria's coronation scene. Contrary {{to what is}} shown in the film, Albert was not present at the ceremony; the couple instead wrote letters to each other, but Fellowes felt that having them keep opening letters would be less cinematic. Furthermore, according to Fellowes, [...] "The scene where [...] is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> sign the paper when she is ill and she throws it to the floor - it's completely true", and [...] "The scene in Windsor where the King stands up and insults Victoria's mother is not only true, but about two-thirds of his speech is what he actually said!" [...] However, the Duchess of Kent was seated next to the King when he spoke and did not leave during the speech; and, undepicted in the film, the princess burst into tears, [...] "and the two parties, soon realising that they had gone too far, patched up an uneasy truce". According to Charles Greville's memoirs: [...] "The Queen [...] looked in deep distress, the Princess [...] burst into tears, and the whole company were aghast. The Duchess of Kent said not a word. Immediately after they rose and retired, and a terrible scene ensued; the Duchess announced her immediate departure and ordered her carriage, but a sort of reconciliation was patched up, and she was prevailed upon to stay till the next day." ...|$|E

500|$|In each of {{the months}} leading up to its release, Hunt {{promoted}} the album by releasing new songs as free downloads. They were made available through music websites, blogs, and his own website. The song [...] "June" [...] was released through The Huffington Post on June 15. Excluded from the album, it is a somber, jazz-styled track that contrasts the album's raw aesthetic, with upright bass and blue chord changes. Hunt explained the song to be [...] "about a somber girl. I'm identifying with her somberness, but <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> smile ... he June bloom has set in her and she's struggling with it." [...] On July 7, Hunt released another non-album track, [...] "The Savage, Sincere L of P", on Pastes website. It features a soulful rock style and lyrics about the pleasures of the flesh and [...] "the savage, sincere look of pleasure". The album's lead single, [...] "Eyes Like Pearls", was released on September 9 via Hunt's Facebook page. Hunt also promoted the album with a 20-date national headlining tour, his first national tour since 2008. It began on September 19 at Webster Hall in New York City and concluded on October 13 at Yoshi's in San Francisco. He performed with members of his session band, drummer Ruth Price and keyboardist Peter Dyer, as well as guitarist Douglas Showalter. Prior to the tour, they had played at the 21st NAACP Theatre Awards gala on August 29.|$|E
500|$|Mona Penelope Simpson (née Olsen), {{voiced by}} Glenn Close, is Homer's {{deceased}} long-lost mother and Abe's estranged first wife. Her first major appearance was in [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] where she reveals {{that she was}} forced to abandon her family after being caught up in the hippie movement and participated in various acts of activism. The writers used this episode as an opportunity to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Prior to the seventh season, Mona Simpson had only made two brief flashback appearances, the first being season two's [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] and the second being season six's [...] "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] and in both episodes she was voiced by Maggie Roswell. Mona dies in the episode [...] "Mona Leaves-a", as Homer struggles {{to come to terms with}} her death. The character is named after writer Richard Appel's wife, whose maiden name is Mona Simpson. Mona was designed in a way so that she has little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. Glenn Close recorded original material for another episode, season fifteen's [...] "My Mother the Carjacker". Mona also has a speaking appearance in season ten's [...] "D'oh-in in the Wind", this time voiced by Tress MacNeille.|$|E
500|$|The Lone Gunmen come to Mulder's {{apartment}} in disguise {{and tell him}} that they cannot find Scully. They reveal that they have found e-mails between Scully and a man called Cobra, who is apparently working on a shadow project at the Department of Defense. [...] Meanwhile, Scully wakes up in a cabin in Pennsylvania in pajamas instead of her clothes, and accuses The Smoking Man of drugging her. He claims she was merely exhausted and he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> comfortable. [...] She attempts to leave but decides to continue when The Smoking Man tells her she's free to go and that the choice of whether to accept his help or not is hers. Mulder and The Lone Gunmen go to Skinner to figure out why Scully was communicating with Cobra. They find that an anonymous person has hacked into Scully's computer and has been sending Cobra messages calling for a meeting. The group believe that it is the work of The Smoking Man, but Skinner still does not know how {{to get a hold of}} him. At dinner, The Smoking Man tells Scully that the cure he possesses is not just the cure for cancer, but for all human disease, and that it is extraterrestrial. The Smoking Man goes outside and tells the man who has been following them that Cobra has not shown. Scully finds a note under her dessert plate saying to meet at Calico Cove at dawn. She goes alone and is stopped by Cobra, who gives her a disc before being shot and killed by a sniper. The sniper also attempts to kill Scully, but is killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E

Iodine's antics gave the Sunday comics page a female precursor to Hank Ketcham's Dennis the Menace. From 1943 to 1963, Little Iodine was written and drawn by Hatlo, who said, [...] "I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> the embodiment of all the brats I knew...

Tomari is Hazumu's {{childhood}} friend, so the two {{know a lot about}} each other and have many memories from the past. Hazumu would often get bullied as a child, and Tomari would have to come to his rescue, saying that she would protect him forever. After Hazumu's initial transformation, Tomari does not know what to do.

2500|$|Her outfit in Bayonetta 2 {{was again}} {{designed}} by Shimazaki. It was generally designed more around straight lines than curves. All her jewelry and accessories were designed around this initiative apart from her glasses. There was debate {{about where to}} show skin, {{but when it was}} decided to create a cape {{at the front of the}} outfit, the front of her outfit was closed and instead they opted to show a large area of her back. For her new look, blue became a key color as opposed to the first game, where it was red: this was because water was a key theme for the second game and Hashimoto requested blue to become the design's key color. This eventually proved difficult as, combined with the black and silver incorporated into her outfit and the game's general color palette, it did not have the sharp qualities of her former appearance. Shimazaki described <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> stand out in her black outfit as [...] "a nightmare". Her overall design theme was [...] "solid". The character's hairstyle underwent a major redesign. Hashimoto's main reason behind this was that [...] " [...] personality is the type that would not want to remain stagnant. She would want to change her style, taste in fashion, and her costumes. Down the line in the series, she may make further changes to her appearance." [...] The texture of her outfit was designed to appear similar to leather, despite it still being made from her hair. Her new guns, Love is Blue, were also difficult to design, as making them too large or too similar in color to other elements of Bayonetta's outfit would not have fitted her. In the end, they were made a more striking shade of blue, as well as being given some gold to match Bayonetta's chestpiece and a silver sheen. Each of the guns, Night, Jealous, Eye and Life, were given antique charms adorned with flower designs and named according to their color and the ideas they evoked to further promote and augment the new look.|$|E
