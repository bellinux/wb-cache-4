Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority over the use of the Deep Space Network.

The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin.|$|E
