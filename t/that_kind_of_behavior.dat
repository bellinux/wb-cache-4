Jirafales approaches her on impulse (in ballet-like steps) and initiates a dialogue routine, which always ends with him taking her arm and stepping into her house for [...] "una tacita de café" [...] (a cup of coffee). The entire routine is purposefully cliché and overdone, and despite her obvious interest, Jirafales has not gathered the courage to confess. The most Professor Jirafales wants, and struggles with, is to confess he is in love with Doña Florinda, although it is never officially said so. Doña Florindas son, Quico, always says: [...] "Some more 38 (or whatever number) cups of coffee, and I have a new daddy". Another weird thing is that in Spanish Doña Florinda talks to Professor Jirafales (and vice versa) in the form of [...] "usted", which in Spanish is the usual way to talk to a person older than you, or a random person you dont have the confidence to talk as a known one, or simply for respect to that person. Professor Jirafales also does some very personal attitudes that simple friends dont. For example, he asks Doña Florinda to bake a special cake for him. Once, Quico noticed that Jirafales only ever brought flowers to Doña Florinda, and questioned him about this. After several fruitless arguments, Florinda ended the discussion with her traditional cup of coffee (Quico concludes that Jirafales only gives flowers to Doña Florinda because she only gives coffee to Jirafales). Sometimes, after a conversation or something else that distracted him and Doña Florinda appears, he would accidentally scramble a keyword from the conversation/distraction with her name. Analyzing <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior,</b> it can assume that this is due to reasons of typical nerves of a person in love.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{conceptions of}} {{sadomasochism}} are misleading. This {{is because they}} are not based on close examination of what the majority of SM participants actually do and how they interpret their own behaviors. Over a period of eight years, we inter-viewed a variety of SM participants and observed their behavior in many different settings. We found that sadomasochism was constituted by five social features: dominance and submission, role playing, consensuality, a sexual context, and mutual definition. These features formed the basis for the interpretation of behaviors and experiences as SM by participants. This focus permits a sociological model of the phenomena which avoids the limitations of more traditional conceptions. Sadomasochism (SM), the deliberate use of physical and/or psychological "pain " to produce sexual arousal, puzzles the public and professionals alike. Most people relate sex to feelings of love, tenderness, and affection, not the hate and callousness that SM implies. SM's emphasis on pain and humiliation leads many people to regard SM participants as "perverted " and "sick. " The public's conception of SM is exemplified in an article in Time (1981 : 74) which concluded, "While <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> [cruelty involved with sex] may be rare, it is a sobering reminder that SM is no sport, but a driven activity fueled by rage.

Such behavior is seen throughout history, dating back at least to ancient Egypt (Bloch, 1935; Ellis, 1936). Generally, it has been viewed positively.
