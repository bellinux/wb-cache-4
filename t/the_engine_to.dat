5|$|The R-95Sh engines {{have been}} {{overhauled}} and modified with an anti-surge system installed. The {{system is designed}} to improve the resistance of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> ingested powders and gases during gun and rocket salvo firing.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This {{was overcome by}} reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories from beneath <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> the sides. The resulting flattened nacelle bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing737 with CFM56 engines.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E

5000|$|Tapered spacers will be {{installed}} in <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> reduce horsepower from 850 to 725.|$|R
60|$|Immediately after, {{he ordered}} <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> {{play on a}} {{particular}} part of the building.|$|R
5|$|Most of the Merlin's {{technical}} improvements {{resulted from}} more efficient superchargers, designed by Stanley Hooker, {{and the introduction}} of aviation fuel with increased octane ratings. Numerous detail changes were made internally and externally to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> withstand increased power ratings and to incorporate advances in engineering practices.|$|E
5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive from the rear of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several engine {{failures}} in the early service of the CFM56 family which were serious enough to either ground the fleet or require aspects of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> be redesigned. The engines have also suffered, periodically, from thrust instability events tentatively traced to Honeywell's hydromechanical unit.|$|E
50|$|SuperDraco rocket engines utilize a {{storable}} (non-cryogenic) propellant {{which allows}} <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> be fired many months after fueling and launch.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> bear {{a passing}} {{resemblance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> on <b>the</b> Snowdon Mountain Railway, Christopher Awdry {{notes that he}} doesn't believe his father intended any of <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> correspond with particular SMR locomotives.|$|R
25|$|Ice {{adhered to}} the inside of the fuel lines, {{probably}} where they ran through the struts attaching <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wings.|$|R
5|$|While it {{received}} little {{attention from the}} mainstream media, the game was immediately controversial among Americans {{on both sides of}} the political spectrum. The Anti-Defamation League, an anti-racist organization that especially covers anti-Semitism, publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> develop racist games. They lobbied the Interactive Digital Software Association to encourage its members to adopt such policies.|$|E
5|$|At a {{research}} lab in Colson, Washington, intellectually disabled janitor Roland Fuller is scolded by scientist Dr. Keats for forgetting {{how to use}} the facility's keycard locks. Keats walks in on his colleagues, Frank Nollette and Ronald Surnow, as they argue over a prototype jet engine they are developing. Nollette wants to push testing of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> break mach 15, but Surnow is unwilling to risk damaging the prototype. After Keats and Nollette angrily leave, Surnow enters the facility's wind tunnel to make adjustments. However, Roland activates the tunnel's turbines, sending Surnow flying to his death.|$|E
5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the engine air intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the wing spar.|$|E
50|$|Fan, {{compressor}} or {{turbine blade}} failures {{have to be}} contained within <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> casing. <b>To</b> do this <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> has <b>to</b> be designed to pass blade containment tests as specified by certification authorities.|$|R
50|$|The key {{design feature}} for <b>the</b> Scimitar <b>engines</b> is <b>the</b> precooler, {{which is a}} heat {{exchanger}} that transfers {{the heat from the}} incoming air into the hydrogen fuel. This greatly cools the air, which allows <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> burn more fuel even at very high speed, and allows <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> be made of lighter, but more heat susceptible, materials such as light alloys. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> inlet diffuser also has to slow the incoming air to subsonic speeds because if the air moved through the precooler and compressor at supersonic speeds, it would cause damage to them.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{though the}} {{temperature}} was freezing and it was snowing, the crew did not activate <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> anti-ice system. This system uses heat from <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> prevent sensors from freezing, ensuring accurate readings.|$|R
5|$|In {{the course}} of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60Imperial gallons (gal) (270L) of {{pre-heated}} castor oil. The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E
5|$|TWR {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new turbocharged engine, codenamed JV6, under the auspices of Allan Scott, with proportions roughly similar to the V64V, and suitable for Sportcar racing. As the V64V was originally naturally aspirated, TWR needed to redesign all parts of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> accommodate forced induction. A few of the changes included increasing the displacement to 3.5 litres, strengthening the internals, and adding two Garrett TO3 turbochargers. The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220. The engine had a 90Â° bank angle, four valves per cylinder and belt-driven double overhead camshafts. It shares a number of design features with the Cosworth DFV Formula One engine.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger {{went into}} {{production}} in June 1964, {{little more than}} a year after the completion of the Shelby prototype. Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by Pressed Steel in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods, including using a sledgehammer to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{addressing}} overheating issues, the modifications allow <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> {{work better}} on the grades on the southern region of the Main Line.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{placement}} of <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> proved <b>to</b> be unsatisfactory. In {{order to protect}} them from enemy shot, they had been crowded into shallow holds, causing <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> work both water and steam. To remedy the problem, the steam drums had to be moved {{to the top of the}} boilers. This meant that they were no longer fully protected.|$|R
5000|$|Varney Air Lines also flew a Wright J-4 powered {{model as}} an {{addition}} to its Swallow airmail aircraft. It later upgraded <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> Wright J-5s ...|$|R
5|$|The game {{used the}} Infinity Engine, a game engine {{initially}} developed by BioWare for Baldur's Gate. However, Planescape: Torment was being developed using the Infinity Engine before Baldur's Gate had been released, leaving the engine's acceptance {{in the market}} still unknown. Black Isle made modifications to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> suit the game. For example, playable characters were able to run, and both the character sprites and backgrounds were larger and more detailed. The greater size and detail was achieved by bringing the perspective closer to the ground. Magic was also {{an important part of}} the game's design, and a team of four designers worked solely on the visuals and mechanics of spells.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} engine used {{to power the}} game was christened the Diesel Engine. Grin developed this engine for flexibility and scalability, allowing <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> be easily upgraded with new features. Based on DirectX, this meant the engine could be used across Windows and Xbox platforms. Grin worked closely with NVIDIA to incorporate then new technologies such as pixel and vertex shaders to render complex scenes. Ballistics was marketed by NVIDIA as a flagship title for their new series of GeForce 3 graphics cards. The game came bundled with various versions of the GeForce 3, with distribution of the bundled game handled by Interplay OEM. Later versions of the Diesel Engine would be used in Grin games such as the Windows version of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives to the front of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved {{to the front of the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|Avgas is {{occasionally}} used in amateur {{auto racing}} cars as its octane rating {{is higher than}} automotive gasoline thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> run at higher compression ratios.|$|R
50|$|Construction of {{the four}} prototypes (serial numbers A-5576, A-5577, A-5578, and A-5579) began in August 1919. The first TF was {{completed}} on October 1, 1920, with the first flight taking place 12 days later. However, high throttle settings caused <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> overheat, thus obliging the pilot to undertake an emergency landing {{at the mouth of}} the Delaware River. After a brief waiting period <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> cool, <b>the</b> aircraft was damaged upon collision with an ocean liner's wake during another takeoff attempt. Other problems noted during initial testing were stiff and erratic rudder control while the ailerons exhibited a tendency to roll in directions opposite to that of rudder control. While subsequent modifications to the tail section remedied the stability problems, the propensity of <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> overheat at high RPM settings remained an ongoing hindrance to the testing procedure, not only causing several premature landings, but ultimately providing the most decisive factor in the TF's subsequent cancellation.|$|R
50|$|W2 {{were the}} 5.7 L inline six engines built for and ordered by Spyker. Not all were purchased, and Karl {{had to build}} cars {{featuring}} <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> offset costs.|$|R
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> stall.|$|E
5|$|To {{provide the}} desired performance, several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Wolfenstein 3D was a {{critical}} and commercial success, garnering numerous awards and selling over 200,000 copies {{by the end of}} 1993. It is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first-person shooter genre and establishing the standard of fast-paced action and technical prowess for many subsequent games in the genre, as well as showcasing the viability of the shareware publishing model at the time. FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game, while Apogee released a pack of over 800 fan-created levels. Id Software never returned to the series, but did license <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in 1995, and multiple other games in the Wolfenstein series have been developed by other companies since 2001.|$|E
5000|$|... 1909 (September) The S.S. Ocean Queen was wrecked on {{the reef}} at Makatea; a bent {{connecting}} rod caused <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> stop and <b>the</b> current carried the ship onto the reef.|$|R
50|$|At that moment, {{the crew}} applied maximum thrust on <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> climb to 18000 ft. Supposedly, {{had they not}} applied thrust, the turbine disc in the inner left (No. 2) engine would have survived the entire flight. However, nine minutes after the thrust was applied, the faulty {{bearings}} inside <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> overheated enough (<b>to</b> about 1000 C) to cause an explosion.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{difficulties}} were encountered when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> started <b>to</b> be used: {{power output}} {{was said to}} be only around [...] at around 13,000 rpm, while the novel method of drawing power from the centre of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> led <b>to</b> oil pressure problems.|$|R
