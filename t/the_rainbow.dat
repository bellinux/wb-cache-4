Since that date it has remained chalked. A group of families and supporters continue to chalk <b>the</b> <b>rainbow,</b> especially after rain. This group has also ensured the area remains free of litter; they also hold occasional performances and arts-related celebrations at the site. Some local businesses have offered discounts and support for <b>the</b> <b>rainbow,</b> these display a logo with a stylised image of <b>the</b> <b>rainbow</b> crossing on it.|$|E

5|$|In August 2008, it was {{announced}} that Talbot had signed a contract with Data Design Interactive for production of a video game on the Wii console. The game was to feature 15 songs from Over <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow,</b> allowing players to sing along with a computer-generated image of Talbot or against other players in a karaoke mode. Talbot re-recorded the album for the game. The game was scheduled for release {{in the first quarter of}} 2009, and is called Connie Talbot: Over <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow.</b> The game has never been released, citing copyright issues on the songs used for it.|$|E
5|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow</b> {{received}} poor reviews. Though praising Talbot's voice, critics noted a lack {{of depth}} in the performances, and questioned the appropriateness of releasing and rating work by such a young artist. The album peaked at number 35 on the UK Albums Chart. Despite its poor chart performance, additional copies of the album had to be pressed after sales were higher than expected. Talbot later toured Asia {{in support of the}} album; Over <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow</b> achieved more success on Asian charts, reaching number one in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.|$|E

A former fairground worker employed at <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow</b> public house in the Digbeth area of the city, Smith killed his victims over a four-day period in November 2000, befriending two of them at <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow</b> before carrying out the crimes. All three victims were mutilated almost beyond recognition, but Smith was quickly identified as the killer because of the overwhelming evidence linking him to the deaths.|$|E

5|$|The late 1960s {{and early}} 1970s {{also saw the}} {{complete}} reconstruction of three important interchanges: <b>The</b> <b>Rainbow</b> Bridge Approach (later Highway420) in Niagara Falls, Highway20 (Centennial Parkway) in Hamilton and Highway27 in Toronto. The former two were traffic circles in place since the QEW was opened in 1940. The third was a large cloverleaf interchange that had become outdated with the expansion of Highway27 to ten lanes throughout the 1960s. The connections with <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow</b> Bridge Approach and with Highway27 required new massive high-speed interchanges to accommodate freeway–freeway traffic movements.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{completed}} by April 1972, at which point <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow</b> Bridge Approach was designated as Highway420.|$|E
