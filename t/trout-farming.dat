50|$|Despite {{being in}} one of Mexico’s most {{populated}} regions, the municipality is still quite rural as it is located in an isolated valley, with farmland on the valley floor, and forests in the elevations. Most {{of the land in}} the municipality is used for forestry, followed by fish farming then agriculture. However, agriculture is the most important economic activity, harvesting corn, flowers and rice. There is some livestock but very little industry. Trout farming is also an important economic activity. Commerce here centers on the needs of the local population and tourism {{in the case of the}} towns of Malinalco and Chalma. Sixty three percent of the population here makes its living through agriculture, livestock and <b>trout-farming.</b> A study done on peasant households in the municipality show that these families depend on multiple economic activities, including temporary migration to nearby cities or the United States.|$|E

The large number of rivers and streams that feed into dams have created places to fish for trout as well as <b>trout-farming.</b> In locations like the Taxhimay Dam, boat rentals for fishing include cooking what you catch. Trout-farms raise and sell the fish to locales {{inside and outside of}} Villa del Carbón. There are also a number of restaurants dedicated to cuisine based on trout and other forest products. These restaurants are mostly located were rivers run near the highways to Mexico City and Atlacomulco.In and around the municipal seat, charreada is {{a major part of the}} local culture and competitions here have gone national. The main sponsor of these events is the Villa de Carbón Charreada Association, which has gained statues in the charreada world over the years. This association now hosts national-level competitions at the Lienzo Charro Cornielio Nieto, located just outside the town of Villa del Carbón. One particular group of note is the Escaramuza Charra (a group of twelve women who perform choreographed equine displays). This group has placed in the top three in many regional and national-level competitions and placed fifth in the national championships of 2005. Villa del Carbón main charreada events take place on March 10 (founding of the municipality), September 16 (Mexican Independence) and December 8 (Feast day of the patron saint of Villa del Carbón). On these days, the events are accompanies by musical events, dances, craft expositions and regional cuisine.|$|E
