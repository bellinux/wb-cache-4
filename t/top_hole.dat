2500|$|Hungarian piping is {{characterized}} by use of the kontra to provide rhythmic accompaniment and to vary the drone sound. The melody pipe has a [...] "flea hole", a common feature in Eastern bagpipes: the <b>top</b> <b>hole</b> on the chanter is very small and uncovering it raises the pitch of any other note by approximately a semitone, making the Hungarian pipe largely chromatic over its range (it lacks a major seventh). In some historic examples, the magyar duda was tuned with a neutral (i.e., between the major and the minor in pitch) third and sixth and the flea hole was filled in with wax.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stone is}} {{identified}} as a hearth stone; the nozzle of the bellows would be inserted into {{the hole in the}} front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the <b>top</b> <b>hole,</b> all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans Jørgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is [...] "the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known." [...] The stone is housed and on display at the Moesgård Museum near Aarhus, Denmark.|$|E
2500|$|Fingering in {{the second}} {{register}} is generally {{the same as in}} the first/fundamental, though alternate fingerings are sometimes employed in the higher end of the registers to correct a flattening effect caused by higher aircolumn velocity. Also, the tonic note of the second register is usually played with the <b>top</b> <b>hole</b> of the whistle partially uncovered instead of covering all holes as with the tonic note of the first register; this makes it harder to accidentally drop into the first register and helps to correct pitch. Recorders perform this by [...] "pinching" [...] open the dorsal thumb hole.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{compression}} strength of the corrugated shipping containers having the conventional purpose hand holes and the arc <b>top</b> hand <b>holes.</b> Generally, the arc <b>top</b> hand <b>hole</b> has stronger tear strength than the conventional purpose hand hole, but the arc <b>top</b> hand <b>hole</b> has a larger opening area than the conventional purpose hand hole, and the larger opening area needs more space of a dispersion of compression stress to increase compression resistance. However, when a hand hole has enough space to distribute compression stress, the only one variable is the width of the opening area in shipping containers if the containers have the same dimensions. In this study, two designs of the hand hole have the same width of opening area and are located to have enough space to distribute compression stress. As a result, the resistance forces of containers are the same in each different environment...|$|R

5000|$|The one single-ball mode not {{accounted}} for by the door panels is [...] "Battle the Power". The door panel by the same name merely lights the right ramp. To actually play the [...] "Battle the Power" [...] mode, the player must shoot the right ramp when the shot is lit and the Powerball is not in play. The ball moves to the raised triangular mini-playfield (the [...] "Powerfield") at the left edge of the main playfield, and the player must then direct the ball into the <b>top</b> <b>hole</b> within a set time limit. The Powerfield utilizes two medium-power magnets that act as flippers (dubbed [...] "Magna-Flips"). Points are awarded for hitting switches on the walls. If the ball falls through the bottom hole or time runs out, the player scores the points accumulated during the mode. If the player succeeds in shooting the ball through the <b>top</b> <b>hole,</b> the total is doubled and the currently highlighted door panel mode is started.
