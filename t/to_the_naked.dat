5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy {{is among the}} brightest of the Messier objects - making it visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.|$|E
5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of {{the stars in the}} Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
50|$|In a {{modern-time}} re-enactment of the Pasteur experiment, it {{was established}} that the preparation of crystals was not very reproducible. The crystals deformed, but they were large enough <b>to</b> inspect with <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye (microscope not required).|$|R
50|$|The Vorlons {{were able}} to take a piece of {{hyperspace}} and fold it onto itself like a pocket {{and use it as a}} hiding place (anything inside the pocket is apparently almost invisible <b>to</b> sensors and <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye).|$|R

5|$|Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially {{designated}} 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet {{visible from}} Earth every 74–79 years. Halley {{is the only}} known short-period comet that is regularly visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{classical}} planets, Uranus is visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye, {{but it was}} never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit. Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on 13 March 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System {{for the first time in}} history and making Uranus the first planet discovered with a telescope.|$|E
50|$|Hunters {{commonly}} use binoculars in {{the field}} {{as a way to}} see game animals that are too far away <b>to</b> spot with <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. Hunters most commonly use 8x binoculars with light transmission and large enough objectives to gather light in low light conditions.|$|R
25|$|M13, visible <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye and binoculars, is a {{globular}} cluster of the 6th magnitude that {{contains more than}} 300,000 stars and is 25,200 light-years from Earth.

5|$|Phoenix {{contains}} HE0107-5240, possibly one of {{the oldest}} stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early {{in the history of the}} universe. With a visual magnitude of 15.17, it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye and is 36000 light years distant.|$|E
5|$|The nucleus {{reached its}} maximum {{apparent}} size in December 1882. The comet faded gradually, but despite its fragmentation it remained visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye until February 1883. The last definite sighting {{of the comet}} was made by B. A. Gould at Córdoba on 1 June 1883.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} probability is {{that the}} next supernova observed in the Milky Way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant, very likely not even visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. Nevertheless, {{the prospect of a}} supernova originating from an object as extreme, nearby, and well-studied as Eta Carinae arouses great interest.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} <b>to</b> see with <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye if <b>the</b> eggs are developing healthily. Freshly laid eggs have a gray-white color. Shortly thereafter, a bright white spot forms on the uppermost {{point of the}} egg. This spot gradually grows until the entire egg is bright white.|$|R
5|$|The planet Jupiter {{has been}} known since ancient times. It is visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye {{in the night sky}} and can {{occasionally}} be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low. To the Babylonians, this object represented their god Marduk. They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.|$|E
5|$|The star HR 6958, {{also known}} as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum {{variable}} that is faintly visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. The star's metal abundance is ten {{times higher than the}} Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess silicon. Barely visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye is HD 172365, a likely post-blue straggler in the open cluster IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium. HD 172189, also located in IC 4756, is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.|$|E
5|$|The tan lines {{created by}} the wearing of a bikini while tanning are known as a bikini tan. A 1969 {{innovation}} of tan-through swimwear uses fabric which is perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye, but which let enough sunlight through to produce a line-free tan.|$|E

5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude between +7.7 and +8.0, Neptune is never visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye {{and can be}} outshone by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno, and 6 Hebe. A telescope or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into {{the northern part of the}} constellation. The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E
50|$|Fortuny often painted scenes where {{contemporary}} life had still not shaken off the epaulets and decorations of ancient traditions {{such as the}} ‘’Burial of a matador’’ and couples signing marriage contracts (La Vicaria). Each has the dazzle of bric-a-brac ornament, but as in his painting of the Judgement of the model, that painterly decorative air of Rococo and Romanticism was fading into academicism and left <b>to</b> confront <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> reality of <b>the</b> represented object. He inherited Goya's eye for the paradox of ceremony and reality.|$|R
30|$|Plantation program aims <b>to</b> vegetate <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> mudflats by {{community}} participation. One of the focal reasons for mangrove deforestation {{in the human}} habituated islands of Sundarbans had been overgrazed by livestock specially goats apart from land conversion activities. So involving <b>the</b> community <b>to</b> plant <b>the</b> saplings gave them an emotional attachment with the planted saplings and it reduces their overgrazing activity. This conclusion {{can be drawn from}} the survival rate of the saplings and informal interviews conducted by the project employees amongst the non-group members of the community residing near the plantation area.|$|R
40|$|SummaryVertebrates rely on {{antimicrobial}} peptides as a front-line {{defense against}} invading pathogens. Certain cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as human α-defensins, {{have traditionally been}} thought to destroy invading microbes by disrupting their lipid membranes.
