5|$|Depending {{on where}} it is used, the phrase has had {{different}} emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer for <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condemned. However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it has only been said {{as a result of}} legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.|$|E
2500|$|The Egyptian god Hor, {{living in}} the second century BCE {{suggests}} the purpose underlying <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> mummifying animals: [...] "The benefit [...] which is performed for <b>the</b> Ibis, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Toth, <b>the</b> greatest one, is made for <b>the</b> Hawk also, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Ptah, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Apis, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Pre, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Shu, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Tefnut, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Geb, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Osiris, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Isis, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Nephtys, <b>the</b> great gods <b>of</b> Egypt, <b>the</b> Ibis and the Hawk." [...] Hor believes that <b>the</b> mummies are <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods: he describes <b>the</b> ibis as <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Toth and <b>the</b> hawk as <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> many different gods. That is to say, some animals were, or contained, a ba- a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> that is an active agents in this world and the spiritual world. Therefore, votive animal mummies are <b>the</b> animals' <b>souls</b> acted as messengers between people on earth and the gods.|$|R

5|$|Reyes finds {{newspaper}} clippings explaining the story: In 1868, {{a group of}} four miners murdered a man.

In each case, the avenger is a prominent figure of the law.|$|E

5|$|An infant's new tooth {{is celebrated}} with bowls of {{sweetened}} wheat or barley and sweets served after a child's circumcision include baklava and Burma. Christian families in mourning serve a sweet bun known as rahmeh. It is a food eaten in remembrance {{of the dead}} and as a gesture of blessing <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased person. The Greek Orthodox Church offer a special tray with cooked wheat covered with sugar and candy after a memorial service.|$|E
50|$|Youdu is {{the home}} or {{official}} residence of various deities, and also <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> their official offices or palaces. <b>The</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead are their fellow inhabitants and subjects. There are also many subordinate demons which serve to carry out <b>the</b> commands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judges. Many <b>of</b> these are concerned with punishing or processing <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead for reincarnation. The sovereign deity is {{generally considered to be}} King Yama. Beneath him in rank ten other kings serve as judges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead.|$|R
50|$|Mt. Zinghmuh {{was once}} the Chin people's {{favourite}} place for cults and worshipping gods/ spirits. It was also a highway for <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead people {{on their way to}} the dead village, locally known as Mithi Khua. Before Christianity came to Chin Hills, the Chin people believed that <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead went to a place called <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> dead i.e. Mithi Khua. It was believed that <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead had to pass along <b>the</b> imaginary street <b>of</b> Zinghmun mountain range. It was an imaginary street for living people because mortal people could not see it.|$|R

5|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for Hasidic Jews to place kvitelach on the gravesite of a Rebbe or tzadik {{with the belief that}} <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased will pray for them in Heaven. The visitor usually sits beside the grave to write his kvitel and meditate on his request, and then tears the kvitel and throws it on top of the grave. Many graves of Jewish holy men are constructed with special apertures for the insertion of kvitelach.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremony}} is often held weeks, months, or {{years after the}} death so that the deceased's family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses. Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward Puya (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, {{the body of the}} deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the tongkonan. <b>The</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral {{ceremony is}} completed, after which it begins its journey to Puya.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, <b>The</b> <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E

5|$|Funerary poems {{were thought}} to {{preserve}} a monarch's soul in death. The Pyramid Texts are the earliest surviving religious literature incorporating poetic verse. These texts do not appear in tombs or pyramids originating before the reign of Unas (r. 2375–2345 BC), who had the Pyramid of Unas built at Saqqara. The Pyramid Texts are chiefly concerned with the function of preserving and nurturing <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sovereign in the afterlife. This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects in the afterlife. A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom, the so-called Book of the Dead, Litany of Ra, and Amduat written on papyri from the New Kingdom {{until the end of}} ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson, {{alongside}} Edward Elgar and H.G. Wells represented British {{culture at}} the celebrations of {{the first anniversary of}} the Republic of Czechoslovakia in Prague in 1919. Nevinson first visited New York in May 1919 and spent a month there while his World War One prints were being shown, to great acclaim, at the Frederick Keppel & Co gallery. A second exhibition at the same venue in October 1920 was poorly received. This led to Nevinson becoming disillusioned with New York, to the extent he changed the name of his painting New York-an abstraction to <b>The</b> <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soulless City. Nevinson claimed to have been the first artist to depict New York in a modernist style but in fact several British avant-garde artists had painted in the city before World War One. In May 1919, while Nevinson was in America, Kathleen Nevinson gave birth to a baby son, but the child died shortly later and before his father could return to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E
