5|$|At {{the end of}} development, {{the game}} was known as Draconia, before being renamed to Menace shortly before release, upon {{discovering}} that another game had the same title. It was published in 1988 for the Amiga, and in 1989 for the Atari ST, Commodore 64 and DOS. The game generated {{a considerable amount of}} money for DMA Design, allowing the company <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>more</b> games.

Working with director John Farrow at RKO Pictures in 1939, he created a fine character study as the condemned anarchist in Five Came Back, and portrayed a heroic priest in Full Confession.

5|$|Raël founded Clonaid in March 1997, {{shortly after}} the Dolly the Sheep cloning, believing that the process was {{important}} because the human species had been created by an extraterrestrial cloning project. On a practical level, Raël promoted the practice as a way <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>more</b> desirable genetics and eventually prolong memories in new bodies. Shortly after Clonaid's launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that she had set up cloning laboratories and had hired a team of six scientists. She said she had limited knowledge of cloning but was skilled in selecting experts.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} redesigned {{the game}} engine, {{the software that}} handles rendering and much of gameplay. Bungie hired an expert in motion capture <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>more</b> realistic character animations.

The developers sought to increase replay value by focusing on improving artificial intelligence. Rather than scripting enemy encounters, they focused on a more open world or sandbox approach to battles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{influential}} early mainframe {{game was}} Baseball, a sports game {{that was created}} on a PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1971 by English major Don Daglow. Baseball was the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players {{at the beginning of}} a game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Baseball was continually updated through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk the batter, or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and the batter to hit. The results of the play would be printed out onto paper as a verbose description, like a radio description of the game. Daglow went on <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with Intellivision World Series Baseball, and 1987 with Earl Weaver Baseball, as well as numerous other games.|$|E

He was also 2nd with in on base % (.414), tied for 9th in triples (7) and 5th in times on base, reaching 257 times. In the final season of his first stint in Oakland Henderson started <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>more</b> of a power stroke hitting 16 home runs while leading the league in stolen bases (66), finishing 2nd in runs scored (113) and 3rd in on base % (.399).

5|$|In January 2000, Ferraro and Lynn Martin—a former Republican Congresswoman and U.S. Secretary of Labor who {{had played}} Ferraro in George H. W.

Its goal was to advise corporations on how <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>more</b> women leaders and make their workplaces more amenable to female employees. G Strategies subsequently became part of Golin Harris International. In , Ferraro was made {{executive vice president and}} managing director of the public affairs practice of the Global Consulting Group, an international investor relations and corporate communications component of Huntsworth.

5|$|Mulder goes to {{investigate}} the facility Sheriff Frass mentioned. Before breaking in, he and Scully discuss the odd behavior of the roaches, with Scully hypothesizing that the roaches could be an invasive species. Inside the facility, which resembles a typical house, Mulder sees the walls rippling and is quickly surrounded by roaches. He is then confronted by Dr. Bambi Berenbaum (Bobbie Phillips), a researcher from the Department of Agriculture who is studying cockroaches <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>more</b> effective methods of pest control. Berenbaum has great interest in insects and, incidentally, believes that some UFOs are actually insect swarms flying through electrically charged airspaces. Yet another death occurs in Mulder's hotel, with the individual being found covered in roaches that quickly flee. At this point, Mulder believes that the individual simply died of fright, though Scully begins to wonder {{what is going on}} and decides to head up there herself.|$|E
5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>more</b> aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E
5|$|A {{long-lived}} system {{developed on}} February28 in the Australian region south of February28, and moved westward. On March7, the JTWC initiated advisories {{on the system}} as Tropical Cyclone 26S, briefly estimating peak 1-minute winds of 65km/h (40mph) the next day. Soon after, the system weakened into a tropical depression, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean late on March8. At that time, it was designated Tropical Disturbance E2. Continuing westward along {{the northern edge of}} a strong ridge, the disturbance failed to intensify due to easterly wind shear. Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories, they noted that a distinct circulation persisted, reaching a location to the north of Mauritius by March16. That day, it turned back to the east with a sporadic area of convection, influenced by the larger Tropical Depression E3. Two days later, the system organized enough for the MFR to reclassify it as a tropical disturbance. The system failed to reorganize much, and dissipated on March20. Another tropical disturbance, named E3, formed on March11 in the eastern portion of the basin. It initially failed <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>more,</b> but after an increase in convection, the system intensified into a tropical depression on March14 while moving generally west-northwestward. On the next day, the system began drifting to the southwest due to weak steering currents. On March16, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 28S, briefly upgrading it to tropical storm status on the next day. On March18, the depression began weakening, dissipating three days later.|$|E
