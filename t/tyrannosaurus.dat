5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be closely related to <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex, or even a direct ancestor through anagenesis. Gregory Paul reassigned D. torosus to the genus <b>Tyrannosaurus,</b> creating the new combination <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> torosus, but {{this has not been}} generally accepted. Many researchers believe Tarbosaurus and <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> to be sister taxa or even to be the same genus, with Daspletosaurus a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find Daspletosaurus to be more closely related to Tarbosaurus and other Asian tyrannosaurids like Alioramus than to the North American <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of Daspletosaurus may become clearer once all the species have been described.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Soviet {{paleontologist}} Evgeny Maleev named a new species, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> bataar, from Mongolia. By 1965, {{this species}} had been renamed Tarbosaurus bataar. Despite the renaming, many phylogenetic analyses have found Tarbosaurus bataar {{to be the}} sister taxon of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex, and {{it has often been}} considered an Asian species of <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> A recent redescription of the skull of Tarbosaurus bataar has shown that it was much narrower than that of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex and that during a bite, the distribution of stress in the skull would have been very different, closer to that of Alioramus, another Asian tyrannosaur. A related cladistic analysis found that Alioramus, not <b>Tyrannosaurus,</b> was the sister taxon of Tarbosaurus, which, if true, would suggest that Tarbosaurus and <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> should remain separate. The discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus would later disprove this and revealed that Alioramus belonged to the clade Alioramini. The discovery of the tyrannosaurid Lythronax further indicates that Tarbosaurus and <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> are closely related, forming a clade with fellow Asian tyrannosaurid Zhuchengtyrannus, with Lythronax being their sister taxon. A further study from 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al., also indicates <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> may have been an immigrant from Asia, as well as a possible descendent of Tarbosaurus. The study further indicates the possibility that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> may have driven other tyrannosaurids that were native to North America extinct through competition. Other finds in 2006 indicate giant tyrannosaurs may have been present in North America as early as 75 million years ago. Whether or not this specimen belongs to <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex, a new species of <b>Tyrannosaurus,</b> or a new genus entirely is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|A 2003 {{attempt by}} Christopher Brochu {{included}} Albertosaurus, Alectrosaurus, Alioramus, Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> in the definition. Holtz redefined the clade in 2004 {{to use all}} of the above as specifiers except for Alioramus and Alectrosaurus, which his analysis could not place with certainty. However, in the same paper, Holtz also provided a completely different definition, including all theropods more closely related to <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> than to Eotyrannus. The most recent definition is that of Sereno in 2005, which defined Tyrannosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Albertosaurus periculosus, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> luanchuanensis, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> turpanensis and Chingkankousaurus fragilis were {{considered}} synonyms of Tarbosaurus {{in the second}} edition of the Dinosauria, but Chingkankousaurus has been assessed as dubious by Brusatte et al. (2013).|$|E
5|$|Brown had {{collected}} seventy-seven osteoderms while excavating a <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> specimen in the Lance Formation of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in {{his description of}} Ankylosaurus, but thought they belonged to the <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when he described the <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> specimen as the now invalid genus Dynamosaurus in 1905. Later examination has shown them {{to be similar to}} those of Ankylosaurus, and that Brown had compared them with some Euoplocephalus osteoderms, which had been erroneously catalogued as belonging to Ankylosaurus at the AMNH.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, Jack Horner {{discovered}} five <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> skeletons near the Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana. One of the specimens {{was reported to be}} perhaps the largest <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> ever found.|$|E
5|$|More than 50specimens of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex {{have been}} identified, {{some of which}} are nearly {{complete}} skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in {{at least one of these}} specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology and potential speed of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to be a second <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> species while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has {{suggested}} that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> may have been pack animals. Currie compared <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex favorably to related species Tarbosaurus bataar and Albertosaurus sarcophagus, fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used {{to suggest that they}} lived in packs. Currie pointed out that a find in South Dakota preserved three <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex skeletons in close proximity to each other. After using CT scanning, Currie stated that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> would have been capable of such complex behavior, because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size. Currie elaborated that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> had a larger brain-to-body-size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops of the same size. Currie believed <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> to hunt in groups. Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together, with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill, by analogy to modern-day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill.|$|E
5|$|Teeth {{from what}} is now {{documented}} as a <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex were found in 1874 by Arthur Lakes near Golden, Colorado. In the early 1890s, John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming. The fossils {{were believed to be}} from a large species of Ornithomimus (O. grandis) but are now considered <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex remains. Vertebral fragments found by Edward Drinker Cope in western South Dakota in 1892 and assigned to Manospondylus gigas have also been recognized as belonging to <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate about}} whether <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> most scientists have speculated that it was a predator; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops {{were long}} {{thought to have}} {{possibly}} used their horns and frills in combat with predators such as <b>Tyrannosaurus,</b> the idea being discussed first by C. H. Sternberg in 1917 and 70 years later by Robert Bakker. There is evidence that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> did have aggressive head-on encounters with Triceratops, based on partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal; the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. Which animal was the aggressor is not known. Since the Triceratops wounds healed, it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that if <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> attacked a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> using its sharp horns. <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> is also known to have fed on Triceratops. Evidence for this includes a heavily tooth-scored Triceratops ilium and sacrum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tyrannosaurus</b> {{may have}} also {{inhabited}} Mexico's Lomas Coloradas formation in Sonora. Though skeletal evidence is lacking, six shed and broken teeth from the fossil bed have been thoroughly compared with other theropod genera and appear to be identical to those of <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> If true, the evidence indicates the range of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was possibly more extensive than previously believed. It is possible that tyrannosaurs were originally Asian species, migrating to North America {{before the end of}} the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|A 1965 {{paper by}} A.K. Rozhdestvensky {{recognized}} all of Maleev's specimens as different growth {{stages of the}} same species, which he believed to be distinct from the North American <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> He created a new combination, Tarbosaurus bataar, to include all the specimens described in 1955 as well as newer material. Later authors, including Maleev himself, agreed with Rozhdestvensky's analysis, although some used the name Tarbosaurus efremovi rather than T. bataar. American paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter re-examined the material in 1992. He concluded that it belonged to the genus <b>Tyrannosaurus,</b> as originally published by Maleev, and lumped all the specimens into the species <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> bataar except the remains that Maleev had named Gorgosaurus novojilovi. Carpenter thought this specimen represented a separate, smaller genus of tyrannosaurid, which he called Maleevosaurus novojilovi. George Olshevsky created the new generic name Jenghizkhan (after Genghis Khan) for <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> bataar in 1995, while also recognizing Tarbosaurus efremovi and Maleevosaurus novojilovi, {{for a total of}} three distinct, contemporaneous genera from the Nemegt Formation. A 1999 study subsequently reclassified Maleevosaurus as a juvenile Tarbosaurus. All research published since 1999 recognizes only a single species, which is either called Tarbosaurus bataar or <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> bataar.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown, {{assistant}} {{curator of}} the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial skeleton of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex in eastern Wyoming in 1900. H. F. Osborn originally named this skeleton Dynamosaurus imperiosus in a paper in 1905. Brown found another partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 1902. Osborn used this holotype to describe <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex in the same paper in which D. imperiosus was described. In 1906, Osborn recognized the two as synonyms, and acted as first revisor by selecting <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> as the valid name. The original Dynamosaurus material resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Maastrichtian, albertosaurines {{appear to have}} gone extinct, while the tyrannosaurine <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> roamed from Saskatchewan to Texas. This pattern is {{mirrored}} in other North American dinosaur taxa. During the Campanian and early Maastrichtian, lambeosaurine hadrosaurs and centrosaurine ceratopsians are common in the northwest, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were more common to the south. By {{the end of the}} Cretaceous, centrosaurines are unknown and lambeosaurines are rare, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were common throughout the Western Interior. A study published in the journal Scientific Reports on February 2, 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al. indicates that during the later Maastrichtian, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> itself might have been partially responsible for the extinction of the other tyrannosaurids in most of western North America. The study indicates that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> might have been an immigrant from Asia as opposed to having evolved in North America (possibly a descendent of the closely related Tarbosaurus) that supplanted and outcompeted other tyrannosaurids. This theory is further supported by the fact that few to no other types of tyrannosaurid are found within <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> known range.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{belongs in}} the {{subfamily}} Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae, along with Tarbosaurus, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> and Alioramus. Animals in this subfamily are {{more closely related to}} <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> than to Albertosaurus and are known– with the exception of Alioramus– for their robust build with proportionally larger skulls and longer femora than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|In another study, Gregory S. Paul {{pointed out}} that the flexed kneed and digitigrade adult <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> were much better adapted for running than {{elephants}} or humans, pointing out that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> had a large ilium bone and cnemial crest that would have supported large muscles needed for running. He also mentioned that Alexander's (1989) formula to calculate speed by bone strength was only partly reliable. He suggests that the formula is overly sensitive to bone length; making long bones artificially weak. He also {{pointed out that}} the lowered risk of being wounded in combat may have been worth the risk of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> falling while running.|$|E
5|$|In his 1905 paper naming Albertosaurus, Osborn {{described}} {{two additional}} tyrannosaur specimens {{that had been}} collected from in Montana and Wyoming during a 1902 expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led by Barnum Brown. Initially, Osborn considered these to be distinct species. The first, he named Dynamosaurus imperiosus ("emperor power lizard"), and the second, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex ("king tyrant lizard"). A year later, Osborn recognized that these two specimens actually {{came from the same}} species. Despite the fact that Dynamosaurus had been found first, the name <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> had appeared one page earlier in his original article describing both specimens. Therefore, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the name <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was used.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops {{that seemed to have}} survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus is {{classified}} as a theropod in the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. Other members include <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> and the earlier Daspletosaurus, both from North America, and possibly the Mongolian genus Alioramus. Animals in this subfamily are {{more closely related to}} <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> than to Albertosaurus and are known for their robust build with proportionally larger skulls and longer femurs than in the other subfamily, the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate about}} whether <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus’ close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus’ teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> most scientists have agreed that it was a predator, although like modern large predators it would have been happy to scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Lythronax argestes, a much earlier tyrannosaurine further reveals the {{close relationship between}} <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> and Tarbosaurus, and {{it was discovered that}} Lythronax is a sister taxon to a clade consisting of Campanian genus Zhuchengtyrannus, and Maastrichtian genera <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> and Tarbosaurus. Further studies of Lythronax also suggest that the Asian tyrannosauroids were part of one evolutionary radiation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tyrannosaurus</b> {{may have}} had {{infectious}} saliva used to kill its prey. This theory was first proposed by William Abler. Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration; the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> a deadly, infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have. Jack Horner regards <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor's teeth, which are rounded. All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria, so the prospect of it {{being used as a}} method of predation is disputable.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of phylogenetic {{taxonomy}} in vertebrate paleontology, Tyrannosauridae has been given several explicit definitions. The original was produced by Paul Sereno in 1998, and included all tyrannosauroids closer to <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> than to either Alectrosaurus, Aublysodon or Nanotyrannus. However, Nanotyrannus is often {{considered to be a}} juvenile <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex, while Aublysodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium unsuitable for use in the definition of a clade. Definitions since then have been based on more well-established genera.|$|E
5|$|A {{skeleton}} of the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens {{has been described}} from Montana with healed tyrannosaur-inflicted damage on its tail vertebrae. The fact that the damage seems to have healed suggests that the Edmontosaurus survived a tyrannosaur's attack on a living target, i.e. the tyrannosaur had attempted active predation. There is also evidence for an aggressive interaction between a Triceratops and a <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> {{in the form of}} partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal (a bone of the neck frill); the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. It is not known what the exact nature of the interaction was, though: either animal could have been the aggressor. Since the Triceratops wounds healed, it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> using its sharp horns.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> They studied some <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>Tyrannosaurus,</b> nicknamed Stan, {{in honor}} of amateur {{paleontologist}} Stan Sacrison, {{was found in the}} Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota, in the spring of 1987. It was not collected until 1992, as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton. Stan is 63% complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996. This tyrannosaur, too, was found to have many bone pathologies, including broken and healed ribs, a broken (and healed) neck and a spectacular hole in the back of its head, {{about the size of a}} <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> tooth.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study in}} July 2017 by Miriam Hirt et al., {{published}} in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the top speed of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was around 17mph (27km/h). Other dinosaurs including Triceratops, Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus were also analyzed in the study, as were many living animals like elephants, cheetahs and rabbits. The speed of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was calculated by factoring its weight in conjunction with the medium upon which it travelled (in the case of the theropod, land) and by the assumptions that: one; animals reach their maximum speeds during comparatively short sprints, and two; Newton's laws of motion dictate that mass has to overcome inertia. It found that large animals like <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> exhaust their energy reserves long before they reach their theoretical top speed, resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and speed. The equation can calculate the top speed of an animal with almost 90% accuracy and can be applied to both living and extinct animals.|$|E
5|$|As {{the archetypal}} theropod, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> {{is one of}} the best-known dinosaurs since the 20th century, and has been {{featured}} in film, advertising, and postal stamps, as well as many other types of media.|$|E
5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E
5|$|Henry Fairfield Osborn – {{paleontologist}} and geologist, Osborn {{joined the}} US Geological Survey in 1890, {{and on one}} fossil-hunting trip to the West met Cope. He described numerous well-known dinosaur genera, including Ornitholestes, <b>Tyrannosaurus,</b> and Velociraptor.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford, Illinois. Dubbed Jane, the find was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed {{that it is more}} likely a juvenile <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of her age. Jane is currently on exhibit at the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of <b>Tyrannosaurus.</b> The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} for sexual dimorphism has been weakened. A 2005 {{study reported that}} previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting doubt {{on the existence of}} similar dimorphism between <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex sexes. A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E
