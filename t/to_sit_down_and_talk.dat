500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E

2500|$|One of Bob Log III's more {{controversial}} antics is 'Boob Scotch', that is, scotch {{which has been}} stirred by a female (or male) breast.

2500|$|Dish has {{reportedly}} {{been criticized for}} treating analysts and major shareholders poorly. Craig Moffett, senior analyst of U.S. telecommunications, U.S. cable, and satellite broadcasting at Sanford C. Bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how Dish does business. Ergen told him, “We’re too busy creating value around here <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> about it. Thanks but no thanks.” Chris Marangi, a money manager for Gamco Investors, which held about 4 millions shares in Dish, said {{that the company is}} very uncooperative. He says that despite traveling to Denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with Ergen or any other Dish senior manager. “They’re probably the least transparent company of any I’ve ever dealt with." [...] Dish sends out press releases on its earnings deliberately late enough to be of little or no use to analysts and investors whom are then forced to sort through complicated filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.|$|E

60|$|My ever dear Friend,--To {{have three}} letters from you all {{unanswered}} seems really to discredit me to myself, while it gives such proof of your kindness and affection. No other excuse {{is to be}} offered but the sort of interruption which sadness gives. I really had not the heart <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> of my 'Aurora,' even {{in reference to the}} pleasure and honour brought to me by the expression of your opinion, when the beloved friend associated with the poor book was lost to me in this world, gone where perhaps he no longer sympathises with pleasure or honour of mine, now--for nearly the first time. Perhaps. After such separations the sense of distance is the thing felt first. And certainly my book at least is naturally saddened to me, and the success of it wholesomely spoiled.|$|E

Perhaps neither of them was [...] bubbling over with things to say; perhaps it was becoming yearly [...] less attractive {{to pick up a}} pen and write, and then, of course, [...] there was always the discouragement of distance. Once Howells [...] wrote: [...] "I know this will find you in Austria before I can well turn [...] round, but I must make believe you are in Kennebunkport before I can [...] begin it." [...] And in another letter: [...] "It ought to be as pleasant to [...] sit down and write to you as <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to you, but it [...] isn't..... The only reason why I write is that I want another [...] letter from you, and because I have a whole afternoon for the job. [...] I have the whole of every afternoon, for I cannot work later than [...] lunch. I am fagged by that time, and Sunday is the only day that [...] brings unbearable leisure. I hope you will be in New York another [...] winter; then I shall {{know what to do with}} these foretastes of [...] eternity." ...|$|E

In order to do so, Medem edits the interviews giving a sense of dialogue between parties that refused <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk.</b> Due to its lack of contextualization, the film may be hard to understand to audiences without previous knowledge of the Basque problem - it is obviously a film designed to be viewed by Spanish audiences, or people familiar with the issues.|$|E
