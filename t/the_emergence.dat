50|$|Although Nothia aphylla was leafless, its aerial stems {{were covered}} with 'emergences': bumps on the stems which were oval, around 0.3 mm high and 0.7 to 1.2 mm long by up to 0.5 mm wide. <b>The</b> <b>emergences</b> were formed by {{existing}} cells expanding, not by extra cells being produced as in other Early Devonian zosterophylls and trimerophytes. Each emergence had a single stoma. The density of <b>the</b> <b>emergences</b> varied so that in regions which had them there were between 3 and 5 or more stomata per mm2. The sporangia did not have emergences, although {{there were a few}} stomata.|$|R

5|$|The Diet was {{initially}} dominated by Polish nobles, but in time, it saw <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> {{of a strong}} peasant faction.

Overall, the Diet preserved the Polish parliamentary tradition during a time in which it waned in the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition, and saw <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> of the major political parties and groupings that were to dominate the political life of the Second Polish Republic after World War I. The leader of the Polish peasant movement in the Second Polish Republic, Wincenty Witos, gained his experience in the Diet, elected {{for the first time in}} 1908. Similarly, the National Democrats, and the Polish socialists, had their political blocs in the diet around that time.|$|E
