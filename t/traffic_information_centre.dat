If the caller cannot identify his or her location, the emergency centres currently receive an approximate location of the cellular phone based on the closest tower. Because the accuracy of the location information depends on the density of towers, the location information ranges from tens of metres in urban areas to kilometres in sparsely populated rural areas.|$|E

The use of intelligent techniques {{in the context of a}} MOTIC is related to three main issues: (1) the integration of data and information of different transport modes coming from different sources in the transport network, (2) the provision of added-value information services for travellers, to be operated and offered to the users by the relevant service operators and (3) the provision of a strategic traffic management “shell ” for traffic managers and planners, including tools for scenario simulation and analysis, strategy planning and dissemination to local information/control centres and operators...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Road safety {{has become}} a main issue for gov-ernments and car {{manufacturers}} in the last twenty years. The development of new vehicular technologies has favoured companies, researchers and institutions to focus their efforts on improving road safety. During the last decades, the evolution of wireless technologies has allowed researchers to design commu-nication systems where vehicles participate in the communication networks. Thus, new types of networks, such as Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), have been created to facilitate communication between vehicles themselves and between vehicles and infrastructure. New concepts where vehicular networks {{play an important role}} have appeared the last years, such as smart cities and living labs [1]. Smart cities include intelligent traffic management in which data from the TIC (<b>Traffic</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre)</b> infrastructures could be reachable at any point. To test the possibilities of these future cities, living labs (cities in which new designed systems can be tested in real conditions) have been created all over Europe. The goal of our framework is to transmit information about the traffic conditions to help the driver (or the vehicle itself) take adequate decisions. In this work, the development of a warning system composed of Intelligent Traffic Lights (ITLs) that provides information to drivers about traffic density and weather conditions in the streets of a city is proposed and evaluated through simulations...|$|E

In the present research, a systematic framework based on traffic assignment models is proposed to analyze the value of <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> in implementing route diversion strategies for on-line traffic management purposes, especially under the impacts of traffic incidents.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} both radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and {{variable}} message sign information on route choice behaviour. The empirical analysis {{is based on an}} extensive survey held among road users in the Amsterdam corridor in July 1994. The data is stemming from the EC DRIVE II project BATT. To analyse the factors that influence route choice behaviour, several types of discrete choice models (ordered probit, multiple logit and bivariate ordered probit) have been estimated. Bivariate models are needed to model the (endogenous) dependency of the use of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information. The results confirm earlier findings that women {{are less likely to be}} influenced by <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> New is the finding that commuters are less likely to be influenced, and that the level of satisfaction with alternative routes is strongly related to the type and distance of the alternative road. The analysis also reveals that the impacts of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information on route choice behaviour are very similar, and that route choice adaptations based on radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> are positively related to route choice adaptations based on variable message sign information. An interesting issue is the willingness-to-pay for having in-vehicle dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> As expected, the willingness-to-pay is relatively large for male drivers on business trips. Another important new finding is that the results suggest that there is a positive correlation between the use of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information. ...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{demand in}} {{emergency}} evacuation is usually {{too large to}} be effectively managed with reactive <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> control methods. These methods adapt to the road traffic passively by publishing real-time information without consideration of the routing behavior feedback produced by evacuees. Other remedy measures {{have to be prepared}} in case of nonrecurring congestion under these methods. To use the network capacity fully to mitigate near-future evacuation traffic congestion, we propose proactive <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> control (PTIC) model. Based on the mechanism between information and routing behavior feedback, this model can change the route choice of evacuees in advance by dissipating strategic <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> Generally, the near-future traffic condition is difficult to accurately predict because it is uncertain in evacuation.
