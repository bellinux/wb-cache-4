5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Orange Bowl had {{the fourth}} and sixth {{selections}} from eligible Bowl Alliance teams. The Sugar Bowl had the top two picks, while the Fiesta Bowl, which had the top picks in 1995, received the third and fifth picks. Due to Bowl Alliance restrictions, the Orange Bowl {{at the end of}} the 1996 season had to be played on December 31, marking the first time in the history of the Orange Bowl that the game was not played in January and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> Orange Bowls in the same year—one {{at the end of the}} 1995 season, and the other at the conclusion of the 1996 season. The only other time was in 2014, the first year of the college football playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1944 the Royal Navy sent a {{flotilla}} into the Adriatic, both to secure the area and to attack German coastal shipping. The coastal shipping became increasingly significant for the German forces deployed in the Independent State of Croatia, and especially Dalmatia—as road and rail routes became unsafe for use because of activity of the Yugoslav Partisans. To deny that option, the Royal Navy initiated Operation Exterminate, primarily aimed at destruction of German corvettes. On 26 October, the Yugoslav Partisans informed Lieutenant Commander Morgan Morgan-Giles, commander of the coastal forces in the north Adriatic, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> German destroyers in a cove on the south coast of the Rab Island.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> billion cases of gastroenteritis {{that resulted in}} 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children {{and those in the}} developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8g/cm3, {{and concluded that the}} two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe) and pelopium (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium, and dianium were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within a tin case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only {{a day on the}} market, Warner Bros. announced <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> errors discovered within the set. The first was that the 2.0 audio track on Superman, was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Buddhist temples, {{including}} Borobudur, at {{that time}} was possible because Sanjaya's immediate successor, Rakai Panangkaran, granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples. In fact, to show his respect, Panangkaran gave the village of Kalasan to the Buddhist community, as is written in the Kalasan Charter dated 778 CE. This has led some archaeologists to believe that there was never serious conflict concerning religion in Java as it was possible for a Hindu king to patronize the establishment of a Buddhist monument; or for a Buddhist king to act likewise. However, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> rival royal dynasties in Java at the time—the Buddhist Sailendra and the Saivite Sanjaya—in which the latter triumphed over their rival in the 856 battle on the Ratubaka plateau. Similar confusion also exists regarding the Lara Jonggrang temple at the Prambanan complex, which was believed to have been erected by the victor Rakai Pikatan as the Sanjaya dynasty's reply to Borobudur, but others suggest that there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where Sailendra involvement exists in Lara Jonggrang.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Megh {{continued}} to rapidly intensify while approaching {{the island of}} Socotra. It developed a small eye just 7.4km (4.6mi) in diameter by early on November8, along with a convective core just 280km (175mi) in diameter. At 03:00UTC that day, the IMD upgraded the system to an extremely severe cyclonic storm, and three hours later estimated peak 3minute winds of 175km/h (110mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). Since accurate record keeping began in the basin in 1990, this {{marked the first time}} in the Arabian Sea <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> cyclones in one season with 1minute winds of at least 185km/h (115km/h). Between 06:0012:00UTC on November8, the eye of Megh crossed the northern coast of Socotra, with the resulting land interaction causing the eyewall to disappear and for the winds to diminish. After exiting the island, the cyclone began weakening further due to cooler water temperatures and drier air from the Arabian Peninsula to the northwest. Early on November9, the center of Megh passed 57km (36mi) north of Cape Guardafui, and further land interaction with Somalia to the south increasingly degraded the storm's structure. At 00:00UTC that day, Megh weakened into a very severe cyclonic storm.|$|E
5|$|Only {{microscopic}} {{quantities of}} plutonium were available until the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works came online on 4 November 1943, {{but there were}} already some worrying signs. When plutonium fluoride was produced at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it was sometimes light colored, and sometimes dark, although the chemical process was the same. When they managed to reduce it to plutonium metal in November 1943, the density was measured at 15g/cm3, and a measurement using X-ray scattering techniques pointed to a density of 13g/cm3. This was bad; it had been assumed that its density {{was the same as}} uranium, about 19g/cm3. If these figures were correct, far more plutonium would be needed for a bomb. Kennedy disliked Seaborg's ambitious and attention-seeking manner, and with Arthur Wahl had devised a procedure for plutonium purification independent of Seaborg's group. When they got hold of a sample in February, this procedure was tested. That month the Metallurgical Laboratory announced that it had determined <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> different fluorides: the light colored plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4) and the dark plutonium trifluoride (PuF3). The chemists soon discovered how to make them selectively, and the former turned out to be easier to reduce to metal. Measurements in March 1944 indicated a density of between 19 and 20g/cm3.|$|E

5|$|Season five {{features}} Monica and Chandler {{trying to}} keep their new relationship a secret from their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show's 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy, Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls: Leslie and Chandler. (They had originally thought <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> boys and one girl, but decided to keep the name Chandler, despite the baby turning out a girl.) Emily states that the only condition in which she would remain married to Ross is if he stops all communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but during a last dinner with all six main characters together, Emily phones Ross and, upon discovering Rachel is there, realizes she does not trust him, which ends the marriage. Phoebe begins {{a relationship with a}} police officer, Gary (Michael Rapaport), after finding his badge and using it as her own. Monica and Chandler go public with their relationship, to the surprise and happiness of their friends. They decide to get married on a trip to Las Vegas, but change their plans after witnessing Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumble out of the wedding chapel.|$|E
5|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{lies between}} the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula, both mostly desert regions {{with very few}} {{permanent}} settlements. The seismologists who work with historical events gather macroseismic data from written records from cities {{that may not have}} been anywhere near the epicentral area. This can result in the mislocation of events when significant damage was reported in a particular location which were not actually where the earthquake occurred. The records of these events have been influenced by the distribution of the population (where the people were) and this has caused difficulty in creating a complete and accurate index of historical events. Several studies in the 80s and 90s indicate <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> or possibly three large earthquakes in the region in the last 2000 years with magnitudes estimated to be 6.5–7.0 based on macroseismic data.|$|E
5|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} {{was first}} {{described by the}} American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time it was thought <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the New Guinea crocodile native to Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea, and C. n. mindorensis, the Philippine crocodile, native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that the Philippine crocodile is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that the Philippine crocodile is, in part, paraphyletic {{with regard to the}} New Guinea crocodile, and that the latter may constitutes a population within the Philippine crocodile. Among their two samples for the New Guinea crocodile, one was part of the Philippine crocodile clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6–6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (could potentially be misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution.|$|E

5|$|The {{quarries}} at Stonesfield, {{which were}} worked until 1911, continued to produce Megalosaurus bucklandii fossils, mostly single bones from the pelvis and hindlimbs. Vertebrae and skull bones are rare. In 2010, Roger Benson counted {{a total of}} 103 specimens from the Stonesfield Slate, from a minimum of seven individuals. It has been contentious whether this material represents just a single taxon. In 2004, Julia Day and Paul Barrett claimed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> morphotypes present, based on small differences in the thighbones. In 2008 Benson favoured this idea, but in 2010 concluded the differences were illusory. A maxilla fragment, specimen OUM J13506, was, in 1869 assigned, by Thomas Huxley, to M. bucklandii. In 1992 Robert Thomas Bakker claimed it represented {{a member of the}} Sinraptoridae; in 2007, Darren Naish thought it was a separate species belonging to the Abelisauroidea. In 2010, Benson pointed out that the fragment was basically indistinguishable from other known M. bucklandii maxillae, to which it had in fact not been compared by the other authors.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was still chaotic when King HenryIII became king after his father's death in 1216. Although Bolsover fell to Ferrers' forces in 1217 after a siege, {{there is no}} indication that Peveril was assaulted, and it is likely that Brian de Lisle negotiated his surrender. Ferrers only had possession of the lordship until King HenryIII came of age. When the time came he was reluctant to hand over the property, and after an initial deadlock the Crown took control in 1223. Although contemporary Pipe Roll records of expenditure at Peveril survive, they do not specify how the money was spent. As a result, it is unclear what constitutes maintenance and what marks substantial construction work; however, Richard Eales, who wrote the 2006 English Heritage guidebook, suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> periods of building, when sums spent were larger than usual: £54 in 1204–1207 and £67 in 1210–1212. The medieval historian Sidney Painter estimated that in about 1200 there were only seven magnates in England whose annual income exceeded £400 and a knight could easily live on £10 to £20 per year.|$|E
5|$|Emraan Hashmi, who {{appeared}} in the original film, was initially chosen to play the lead role. However, Luthria was looking for an older actor and chose Kumar {{for the role of}} Shoaib Khan (based on Dawood Ibrahim). In February 2012 it was announced <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> male leads in the film, the second said to be Shahid Kapoor, but the following month Imran Khan was confirmed as the second male lead. Many actresses were considered for the female lead, including Illeana D'Cruz, Kareena Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Asin Thottumkal, Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, but in April it was reported that Sonakshi Sinha had been cast. Sonali Bendre was also signed as a lead character in the film. The film marked Bendre's first role since Shankar Dada MBBS. Bendre did not charge her fees for the film owing to the fact that Sobha Kapoor, one of the producers of the film has been the friend of her Mother-in-law for the past 40 years also out of gratitude for Luthria, who shot her first song Sambhala hai Maine in the 1994 film Naaraaz. In November 2012, it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on Eid 2013. TV actor Chetan Hansraj was signed as an antagonist in the film. Kumar revealed during the trailer launch of the film about having no aspirations to set new benchmarks on a role previously enacted by Hashmi. Khan in preparation {{for his role in the}} film drew inspiration from Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor, copying their mannerisms, behaviour and dressing style by watching DVD's of films starring them produced in the 1980s. Back in those days copying mannerism of film stars drew appreciation from peers.|$|E
