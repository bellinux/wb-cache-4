40|$|The Weibull {{strength}} distributions and fracture {{characteristics of}} three abrasive grains, brown corundum, white corundum and green silicon carbide, are investigated. The {{effects of the}} surface defects from crushing and the inherent microcracks from processing prior <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> on fracture strengths and characteristics of the abrasive grains are discussed together with SEM observations. A novel proof-testing {{has been carried out}} in terms of low energy ball milling so that survived abrasive grains have improved strength characteristics. Strength distributions before and after the proof-testing have been compared. It is concluded that the strength of larger grains is strongly influenced by surface defects due <b>to</b> <b>crushing,</b> and the strength of smaller grains is more relevant to the inherent processing microcracks and pores formed during the manufacturing process prior <b>to</b> <b>crushing.</b> The influence of processing conditions, such as fusing and sintering, on strength distributions of the brown corundum is also discussed...|$|R
5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that {{is neither a}} planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the {{neighborhood}} of other material around its orbit.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{consolidating}} Stalin's {{control over}} the Eastern Bloc, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), led by Lavrentiy Beriya, supervised the establishment of Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc that were supposed <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> anti-communist resistance. When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.|$|E
5|$|Daurises, {{who seems}} to have had the largest army, {{initially}} took his army to the Hellespont. There, he systematically besieged and took the cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus and Paesus, each in a single day according to Herodotus. However, when he heard that the Carians were revolting, he moved his army southwards to attempt <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> this new rebellion. This places the timing of the Carian revolt to early 497 BC.|$|E

5|$|Dsungaripterids are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} being specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> the shells of molluscs and crustaceans. While this remains the dominant view of dsungaripterid paleobiology today, {{some have suggested that}} they were generalistic omnivores eating a variety of hard foods, as dsungaripterids are better adapted to terrestrial movement rather than wading and are found in inland deposits.|$|E
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} was {{a common}} method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used <b>to</b> <b>crush,</b> dismember, or torture captives in public executions. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power {{and his ability to}} control wild animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} Macrinus dispatched his Praetorian prefect Ulpius Julianus to {{the region}} with a contingent of troops he considered strong enough <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> the rebellion. However, this force soon joined the faction of Elagabalus when, during the battle, they turned on their own commanders. The officers were killed and Julianus' head {{was sent back to}} the emperor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{pieces of}} knowledge obtained at chips briquetting at metal cutting. For briquetting the functional {{model of the}} briquetting press of our own construction was used. Experiments were carried out using eight chips types obtained at three different cutting methods and five different nonferrous metal alloys. By {{the evaluation of the}} measured values the relations between the briquettes volume density and the briquetting pressure and between the force needed for the briquette destruction and the briquetting pressure were obtained. It was proved that the briquettes volume density depends very much on the material which the briquettes are made from. Next influences (cutting method, chips size) are less meaningful. From {{the point of view of}} the relation between the destruction force and the briquetting pressure it was found that the resistance <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> of briquettes made from copper alloys was minimal, the resistance <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> of briquettes made from aluminium alloys was major and the resistance <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> of briquettes made from zinc alloys was the highest...|$|R

5|$|The {{fighting}} in southeastern Laos was unlike any yet {{seen in the}} Vietnam War, since the PAVN abandoned its old hit-and-run tactics and launched a conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> ARVN positions on the flanks of the main advance. Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made tactical air support and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} match featured Shawn Michaels {{defending his}} WWF Intercontinental Championship against Crush. Crush controlled the early {{portion of the}} match by performing several dropkicks on Michaels, which he followed with a military press slam and a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker. Michaels left the ring to recover and returned <b>to</b> attack <b>Crush's</b> head. Michaels was unable <b>to</b> pin <b>Crush,</b> however, and Crush threw Michaels out of the ring. Two wrestlers dressed as Doink the Clown, with whom Crush had been feuding, came to the ring <b>to</b> distract <b>Crush.</b> Michaels performed a superkick, his signature move, and pinned <b>Crush</b> <b>to</b> retain the championship.|$|R

5|$|Unknown to the Soviet forces, the German 6th Army, {{under the}} newly {{appointed}} General Paulus, was issued orders for Operation Fredericus on 30 April 1942. This operation was <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> the Soviet armies within the Izium salient south of Kharkov, created during the Soviet spring offensives in March and April. The final directive for this offensive, issued on 30 April, gave a start date of 18 May.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements {{from the}} colonial headquarters at Batavia, the Dutch launched an attack in 1635 {{and were able}} <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> opposition and bring the area around present-day Tainan fully under their control. After seeing Mattau and Soulang, the most powerful villages in the area, defeated so comprehensively, many other villages in the surrounding area came to the Dutch to seek peace and surrender sovereignty. Thus the Dutch were able to dramatically expand {{the extent of their}} territorial control in a short time, and avoid the need for further fighting. The campaign ended in February 1636, when representatives from twenty-eight villages attended a ceremony in Tayouan to cement Dutch sovereignty.|$|E

5|$|After the Spartan threat {{had been}} removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> the revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, {{who lost their}} properties. The {{residents}} of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446â445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt {{to win over the}} other state's allies.|$|E
