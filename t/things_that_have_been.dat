25|$|We do not {{perceive}} by an immediate intuition that God exists, {{nor do we}} prove it a priori. But we do prove it a posteriori, i.e., from the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from {{the production of the}} things in this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a separated intellect which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise, Ford's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by an aversion to doing <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done before. This is perhaps most notable in his two Star Trek novels, The Final Reflection (1984) and How Much for Just the Planet? (1987). The Final Reflection {{is the story of}} a small group of Klingons who prevent a war between the Klingon Empire and the Federation while the regular series characters are relegated to cameo appearances. (This novel introduced the fictional language Klingonaase.) In the comedic How Much for Just the Planet?, the Enterprise crew compete with a Klingon crew for control of a planet, whose colonists are not happy with this and defend their peace in inventive ways, which soon make everything a farce, including a Vaudevillian pie fight. The book includes song lyrics that satirize many 20th century stage musicals. Both novels present the Klingons in a more positive light, not just as the token evil menace of the week.|$|E

500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio was {{the first}} actor to be cast in the film. Nolan {{had been trying to}} work with the actor for years and met him several times, but was unable to {{convince}} him to appear in any of his films until Inception. DiCaprio finally agreed because he was [...] "intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character's going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life." [...] He read the script and found it to be [...] "very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate some of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> swirling around his head for the last eight years." [...] DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay. Nolan took a long time re-writing the script in order [...] "to make sure that the emotional journey of his character was the driving force of the movie." [...] On February 11, 2009, it was announced that Warner Bros. purchased Inception, a spec script written by Nolan.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for IGN, Matt Fowler wrote, [...] "With Jon's final choice in [...] "Oathbreaker," [...] the show {{seemed to make}} a huge step forward into the endgame. One where we might see <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> set up {{for a long time}} start to pay off. Not everyone's story is firing on all {{cylinders}} at the moment, Tyrion was actively bored while waiting for news this week, but enough {{is going on in the}} North and at King's Landing to carry the series right now." [...] Likewise, Todd VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, [...] ""Oathbreaker" [...] is a crisp, lean, nicely paced episode of Game of Thrones. It's one of those episodes where the characters are mostly being positioned for future episodes, but it's a solidly executed version of that basic template." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of the Washington Post wrote that she believed this was [...] "The strongest episode of the sixth season of Game of Thrones to date." [...] While Erik Kain of Forbes noted [...] "The season has been full of revelations, but things are still building. That's okay. I love the tension and not knowing exactly what's coming." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lacrymosa" [...] {{incorporates}} the Lacrimosa sequence from Mozart's Requiem (1791). It additionally includes a 22-piece orchestra led by Dave Campbell and background vocals by The Millennium Choir. Inspired {{by the film}} Amadeus, the song contains electronic backing beats, symphonic string section, heavy guitar and a haunting choir. Its vocals make a contrasting representation of light and dark. Jim Farber of Daily News compared the song with the works of English progressive rock band Renaissance. [...] "Like You" [...] is written in memory of Lee's deceased sister, as was [...] "Hello" [...] on Fallen. Concerning this, the singer said, [...] "I can't help but be affected by that, and if it's my place to express myself and all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> most deep and the most painful and have just touched me, I feel like it does honor her". One of the most personal songs on the album, [...] "Like You", contains lyrics which yearn for death so Lee can be with her sister. which are accompanied by heavy riffing guitars. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield found similarities between the track and American rock band My Chemical Romance's song [...] "Helena" [...] (2005); other critics compared the song with Evanescence's earlier material on Fallen. [...] "Lose Control" [...] was inspired by Balsamo's loud guitar and contains influences from Portishead. The protagonist shows her anger through the lines, [...] "You don't remember my name, I don't really care". According to Lee, the song is about wanting to be less apprehensive and looser.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his defeat, Wallace adopted a hard-line segregationist stance and used this stand to court the white vote in the next gubernatorial {{election}} in 1962. When a supporter asked why he started using racist messages, Wallace replied, [...] "You know, I tried to talk about good roads and good schools and all these <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> part of my career, and nobody listened. And then I began talking about niggers, and they stomped the floor." ...|$|E

Football in this country is honest."..."I would love it if we beat them , love it. The battle is still on, they have not won it yet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} {{that the existence of}} God can be known to all, even prior to exposure to any divine revelation, predates Christianity. St. Paul made this argument when he said that pagans were without excuse because [...] "since the creation of the world [...] invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made". In this Paul alludes to the proofs for a creator, later enunciated by St. Thomas and others, but that had also been explored by the Greek philosophers.|$|E

2500|$|Contemporary {{reviews of}} the work were not universally positive. [...] Writing in the American New Republic magazine, George Soule {{expressed}} his disappointment in the book, writing that it [...] "puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory {{turned out to be}} a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> said better directly." [...] Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations, and said, [...] "It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well".|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Paul Wild {{took over}} from E.G. 'Taffy' Bowen {{as chief of}} CSIRO's Division of Radiophysics. For someone who joined a {{particular}} research team {{so that he could}} [...] "do his own thing", it may be surprising that he agreed to be appointed to this role. He explained his motivation: Well all my life, scientific life, people have given me lots of resources and lots of opportunities and I think it's a matter of duty; when the finger is pointed to you it's your duty to pay back some of those wonderful <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> given. That's how I became an administrator. [...] when I was Chief of Division I was not merely an administrator, because I also led a research group on the Interscan landing system.|$|E
2500|$|A {{shooting}} {{incident in}} the lobby of FRC headquarters in 2012 (see below) prompted further comments on the SPLC's 'hate group' [...] listing. Dana Milbank, columnist for the Washington Post, referred to the incident as [...] "a madman's act" [...] for which the SPLC should not be blamed, but called its classification of [...] FRC as a hate group [...] "reckless" [...] and said that [...] "it's absurd to put the group, as the law center does, in the same category as Aryan Nations, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Stormfront and the Westboro Baptist Church." [...] Tufts University political science professor Jeffrey Berry described himself as [...] "not comfortable" [...] with the designation: [...] "There's probably some <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> said by one or two individuals that qualify as hate speech. But overall, it's not seen as a hate group." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1970, {{according}} to Barry, [...] "Robin rang me in Spain where I was on holiday [...] 'let's do it again'". By 21 August 1970, after they had reunited, Barry announced that the Bee Gees [...] "are there and they will never, ever part again". Maurice said, [...] "We just discussed it and re-formed. We want to apologise publicly to Robin for the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> said." [...] Earlier in June 1970, Robin and Maurice recorded a dozen songs before Barry joined and included two songs that were on their reunion album. Around the same time, Barry and Robin were about to publish the book, On the Other Hand. They also recruited Geoff Bridgford as the group's official drummer; Bridgford had previously worked with the Groove and Tin Tin, and played drums on Maurice's unreleased first solo album.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Day of the Doctor" [...] {{was written}} by Steven Moffat, current head writer of Doctor Who, and {{produced}} by Marcus Wilson with Nick Hurran directing. Moffat was developing ideas for the 50th anniversary episode as early as late 2011, when he stated that the team [...] "knew what [...] want to do" [...] and were [...] "revving up" [...] for the episode in an interview discussing {{his work on the}} 2011 film The Adventures of Tintin, and began writing the script for [...] "The Day of the Doctor" [...] in late 2012, announcing that, as a security precaution, he had not produced any copies, instead keeping it on his computer [...] "under lock and key" [...] until it was needed. Moffat stated prior to the episode's release, [...] "Most <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> said about the 50th are not true... Normally I am responsible for the disinformation and the rubbish rumors—I usually put them out myself, but I haven't needed to for this one." [...] On the importance of the episode, Moffat has stated that it will [...] "change the narrative" [...] of Doctor Who.|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
