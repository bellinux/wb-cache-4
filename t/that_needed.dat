5|$|Bristol Bridge, {{the only}} way of {{crossing}} the river without using a ferry, was rebuilt between 1764 and 1768. The earlier medieval bridge was too narrow and congested to cope with the amount of traffic <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> to use it. A toll was charged to pay for the works, and when, in 1793, the toll was extended for a further period of time the Bristol Bridge Riot ensued. Eleven people were killed and 45 injured, {{making it one of the}} worst riots of the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the success, the Massachusetts {{provisional}} government agreed to organize an expedition on a larger scale against Quebec, the capital of New France, and gave its command to Phips. Originally intending to coordinate with a simultaneous overland attack on Montreal launched from Albany, New York, the expedition's departure was delayed in the vain hope <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> munitions would arrive from England. The expedition, counting 34 ships and more than 2,000 soldiers, finally sailed on August 20.

Eventually, signs that used to warn people not {{to stay on the}} islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there. A resettlement community was constructed months later, with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> to be moved from the area. Those that were not moved were left on Isle Verde despite orders not to stay there. Another resettlement project for 700families was planned at the cost of $1million.|$|E

At the Yankees' request, Jeter embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness.

5|$|NFL postseason {{history can}} be traced to the first NFL Championship Game in 1933, though in the early years, {{qualification}} for the game was based solely on regular season records. From 1933 to 1966, the NFL postseason generally only consisted of the NFL Championship Game, pitting the league's two division winners (pending any one-game playoff matches <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> to be held to break ties in the division standings). The NFL playoffs then expanded in 1967, when four teams qualified for the tournament. When the league merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970, the playoffs expanded to eight teams. The playoffs were expanded to 10 teams in 1978 and 12 teams since 1990.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels.

In the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries.

5|$|The {{budget of}} about £1million per episode (totalling US$9.6million) allowed 20 {{shooting}} weeks of {{five days to}} film six 55-minute episodes.

Two weeks before filming began, about 70 of {{the cast and crew}} gathered for the script read-through, followed by rehearsals, lessons for dancing, horse-riding, fencing, and other skills <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> to be ready ahead of the actual filming. Filming took place between June 1994 and 1 November 1994 to reflect the changing seasons in the plot, followed by post-production until mid-May 1995.

In the closing minutes of the first half, Jensen made two crucial saves: he blocked David Fairclough, who had made a run towards goal, and he tipped a header by Alan Hansen over the crossbar.
