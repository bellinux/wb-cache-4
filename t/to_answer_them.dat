The answers are written down, then the person signs and dates his interrogation and that's the game over.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearing must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>them,</b> and the opportunity to present their own cases.|$|E

One {{contestant}} is onstage with the host, while the other is sequestered backstage so that he/she cannot hear the first portion of the round. The first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>them</b> (originally 15 seconds, extended to 20 in 1994). The clock begins to run only after the first question is asked, and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked, if time remains.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} from Australia, Cowdrey decided {{to drop out of}} Oxford so he could {{concentrate}} on his career with Kent and England. No longer an undergraduate he was called up for national service, but discharged after two weeks in the Royal Air Force due to a hereditary disability of rigid toes on which he previously had an operation. This caused some controversy as he promptly made 44, 101, 5, 139, 48, 44, 115 not out and 103 not out, hardly the scores of an invalid. The press suggested that strings had been pulled on his behalf and questions were asked in the House of Commons by Gerald Nabarro MP, though he apologised after the true facts became known. Cowdrey received hate mail from the parents of national servicemen, and took great care <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>them</b> personally. He was called up for the Third Test against South Africa, but was battered by the fast bowlers Peter Heine and Neil Adcock making 1 and 50, which he considered to be the worse bruising of his career and Cowdrey pulled out of the series rather than add to his injuries.|$|E

500|$|Critic Darcy Sullivan saw {{the book}} as {{presenting}} how Brown's Playboy obsession affects his ability to relate to women. [...] Sullivan called The Playboy stories [...] "he most honest sex in comics" [...] of the early 1990s, [...] "and the most damning exposé of pornography" [...] as it deals [...] "with nothing more than Brown's relationship with Playboy". [...] He praises how quickly Brown matured as a storyteller {{over the course of}} The Playboy, and for the believability of scenes {{which may or may not}} have happened as Brown depicted them. [...] While seeming to acknowledge feminist concerns, Brown depicts himself as [...] "a victim of his urges", and that [...] "Playboy has kept him mentally separate". [...] Sullivan asserts the book shows that pornography does not merely satisfy a need, but fosters an addiction. [...] Brown's comics raise questions, rather than trying <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>them,</b> an approach Sullivan compared favourably to that of Joe Matt's less subtle body of work, which also details a pornography obsession: he wrote that Matt's comics analyze and rationalize his obsession, while Brown's reveal.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics of}} Lukashenko, {{including}} the opposition group Zubr, {{use the term}} Lukashism {{to refer to the}} political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus. [...] The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition. Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries. Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying: [...] "I've been hearing these accusations for over 10years and we have got used to it. We are not going <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>them.</b> I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. I am sure that it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state." ...|$|E

Using his tentacles to save the Master Chief and Arbiter from perishing, Gravemind brings them face to face in a chasm on Delta Halo. Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the ring's architects, the Forerunners, died when they activated the installation {{in order to stop}} the threat of the Flood; the Master Chief verifies what the creature says, having stopped the firing of another ring in [...] Though the Arbiter does not accept the truth immediately, Gravemind sends the Master Chief to the Covenant city High Charity and the Arbiter to the Halo's control room in order to stop the deluded Covenant from killing all sentient life a second time. Though he promises an alliance, Gravemind has ulterior motives. His Flood infest the human ship In Amber Clad and makes a slipspace jump into High Charity itself, in an effort to use the station to escape the confines of Halo. Having taken over the city, Gravemind questions the A.I. Cortana, who was left behind to destroy High Charity if Halo was activated. Gravemind says that he has questions that he will ask, and Cortana agrees <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>them.</b> A short story in the 2009 Halo: Evolutions anthology details the conversations that follow.|$|E

[...] Mrs. Washington was an habitual communicant...I have been written to by many on that point, and have been obliged <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>them</b> as I now do you." [...] This letter is one piece of evidence among many which are frequently cited in support of Washington's deist or even atheist beliefs.

2500|$|One set {{of studies}} has {{reported}} differential item functioning – namely, some test questions function differently {{based on the}} racial group of the test taker, reflecting some kind of systematic difference in a groups ability to understand certain test questions or to acquire the knowledge required <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>them.</b> In 2003 Freedle published data showing that Black students have had a slight advantage on the verbal questions that are labeled as difficult on the SAT, whereas white and Asian students tended to have a slight advantage on questions labeled as easy. Freedle argued that {{these findings suggest that}} [...] "easy" [...] test items use vocabulary that is easier to understand for white middle class students than for minorities, who often use a different language in the home environment, whereas the difficult items use complex language learned only through lectures and textbooks, [...] giving both student groups equal opportunities to acquiring it.|$|E
