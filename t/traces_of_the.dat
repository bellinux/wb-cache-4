5|$|A 12th century {{stairway}} {{was discovered}} that led down to a lower chapel from the 11th century, in excellent condition, whose existence was completely unknown before 1958. Various other <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early buildings have been found.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of pilot Pavel Gruzin's body revealed <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug phenazepam, a benzodiazepine-class sedative in his muscle tissue. Investigators also found an open packet of the Russian-made drug in baggage belonging to Gruzin.|$|E

5|$|A {{site for}} the {{replacement}} terminus was bought by the LSWR in 1899, south of the existing site and {{on the opposite side}} of Westminster Bridge Road. It was completed on 8 February 1902, and the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station, destroying all <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original LNC terminus.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a fragment of a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of the dig suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were farther west than previously thought.|$|E

5|$|It is {{currently}} occupied by an office development, also called Greyfriars, {{and parts of}} Bristol Dental School. <b>Traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abbot's house were discovered during building works in 1989 and a small oval window was incorporated into the new building. Archaeological investigations have found graves with human remains, dating to the thirteenth to fifteenth century, and a medieval conduit, similar to one excavated at Saint Augustine's Abbey in Bristol.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} of the last mansio built at the site, and its associated bath-house, were uncovered by archaeologists in 1912–13. The rooms of both the mansio and bath-house were emptied and the stone foundations were exposed. This work left, in some lower stratified levels, <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two earlier wooden mansiones.|$|E
5|$|<b>Traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway {{can still}} be seen, {{including}} a cast iron pole that supported the overhead wire, {{the remains of the}} engine shed (burnt down in 2004), and a short section of track.

[...] Einstein gleefully pointed out that this equation now takes the form which he had earlier proposed with von Laue, and gives a concrete example of a class of theories which he had studied with Grossmann.|$|R
5|$|Aerial {{surveys of}} the site have {{confirmed}} {{that there was a}} very large artificial enclosure, roughly circular in shape, within which are what is left of several circular and rectangular basins. The basins may be identified with the artificial pools described by the court poet Ali ibn Muhammad el-Iyadi, which surrounded the palace. The foundations have been revealed through archaeological excavations. <b>Traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great hall's columns are still visible. Some parts of the canal can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square before it is re-opened to the public the following morning. Few <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous night's celebration remain after the cleanup process is completed: following the 2013–14 drop, the New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that by 8:00a.m., it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, Alyeska was {{required}} to remove most <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 31 pipeline construction camps. Seven camps closed in November 1976, and six more closed before the 1977 construction season started. All told, 20 camps went up for sale. One was sold to the University of Alaska {{for use as a}}n Arctic research facility, while another was converted for use as a truck stop and motel.|$|E

5|$|Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its {{population}} of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was {{the largest in the}} history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old town {{can be found in the}} modern city.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original conditions. The outer surface {{is divided into}} several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, nearby nuclear weapons testing by the United States {{military}} accidentally caused {{all of the}} islands of Hy-yi-yi to sink into the ocean, destroying all <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhinogrades and their unique ecosystem. Also killed were all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, who were attending a conference on Hy-yi-yi at the time. The book's epilogue, credited to Steiner {{in his capacity as}} the book's illustrator, explains that Stümpke had sent the book's materials to Steiner to {{serve as the basis for}} illustrations in preparation for publication. Following the disaster, it is the only remaining record of the subjects it describes.|$|E

5|$|Some {{specimens}} of M. yaotunensis preserve <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reddish brown pigment protoporphyrin and the blue-green pigment biliverdin, the same pigments {{used in the}} eggs of many modern birds. The eggs were most likely an intense blue-green color, {{as shown by the}} predominance of biliverdin in the shell. The purpose of the coloration is uncertain, but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post-mating sexual signal. Colored eggs are also correlated with active paternal care in modern birds, lending further support to the hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the scientific literature by James Bolton in 1788, under the name Agaricus politus. This usage is not considered valid according to nomenclatural rules, because it was used by Christian Hendrik Persoon to refer to another species in his 1801 Synopsis methodica fungorum, which is a sanctioned work. Stropharia caerulea was officially described by mycologist Hanns Kreisel in 1979 from collections made near Woldegk, Germany. Machiel Noordeloos transferred the species to Psilocybe in 1995, but today this genus is mostly reserved for species that contain the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin. Although psilocybin had once been reported from S.caerulea, subsequent analyses have not revealed any <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substance in the fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E
