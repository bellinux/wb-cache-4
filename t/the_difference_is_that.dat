5|$|Challenge mode employs similar {{gameplay}} {{to that of}} the Story mode. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the gameplay for Challenge mode is faster-paced, {{offers more}} puzzles, and sacrifices any storyline in this mode. It consists of 30 levels and players must fulfill certain conditions before succeeding. Each level lasts only a few minutes, offering more exciting, yet harder, gameplay. The time needed for players to complete a level is recorded in an online leaderboard which can be viewed by other players.|$|E
5|$|Season mode was {{replaced}} with Road to WrestleMania in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, and remained in the games until WWE '12. In this mode, players could choose from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player storylines. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> each storyline is tailor made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode is a more authentic experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.|$|E
5|$|The {{second volume}} {{represents}} the ethical stage. Victor Eremita found {{a group of}} letters from a retired Judge Vilhelm or William, another pseudonymous author, to 'A', trying to convince 'A' {{of the value of}} the ethical stage of life by arguing that the ethical person can still enjoy aesthetic values. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pursuit of pleasure is tempered with ethical values and responsibilities.|$|E
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{bean sprouts}} chicken {{comes with a}} plate of beansprouts, famous {{throughout}} the city of Ipoh. The steamed chicken is served with light soya sauce flavoured with oil.|$|R
3000|$|... [...]. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{last three}} terms in (19) {{will be changed}} with the {{different}} T in (24). Even so, our BB-MUSIC estimator can still work correctly under the assumptions A 1, A 2 and A 3.|$|R
30|$|The fully {{automated}} system {{was similar to}} the partially automated system in how it was activated and controlled; <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system also activated the steering, meaning that the drivers could release the steering wheel and did not need to do anything for the 45 -min drive.|$|R
5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
25|$|The syntax {{is similar}} to the one of constructors. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the name is preceded by a ~ and it cannot contain any parameters. There cannot be more than one destructor..|$|E
25|$|Belle, a {{character}} from Thomas & Friends, is {{loosely based on}} this engine. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she has water cannons {{on top of her}} tanks (which was clearly an idea by the series producer).|$|E
40|$|UMM {{found another}} {{breakthrough}} in fostering its students’ entrepreneurship. Coordinating with the Department of Economics and Development Studies (IESP), UMM organized Sunday Morning Market just like Pasar Tugu on Semeru Street, Malang. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> market called "UMM Sunday Morning Market" was managed by students of UMM...|$|R
50|$|Lilium michauxii or Carolina Lily {{is another}} species similar to Lilium iridollae. Lilium michauxii has flowers that {{resemble}} flowers of Turk’s Cap Lily, but <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flowers <b>are</b> fragrant and the stem is only 2 - 3 feet tall. In addition, {{the leaves are}} broadly lance-shaped.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} 11 early {{vehicles}} with a Porsche suspension, the only variant developed <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Sd.Kfz.185. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gun used was the 8.8 cm PaK 43 {{rather than the}} 12.8 cm PaK 44. This was due to shortages of the latter weapon. The variant did not enter service.|$|R
25|$|Pessimism bias is {{an effect}} {{in which people}} exaggerate the {{likelihood}} that negative things will happen to them. It contrasts with optimism bias. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we are in an improbable way worried about our society's future.|$|E
25|$|The Lewis & Clark Baseball League postseason {{operates}} {{like the}} major league model of the 1970s; no wild cards, just the four division winners. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> those MLB series were the best-of-five and the LCBL variety can, at most, go three games.|$|E
25|$|Capital {{acquisitions}} tax {{is charged}} to {{the recipient of}} gifts or inheritances, {{at the rate of}} 33% above a tax-free threshold. Gifts and inheritances are gratuitous benefits; <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> an inheritance is taken on death and a gift is taken other than on death.|$|E
25|$|Bellone had 34 guns, {{including}} 24 long 8-pounder guns, {{and though}} she had more guns, her broadside <b>was</b> inferior to <b>that</b> on Lord Nelson. What made <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Bellone had a crew of 260 men, versus the 102 men, exclusive of passengers, on Lord Nelson. However, Bellone also had on board some 56 prisoners from various captures.|$|R

50|$|Blockbusters {{was created}} by Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions and {{originated}} as an American series in 1980. The UK version was created after Central Independent Television producer Graham C. Williams spotted the show in 1981 and produced a pilot in 1982. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> instead of adults, who appeared on the American edition, the UK edition was produced for sixth formers.|$|R
25|$|The {{overhead}} pass is executed {{similarly to}} the two-handed pass. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is executed over the passer's head. The overhead pass {{may also be}} executed similarly to the one-handed shoulder pass, with the difference being that the movements are done overhead, instead of at shoulder height.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{sometimes}} confusion between a rousant eagle with displayed wings and a displayed eagle. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> rousant eagles {{face to the}} right and have their feet on the ground and displayed eagles face the viewer, have their legs splayed out, and the tail is completely visible.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a Schauder basis or {{countable}} {{basis is}} similar to the usual (Hamel) basis of a vector space; <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Hamel bases use linear combinations that are finite sums, while for Schauder bases they may be infinite sums. This makes Schauder bases more suitable for the analysis of infinite-dimensional topological vector spaces including Banach spaces.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} article compares {{a method}} (presented by Salas-Bringas et al 1) using a flow rate equation with the Rabinowitsch method {{to estimate the}} consistency and flow behavior index of a Non-Newtonian fluid in capillary flow. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method presented by Salas-Bringas et al 1 gives {{the uncertainty of the}} measurements and requires less number of experiments when different flow rates are measured...|$|R
25|$|These {{traditional}} {{markets are}} {{a variation of}} tianguis, or open air markets, which have been {{an important part of}} commerce since pre Hispanic times. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> traditional tianguis are held on specific days, with individual vendors setting up and taking down their stalls on the same day. Like tianguis, traditional fixed markets have stands occupied by various individual merchants, and tend to sell the same kinds of products: produce, groceries and other basic necessities. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the fixed markets operate every day, and individual stands are rented and occupied {{in much the same way}} as a store is. The fixed market has its origin in various attempts to replace tianguis with markets that can be better regulated. However, the tianguis were never replaced. Many tianguis, especially in rural areas, now operate in conjunction with the fixed markets to expand on variety of merchandise available.|$|E
25|$|There are two signings, {{sometimes}} also referenced as two approbations. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> four signatories of {{the first}} part testify that they have examined the treatises and endorse its text while in the second signing signatories do not assert that they have read the treatises but nonetheless express approval by explicitly restating some general propositions of the treatises and endorsing them instead.|$|E
25|$|Upper schools (viša škola) {{last for}} 3 years. They {{correspond}} to professional universities. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> professional universities last 3–8 years (just as normal ones do) and offer common tertiary degrees, while upper schools last only for 3 years and offer special upper school diploma. However, since Serbia signed Bologna Process in 2003, upper schools {{are to be}} reformed in accordance with it.|$|E

30|$|Delineate and {{understand}} ECD determinants in families, neighborhoods, and society. The determinants {{are complex and}} are expressed differently in different settings (Irwin, Siddiqi, & Hertzman, 2007). Using a population-based assessment, one can identify what 0 and where <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> determine different outcomes.

25|$|The terms Expanded and Elevated or Abaisé and Inverted {{are similar}} terms often used interchangeably in {{heraldry}} but have specific meanings. There is also sometimes confusion between a Rising bird with Displayed wings and a Displayed bird. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Rising birds face {{either to the}} dexter or in trian aspect and have their feet on the ground. Displayed birds face the viewer, have their legs splayed out, and the tail is completely visible.|$|E
25|$|Han {{blue and}} Egyptian blue {{have the same}} basic {{structure}} and have very similar properties. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Egyptian blue (CaCuSi4O10) has calcium {{in the position of}} Han blue's barium (BaCuSi4O10). The similarities lead some to suggest that Han blue was based on Egyptian blue knowledge, which had travelled east along the Silk Road. Independent innovation in China would still have been needed to replace calcium with barium (the Han pigments start to form at 100–200°C higher than Egyptian blue).|$|E
25|$|Fortune-telling is the {{practice}} of predicting information about a person's life. The scope of fortune-telling is in principle identical with {{the practice}} of divination. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> divination is the term used for predictions considered part of a religious ritual, invoking deities or spirits, while the term fortune-telling implies a less serious or formal setting, even one of popular culture, where belief in occult workings behind the prediction is less prominent than the concept of suggestion, spiritual or practical advisory or affirmation.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} MDER rules {{are a subset}} of the BER rules. This MDER-encoded ASN.1 {{representation}} of objects is similar in concept to using XML as a machine-independent method of exchanging data (indeed, the XER transfer syntax transfers ASN.1 objects in XML). However <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> MDER messages <b>are</b> much smaller than the equivalent XML messages, and much simpler for machines to convert to and from internal data structures.|$|R
