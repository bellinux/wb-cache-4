5000|$|Often {{called the}} [...] "steel-case" [...] {{transmission}} for its steel shell, {{in contrast to}} the later W-series transmissions' aluminium case. This transmission is mostly associated with early Celicas of the 1970s. It is also shorter from the bellhousing face to the <b>transmission</b> <b>mount</b> than the later aluminium case W-series transmissions, despite using the same mount.|$|E
5000|$|Dufault {{made her}} NASCAR Nationwide Series debut at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on August 20, 2011 driving for MacDonald Motorsports. As {{the team was}} in the top 30 in season car-owner points, she was {{guaranteed}} a starting position; she started 39th and finished 30th with a <b>transmission</b> <b>mount</b> broke. She was the first Canadian woman to race in the NASCAR Nationwide Series since it took that name. Dufault was listed {{as one of the}} [...] "Top female drivers in racing today" [...] by Fox Sports, and was also named as one of the [...] "Top 12 Up-and-Coming Female Drivers in Motorsports" [...] by Bleacher Report. In addition, Dufault competed in the inaugural Dodge Viper Celebrity Challenge at Miller Motorsports Park in October 2011, competing alongside racing legends such as Roger Penske, Kurt Busch and Allen Johnson.|$|E
30|$|In {{taking these}} {{elements}} into account, the conceptual idea of combining {{the area of}} the top longitudinal rail, the strut tower and the engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>mount</b> into a single large aluminium alloy cast component was developed. This area has stringent requirements regarding crash safety of the vehicle, e.g. in case of a head-on collision, and the torsion and flexural stiffness of the entire vehicle structure.|$|E

5000|$|The Audi A4 {{automobile}} layout {{consists of}} a longitudinal engine front-engine design, with transaxle-type <b>transmissions</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the rear of}} the engine. The cars are front-wheel drive, or on some models, [...] "quattro" [...] all-wheel drive.|$|R
50|$|Many Powerglides {{share the}} same length, 27 spline output shaft, and <b>transmission</b> <b>mounting</b> as the THM 350; thus, the {{transmissions}} are easily interchangeable for owners wanting three speeds instead of two. Other Powerglides came with an incompatible 16 spline output shaft.|$|R
40|$|Engine mount tuning is a multi-disciplinary {{exercise}} {{since it}} affects Idle-shake, Road-shake and power-train noise response. Engine inertia {{is often used}} as a tuned absorber for controlling suspension resonance related road-shake issues. Last but not least, vehicle ride and handling may also be affected by mount tuning. In this work, Torque-Roll-Axis (TRA) decoupling of the rigid powertrain {{was used as a}} starting point for mount tuning. Nodal point of flexible powertrain bending was used to define the envelop for <b>transmission</b> <b>mount</b> locations. The frequency corresponding to the decoupled roll mode of the rigid powertrain was then adjusted for idle-shake and road-shake response management...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{reversed}} system witnessed rapid {{consumption of the}} front frame within the first 20 milliseconds of the impact leading to transfer of huge amount of the impact load on the other components. As a result both the radiator and the sheet metal experienced unreasonably high peak deformation. Some of the interior structures which include; the torque box and the engine mount equally show extended deformation, suggesting increased structural intrusion and poor energy management scheme (Figure  5 b). However, the firewall, the drive-line and <b>transmission</b> <b>mount</b> maintain similar deformation pattern as in normal structural mode but with slightly increased peak values (Figure  6 b).|$|E
5000|$|The {{compact and}} {{efficient}} layout [...] - [...] a transversely-mounted engine with <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> beside the engine driving {{the front wheels}} through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts [...] - [...] subsequently became common with competitors and arguably an industry standard.|$|R
5000|$|The Fina-Sport was an American {{automobile}} manufactured from 1953 until 1954. The {{brainchild of}} Perry Fina, it used a [...] Cadillac V-8 engine and Hydramatic <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Ford chassis. Styling of both convertibles and hardtops was by Vignale.|$|R
50|$|Mister Transmission {{performs}} multi-check inspections. These inspections include: {{checking the}} transmission fluid, a road test, a lift inspection checking: neutral switch, engine rpm, throttle linkage, modulators, <b>transmission</b> <b>mounts,</b> u-joints, fluid retention, and electronic controls, while also doing a pan inspection which checks {{the inside of}} the transmission.|$|R
50|$|Because the 911 {{air-cooled}} crankcase {{uses the}} Porsche 356 engine to <b>transmission</b> <b>mounting</b> flange configuration, the 996 GT3 used a manual gearbox also of air-cooled 911 heritage. This gearbox has interchangeable gear ratios {{and is more}} durable making it more suitable for racing than the standard 911 type 996 gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|All {{versions}} of the S4 have their <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> immediately {{at the rear of}} the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle, and like all Audi [...] "S" [...] cars, are only available as standard with Audis quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, using a Torsen-based centre differential system.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Dennis {{developed}} the Falcon single-deck bus with longitudinally-mounted rear engine. The Falcon H variant had a horizontal Gardner engine with the Voith gearbox mounted {{ahead of the}} rear axle, the later Falcon HC had the Voith <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> behind the rear axle and close-coupled to the Gardner engine. The Falcon V variant had vertical engines.|$|R
5000|$|Fiat quickly {{demonstrated}} the layouts flexibility, re-configuring the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the Fiat X1/9, and the compact, efficient layout [...] - [...] a transversely-mounted engine with <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> beside the engine driving {{the front wheels}} through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts [...] - [...] subsequently became common with competitors and arguably an industry standard.|$|R
50|$|In {{critical}} {{military and}} commercial aerospace applications, material engineers commonly specify VIM-VAR steels. VIM means Vacuum Induction Melted and VAR means Vacuum Arc Remelted. VIM-VAR steels become bearings for jet engines, rotor shafts for military helicopters, flap actuators for fighter jets, gears in jet or helicopter <b>transmissions,</b> <b>mounts</b> or fasteners for jet engines, jet tail hooks and other demanding applications.|$|R
50|$|After the 128, Fiat further {{demonstrated}} the layouts flexibility, re-configurating the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the Fiat X1/9. The compact, efficient Giacosa layout — a transversely-mounted engine with <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> beside the engine driving {{the front wheels}} through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts, combined with MacPherson struts and an independently located radiator — subsequently became common with competitors and arguably an industry standard.|$|R
5000|$|The 1964 {{model year}} Classics, were refined with {{stainless}} steel rocker moldings, a flush single-plane aluminum grille replacing the previous year's deep concave design, and oval tail-lamps replacing the flush mounted lenses of the 1963's. Classics with bucket seats and V8 engine could be ordered {{with a new}} [...] "Shift-Command" [...] three-speed automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> on the center console that could be shifted manually.|$|R
5000|$|The TU {{engine is}} distantly {{related to the}} older X-Type engine - sharing a similar {{overhead}} camshaft architecture, but the key differences are the belt driven camshaft (the X is chain driven), and that the TU is mounted in a conventional upright position with a separate, end-on <b>mounted</b> <b>transmission</b> and unequal length driveshafts. The X engine, by comparison, had an integral <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the side of}} the crankcase (giving rise to its popular nickname the [...] "suitcase engine"), sharing a common oil supply and was mounted almost lying flat on its side within the car.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1982, Mitsubishi facelifted the Mirage range. Distinguished by the {{installation}} of flusher fitting headlamps that extended into the fender panels, stylists also designed a new grille insert. The taillights were larger, new firmer engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>mounts</b> were fitted, and a new, lighter and more rigid transmission case was developed. The dashboard was also updated, with rotating [...] "satellite"buttons mounted within fingertip reach for light and wiper functions.|$|R
5000|$|The American M26 Pershing was {{designed}} as a medium tank to replace the M4 Sherman, and contained many features common on post-war MBTs. These features include an automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> in the rear, torsion bar suspension [...] and had an early form of powerpack. The M26, however, suffered from a relatively weak engine, and was somewhat under powered. [...] The design of the M26 had profound influence on American postwar medium and Main Battle tanks: ...|$|R
50|$|After serving {{two years}} in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Stempel joined GM's Oldsmobile Division as a senior {{detailer}} in the chassis design department in 1958, later serving as senior designer (1962); transmission design engineer (1964); motor engineer (1969); and assistant chief engineer (1972). Stempel subsequently worked on the team that developed the 1966 Toronado, the first modern American front-wheel-drive car. According to a GM biography, Stempel designed the Toronado’s front suspension and its engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>mounting</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The Fl 282 Kolibri was an {{improved}} {{version of the}} Flettner Fl 265 announced in July 1940, which pioneered the same intermeshing rotor configuration that the Kolibri used. It had a 7.7 litre displacement, seven-cylinder Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial engine of 150-160 hp mounted {{in the center of}} the fuselage, with a <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> on the front of the engine from which a drive shaft ran to an upper gearbox, which then split the power to a pair of opposite-rotation drive shafts to turn the rotors.|$|R
5000|$|Although Lordstown Assembly had a {{purpose-built}} exit {{off of the}} Ohio Turnpike {{built to}} make shipment easier, the Vega was designed for vertical shipment, nose down. General Motors and Southern Pacific designed [...] "Vert-A-Pac" [...] rail cars to hold 30 Vegas each, compared with conventional tri-level autoracks which held 18. The Vega was fitted with four removable cast-steel sockets on the underside and had plastic spacers - removed at unloading - to protect engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>mounts.</b> The rail car ramp/doors were opened and closed via forklift.|$|R
50|$|Operation of the Allison Transmission (AHS-2), or Two-Mode Hybrid, {{from the}} Global Hybrid Cooperation. This <b>transmission</b> is <b>mounted</b> on the BMW ActiveHybrid and the Mercedes-Benz ML450 BlueHybrid.|$|R
50|$|Cars {{built in}} Germany were {{assembled}} in {{a brand new}} (at the time) plant at Wolfsburg in Assembly Hall 54. The plant was heavily robotised {{in an effort to}} make build quality more consistent. New innovations on the second generation included an optional trip computer (referred to as the MFA, German Multi-Funktions-Anzeige), as well as silicone dampened engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>mounts</b> to reduce noise, vibration, and harshness levels. In 1988, a more advanced fully electronic fuel injection system became available. This arrangement is known as the Digifant engine management system.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} Boxster is {{fitted with}} a new 2.7-litre flat-6 engines, and the Boxster S is fitted with the existing 3.4-litre engine but with revised performance. Both engines are equipped with a 6-speed manual gearbox and an optional 7-speed reworked PDK. Both manual and automatic models are available with several technical options including Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) and a Sport Chrono Package that includes active <b>transmission</b> <b>mounts,</b> and makes the PDK-equipped model even faster. Porsche claims that the new generation Boxster provides fuel savings of 15% over the outgoing model.|$|R
50|$|The {{holograms}} {{found on}} credit cards are examples of rainbow holograms. These are technically <b>transmission</b> holograms <b>mounted</b> onto a reflective surface like a metalized polyethylene terephthalate substrate commonly known as PET.|$|R
50|$|This {{tradition}} {{is the source}} of and more or less shares the same doctrines as Shingon Buddhism, and some of its students travel to Japan to be given <b>transmission</b> at <b>Mount</b> Kōya.|$|R
50|$|The {{mainshaft}} extends {{outside the}} case in both directions: the input shaft towards the engine, and the output shaft towards the rear axle (on rear wheel drive cars. Front wheel drives generally have the engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> transversely, the differential {{being part of the}} transmission assembly.) The shaft is suspended by the main bearings, and is split towards the input end. At the point of the split, a pilot bearing holds the shafts together. The gears and clutches ride on the mainshaft, the gears being free to turn relative to the mainshaft except when engaged by the clutches.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Toyota {{introduced}} the slightly larger third generation Tercel {{with a new}} 12-valve engine which featured a variable venturi carburetor, and later models with EFI. From this generation on, the engine is mounted transversely, with the <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the right side}} of the engine in a layout developed by Dante Giacosa and earlier popularised in such vehicles as the Fiat 128 and Volkswagen Golf. Other improvements included revised rack-and-pinion steering and a newly designed, fully independent suspension. The Tercel continued in North America as Toyota's least expensive vehicle, while it was no longer offered in Europe. In other markets, the smaller Starlet was also offered.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} {{vehicles}} have a clutch and gearbox (or <b>transmission)</b> <b>mounted</b> {{directly on the}} engine, with a drive shaft leading to a final drive in the rear axle. When the vehicle is stationary, the drive shaft does not rotate. Some vehicles (generally sports cars, most commonly Alfa Romeos or Porsche 924s), seeking improved weight balance between front and rear, use a rear-mounted transaxle. This places the clutch and transmission {{at the rear of}} the car and the drive shaft between them and the engine. In this case the drive shaft rotates continuously with the engine, even when the car is stationary and out of gear.|$|R
5000|$|Advertising {{themselves}} as [...] "The pioneer builder of quality small cars", the first Templar car had a four-cylinder, overhead-valve engine of 3.2 litres capacity coupled to a three-speed <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> in a chassis with a 118 in wheelbase. The entry of the United States into World War I severely curtailed production, the company making artillery shells {{for the war}} effort. Only around 150 cars were made in 1918. Body styles included a coupe with coachwork by Leon Rubay at US$4250, a Victoria Elite tourer, a 3-door sedan and a sports model called the Sportette at US$2400. The cars were extremely well equipped with a compass and Kodak camera as standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|XHUDG-FM {{began to}} {{transmit}} officially on May 30, 1974, created {{to bridge the}} gap between the academic community and the residents of Jalisco. However, the history of the station dates to an experimental <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> in 1963 under the callsign XEIITG by UDG's engineering school. From the late 1960s, attempts were made to win a permit and actually launch a full-time radio station, a permit conceded by presidential decree in 1973. The first transmitter, donated by then-President Luis Echeverria, was put into place, and the station came on air from the engineering school, broadcasting 13 hours a day. XHUDG-FM moved to the Cultural and Administrative Building in 1983.|$|R
5000|$|The Sima-Violet cyclecar was {{powered by}} a {{two-stroke}} twin-cylinder air-cooled engine of 497cc mounted in a low-slung position ahead of the driver. [...] Power was delivered to the rear wheels via a two speed <b>transmission</b> <b>mounted</b> on the rear-axle. [...] The quoted top speed for a standard vehicle was 110 km/h (68 mph). The Sima-Violet appeared at the Paris Motor Show in October 1924 at which time the only body-style listed was a steel-frame [...] "Torpedo" [...] type 2-seater, sitting on a 2200 mm wheelbase, and which the manufacturer was listing at a price of 4,950 francs. [...] A single seater sports bodied version was also produced.|$|R
