25|$|In November 1922, Kellogg {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Indian Welfare League in Albany, in which Assemblyman Everett was chastised by both Indian and non-Indian reformers for his report, including his actions which allegedly stirred up false hope among Indians about the land claims issue. In a column of the Knickerbocker Press, Kellogg reacted to the meeting by defending Everett. She added that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>question</b> was not the workings of the Everett Commission, but the legal status of the Six Nations according to Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1784 granting the Iroquois Confederacy independence. Less than a week later, Kellogg sent Everett a letter endorsing his report, condemning the Indian Welfare League, and making an offer to retain his legal services for in future litigation.|$|E
25|$|Victim's {{contribution}} R v Dear (1996) CLR 595. Believing {{that the}} victim had sexually interfered with his 12-year-old daughter, the defendant attacked the victim with a Stanley knife. The defendant argued that the chain of causation had been broken because, two days later, the victim had committed suicide either by reopening his wounds or because {{he had failed to}} take steps to staunch the blood flow after the wounds had reopened spontaneously (i.e. the potential suicide constituted a novus actus interveniens). It was held that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>question</b> was whether the injuries inflicted by the defendant were an operating and significant cause of or contribution to the death. Distinctions between the victim's mere self-neglect (no break in the chain) and the victim's gross self-neglect (break in the chain) were not helpful. The victim's death resulted from bleeding from the artery severed by the defendant. Whether the resumption or continuation of that bleeding was deliberately caused by the victim, the defendant's conduct remained the operative and significant cause of the victim's death.|$|E

Musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, [...] "Even symphonies by [...] {{well-known}} composers of the early 19th century as Méhul, Rossini, Cherubini, Hérold, Czerny, Clementi, Weber and Moscheles were perceived in their own time as standing in the symphonic shadow of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, or some combination of the three." [...] While many composers continued to write symphonies during the 1820s and 30s, [...] "there was a growing sense that these works were aesthetically far inferior to Beethoven's.... <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>question</b> was not so much whether symphonies could still be written, but whether the genre could continue to flourish and grow as it had over the previous half-century in the hands of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. On this count, there were varying degrees of skepticism but virtually no real optimism." ...|$|E

[...] The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>question</b> was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it. [...] After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides?

500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic {{selected}} the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, noting that it has [...] "a wide theatrical scope akin to that of The-Dream's own 'Nikki, Pt. 2/Abyss.'"

Perhaps no one should read anything into it." [...] Christina Lee of Idolator observed that the song [...] "casts out the album’s most heartbreaking line — 'I’m prepared to die at the moment' — but puts it in a context that doesn’t explain enough." [...] Esquires Miles Raymer thought that Police would have been a better band if they would have had Rihanna as their lead singer instead of Sting; however, he described [...] "Mother Mary" [...] as something to skip. Alike Raymer, Bernard Perusse for The Montreal Gazette felt that only [...] "Love Without Tragedy" [...] was worth listening to and described it as demonstrating [...] "a tiny bit of hope" [...] on the album. In a review of the album, Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "Rihanna sings a grim rhetorical: [...] "What's love without tragedy?" [...] However, according to her <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>question</b> that she and her songwriters is presenting on the record is [...] "Who is Rihanna without Chris Brown?" [...] "Nathan Slavick for DJ Booth was critical of the tracks theme, writing that [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary", along with [...] "Stay" [...] and [...] "No Love Allowed", all discuss the topic of Rihanna being a non-controversial person who is struggling to find love in a [...] "mad world".

2500|$|But here's where <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>question</b> lies. Did God {{create the}} world, or not? Is it God's handiwork?

2500|$|The {{primitive}} {{attempt in}} dealing with differential equations had in view a reduction to quadratures. As {{it had been the}} hope of eighteenth-century algebraists to find a method for solving the general equation of the nth degree, so it was the hope of analysts to find a general method for integrating any differential equation. Gauss (1799) showed, however, that the differential equation meets its limitations very soon unless complex numbers are introduced. Hence, analysts began to substitute the study of functions, thus opening a new and fertile field. Cauchy was the first to appreciate the importance of this view. [...] Thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>question</b> was to be not whether a solution is possible by means of known functions or their integrals but whether a given differential equation suffices for the definition of a function of the independent variable or variables, and, if so, what are the characteristic properties of this function.|$|E

[...] For the rock to be unable {{to move from one}} space to another, {{it would have to be}} larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, then the question would not make sense—because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God's capabilities.|$|E
