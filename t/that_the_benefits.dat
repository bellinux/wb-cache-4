5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015 the Supreme Court issued {{judgement}} on a court case, R (on {{the application}} of SG and others) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, concerning an argument made on behalf of two lone mothers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> cap was discriminatory and unfair. The court ruled by a 3-2 majority verdict <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> cap was lawful but {{three of the five}} judges concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> cap breached <b>the</b> United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which the UK is a signatory. Supreme court judge Lord Carnwath recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government review the policy. Deputy president of the court, Lady Hale, said that: [...] "claimants affected by the cap will, by definition, not receive the sums of money which the state deems necessary for them adequately to house, feed, clothe and warm themselves and their children." [...] In reaction to the judgement the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said: [...] "I am delighted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country’s highest court has agreed with this government and overwhelming public opinion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> cap is right and fair".|$|R

5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} received American {{news coverage}} during the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential primaries after {{the details of}} a conversation between Barack Obama's economic advisor Austan Goolsbee, and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed. Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama's comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more political rhetoric than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among Democratic voters was (and is) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|The red-throated loon breeds {{primarily}} in the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America (generally north of 50°N latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters, sometimes in groups of considerable size. More than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on {{the eastern part of}} the German Bight, for example. Unlike other loons, it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites. Its small size renders it more versatile, but it is less able to feed on deeper prey. The increase in size and diversity of the remaining species of loons suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of larger size outweigh the limitations.|$|E

Unlike its predecessors, Lehnert did not stress <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> to <b>the</b> unit {{must be in the}} area of collective bargaining or labor-management issues. Its statement that for an expense to be charged [...] "there must be some indication <b>that</b> <b>the</b> payment is for services that may ultimately enure to <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of <b>the</b> members of the local union" [...] implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> to <b>the</b> worker need not be in the form of increased leverage against the employer.|$|R

Along this line, inspired from the Luenberger’s ap-proach, we propose a dual framework and establish a characterization of Nash equilibriums in terms of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> function. Moreover, some criterions are provided to identify the efficient mixed strategies of a game (which differ from the Pareto efficient strategies).
