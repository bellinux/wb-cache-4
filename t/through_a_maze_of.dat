5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} to control Pac-Man, navigating him <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> consumable dashes called Video Wafers,  opposed by {{a quartet of}} multi-colored ghosts. The goal {{of the game is}} to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed to the next one in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
25|$|The player {{controls}} Pac-Man <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> various dots, {{known as}} Pac-Dots, {{as well as}} four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal {{of the game is}} to consume all the Pac-Dots in a stage in order to proceed to the next one. Between some stages, one of three intermission animations plays. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touch Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default—DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points to 15,000 or 20,000, or disable the bonus life altogether. The number of lives can be set to 1 life only or up to five lives maximum. High score cannot exceed 999,990 points; players may exceed that score, but the game keeps the last 6 digits.|$|E
50|$|Crazy Balloon is an arcade game {{released}} by Taito in 1980. Crazy Balloon requires the player to maneuver <b>a</b> balloon <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> full <b>of</b> thorns {{in order to}} reach the goal. The game has appeared on various platforms including an updated remake for the PlayStation Portable as part of the Taito Legends Power-Up collection.|$|R
50|$|The {{store is}} divided into two {{distinct}} sections: the front part, facing Titus Avenue, houses all varieties of electric guitars, acoustic guitars and bass guitars as well as drums, keyboards and amplifiers. The rear section, accessible from a back door near Grange Pl. or from the front <b>through</b> <b>a</b> short <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> corridors, houses the music collection.|$|R
50|$|The game is an arcade-style puzzle {{game where}} the player must {{navigate}} the Dizzy <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> <b>mazes</b> {{similar to the}} Adventures of Lolo games.|$|R
500|$|Beck {{continued}} {{to explore new}} guitar sounds and used a recently purchased Sho-Bud steel guitar to create the slide fills for the song. [...] Martin Power describes the songs' instrumental break as [...] "its 'pistols at dawn' mid-section, which found Jeff and [...] Micky Waller chasing each other <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> drum rolls, crashing cymbals, slashing chords, and creamy arpeggios".|$|E
500|$|On 2 June, {{the launch}} cleared Cape York, the extreme {{northern}} {{point of the}} Australian continent. Bligh turned south-west, and steered <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> shoals, reefs, sandbanks, and small islands. The route taken was not the Endeavour Strait, but a narrower southerly passage later known as the Prince of Wales Channel. At 20:00 that evening, they reached the open Arafura Sea, still [...] from Coupang. The following eight days encompassed {{some of the toughest}} travel of the entire journey and, by 11 June, many were close to collapse. The next day, the coast of Timor was sighted: [...] "It is not possible for me to describe the pleasure which the blessing of the sight of this land diffused among us", Bligh wrote. On 14 June, with a makeshift Union Jack hoisted, they sailed into Coupang harbour.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 July, Hitler summoned Kluge and Manstein to his {{headquarters}} at Rastenburg in East Prussia. Two days earlier, the Western Allies had invaded Sicily. The threat of further Allied landings in Italy or along southern France made Hitler believe it was essential to move forces from Kursk to Italy and to discontinue the offensive. Kluge welcomed the news, as {{he was aware that}} the Soviets were initiating a massive offensive against his sector, but Manstein was less welcoming. Manstein's forces had just spent a week fighting <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> defensive works and he believed they {{were on the verge of}} breaking through to more open terrain, which would allow him to engage and destroy the Soviet armoured reserves in a mobile battle. Manstein stated, [...] "On no account should we let go of the enemy until the mobile reserves he [...] committed [...] completely beaten." [...] Hitler agreed to temporarily allow the continuance of the offensive in the southern part of the salient, but the following day he ordered Manstein's reserve – the XXIV Panzer Corps – to move south to support the 1st Panzer Army. This removed the force Manstein believed was needed to succeed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} and mid-1960s, Hazel helped steer a {{development}} company helmed by Isadore Guldesky, Theodore Lerner, and H. Max Ammerman <b>through</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> ordinances and regulations to construct Tysons Corner Center, at the time one the first super-regional enclosed malls in the country. After a controversial Fairfax County Board {{vote in favor of}} the Guldesky-Lerner-Ammerman group and, later, a lawsuit concerning a lease and zoning issue, the highly anticipated Tysons Corner Center was opened in 1968.|$|R
2500|$|Just as {{happened}} to Argentina in Group D, Belgium endured {{the same fate}} in Group F. Despite winning its first two World Cup games 1–0 [...] against [...] Morocco and the Netherlands, Belgium finished third as, in an upset, it lost to tournament newcomers Saudi Arabia 1–0 in the third game. During that game, Saudi player Saaed Al-Owairian ran from his own half <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> Belgian players to score the game's only goal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{good side}} {{was to be}} home to Quest of the Unicorn, an {{adventure}} that would send guests <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> medieval mythological creatures to seek the hidden grotto where the unicorn lives. Finally, the Fantasia Gardens attraction {{was to be a}} musical boat ride through animal scenes from Disney's animated classic, Fantasia.

5000|$|In Chimera, {{the player}} moves <b>through</b> <b>an</b> {{isometric}} <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> 8 x 8 screens. The player {{must try to}} gain access to hidden or blocked areas of the spaceship, often searching for items in order to circumvent various obstacles. Once the obstacles are disabled, the player may use items to create a warhead and carry it to one of the [...] "blue" [...] rooms of the ship. Upon activation of all four warheads, the player must reach the green room in order to complete the quest.|$|R
5000|$|Blind Leading the Blind: Each {{team has}} to advance <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> {{consisting}} <b>of</b> bamboo poles, with each partner having their wrists tied together, blindfolded and wearing electrical-shock dog collars.

50|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is mostly}} {{identical to that}} of Deus Ex, save for a few additions, such as an in-game IRC client which adds a multiplayer element to an otherwise single-player game. In addition, the mod adds a highly configurable difficulty system, the ability to skip all cut scenes and a new training mission to acclimatize players to the changes. It also features some scripted linear sequences and levels, which are mainly used to modify the atmosphere (e.g. navigating <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> full <b>of</b> deadly robots or going <b>through</b> <b>a</b> hall with laser traps), {{although most of the}} maps in the game retain the multiple-solution standard set by Deus Ex.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the season}} of 1908, the Star of Bengal sailed from San Francisco on April 22, {{arriving}} at Fort Wrangell on May 5. She was loaded with supplies for Wrangell cannery, including the fuel for the season, and had 146 people on board, 110 of which were [...] "Oriental" [...] seasonal workers. Because maneuvering a sailing vessel <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> small islands and narrow straits is too risky, the last [...] of the voyage, from Warren Island to Fort Wrangell, the Star of Bengal was tugged by the [...] 250-hp Chilkat, an Alaska Packers' Association's steamboat. That summer Wrangell cannery yielded 52,000 cases of salmon which were loaded on the ship while she was moored next to the cannery for the season.|$|E
2500|$|Postoperative {{cognitive}} dysfunction (also known as POCD and post-anesthetic confusion) is a disturbance in cognition after surgery. [...] It {{may also be}} variably used to describe emergence delirium (immediate post-operative confusion) and early {{cognitive dysfunction}} (diminished cognitive function in the first post-operative week). [...] Although the three entities (delirium, early POCD and long-term POCD) are separate, the presence of delirium post-operatively predicts the presence of early POCD. [...] There {{does not appear to}} be an association between delirium or early POCD and long-term POCD. According to a recent study conducted at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, the brain navigates its way through a series of activity clusters, or [...] "hubs" [...] on its way back to consciousness. Dr. Andrew Hudson, an assistant professor in anesthesiology states, [...] "Recovery from anesthesia is not simply the result of the anesthetic 'wearing off,' but also of the brain finding its way back <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> possible activity states to those that allow conscious experience. Put simply, the brain reboots itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amman, {{a further}} [...] {{to the east}} {{southeast}} across the plateau from Es Salt, is [...] above sea level requiring a climb of [...] from Es Salt. The divisional headquarters of the Anzac Mounted Division together with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade marched towards Amman on the number three road, a track well {{to the south of}} the main road which passed through the village of Naaur some [...] to the south of Shunet Nimrin. From the Jordan River at [...] below sea level, the road to Naaur [...] away rises [...] <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> rocky hills intersected by deep ravines. The head of the mounted force reached the top at about 02:00 on 25 March but was stretched out in single file for about [...] {{along the side of the}} mountains. As the road to Naaur dwindled away to a track all wheels had to be left behind including most of the reserve small arms ammunition (SAA). Only four small pack mountain guns, a little reserve ammunition (two boxes of SAA to a camel) and the explosives required to demolish the viaduct and tunnels, were put on camels and pack-horses to make the trek forward. On this trek, near the Wadi el Kefrein, a group of Arabs joined the light horse units.|$|E

40|$|While it is {{generally}} accepted that honeybees (Apis mellifera) are capable of using the pattern of polarized light in the sky to navigate to a food source, {{there is little or}} no direct behavioural evidence that they actually do so. We have examined whether bees can be trained to find their way <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> composed <b>of</b> four interconnected tunnels, by using directional information provided by polarized light illumination from the ceilings of the tunnels. The results show that bees can learn this task, thus demonstrating directly, and for the first time, that bees are indeed capable of using the polarized-light information in the sky as a compass to steer their way to a food source...|$|R
60|$|Ida {{rose with}} an effort, and clung heavily to his arm when they crept {{downward}} again; {{but the light}} grew a little clearer as they proceeded, {{and the sound of}} the river rang louder in their ears. Then, in the gray of the morning, they staggered out upon the bank of the river. Walking, half awake, Ida floundered among the boulders and <b>through</b> <b>a</b> horrible <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> whitened driftwood cast up by the stream. Farther on they fortunately found stretches of smooth sand, and they plodded over these and through little pools, though she afterward fancied that Weston carried her across some of the deeper ones.|$|R
2500|$|The {{game has}} been noted for its fluid animation, {{featuring}} a hand-drawn style that was unusual for 16-bit releases. GamePro argued that the game has [...] "the most innovative game play since Sonic first raced onto the Genesis", backing up the point by noting [...] "In the first level, New Junk City, Jim leaps off old tires, climbs strange crevices and cliffs, swings from chains, and creeps <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> garbage - and that's the most traditional level in the game!" [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly gave rave reviews for both the Genesis and SNES versions, praising animations, long levels, and warped sense of humor. One of their reviewers summarized that [...] "This game was made by a gamer, and it shows." [...] With regard to the game's overall appeal, a review from GameZone stated [...] "Back when platformers were the king of genres, Earthworm Jim made its presence known as the 'cool kid on the block' by appealing to many demographics. Obtaining a moderate difficulty level and establishing itself with stylish humor, Earthworm Jim was a financial and critical success for Interplay and Shiny Entertainment. Even though I feel the sequel {{is the best of}} the series, the original still is able to stand out on its own." [...] The review also went on to praise the soundtrack from Mark Miller as well.|$|E

40|$|In {{his recent}} article on "Duality and Unity in the Luiseno Cosmos," Richard Applegate {{attempts}} and succeeds {{not only in}} guiding bis reader <b>through</b> <b>a</b> fascinating <b>maze</b> <b>of</b> esoteric religious details, but also takes him {{below the surface of}} descriptive ethnography to view the fundamental principles operating at the very core of the Luiseno world view. Despite the impeccable quality of many previous investigations, a sophisticated theoretical analysis of the implicit structure and logic of the Luiseno belief system has been long overdue. Applegate's presentation is a welcome, much needed, addition to local California anthropology as well as a valuable contribution to more general investigations concerning the symbolic study of religion. Positive superlatives are in order...|$|R
