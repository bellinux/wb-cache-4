5|$|Apple {{released}} {{the third generation}} of MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen during WWDC 2012 and discontinued the 17-inch variant. The previous generation 13- and 15-inch unibody models continued to sell with updated processors. The third generation model was a quarter <b>thinner</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor and introduced the Retina Display with a much higher screen resolution. A 13-inch variant was released in October 2012.|$|E

5|$|A new, {{redesigned}} MacBook {{line was}} launched on March 9, 2015.

The iPad 2 includes front and back cameras that support the FaceTime videophone application, as well as a three-axis gyroscope. It retained the original's 10‑hour battery life and had a similar pricing scheme.|$|E

The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar); if it exists, {{it would have to be}} far <b>thinner</b> <b>than</b> that of Triton or Pluto. This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible surface pressure of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|While <b>thinner</b> <b>than</b> its {{predecessor}} – the iBook G4 – the MacBook is {{wider than the}} 12-inch model due to its widescreen display. In addition, the MacBook {{was one of the}} first (the first being the MacBook Pro) to adopt Apple's MagSafe power connector and it replaced the iBook's mini-VGA display port with a mini-DVI display port. The iBook's discrete graphics chip was initially replaced by an integrated Intel GMA solution, though the latest revisions of the MacBook were upgraded with the more powerful Nvidia GeForce 9400M and later the 320M.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovered}} beef {{material is}} extruded through long tubes that are <b>thinner</b> <b>than</b> a pencil, {{during which time}} at the Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) processing plant, the meat is exposed to gaseous ammonia. At Cargill Meat Solutions, citric acid is used to kill bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella.

The ammonia sharply increases the pH and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened cell walls, and the mechanical stress destroys the organisms altogether. The product is finely ground, compressed into pellets or blocks, flash frozen and then shipped for use as an additive.|$|E

5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} uses calcium {{to cause a}} depolarising signal {{transduction}} pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that {{are made up of}} thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be <b>thinner</b> <b>than</b> the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.|$|E
5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly <b>thinner</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 8th century, sceattas were the primary {{circulating}} coinage. These were small silver pennies, which often did not bear the name of either the moneyer or the king for whom they were produced. To contemporaries these were probably known as pennies, and are the coins referred to in the laws of Ine of Wessex. This light coinage (in contrast to the heavier coins minted later in Offa's reign) can probably be dated to the late 760s and early 770s. A second, medium-weight coinage can be identified before the early 790s. These new medium-weight coins were heavier, broader and <b>thinner</b> <b>than</b> the pennies they replaced, and were prompted by the contemporary Carolingian currency reforms. The new pennies almost invariably carried both Offa's name {{and the name of the}} moneyer from whose mint the coins came. The reform in the coinage appears to have extended beyond Offa's own mints: the kings of East Anglia, Kent and Wessex all produced coins of the new heavier weight in this period.|$|E

Although females at the Lebanese American University were more likely to snack between meals than their male counterparts, they have are more motivation to be <b>thin</b> <b>than</b> males due to sex differences in physical attraction.|$|R

5|$|Baryonyx had a {{rudimentary}} secondary palate, similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests {{the presence of}} a horny pad in the roof of the mouth. It had a sagittal crest above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasal bones, which was triangular, narrow, and sharp in front. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a horn core similar to those seen, for example, on Allosaurus. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent Meckelian groove. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much <b>thinner</b> <b>than</b> the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary had many foramina (openings), which were passages for nerves and blood vessels. It has been suggested that some of Baryonyx cranial bones had been misidentified (resulting in the occiput's too-deep reconstruction), and the skull was probably as low, long and narrow as that of the closely related Suchomimus.|$|E

In contrast, improving the forest environment by thinning seemed to reduce the tension and anxiety of the respondents. However, its effect on appreciation for the forest environment was confirmed as a trend that was probably due to a difference in the thickness (p[*]<[*] 0.1) attribute and was actually rated higher in the <b>thinned</b> <b>than</b> the unthinned condition (Table  5).|$|R
