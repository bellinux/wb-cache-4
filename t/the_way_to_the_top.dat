5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed {{by the sight of}} purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at {{the beginning and the end}} of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E

500|$|A key {{requirement}} that enables a geyser to erupt is a material called geyserite found in rocks nearby the geyser. [...] Geyserite—mostly silicon dioxide (SiO2), is dissolved from {{the rocks and}} gets deposited {{on the walls of}} the geyser's plumbing system and on the surface. The deposits make the channels carrying the water up to the surface pressure-tight. This allows the pressure to be carried all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> and not be leaked out into the loose gravel or soil that are normally under the geyser fields.|$|E

Meanwhile, Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) enlists Michael (Steve Carell) to report on the success of a small family-owned local paper competitor named Prince Paper, which works in an area where Dunder Mifflin has never successfully acquired clients. Michael brings Dwight along on his field work to help gather information. Michael visits business owner Roger Prince (Dan Desmond) posing as a potential customer named [...] "Michael Scarn", while Dwight enters and pretends to request a job. The kind and overly trusting Roger Prince gives Michael the company's customer list to use as a reference, and Michael and Dwight leave triumphantly.|$|E

[...] Fortunately for Rincewind, the Octavo spell in his head precludes him from actually dying, resulting in several comic encounters with Death. Meanwhile, a significant power struggle is occurring within the Unseen University.

[...] The power-hungry wizard Ymper Trymon (Tim Curry) plans to become Archchancellor. Trymon assassinates several faculty members but is thwarted by the incumbent Archchancellor, Galder Weatherwax, and his superior magical knowledge of the Octavo. Trymon knows {{there is no point in}} deposing the Archchancellor until he learns how to control the Octavo, which is growing increasingly restless as Rincewind (and the spell in his head) moves further away from Ankh-Morpork and into greater danger.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{vertical}} segregation describes men's {{domination of the}} highest status jobs in both traditionally male and traditionally female occupations.

Generally, the more occupational segregation present in a country, the less vertical segregation there is because women {{have a better chance of}} obtaining the highest positions in a given occupation as their share of employment in that particular occupation increases.|$|E

[...] Tunnel Mill was also the first mill in the region to use a series of elevators to move corn called the Evans and Ellicott's machinery, which made milling the work of two people instead of six, a great technological advantage over those who had to carry sacks of corn all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the mill so it could be milled step by step.

2500|$|Professor Lowe had a {{dream to}} make the {{beautiful}} Mountains overlooking the cities of Altadena / Pasadena accessible to average citizens. After much planning, many exploratory trips on horseback, he and Engineer Thomas McPherson located a series of routes that could be built upon {{with a series of}} rail cars to reach miles back into the forest and eventually all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Mount Wilson. [...] Financing the project himself, Professor Lowe proceeded to build his dream which eventually reached {{all the way to the}} base of Mount Lowe (named after Professor Lowe, previously known as Oak Mountain). At its peak, it was the top honeymoon destination in America. Beginning with the famous red car lines in California, Professor Lowe extended the line up through the rolling hills in Rubio Canyon where a small hotel was built at the base of new incline rail systems that would take a visitor up a mile along a ridge overlooking the LA Basin to the top of Echo Mountain.|$|E
2500|$|The top of Echo Mountain {{became a}} little city {{of its own}} with places to eat, order picnic lunches, shop at stores, dormitories for employees, power {{generating}} station to power Echo Mountain facilities. There was also a trolley repair building and pit, observation decks at various spots, trails that could be taken by hikers both {{up and down the}} mountain and into the Alpine regions, tennis courts, stables and a now little known zoo. The entire assembly of buildings were painted white and because of the view from far below, became known as [...] "The White City in the sky". The “opera box” great incline cars were also white and could be seen from afar ferrying up and down the hill. [...] On a ridge behind the Echo Mountain ridge was an observatory building with a working 16 inch telescope housed in a round domed building. The foundations can still be found at the site as well as the cement stand which is what the telescope was mounted upon. It was Professor Lowe's intention to build the rail system all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Mount Wilson along with additional hotels and facilities on the top of Mount Wilson. Later, much of the path of the large 100 inch telescope and observatory built on Mount Wilson was used to transport the delicate 100 inch mirror to the top of Mount Wilson.|$|E
