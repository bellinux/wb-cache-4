5|$|After the {{valuable}} coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe {{for the previous}} years in one sum. Historians estimate that the peasant families were required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> this amount, especially because they also had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E
5|$|Anya closes a {{restaurant}} where four men—northerners Archie, Malcolm and Kevin are entertaining southerner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> but Archie stops him. He reveals that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> as he has an inoperable brain tumour.|$|E

40|$|Wage posting {{models of}} job search {{typically}} assume that firms can commit <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> workers the posted wage. This paper investigates {{the consequences of}} relaxing this assumption. Under "downward" commitment firms can commit only <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> at least their advertised wage. We show that wage posting is always an equilibrium, although in special cases other equilibria can exist. Surprisingly, the wage posting equilibrium in our economy {{is identical to the}} equilibrium when firms can commit <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> exactly their posted wage. When firms cannot even commit <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> at least their advertised wage, equilibrium exhibits job auctions with wage dispersion which generally are not constrained efficient. directed search, wage posting, job auctions, commitment...|$|R

5|$|To {{secure the}} payment of the arrears, the bishop applied ecclesiastic penalties, placing whole villages under interdict in summer 1436. He also excommunicated the petty noblemen who had refused <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the tithe. However, most serfs {{resisted}} and their lords were unwilling to assist the bishop. At the bishop's request, the king ordered the voivode and the ispáns (or heads) of the counties to secure {{the collection of the}} tithe in early September. The king also decreed that all peasants who failed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the arrears within a month after their excommunication were <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> twelve golden florins as a penalty.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{previous}} taxation code, farmers were required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{a tenth of}} their seasonal agricultural output, 1 ducat and 4 groshe (two-ninths of a ducat) to their lords. The Ottoman system aimed towards revenue increase to support military expenses, thus new taxes were imposed and existing ones were altered. In addition to 1/10 of agrarian production Muslim convert families were required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> 22 akçe (~0.6 ducats) to the timar holders, while non-Muslim families had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> 25 akçe (~0.7 ducats). Both groups were subject to additional taxes including the avarız, an annual cash tax that affected households registered to the cadasters. Non-Muslims were also required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> 45 akçe (~1.3 ducats) {{as part of the}} jizya and had to supply regularly the Ottoman state with young recruits in accordance with the devşirme, which required the enlistment of young males in the Ottoman army and their conversion to Islam.|$|E

The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E
