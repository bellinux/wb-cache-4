Ultimately kites sounded the atmosphere to an altitude of 5 kilometers and provided Rotch with information concerning fundamental upper air patterns of wind, temperature, and humidity, as well as their relationship to surface weather patterns. In 1904, at the St. Louis World's Fair, Rotch initiated the use of sounding balloons in the U.S. These balloons carried recording instruments beyond even the highest clouds to a height of 17 kilometers. Rotch and Leon Teisserenc de Bort, discoverer of the stratosphere, made extensive upper-air kite measurements from ships in the tropical and sub-tropical North Atlantic. These permitted publication in 1911 of a chart of aerial routes, thus pointing the way to the feasibility of transatlantic air travel aided by air patterns.

50|$|Struve {{continued}} his father's work in several directions. In particular, they compiled famous Pulkovo catalogues of stellar coordinates, including several thousands double stars observed with a 15-inch refractor. Between 1816 and 1852, the observatory completed the famous survey <b>triangulation</b> <b>measurements</b> of the angular arc (named Struve Geodetic Arc). The measurements extended through over 2,820 km, from Hammerfest in Norway to the Staraya Nekrasovka village by the Black Sea, and aimed {{to establish the}} exact {{size and shape of}} the Earth. In 1851, while observing a solar eclipse, he came to a conclusion that solar corona and protuberances are physically connected with the Sun and are not an optical effect, as most of astronomers believed. Later in 1860 he suggested a close connection between solar protuberances and flares. Struve also observed satellites of Uranus (Ariel and Umbriel, in 1851) and of Neptune. He also measured the rings of Saturn and discovered (in parallel with other researchers) the dark inner ring of Saturn. In 1861, in his report to the Academy of Sciences, he had supported and developed the ideas of William Herschel that stars are formed from the diffuse matter. In 1872, Struve organized assistance with equipment to the newly opened observatory in Tashkent - a southern location offering clear skies for observations. In 1874, he prepared several expeditions to monitor the transit of Venus across the solar disk in eastern Asia, Caucasus, Persia and Egypt. In 1887, he sent several groups within Russia to observe the solar eclipse. In some of those expeditions, he took part personally. In 1885, a 30-inch refracting telescope was installed at Pulkovo, at the time the largest in the world (see great refractor).|$|E

40|$|Active {{deformation}} at {{the boundary}} between the Eurasia and Africa plates varies in style. The belt between the Alpine mountain range and the Mediterranean Sea, for example, differs markedly in its western and eastern parts. In the western part, around southeast France, the mountains are higher, but the seismicity lower, than in the eastern part, around northern Italy and Greece. Yet the inter-plate convergence rate of 6 mm=yr varies by less than 15 % between these two areas. To better understand the behaviour of this complex plate boundary, we use geodesy to map the spatial distribution of the deformation. In this paper, we focus on southeast France, a tectonic crossroads between three different domains (Alps, Ligurian Sea, and Massif Central) which exhibits a moderate level of seismicity. Here, the geodetic measurements imply low rates of horizontal deformation. By combining historical <b>triangulation</b> <b>measurements</b> mostly from 1947 to 1983 with Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys in 1993 and 1994, we estimate the rate of angular shear in triangular subnetworks covering the study area. The estimated strain rates in thirteen of nineteen triangles are smaller than their (1 standard deviation) uncertainties of about 0. 1 microradian=yr. This value bounds the rate of deformation for a 100 -km wide zone in Provence, between Marseilles to the south and the Ventoux massif to the north. The geodetic estimates place an upper bound of 1 to 2 mm=yr on the slip rates of two seismically active structures, the Durance fault and the Nı̂mes fault, assuming a fault zone 20 km wide in each case.

We present a new source model that simultaneously fits all the available geodetic measurements of the observed deformation. We integrate <b>triangulation</b> <b>measurements,</b> which have never been previously used in the source modelling of this sequence, with high-precision levelling that covers the epicentral area. We adopt a mixed linear/non-linear optimization scheme, in which we iteratively search for the best-fitting solution by performing several linear slip inversions while varying fault location using a grid search method. Our preferred solution consists of a shallow north-dipping fault plane with assumed azimuth of 282 ◦ and accommodating a reverse dextral slip of about 1 m. The estimated geodetic moment is 6. 6 × 1018 Nm (M w 6. 5), in agreement with seismological estimates. Yet, our preferred model shows that the geodetic solution {{is consistent with the}} activation of a single fault system during the entire sequence, the surface expression of which could be associated with the Buia blind thrust, supporting the hypothesis that the main activity of the Eastern Alps occurs close to the relief margin, as observed in other mountain belts. The retrieved slip pattern consists of a main coseismic patch located 3 – 5 km depth, in good agreement with the distribution of the main shocks. Additional slip is required in the shallower portions of the fault to reproduce the local uplift observed in the region characterized by Quaternary active folding. We tentatively interpret this patch as postseismic deformation (afterslip) occurring {{at the edge of the}} main coseismic patch. Finally, our rupture plane spatially correlates with the area of the locked fault determined from interseismic measurements, supporting the hypothesis that interseismic slip on the creeping dislocation causes strain to accumulate on the shallow (above ∼ 10 km depth) locked section. Assuming that all the long-term accommodation between Adria and Eurasia is seismically released, a time span of 500 – 700 years of strain-accumulating plate motion would result in a 1976 -like earthquake...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cassini ISS Enceladus images {{reveal a}} forest of jets of fine icy {{particles}} erupting from the moon?s south polar terrain (SPT) and feeding a giant plume that extends thousands of kilometers into space [1] eventually forming Saturn?s E ring. Cassini infrared spectrometer (CIRS) observations have also shown the SPT to be anomalously warm [2], and the comparison of high resolution images of the SPT with the highest resolution thermal measurements has shown a coincidence between the hottest measured temperatures in the SPT and the ?tiger stripe? fractures which straddle the region [1, 2]. The most plausible mechanism for heat production on the fractures is tidally driven frictional heating along faults due to cyclical shearing. The time-averaged absolute shear stress on each fracture segment can be calculated [3] and {{will be affected by}} location and orientation, and proportional to the local frictional heat production rate (assuming a constant coefficient of friction). Initial <b>triangulation</b> <b>measurements</b> of the jets seen in ISS images spanning 1. 3 years (from late 2005 to early 2007) and taken over a broad range of image scales (1 to 14 km/pixel), phase angles (148 ? to 178 ?), and viewing directions with respect to the surface revealed the source locations for the 8 most prominent jets [4]. All 8 fell, within 2 ? measurement uncertainties, on the fractures, and about half of these sources were found to be coincident, within uncertainties, with the CIRS hot spots initially reported in 2006. Moreover, ISS jet locations were used to successfully predict the discovery of additional hot spots [4]: eg, the prominent hot spot on Baghdad Sulcus near Jet #I. Results: We have taken new, more precise jet positional measurements in the 62 highest resolution images (down to 40 m/pixel spatial scale) taken from late 2005 to early 2011 at phase angles of 130 ? to 165 ?. We now find over 80 distinct, measureable jets. Nearly all of them fall on one of the four main fractures, most on Cairo and Baghdad; only a few fall off a main fracture and on a nearby branch. To within measurement errors, all 8 previously measured jets have been recovered, with the notable distinction that at very high spatial scale, most of these 8 resolve into multiple narrower jets. Some jet sources that were prominent earlier in the mission appear to be less so in more recent images, indicating some degree of time variability. The most robust jetting activity still appears to be correlated with the hottest locales on the fractures. We will use this correlation between jetting activity and thermal power to produce a proxy thermal map of the SPT that we will then compare with (i) the best available thermal maps of the south polar terrain obtained by CIRS over the last 6 years and (ii) a map of predicted shear-heating along the south polar fractures. ...|$|E
