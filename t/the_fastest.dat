Bamber recorded <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> time at 2:25.495, nearly half a second faster than Bernhard in the sister Porsche in second. Lotterer was third-fastest and had <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> time early in the session. Evans achieved the only time under the 2:34.500 mark in LMP2 with a lap of 2:34.370.

40|$|The {{signal from}} <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> {{component}} is usually considered preferable for quartz {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) dating, however its presence in a continuous wave (CW) OSL signal is often assumed, rather than verified. This paper presents an objective measure (termed <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> ratio) for testing the dominance of <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> component in <b>the</b> initial part of a quartz OSL signal. The ratio {{is based upon the}} photo ionisation cross-sections of <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> and medium components {{and the power of the}} measurement equipment used to record the OSL signal, and it compares parts of the OSL signal selected to represent <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> and medium components. The ability of <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> ratio to distinguish between samples whose CW-OSL signal is dominated by <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> and non-fast components is demonstrated by comparing <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> ratio with <b>the</b> contribution of <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> component calculated from curve deconvolution of measured OSL signals and from simulated data. The ratio offers a rapid method for screening a large number of OSL signals obtained for individual equivalent dose estimates, it can be calculated and applied as easily as other routine screening methods, and is transferrable between different aliquots, samples and measurement equipment.

40|$|Here {{we present}} an {{in-depth}} {{study of the}} behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm, an alternative pulsar searching technique to <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Fourier Transform. Weaknesses in <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Fourier Transform, including a susceptibility to red noise, leave it insensitive to pulsars with long rotational periods (P > 1 s). This sensitivity gap {{has the potential to}} bias our understanding of the period distribution of the pulsar population. <b>The</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm, a time-domain based pulsar searching technique, has the potential to overcome some of these biases. Modern distributed-computing frameworks now allow for the application of this algorithm to all-sky blind pulsar surveys for the first time. However, many aspects of the behaviour of this search technique remain poorly understood, including its responsiveness to variations in pulse shape and the presence of red noise. Using a custom CPU-based implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm, ffancy, we have conducted an in-depth study into the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm in both an ideal, white noise regime as well as a trial on observational data from the HTRU-S Low Latitude pulsar survey, including a comparison to the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Fourier Transform. We are able to both confirm and expand upon earlier studies that demonstrate the ability of <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm to outperform <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Fourier Transform under ideal white noise conditions, and demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity to long-period pulsars in real observational data through the use of <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm.
