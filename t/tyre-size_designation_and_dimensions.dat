40|$|The files herein contain {{results from}} the Bending Beam Rheometer. The tests were {{conducted}} in accordance to AASHTO TP 125 - 16 between November 2015 and November 2017 {{as part of a}} contract witht he Utah Department of Transportation. Each file represents the results from one beam. The file contains a header with the beam <b>designations,</b> <b>and</b> the beam <b>dimensions.</b> Four columns are contained in each file corresponding to measurements of time (s), force (mN), deflection (mm) and temperature (ºC). The time increased in increments of 0. 5 s from zero to 240 during the duration of loading. The load was controlled with a constant value of approximately 4413 ± 50 mN. The deflection of the beam at midspan was recorded using an LVDT to 0. 001 mm precision. The temperature is the temperature of the methanol bath used to condition the specimen during testing. It was measured with a thermocouple to 0. 01 ºC precision. Knowing the time and the deflection at midspan, beam theory can be used to determine the time-dependent creep modulus of the beam. The file naming convention is shown in the read me file...|$|R
