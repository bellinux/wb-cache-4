5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E

The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room.

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a test of}} the usefulness of behavioral methods to control occupational health problems by reducing workers' exposures to toxic chemicals. Four plastics workers were trained in nine behaviors selected for potential to reduce <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> to styrene, a common chemical with multiple toxic effects. Behavioral measures indicated that the workers quickly came to emit most of the behaviors. Measures of air samples indicated that large decreases in exposures to styrene accompanied the changes in behaviors for the three workers who had been selected because they most needed relief from <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> and because they had opportunities to control <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> by the ways they behaved...|$|R

5|$|The risk of {{decompression}} sickness after diving {{can be managed}} through effective decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon, though it remains to some degree unpredictable. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use decompression tables or dive computers to limit or monitor <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> and to control their ascent speed and decompression procedures. If DCS is contracted, it is usually treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber. If treated early, there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Gitera {{visited the}} king at his palace in Nyanza. Although Gitera had {{considerable}} {{respect for the}} monarchy, Rudahigwa treated him contemptuously; {{at one point he}} grabbed Gitera's throat, calling him and his followers inyangarwanda (haters of Rwanda). This humiliation prompted the MSM, APROSOMA and the pro-Hutu Catholic publications to take a firmer stance against the monarchy. Kinyamateka published a detailed report of Rudahigwa's treatment of Gitera, refuting his semi-divine image and accusing him of pro-Tutsi racism. The magazine also published stories citing the origin myths of the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, calling the king's policies inconsistent with them. The articles did not immediately challenge the king's authority over the Hutu peasants, but <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> of Rudahigwa's outburst led to a permanent schism between him, the Hutu counter-elite and Belgian authorities. In 1958 the Belgian colonial ministry tried to strip Rudahigwa of his power, reducing him to a figurehead, but his popularity with the regional chiefs and the Tutsi (who feared the growing Hutu movement) sparked a series of strikes and protests.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} a new {{and important}} cross-sectional determinant of hedge fund returns, <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> to sentiment risk, measured as beta of fund returns to fluctuations in senti-ment proxies. For a large sample of equity-oriented hedge funds, those whose sentiment beta ranks in the top decile subsequently outperform the bottom decile by 0. 67 % per month, after controlling for fund’s exposures to existing risk factors. Sentiment risk is also priced in stocks, but it explains only a small friction of the abnormal return spread between high versus low sentiment-beta hedge funds. High sentiment-beta funds tend to increase <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> to sentiment risk the most when doing so {{turns out to be}} profitable.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{a fourth}} CH-21 {{returned}} to Ap Bac {{to attempt to}} rescue the downed helicopter crews, and it too was heavily damaged by ground fire and forced {{to land on the}} muddy rice field. The Viet Cong had set a new record: the battle was the first time they had either destroyed or downed five helicopters within a few hours. At 13:30, Ba's M113 formation finally closed in on the downed helicopters {{on the west side of}} Ap Bac. The M113s approached the landing zone in single file instead of in formation, and they were immediately fired upon by Viet Cong inside the hamlet who were able to concentrate their fire on one target at a time. The South Vietnamese M113 gun crews were exposed from the waist up, so they were easy targets for snipers; by the end of the day, 14 South Vietnamese M113 crewmen had been killed due to <b>their</b> <b>exposure.</b> The two leading M113s were able to pull up beside the downed helicopters, but one driver was killed while driving with his head outside of the hatch, and Ba was knocked unconscious inside his carrier.|$|E

5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the entity needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has been moving him around to both protect him and contain the entity. Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the entity back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the phone that his brother and the entity cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the entity escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the entity from attacking another victim.|$|E

The true extent of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese {{casualties}} is largely unknown, {{but due to}} <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> to American firepower, the Communist forces undoubtedly suffered heavy losses. Nonetheless, the successful capture of Loc Ninh exceeded Communist expectations, as they had thought that the South Vietnamese would hold out longer. Lộc Ninh became {{the seat of the}} Provisional Revolutionary Government, the capital of Communist-occupied territories in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese, in their efforts to hold the district, lost more than three thousand soldiers killed or captured; only about fifty soldiers actually reached An Lộc. The Viet Cong also captured all seven American advisers and an embedded French journalist, Yves-Michel Dumond, in Lộc Ninh; they were taken to a prison camp in Kratié Province, Cambodia. Dumond was released on 14 July 1972. On 12 February 1973, the Americans were released in accordance with the Paris Peace Accord.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} higher-moment market risks in the {{cross-section}} of hedge fund returns to make several contributions. First, {{we show that}} hedge funds are substantially exposed to the three highermoment risks - volatility, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, mutual funds do not display meaningful dispersions in <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> to these risks. Further, funds of hedge funds when examined as a separate investment category do not show aggressive loading on higher-moment risks. Second, we provide evidence on economically significant premiums being embedded in hedge fund returns on account of <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> to higher-moment risks. Third, we uncover a set of higher-moment factors that are not strongly associated with factors in benchmark models that are currently used for evaluating hedge fund performance. Finally, the addition of these higher-moment factors to benchmark models can better explain the variation in hedge fund returns. Bearing on issues of practical consequence, we find that benchmark models augmented with higher-moment factors can considerably alter the hedge funds’ alpha-based rankings...|$|R
