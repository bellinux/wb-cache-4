5000|$|... "Shine a Light" [...] is an {{uplifting}} anthem, a [...] "piano ballad turned stadium epic." [...] It {{starts with}} [...] "chunky" [...] piano chords and features [...] "thundering" [...] drums, with Banners' falsetto vocals piercing through. Towards {{the end of}} the <b>track,</b> <b>lead</b> guitar escalates to [...] "full-on" [...] stadium rock. Lyrically, the song is about being lost at sea and searching for a [...] "beacon of light," [...] a [...] "glimmer of hope that brings you through the storm." [...] Banners said in interviews that [...] "it's a song to the person in your life that offers salvation while the storm is raging around you," [...] and that he was away from home and feeling lonely when he was writing the song.|$|E
5000|$|In short, Williams often {{lays down}} the initial {{patterns}} {{he has been}} playing out in his head (including everything from clavinet to handclaps), Hugo replays keys and adds tones such as [...] "angry saxophone noise" [...] (his description), and then Williams and Haley <b>track</b> <b>lead</b> vocals, harmonies, beatbox, and other percussive sounds. When needed, different drums are auditioned and triggered from disk, {{but there was no}} recording of additional live kits during the 2010 sessions. Finally, tone sculpting commences. [...] "It's a different process be more virtual, and it does make some things easier," [...] says Hugo. [...] "There are also songs on the album that are more straightforward in rhythm, more four-on-the-floor, so there wasn't as much time in drum editing." ...|$|E
5000|$|.....the most absurd {{situation}} I encountered when I was recording was {{the first}} time I worked with Iggy Pop. He wanted me to mix Raw Power, so he brought the 24-track tape in, and he put it up. He had the band on one <b>track,</b> <b>lead</b> guitar on another and him on a third. Out of 24 tracks there were just three tracks that were used. He said 'see {{what you can do with}} this'. I said, 'Jim, there's nothing to mix'. So we just pushed the vocal up and down a lot. On at least four or five songs that was the situation, including [...] "Search and Destroy." [...] That's got such a peculiar sound because all we did was occasionally bring the lead guitar up and take it out.|$|E

50|$|Kurt Erich Schulz {{was born}} on December 12, 1968 in Wenatchee, Washington to Erich and Judy Schulz. He is a former American {{football}} player in the National Football League. He played 10 years, eight for the Buffalo Bills, and two for the Detroit Lions. He played college football at Eastern Washington University. He began playing football in his junior year at Dwight D.

5000|$|As {{noted by}} MTV, the remix starts with moody synth keys before the {{familiar}} [...] "bed springs" [...] squeak, {{which appeared in}} the original <b>track,</b> <b>lead</b> to the infidelity-laced hook. Wale and Rihanna also trade rap bars: [...] "Bad girls ain't no good and the good girls ain't no fun," [...] he spits before she answers: [...] "And the bad girls want a real nigga." [...] Rihanna tweaks Tiara Thomas' original section into her own, adding a [...] "touch of her seductive island accent". [...] "Is it bad that, I never made love. I never did it, but I sure know how to fuck," [...] she sings tragically. Wale and Rihanna play off one another on the track and voice their inner turmoil involving the opposite sex. Rihanna sings (also later raps) in response to Wale’s laments about a difficult relationship and praises of hot sex on the [...] "bed, floor, couch, more." [...] It uses a whole new instrumental track that refers to Rihanna's song [...] "Loveeeeeee Song". Rihanna raps with Wale with similar lyrics to the original song.|$|E
5000|$|The Family That Plays Together, {{the second}} of four albums {{released}} by the original Spirit lineup, was released on Ode Records in December 1968. More than its predecessor, Spirit, their self-titled and surreal debut, The Family That Plays Together displays the band's ability to play beyond the genre of psychedelic rock. Tracks such as [...] "It Shall Be" [...] and [...] "Silky Sam" [...] demonstrate {{the ease with which}} the ensemble can incorporate jazz into their idiosyncratic form of rock, while [...] "Jewish" [...] and [...] "Aren't You Glad" [...] show the band's competence in exploiting both world music and jam rock. [...] "Poor Richard," [...] "Jewish," [...] and [...] "All the Same" [...] feature double <b>track</b> <b>lead</b> breaks by guitarist Randy California. The album's title was inspired by the stepson-stepfather relationship between guitarist Randy California and percussionist Ed Cassidy. It alludes to the slogan [...] "The family that prays together stays together", created by ad-writer Al Scalpone for the Family Rosary Crusade and popular in American and British rhetoric beginning in the 1940s.|$|E
