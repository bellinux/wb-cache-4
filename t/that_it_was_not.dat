In the House of Commons Sir William Davidson called for a formal protest, because Irish Oak had not warned the convoy, and Douglas Lloyd Savory called for an end of coal exports to Ireland.|$|E

5|$|While the Lithuanian side {{considered}} {{the agreement to}} be an enforceable political treaty, the Polish side considered {{it to be a}} minor military agreement, later superseded by a ceasefire agreement between Lithuania and Å»eligowski reached on November 29. American historian Alfred Erich Senn has argued <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a regular political treaty, as it did not require ratification, but the presence of political representatives of both sides indicated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a mere military agreement. Poland and Lithuania also disagreed about the agreement's relation to the Vilnius question, which was not explicitly addressed in the treaty. The Lithuanian side considered that the agreement assigned Vilnius to Lithuania, while the Polish side argued that it did not concern Vilnius or other territorial claims. Senn has described the agreement as tacitly leaving Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E

To say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> or of what <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> is false, while to say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and of what <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>is</b> true; so that he who says of anything <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> or <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> will say either what is true or what is false Aristotle ...|$|R

5|$|A mobile racing game {{based on}} a mini game from VII, Final Fantasy VII G-Bike, was {{released}} on October 30, 2014, for iOS and Android. A western release for the title was planned.

While related to VII and the Compilation due to its nature, the developers confirmed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> related to nor affected the Compilation itself. Due to difficulties delivering continual satisfactory service, G-Bike was shut down in 2015 without seeing a Western release.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W.

He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{admits that}} there may be death metal {{influences}} in the vocals, but says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a conscious design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. He claims that there are no black metal influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E
