5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle <b>train</b> <b>on</b> track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The <b>train</b> <b>on</b> Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, NSB test-ran an X2 <b>train</b> <b>on</b> the Randsfjord Line, {{and between}} 29 September and 21 December 1996, ran a unit in regular {{service on the}} Sørland Line. On 23 February 1995, NSB signed a {{contract}} to purchase 16 Class 71 trains for use on the Airport Express <b>Train</b> <b>on</b> the Gardermoen Line. The contract included two options, one for 16 trains for intercity traffic and one for 6 trains for regional traffic. The reason for using {{the same type of}} train as the Airport Express Train, was to reduce maintenance and operation costs through having a unified fleet. The options would only modify the trains slightly; they were primarily designed for the airport service and any optimization for intercity and tilting technology was secondary in the design process. The first option was taken out on 5 March 1997.|$|E

5|$|On {{very rare}} occasions, a {{combination}} of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind can stall a <b>train</b> <b>on</b> the top of the tower. When this happens, a mechanic takes the elevator to the top and pushes the train down the hill.|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} usage of fully {{convolutional}} neural network for segmentation of bones in CT scans.

5|$|The {{conversion}} {{failed to}} make the railroad pay, and the company went into receivership again on August 8, 1918.

Negotiations with the bondholders to resume service were not successful, and the rails were removed in 1921.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Union forces at Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Lincoln summoned McClellan from western Virginia, where McClellan had given the North the only engagements bearing a semblance of victory.

5|$|An unusually {{heavy rain}} storm {{affected}} a GO <b>train</b> <b>on</b> July 8, 2013, when a record-breaking 123mm fell {{over a few}} hours. A Richmond Hill-bound GO train encountered flood waters in the Don Valley and stopped. As the crew worked to change {{the direction of the}} train, flood waters continued to rise and submerged the tracks behind the train. The train itself began to flood, and approximately 1,400 passengers had to be rescued by boat.|$|E
5|$|By around 1900, {{there were}} {{between five and}} seven {{services}} operating daily along the Cheddar Valley Line, with a mixed mail <b>train</b> <b>on</b> Sundays. Traffic was to increase from 1901 {{with the opening of}} the Wrington Vale Light Railway. Although this line joined the Cheddar Valley Line at , most services continued to Yatton. In 1901 there were four passenger trains per day and one goods train, which increased to five passenger trains per day by 1903. The line was known for the transport of mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} decade after {{nationalisation}} services to Chesham continued much as before, although the unification of the mainline companies meant {{a wider variety of}} locomotives operating services on the branch. For two weeks from 13 October 1952 LT experimented with a three-car lightweight diesel <b>train</b> <b>on</b> the route, but the train used had difficulty negotiating the line's sharp bends and the branch reverted to steam operations.|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{the trained}} group {{comprised}} of 30 {{participants who were}} segmented in two groups: one, of 15 persons received <b>training</b> <b>on</b> bone crafting, and the remainder (mainly women) received <b>training</b> <b>on</b> soap making. Because of limited resources, <b>training</b> <b>on</b> horn crafting was not offered. 4 These trainings facilitated the establishment of businesses in bone crafting and soap processing.|$|R

5|$|Meek's Cutoff {{was shot}} in Burns, Oregon and reunited Williams with Reichardt.

The route made all stops between Second Avenue in Manhattan and Queens Plaza in Queens via the IND Sixth Avenue Line and the IND Queens Boulevard Line. In 2011, the train operated on Saturdays instead of Sundays.|$|E

5|$|The Duke and Jones {{intended}} to run {{no more than}} one <b>train</b> <b>on</b> each section of the line so the line was not built with passing loops or signalling. When more than one horse-drawn train or locomotive was in operation, the Tramway operated a token system using colour-coded staffs to ensure only one train could be on a section. Drivers between Quainton Road and Wotton carried a blue staff, those on west of Wotton and the Kingswood siding a red staff.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced crews to fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them.
