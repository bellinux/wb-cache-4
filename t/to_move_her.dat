5|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, Soviet troops {{occupied}} the easternmost part of Denmark, and the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop of conspiracy against the Soviet government. The surviving Romanovs in Denmark grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt, and Olga decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada.|$|E
5|$|The only warship {{reported}} wrecked on the Doom Bar was , a 12-gun schooner. The Whiting {{was originally}} a cargo ship named Arrow, which travelled from the United States to France; she {{was captured by}} the Royal Navy on 8 May 1812 and renamed. On 15 September 1816, she ran aground on the Doom Bar as the tide was ebbing and the wind was from an unfavourable direction offering little assistance. According to court-martial transcripts, an attempt <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> was made at the next high tide, but she was taking on water and {{it was impossible to}} save her.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940, neutral Denmark was {{invaded by}} Nazi Germany and was {{occupied}} {{for the rest}} of World War II. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served as officers in the Danish Army, they were interned as prisoners of war, but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months. Other Russian émigrés, keen to fight against the Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism. After the surrender of Germany in 1945, the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing the Grand Duchess of conspiracy against the Soviet authorities. With the end of the war, Soviet troops occupied the easternmost part of Denmark, and Olga grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt. She decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada, a decision with which Kulikovsky complied.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking {{has caused}} Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> to a {{different}} desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and {{the target of the}} prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his desk and blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E

25|$|Many years later, {{the people}} {{suffered}} great losses {{due to the}} inundations of the Chico River. Their deeply rooted devotion to Our Lady prompted them <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> sanctuary near the riverbank {{in the hope that}} she would spare them from the scourges of the yearly inundations. As a result, the people built a more spacious church of more durable materials on a hill about a mile from the parish church of Sto. Domingo. The present sanctuary was built by Rev. Fr. Diego Pinero and later restored by Fr. José Gurumeta in 1875.|$|E

25|$|In December 1921, {{with the}} help of an uncle and with a loan from two parents of girls at the school, Willis bought The Cloisters, Cold Ash, Berkshire, with sixty acres, for £11,976. The Cloisters had been {{designed}} by the architect James MacLaren Ross and was built during the First World War for a religious order called 'The School of Silence', but the order had been unable to keep up the payments on its mortgage. Willis was able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> school there just four months after the purchase, in April 1922. For the Summer term of 1922, the school had eighty-three girls, and by 1925 there were 118. Downe House had arrived as a leading girls' school.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{formidable}} Danish burhs, the local ruler combined his army with that of Northampton and raided the West Saxon territories of Bedfordshire and Oxfordshire in 913, and defied King Edward the Elder to siege the West Saxon burh of Hertford. This provoked Aethelflaed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> armies up to the fringes of Danish occupied territory around Leicester in 914 and to construct a burh at Warwick. In July 917, {{as part of a}} three-pronged assault, the combined forces of Leicester and Northampton, and possibly Derby, laid siege to the Mercian burh at Towcester. Isolated by the loss of Derby and Northampton later that year, the Mercian army returned in early 918 to ravage the local countryside, and as a result the fortress surrendered peacefully to Aethelflaed's troops.|$|E
25|$|Kate now {{has three}} {{suspects}} for Janet's death: Clarkville, Moon, and Luellen May (a fellow professor who found Janet passed {{out in the}} bathtub at a party). After a visit from Janet's brother and a tour of Janet's old apartment, Kate begins to put some ideas together about what really happened to Janet. Kate then visits with Clarkville once more to discuss his finding of Janet's body. In the meeting, Clarkville explains that the last time anyone had seen Janet alive was in the department meeting. During the meeting, Janet had become hysterical about an issue that {{caused a lot of}} tension in the room. Kate then gets Clarkville to admit to moving Janet's body to the men's room for her to be 'discovered'. Clarkville explains that he had originally found Janet in the chairman's office dead and decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> to a restroom (the men's room was the closest) and reported finding her there. Kate then is granted access to Janet's office at the university and finds a poem that she believes is the biggest clue to Janet's death.|$|E

25|$|Upon Jutta's {{death in}} 1136, Hildegard was {{unanimously}} elected as magistra {{of the community}} by her fellow nuns. Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be Prioress, which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence {{for herself and her}} nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to Rupertsberg. This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of Archbishop Henry I of Mainz. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> nuns to Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery. Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where Volmar served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at Eibingen.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} her 77th year, Coretta began {{experiencing}} health problems. Her husband's former secretary, Dora McDonald, assisted her part-time in this period. Hospitalized in April 2005, a {{month after}} speaking in Selma at the 40th anniversary of the Selma Voting Rights Movement, she was diagnosed with a heart condition and was discharged on her 78th and final birthday. Later, she suffered several small strokes. On August 16, 2005, she was hospitalized after suffering a stroke and a mild heart attack. Initially, she was unable to speak or move her right side. King's daughter Bernice reported that she had been able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> leg on Sunday, August 21 while her other daughter and oldest child Yolanda asserted that the family expected her to fully recover. She was released from Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta on September 22, 2005, after regaining some of her speech and continued physiotherapy at home. Due to continuing health problems, Mrs. King cancelled a number of speaking and traveling engagements throughout the remainder of 2005. On January 14, 2006, Coretta made her last public appearance in Atlanta at a dinner honoring her husband's memory. On January 26, 2006, King checked into a rehabilitation center in Rosarito Beach, Mexico under a different name. Doctors did not learn her real identity until her medical records arrived the next day, and did not begin treatment due to her condition.|$|E
25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>her</b> right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E

Mount Elizabeth is a multi-organ transplant specialty hospital. Some doctors criticised the decision as political, questioning the need to transfer an intensive care unit (ICU) patient for organ transplants that were not scheduled for weeks or even months later. Government sources indicate that the Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit, was personally behind the decision. Hours earlier, Union Minister P. Chidambaram had stated that Jyoti was not in a condition to be moved.
