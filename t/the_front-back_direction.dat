40|$|Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} a Scheimpflug-based imaging procedure for investigating the depth- and time-dependent strain {{response of the}} human cornea to inflation testing of whole eye globes. Methods: Six specimens, three of which with intact corneal epithelium, were mounted in a customized apparatus within a humidity and temperature-monitored wet chamber. Each specimen was subjected to two mechanical tests {{in order to measure}} corneal strain resulting from application of cyclic (cyclic regimen) and constant (creep regimen) stress by changing the intra-ocular pressure (IOP) within physiological ranges (18 – 42 mmHg). Corneal shape changes were analyzed as a function of IOP and both corneal stress-strain curves and creep curves were generated. Results: The procedure was highly accurate and repeatable. Upon cyclic stress application, a biomechanical corneal elasticity gradient was found in <b>the</b> <b>front-back</b> <b>direction.</b> The average Young’s modulus of the anterior cornea ranged between 2. 2860. 87 MPa and 3. 3060. 90 MPa in specimens with and without intact epithelium (P = 0. 05) respectively. The Young’s modulus of the posterior cornea was on average 0. 2160. 09 MPa and 0. 1760. 06 MPa (P. 0. 05) respectively. The time-dependent strain response of the cornea to creep testing was quantified by fitting data to a modified Zener model for extracting both the relaxation time and compliance function. Conclusion: Cyclic and creep mechanical tests are valuable for investigating the strain response of the intact human corne...|$|E
40|$|The directionally {{sensitive}} acoustics of the pinnae enable {{humans to}} perceive <b>the</b> up-down and <b>front-back</b> <b>direction</b> of sound. This mechanism complements another, independent mechanism that derives sound-source azimuth from interaural difference cues. The pinnae effectively add direction-dependent spectral notches and peaks to the incoming sound, {{and it has}} been shown that such features are used to code sound direction in the median plane. However, it is still unclear which of the pinna-induced features play a role in sound localization. The present study presents a method for the reconstruction of the spatially relevant features in the spectral domain. Broadband sounds with random spectral shapes were presented in rapid succession as subjects made saccadic eye movements toward the perceived stimulus locations. The analysis, which is based on Bayesian statistics, indicates that specific spectral features could be associated with perceived spatial locations. Spectral features that were determined by this psychophysical method resemble the main characteristics of the pinna transfer functions obtained from acoustic measurements in the ear canal. Despite current experimental limitations, the approach may prove useful in the study of perceptually relevant spectral cues underlying human sound localization...|$|R
40|$|Listeners use {{monaural}} spectral cues {{to localize}} sound sources in sagittal planes (along <b>the</b> up-down and <b>front-back</b> <b>directions).</b> How {{sensorineural hearing loss}} affects the salience of monaural spectral cues is unclear. To simulate the effects of outer-hair-cell (OHC) dysfunction and the contribution of different auditory-nerve fiber types on localization performance, we incorporated a nonlinear model of the auditory periphery into a model of sagittal-plane sound localization for normal-hearing listeners. The localization model was first evaluated {{in its ability to}} predict the effects of spectral cue modifications for normal-hearing listeners. Then, we used it to simulate various degrees of OHC dysfunction applied to different types of auditory-nerve fibers. Predicted localization performance was hardly affected by mild OHC dysfunction but was strongly degraded in conditions involving severe and complete OHC dysfunction. These predictions resemble the usually observed degradation in localization performance induced by sensorineural hearing loss. Predicted localization performance was best when preserving fibers with medium spontaneous rates, which is particularly important in view of noise-induced hearing loss associated with degeneration of this fiber type. On average across listeners, predicted localization performance was strongly related to level discrimination sensitivity of auditory-nerve fibers, indicating an essential role of this coding property for localization accuracy in sagittal planes...|$|R

The Samoan term for space is vā, defined as the interval or “between-ness” of entities in physical, social, spiritual, ideational and temporal landscapes. I highlight how perceptions of, and actions on, the vā in Samoa are the modus operandi by which relationships, boundaries and balances in Samoa are negotiated and determined, and how <b>the</b> <b>front-back</b> axis informs binary, mutually complementary and inter-dependent sets of socio-spatial relationships in that system.

Informed by both Samoan linguistic and ethnographic evidence and the Whorfian theory of linguistic relativity, the article demonstrates how front–back is primary to a Samoan radial spatial schema, a view that reconfigures Bradd Shore’s positing of a separate, sometimes conflicting, Samoan “front–back binary linear” model (Shore 1983, 1996, 2014) ...|$|R

Design: Commercial hearing aids with a microphone placed in-the-ear-canal (ITC), behind-the-ear (BTE), and in-the-pinna (ITP) were evaluated in the frontal and full horizontal plane, and in the frontal vertical plane. Study Sample: A group of 13 hearing-impaired subjects evaluated the hearing aids. Nine normal-hearing listeners were used as a reference group. Results and Conclusions: Differences in sound localization in <b>the</b> <b>front-back</b> dimension were found for different hearing aids. A large inter-subject variability was found during <b>the</b> <b>front-back</b> and elevation experiments. With ITP or ITC microphones, almost all natural spectral information was preserved. One of the BTE hearing aids, which is equipped with a directional microphone configuration, generated a sufficient amount of spectral cues to allow front-back discrimination.

Hearing-impaired subjects reached the same performance with and without the different hearing aids. In the unaided condition, a frequency-specific audibility correction was applied.

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{problem for}} reproductions of binaural recordings and simulations using HRTFs {{other than those}} of the actual listener is decreased localization performance and increased front-back confusion. Previous studies have indicated that moving the sound source can reduce these problems. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure how a unidirectional sound source movement along an orbit in the horizontal plane (achieved by reproducing sounds with a loudspeaker and turning a recording artificial head with a velocity of 5 °/s) affects front-back confusion and localization errors. Two factors were studied: 1. Movement (static or rotation). 2. Acoustic environment (anechoic or reverberant). Male speech and recurring 840 Hz sinusoidal tones with a Gaussian envelope were used as stimuli. Listening tests showed that <b>the</b> <b>front-back</b> confusion rate and the rate of incorrectly perceiving that the sound is coming straight from the side were significantly lower (95 % confidence level) in the reverberant condition compared to the anechoic condition. <b>The</b> <b>front-back</b> confusion rate was lower for the moving auditory scene compared to the static auditory scene, both in anechoic and reverberant conditions, but these differences were not significant. To conclude, there is reason to add room reflections to 3 D sound synthesis in order to enhance localization performance in auditory displays. The effect of adding movements is small in comparison to the effect of adding reflections. Godkänd; 2013; 20131212 (arny...|$|R

40|$|A key {{question}} motivating research in perception and attention {{is how the}} brain represents visual information. One aspect of this representation is the reference frame with respect to which visual features are encoded. The reference frame specifies the origin of coordinate axes, the up-down, left-right, and <b>front-back</b> <b>directions,</b> and <b>the</b> relative scale of each axis. Reference frames can be prescribed by the viewer’s gaze, head, or trunk, by intrinsic characteristics of an object, or by the environment. To determine the frames of reference involved in human vision and attention, neurological patients with unilateral neglect have been extensively studied. Neglect patients often fail to orient toward, explore, and respond to stimuli on the left. The interesting question is: with respect to what frame of reference is neglect of the left manifested? When a neglect patient shows a deficit in attentional allocation that depends not merely on the location of an object {{with respect to the}} viewer but on the extent, shape, or movement of the object itself, the inference is often made that attentional allocation must be operating in an object-based frame of reference. Via simulations of an existing connectionist model of spatial attention, we argue that this inference is not logically necessary: object-based attentional effects can be obtained without object-based frames of reference. The model, called the AM, has previously accounted for a variety of attentional effects in normals (Mozer...|$|R
