500|$|Photovoltaic systems use no fuel, and modules {{typically}} last 25 to 40 years. Thus, {{capital costs}} make {{up most of}} the cost of solar power.

[...] Also, Renewable portfolio standards impose a government mandate [...] that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs.

2500|$|Tamil Nadu has {{the third}} largest {{installed}} power generation capacity in the country. The Kalpakkam Nuclear Power Plant, Ennore Thermal Plant, Neyveli Lignite Power Plant, many hydroelectric plants including Mettur Dam, hundreds of windmills and the Narimanam Natural Gas Plants are major sources of Tamil Nadu's electricity. Tamil Nadu generates {{a significant proportion of}} its power needs from renewable sources with wind power installed capacity at over 7154 MW, accounting for 38 per cent of total installed wind power in India [...] It is presently adding the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant to its energy grid, which on completion would be the largest atomic power plant in the country with 2000MW installed capacity. The total installed capacity of electricity in the State by January 2014 was 20,716 MW. Tamil Nadu ranks first nationwide in diesel-based <b>thermal</b> <b>electricity</b> generation with a national market share of over 34 per cent. From a power surplus state in 2005–06, Tamil Nadu has become a state facing severe power shortage over the recent years due to lack of new power generation projects and delay in the commercial power generation at Kudankulam Atomic Power Project. The Tuticorin Thermal Power Station has five 210 megawatt generators. The first generator was commissioned in July 1979. The thermal power plants under construction include the coal-based 1000 MW NLC TNEB Power Plant. From the current 17MW installed Solar power, Tamil Nadu government's new policy aims to increase the installed capacity to 3000MW by 2016.|$|E

I should advise young geologists {{to read what}} Sir Henry de la Beche has said on it in his admirable [...] "Geological Observer," [...] pp. 706-725. He will find there, too, some remarks on that equally mysterious {{phenomena}} of jointing, which you may see in almost all the older rocks; it is common in limestones. All we can say is, that some force has gone on, or may be even now going on, in the more ancient rocks, {{which is similar to}} that which produces single crystals; and similar, too, to that which produced the jointed crystals of basalt, i.e. lava, at the Giant's Causeway, in Ireland, and Staffa, in the Hebrides. Two philosophers--Mr. Robert Were Fox and Mr. Robert Hunt--are of opinion that the force which has determined the cleavage of slates may be that of the electric currents, which (as is well known) run through the crust of the earth. Mr. Sharpe, I believe, attributes the cleavage to the mere mechanical pressure of enormous weights of rock, especially where crushed by earthquakes. Professor Rogers, again, points out that as these slates may have been highly heated, <b>thermal</b> <b>electricity</b> (i.e. electricity brought out by heat) may have acted on them.|$|E

50|$|Conversion {{efficiency}} varies; for <b>thermal</b> energy <b>electricity</b> {{and mechanical}} energy production {{is limited by}} Carnot's theorem, and generates a lot of waste heat. Other non thermal conversions can be more efficient, for example wind turbines do not capture all the wind energy, but generate very little waste heat, since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow frequency ranges, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the exergy of a system.|$|R
