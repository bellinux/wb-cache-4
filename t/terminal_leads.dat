40|$|A {{new method}} was {{proposed}} to estimate residual inductance {{inherent in a}} specimen and its <b>terminal</b> <b>leads</b> in dielectric measurements. For a specimen specified by a capacitance and a resistance which are independent of measuring frequency, the product of capacitance and resistance as the readings of an a. c. bridge is to show a linear relation to the squared frequency. The residual in-ductance can be calculated from the slope and the intercept of the linear relation. By the applica-tion of the method to parallel networks of a capacitor and a resistor with varied length of the <b>terminal</b> <b>leads,</b> reasonable results are obtained concerning the impedance per unit length of the leads. The method is also applied to a parallel plate cell system filled with salt solutions. The inductance evaluated for the cell system is seen to be varied with the conductance of the salt solution used. Com-parison of the method is made with the Schwan method which was used to estimate the residual inductance. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} secrecy {{connectivity}} probability for wireless networks with transmit antenna selection {{in the presence}} of randomly located eavesdroppers. Firstly, we propose an antenna selection scheme for use at the base station with a half-duplex receiver to enhance secrecy connectivity performance. Then in order to further improve the secrecy connectivity, a full-duplex (FD) receiver, which broadcasts a jamming signal while receiving the downlink message, is considered in this work. The probabilities of secrecy connectivity are given in the closed form and integral form for half-duplex and full-duplex receivers, respectively. The derived analytical results are verified by Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting analysis shows that the application of antenna selection at the transmitting base station and full-duplex communication at the receiving <b>terminal</b> <b>leads</b> to significant improvements in secrecy connectivit...|$|E

40|$|Noncoded {{amino acids}} such as isobutyric acid {{have been used}} {{extensively}} {{in the process of}} drug design and protein engineering. This article focuses on a noncoded amino acid where the oxygen in the peptide unit is replaced with a sp sulfur. It was hypothesized that the conformational space as well as the conformational preferences of thiopeptides will be more restricted and altered by the bulkier atom with different electrostatic properties. In vacuo conformational minima as well as associated energies for the thio-substituted alanine dipeptides were calculated at the ab initio HF/ 6 - 31 G* level. When the bulkier sulfur atom acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor in the C conformation or in the C and C conformations, the hydrogen bond lengths are much longer than that of normal peptides. Consequently, the φ, ψ dihedral angles of the C, C, and C conformations change to accommodate the longer hydrogen bonds. The thiopeptide group is a poorer hydrogen bond acceptor and a better hydrogen bond donor than the normal peptide group. Therefore, thio-substitution at the amino <b>terminal</b> <b>leads</b> to disfavoring of the C conformations relative to the C conformations and thio-substitution at the carboxyl <b>terminal</b> <b>leads</b> to favoring of the C conformations relative to the C conformation. To simulate the conformations in solution, (φ, ψ) conformational energy maps were calculated for the glycine and alanine dipeptides at various dielectric constants using the CFF 91 force field with our previously derived parameters for the thioamide group. The results show that thio-substitution does restrict the conformations available to amino acids residues in peptides. Thio substitution at the amino terminal introduces unfavorable interactions near φ = - 120 and 120, where there are increased overlaps between S···H, and S···C atoms, respectively. Thio substitution at the carboxyl terminal restricts the conformations near ψ = 60, - 60, and 180, which correspond with increase overlaps between S···C, S···H′ and S···N atoms, respectively. The effects of dithio substitutions of either the alanine or the glycine dipeptides are similar to the combined effects of the two single thio substitutions...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method to analyze the relative contributions of pre- and postsynaptic actions of a particular gene product in neurons in culture and potentially in slices using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. A recombinant virus directed the expression of both a GFP reporter protein and TrkB. T 1, a C-terminal truncated dominant negative TrkB neurotrophin receptor. When expressed in the presynaptic cell at synapses between embryonic hippocampal neurons in culture, the dominant negative TrkB. T 1 inhibited two forms of synaptic potentiation induced by the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) : (i) greater evoked synaptic transmission and (ii) higher frequency of spontaneous miniature synaptic currents. These inhibition effects are not seen if the transgene is expressed only in the postsynaptic cell.

40|$|Conventional {{electrophysiological}} {{techniques were}} used to {{study the effects of}} Ba on the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from frog motor nerve terminals. Equimolar substitution of Ba for Ca eliminated end-plate potentials (e. p. ps) without a corresponding decline in the amplitude of the nerve terminal action potential. Miniature end-plate potentials (m. e. p. ps) were readily detectable in Ba solutions despite a depolarized muscle membrane. Studies on the e. p. p. in curarized preparations bathed with different concentrations of Ca and Ba suggest that Ba may compete with Ca in the process by which depolarization of the nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>leads</b> to the release of ACh. Repetitive nerve stimulation at 1 Hz in Ba solutions caused 5 - 20 fold increases in m. e. p. p. frequencies (7 experiments). Stimulation of Ba-bathed preparations at 10 Hz elevated m. e. p. p. frequencies to very high levels that could not be measured accurately ('' 100 /s). It is suggested that the asynchronous discharge of m. e. p. ps produced by repetitive nerve stimulation is the electrophysiological correlate of the evoked ACh outflow in Ba solutions detected previously by bioassay of ther perfusion fluid...|$|E

If both plane <b>terminal</b> <b>lead</b> angles are free, then this guidance will generate the desired <b>terminal</b> <b>lead</b> angles suc h that control effort can be minimized.

For distance, e. g. for every kilometer a location is closer to a ferry <b>terminal</b> <b>leads</b> to an expected price increase of four percent on average, across the study area. The GWR local model also had good fit and suggests property value gains around specific terminals.

40|$|The neuromuscular {{junction}} {{is the target}} of a variety of autoimmune, neurotoxic and genetic disorders, most of which result in muscle weakness. Most of the diseases, and many neurotoxins, target the ion channels that are essential for neuromuscular transmission. Myasthenia gravis is an acquired autoimmune disease caused in the majority of patients by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel. The antibodies lead to loss of acetylcholine receptor, reduced efficiency of neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness and fatigue. Placental transfer of these antibodies in women with myasthenia can cause fetal or neonatal weakness and occasionally severe deformities. Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome and acquired neuromyotonia are caused by antibodies to voltage-gated calcium or potassium channels, respectively. In the rare acquired neuromyotonia, reduced repolarization of the nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>leads</b> to spontaneous and repetitive muscle activity. In each of these disorders, the antibodies are detected by immunoprecipitation of the relevant ion channel labelled with radioactive neurotoxins. Genetic disorders of neuromuscular transmission are due mainly to mutations in the genes for the acetylcholine receptor. These conditions show recessive or dominant inheritance and result in either loss of receptors or altered kinetics of acetylcholine receptor channel properties. Study of these conditions has greatly increased our understanding of synaptic function and of disease aetiology...|$|E
