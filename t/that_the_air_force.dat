5|$|July 1940to October 1943: A {{total ban}} on air operations, and {{a release of}} interned German {{aircraft}} and pilots, resulting from the encirclement of Swiss territory by the Axis, {{the implementation of the}} Réduit strategy, and recognition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> would be overwhelmed by the Germans in a sustained campaign.|$|E
5|$|For the U.S. program {{there were}} {{teething}} troubles. There {{was a lack}} of sufficient numbers of sensor strings and controlling the number of aircraft available for the missions proved problematic. These difficulties could be remedied. Commando Hunt II (1 May through 31 October 1969), however, was thrown off track by phenomena <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> could do absolutely nothing about. The first wet season offensive was hampered by atrocious weather, especially heavy rain (48inches of rain in July alone).|$|E
5|$|It {{was hoped}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, {{it was left}} {{outdoors}} on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian Institution, became concerned about the Enola Gays condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> 1979 <b>air</b> <b>force</b> {{had only}} {{transport}} and liaison aircraft. In 1987, the Library of Congress Country Study said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force's</b> official name, Ivoirian Air Transport and Liaison Group (Groupement Aérien de Transport et de Liaison—GATL), 'reflects an original mission {{focused more on}} logistics and transport rather than a combat force.' ...|$|R

5|$|The USAF F-111A and Navy F-111B {{variants}} {{used the}} same airframe structural components and TF30-P-1 turbofan engines. They featured side-by-side crew seating in an escape capsule, {{as required by the}} Navy. Because of conflict between the Air Force and Navy over whose requirements had precedence, McNamara intervened in 1961, declaring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> desires would override suggestions by the Navy. The F-111A variant first flew on 21 December 1964 from Carswell AFB, Texas. It was followed by the F-111B, which first flew on 18 May 1965.|$|E
5|$|All {{military}} {{aircraft in the}} DRC are operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> has an estimated strength of 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training Wing and Logistical Wing and has a strength of five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kaminia and consists of Pursuit and Attack Wing and Tactical Transport Wing and has a strength of four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment. Jane's states that National Air Force of Angola fighter aircraft would {{be made available to}} defend Kinshasa if it came under attack.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} Operation Linebacker in 1972 that the problem became acute enough for the Air Force to finally take note. In the three months {{following}} the start of Linebacker in May 1972, the U.S. lost 48 aircraft, 21 to VNAF MiGs and 27 to improved ground defenses. In the same period, only 31 MiGs were shot down by U.S. aircraft and things worsened in the summer with 13 U.S. aircraft lost to MiGs and only 11 MiGs shot down. General John Vogt, commander of the Seventh Air Force, reported to the AF Chief of Staff that they were losing the air war. One immediate outcome was Operation Teaball, which reorganized the entire operational side of the Air Force's early warning systems, and tying them with the Navy's, so that every aircraft had a channel providing immediate warning of incoming aircraft. It {{was not until}} 1975, however, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> introduced Exercise Red Flag to match {{the performance of the}} Navy's TOPGUN.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} services, <b>the</b> Congolese <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> is {{not capable of}} {{carrying}} out its responsibilities. Few of <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force's</b> aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and {{it is unclear whether}} <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force's</b> Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force's</b> pilot training program.|$|R
50|$|In August 2010, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chilean <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> plans to order six KC-390s.|$|R

5|$|Novikov briefly {{held the}} {{position}} of First Deputy to the Air Force Commander from February until April 11, 1942. He then became Commander of the Red Army Air Force – Deputy to the People's Commissar of Defense of the USSR for Aviation, a position from which he began to reorganize the Soviet air force. He worked specifically {{for the creation of}} separate divisions and air corps, as well as the improvement of front line coordination. During the siege of Stalingrad, Novikov successfully persuaded Marshal Zhukov and in turn, Joseph Stalin <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>force</b> was not ready for a planned counter-offensive, an argument to which both commanders eventually conceded. After a substantial period of development, Novikov was able to provide Zhukov with an aerial blockade of the German forces at Stalingrad, along with the destruction of 1,200 enemy planes. Later operations over Kuban destroyed another 1,100 planes.|$|E
5|$|Suharto is soon {{called to}} the {{secondary}} palace in Bogor to speak with Sukarno. There, the president {{says that he has}} received assurances from Air Marshal Omar Dani <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> was not involved. Suharto refutes the statement, noting that the movement's arms were like those of the Air Force. The meeting eventually results in Suharto being confirmed as leader of the Army, working together with Pranoto Reksosamodra. In their investigation of the events, the Army discovers the camp at Lubang Buaya– including the generals' bodies, which are recovered while Suharto delivers a speech describing the coup and the PKI's role in it. The generals are interred elsewhere and Suharto delivers a hagiographic eulogy in which he condemns the G30S and PKI and urges the Indonesian people to continue the fallen generals' struggle.|$|E
5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One of the things that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E
50|$|<b>That</b> year <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> {{operated}} {{a total of}} 36 Alouette III helicopters, which was reduced to 26 helicopters by 1988.|$|R
25|$|In 1971, {{political}} friction increased {{between the}} Army and <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> over <b>the</b> close <b>air</b> support (CAS) mission. <b>The</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Cheyenne would infringe on <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force's</b> CAS mission {{in support of}} the Army, which had been mandated with the Key West Agreement of 1948. The Department of Defense (DOD) conducted a study which concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force's</b> A-X program, <b>the</b> Navy's proposed Harrier, and the Cheyenne were significantly different and that they did not constitute a duplication of capabilities.|$|R

5|$|Things {{changed in}} the early 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 Minuteman {{missiles}} and 54 Titan IIs. This meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> could not respond to new Soviet missiles simply by building more of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions {{about the need for}} any ground-based ICBM. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not do. If the force was going to carry out this mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet attack for a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance.|$|E
5|$|Starting in March 1984, Congress chaired {{a series}} of {{hearings}} into FX. William Schneider, Jr., the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, testified that FX policy might not result in any sales, in spite of any government support. He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy, secondarily a commercial venture. Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's CEO, argued {{that there was little}} point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them. He suggested the FX concept be dropped, and F-20 allowed to be sold by the vendor. Additionally, Brigadier General Thomas Baker, USAF Director of International Programs, testified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> was not actively marketing FX. He observed that over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries, none were FX. He also compared France's aircraft exports, showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed. In the Committee's concluding remarks, the State Department and DOD were accused of rhetoric, and lacking support, on FX.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{a retired}} Air Force officer, Major Wesley T. Carter, filed a {{complaint}} with the Air Force Inspector General alleging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> knew that UC-123Ks used for spraying Agent Orange in Vietnam remained contaminated and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> had failed to properly inform subsequent flight crews of the risks following their transfer to the Air Force Reserve at the end of the Vietnam War. In his complaint, Major Carter contends <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; he cites the fact that when a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known carcinogen polychlorinated dibenzodioxin, studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.|$|E

2500|$|Goose Air Base was {{transferred}} to the Canadian Ministry of Transport as Goose Bay Airport.

25|$|Jane's World Air Forces 2007 states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> {{operates}} between 9 and 22 Mil Mi-24/35s attack helicopters, and {{a single}} Mi-26. The condition of the DRC's aircraft which are not currently in service is generally so poor that they cannot be repaired and returned to flyable status.|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, the Russian Air Force {{planned to}} receive 55 fighters by 2020. Yuri Borisov, Russia's deputy {{minister}} of defence for armaments stated in 2015 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> will slow production and reduce its initial order to 12 fighters and retain large fleets of fourth-generation fighters due to the nation's economy.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), a {{civilian}} UFO research group, requested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> release the panel's report. The Air Force released three summary paragraphs {{and the names}} of the panel's members. In 1966 a nearly full-length version of the report was printed in the science column of the Saturday Review.|$|E
25|$|After {{analyzing}} <b>the</b> {{results of}} <b>that</b> reorganization, <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> decided PEOs <b>that</b> were {{even closer to}} the persons managing programs {{on a day-to-day basis}} would improve the system.|$|R
5000|$|Keyhoe wrote {{several more}} books about UFOs. Flying Saucers From Outer Space (Holt, 1953) {{is perhaps the}} most impressive, being largely based on {{interviews}} and official reports vetted by <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force.</b> <b>The</b> book included a blurb by Albert M. Chop, <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force's</b> press secretary in the Pentagon, who characterized Keyhoe as a [...] "responsible, accurate reporter" [...] and further expressed guarded approval for Keyhoe's arguments in favor of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Such endorsements only cemented the belief, held by some observers, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force's</b> mixed messages about UFOs were due to a cover up.|$|R

25|$|On 29 December 2008, Air Force {{officials}} {{awarded a}} US$468million contract to Northrop Grumman {{to modernize the}} B-2 fleet's radars. Changing the radar's frequency was required as the U.S. Department of Commerce had sold that radio spectrum to another operator. In July 2009, {{it was reported that}} the B-2 had successfully passed a major USAF audit. In 2010, it was made public <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> Research Laboratory had developed a new material to be used {{on the part of the}} wing trailing edge subject to engine exhaust, replacing existing material that quickly degraded.|$|E
25|$|The Americans {{decided that}} while they wanted Khánh out, they did not approve of Thảo and Phát, so they began to lobby Kỳ and Thi, the two most {{powerful}} officers outside Khánh, to defeat both sides. They unofficially designated Kỳ the duty of moderating between the coup forces and Khánh's loyalists, preventing bloodshed and keeping them apart until some further action was planned. Kỳ's work slowed the advance of several Khánh-loyalist units into the capital. During all of these moves, Kỳ's hand was strengthened by the mistaken belief of Khánh and his faction <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> commander supported them.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} strong anti-RAAF move emerged in 1929 {{when there was}} a possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> would be dismembered and split between the other two forces, a threat which was apparent until after the mid-1930s. This coincided with Salmond Report of 1928 which recommended that Australia substitute air power (due to its speed, mobility, flexibility and offensive striking power) for sea and land power. As the Air Force entered the 1930s, it was still equipped with 1916-17 types of machines, although the growing threat of the Japanese air force had been recognised as early as 1925 in the Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia by Air Commodore Williams.|$|E
50|$|In April 2016, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> Global Strike Command (AFGSC) expected the required number to increase to a minimum of 100 B-21s.|$|R

50|$|On 26 December, pro-Syrian {{government}} sources reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Russian <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> directly backed <b>the</b> Turkish Army for {{the first}} time since the start of the Russian intervention in Syria. However, despite Su-24 and Su-34 bombers carrying out airstrikes against ISIL fighters, Turkish-backed rebel forces were unable to maintain control over newly captured areas.
