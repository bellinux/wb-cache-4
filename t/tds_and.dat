5|$|Following {{the general}} {{election}} in February 2011, and {{the election of the}} members of the 24th Seanad, only three political parties had the minimum 20 members of Oireachtas to nominate a candidate: Fine Gael (76 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> 19 senators), the Labour Party (37 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> 13 senators) and Fianna Fáil (19 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> 14 senators). Sinn Féin, the next largest party in the Dáil Éireann, have 14 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> 3 senators. For other candidates to be nominated, support from members of smaller parties, independents (of which there are currently 14 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> 11 senators) or excess members of the three larger parties was needed, or the support of four local authorities.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{decision}} by Fianna Fáil not to run their own candidate, there was speculation that some party members might be prepared to nominate an independent candidate. However, on 11 September the party's chief whip, Seán Ó Fearghail, {{made it clear that}} individual <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> senators would not be permitted to sign the nomination papers of independent candidates. He said that if the party decided to support a candidacy it would be done collectively.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September it was {{revealed}} that the party would seek to have Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, nominated to contest the election. With 14 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> three Senators, Sinn Féin were three short of the required twenty Oireachtas members to nominate a candidate for the presidency. Soon after the nomination was announced, four Independent TDs agreed to nominate McGuinness, securing his nomination: Michael Healy-Rae and Tom Fleming (both representing Kerry South), Luke 'Ming' Flanagan (Roscommon–South Leitrim) and Finian McGrath (Dublin North-Central). Both 'Ming' Flanagan and McGrath had previously pledged their support to Norris.|$|E

5|$|In Week 3, Vick {{was brought}} into action against the St. Louis Rams when Ben Roethlisberger {{sustained}} a knee injury that sidelined him for 4–6 weeks. Vick played decently in that stretch, going 40–66 with 2 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> 1 INT, while also rushing for 104 yards on 15 carries (his other five carries were kneel downs). Vick suffered a hamstring injury in a win against the Arizona Cardinals, being replaced by Landry Jones, which led to him missing six games, and by then Roethlisberger was healthy enough to play. Despite continual injuries to Roethlisberger and the team not signing another quarterback throughout the season, Vick would be inactive {{the remainder of the}} season, leading some sports commentators to speculate that Vick's playing career may be over.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} opener, the Wolverines played the Western Michigan Broncos at Michigan Stadium. The Wolverines scored first, {{midway through the}} first quarter, with a 27-yard {{touchdown}} (TD) pass from Tate Forcier to Junior Hemingway. They added to their lead five minutes later when Denard Robinson ran in a TD from 43 yards out. In the second quarter, Michigan added 17 more points: two <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> a field goal. First was a 7-yard TD pass from Tate Forcier to Kevin Koger. 6 minutes later, Jason Olesnavage kicked a 44-yard field goal. Junior Hemingway scored Michigan's final points when he caught a 44-yard TD pass from Tate Forcier, putting the Wolverines up 31–0 at halftime. Western Michigan missed a field goal just {{before the end of}} the half.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{started out}} well, winning {{his first game}} against the Redskins and {{throwing}} had his first career 400 yard game in a close loss to the Chargers, with 4 passing TDs, 2 rushing <b>TDs,</b> <b>and</b> no interceptions in the two game stretch. After that, Vick suffered losses against Kansas City and Denver, where he threw for 1 touchdown and 3 INTs in that stretch (all 3 were thrown against Kansas City). In {{a game against the}} Giants, Vick was 6–14 for 105 yards, when he suffered a hamstring injury. Nick Foles played stellar in his place, going 8–2 as starter, while throwing 27 touchdowns to only 2 interceptions with a 119.0 passer rating. Vick saw his only playing time in a 15–7 loss to the Giants, where he was 6–9 for 30 yards and an interception, but he again suffered an injury, this time to his quadriceps, and was replaced by rookie Matt Barkley, who played even worse. Foles returned the following week, and Vick {{spent the rest of the}} season as the backup, making only one more appearance in a blowout win over the Chicago Bears.|$|E
50|$|Quarterback Ryan Aplin showcased Malzahn's {{evolving}} spread dual {{attack by}} throwing for 3,342 yards with 24 <b>TD</b> <b>and</b> running for 438 yards with 6 more TD.

25|$|Cutler began December {{completing}} a season high 80% of his 40 passes for 286 yards, 2 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> 1 Int in a 24-17 {{win over the}} Chiefs. The win came via a 95-yard drive and go-ahead touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall for Cutler's fourth rally of the season. But Cutler was just 21-of-33 with 172 yards, 1 TD and 1 Int in a 20-30 loss at Carolina, and despite 359 yards and 2 rushing TDs, had 0 passing <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> 1 Int in a 30-23 loss to Buffalo. This set up a winner-takes-the-division season finale against the San Diego Chargers. Cutler went 33-of-49 with 316 yards, 1 TD and 2 Ints, but it wasn't enough to counteract the Chargers seven <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> Denver lost 52–21, failing to reach {{the playoffs for the}} third straight season.|$|E

40|$|Age-related {{differences}} in temporal discounting (<b>TD)</b> <b>and</b> risk taking, and their association, {{were examined in}} {{adolescents and young adults}} (n= 337) aged 12 - 27 years. Since monetary rewards are typically used in <b>TD</b> <b>and</b> risk-taking tasks, the association between monetary reward valuation and age and decision making in these tasks was explored as well. TD declined linearly with age, with a particularly sharp decline from 15 to 16 years. In contrast, risk taking was not correlated with age <b>and</b> <b>TD.</b> Reward valuation was not associated with <b>TD</b> <b>and</b> risk taking, and age-related {{differences in}} TD remained significant after controlling for reward valuation. Together, these findings suggest that risk taking <b>and</b> <b>TD</b> are two separate constructs with distinct age-related differences in adolescence and young adulthood...|$|R

25|$|For {{elections}} to Dáil Éireann, {{there are two}} constituencies {{in the area of}} the county; Kildare North, which returns four <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> Kildare South which returns three TDs. In the Irish general election, 2016, Kildare North returned Catherine Murphy (SD), James Lawless (FF), Frank O'Rourke (FF) and Bernard Durkan (FG), while Martin Heydon (FG), Fiona O'Loughlin (FF) and Sean O Fearghail (FF) (elected Ceann Comhairle) were returned for Kildare South.|$|E
25|$|The Seahawks then {{traveled}} to Chicago for a rematch with the Bears in the divisional round, but as most experts predicted, the latter {{won the game}} easily: thanks to two passing <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> two rushing TDs by Jay Cutler, the Bears jumped out to a 21-0 halftime lead and eventually defeated the Seahawks 35-24. It would mark {{the third time in}} five years that the Seahawks were eliminated in the divisional round, and the second time by the Bears.|$|E
25|$|Colorado got {{its second}} win of the season. Iowa State's head coach Dan McCarney {{announced}} {{the week before}} the game he was resigning his position. Crosby went 4–5 in field goals and 3–3 in PATs. This was the last home game of the season and the last home game for Colorado's seniors. Jackson had a career performance day throwing for 200yards, including 2 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> running for another 69yard TD. However, Hawkins stated that Jackson has no guarantee of being the starting QB next season.|$|E

Under the tutelage of new QB coach Tom Clements and new offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey, Stewart had his best year as a pro, throwing for over 3,000 yards, completing 60 percent of his passes, and attaining a passer rating of 81.7. He threw for 14 <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> ran for five more. Stewart {{was elected to the}} Pro Bowl and was named the Steelers MVP.|$|E
25|$|Mannock visited Biggin Hill, an aerodrome {{situated}} on high ground near Croydon. At {{the time this}} was used for carrying out wireless experiments under Major H T B Childs. It is not known if Mannock participated in these tests. Save for one Sopwith Pup, the aerodrome had no aircraft for some time until 141 Squadron took residence with Bristol F.2 Fighters to protect against Zeppelin and Gotha G.V air raids. The squadron arrival coincided with Mannock's posting to 74 Squadron at London Colney. The formation was formed in July 1917 at Northolt as a Training Depot Squadron (<b>TDS)</b> <b>and</b> then Training Squadron (TS). It was seen fit to promote the unit to combat operations and give Mannock a position of senior flight commander in February 1918.|$|E
25|$|In Galway city alone, {{more than}} 1,000 {{signatures}} {{in support of}} Norris for President were gathered {{from members of the}} public in just 12 hours on the weekend of 11 September. There was a similar result in the city of Cork. Days later, Norris was presented with a petition of 10,000 signatures, collected nationwide, by the We Want Norris campaign outside Leinster House. As a result, Norris announced his return to the campaign on the Irish television talk programme The Late Late Show on Friday 16 September 2011, though he did not reveal the precise number of signatures belonging to <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> Senators that he had secured. A Sunday Independent/Millward Brown Lansdowne opinion poll published on 18 September showed a high amount of popular support for Senator David Norris of 34 per cent.|$|E

40|$|Land-use {{change is}} the major driver of {{biodiversity}} loss. However, taxonomic diversity (<b>TD)</b> <b>and</b> functional diversity (FD) might respond differently to land-use change, and this response might also {{vary depending on the}} biotic group being analysed. In this study, we compare the <b>TD</b> <b>and</b> FD of four biotic groups (ants, birds, herbaceous, woody vegetation) among four land-use types that represent a gradient of land-use intensity in a Mediterranean landscape (Mediterranean shrublands, dehesas, mixed-pine forests, olive groves). Analyses were performed separately at two different spatial scales: the sampling unit scale and the site scale. Land-use intensity effects on <b>TD</b> <b>and</b> FD were quite different and highly varied among the four biotic groups, with no single clear pattern emerging that could be considered general for all organisms. Additive partitioning of species diversity revealed clear contrasting patterns between <b>TD</b> <b>and</b> FD in the percentage of variability observed at each spatial scale. While most variability in TD was found at the larger scales, irregardless of organism group and land-use type, most variability in FD was found at the smallest scale, indicating that species turnover among communities is much greater than functional trait turnover. Finally, we found that <b>TD</b> <b>and</b> FD did not vary consistently, but rather followed different trajectories that largely depended on the biotic group and the intensity of land-use transformation. Our results highlight that the relationship of land use with <b>TD</b> <b>and</b> FD is highly complex and context-dependent. Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja[URL]...|$|R
