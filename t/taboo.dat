40|$|The {{morality}} of conventions: Ancestral <b>taboos</b> in Madagascar The Vezo of Madagascar have to obey many ancestral <b>taboos</b> which prohibit eating certain foods, uttering certain words, wearing certain clothes, walking to certain places or being intimate with certain persons. For them, the actions thus banned are neither right nor wrong; and a burdensome <b>taboos</b> can be lifted by observing special, if costly, rites. In this respect, Vezo <b>taboos</b> are conventional norms. However, compliance with with {{the intentions of}} the ancestors who originally established these <b>taboos</b> is the most distinctive moral act performed by a Vezo adult. The distinction between conventional and moral norms is explored by using data from field work...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tabooed</b> {{language}} for speakers {{from around the}} world is generally understood to refer to those lexical items and expressions considered to be unlucky, indecent, immoral, obscene, etc. because saying them would violate certain sociocultural norms; but, it is for this very reason that some speakers do indeed utter them. As for the Cantonese language, this study has investigated a set of linguistic terms that its speakers have also <b>tabooed</b> as being inauspicious, profane, offensive, etc. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to and collected through contacts from 72 Cantonese speakers aged 16 to 64, with the objectives to explore speakers’ use of and attitudes towards <b>tabooed</b> lexical items by asking them questions on frequency of and reasons for using the terms, how acceptable and <b>tabooed</b> the terms are perceived to be and their habit of using the Internet. Tables of figures were constructed to consolidate speakers’ responses to the 14 <b>tabooed</b> linguistic terms. Survey results primarily show that often-said <b>tabooed</b> terms are more readily acceptable to speakers, and that the more <b>tabooed</b> the terms are, the lower their acceptability would be, but lower acceptability does not necessarily mean being unacceptable, and that the Internet tends to facilitate use of <b>tabooed</b> language among young speakers. Based on its findings, the study has concluded that every <b>tabooed</b> lexical item has a history and development of its own; and that change of speakers’ attitudes towards the types of words <b>tabooed</b> over time may cause changes in <b>tabooed</b> Cantonese lexicon which is also likely to be impacted by use of the Internet, especially among young speakers who are often at the leading edge of linguistic change. This study was conducted with a view to reveal some especially interesting but quite complex aspects of language and the opportunities for further theoretical progress in sociolinguistic research. published_or_final_versionLinguisticsMasterMaster of Art...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the role of}} <b>taboos</b> {{for the protection of}} species listed as "threatened" by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), and also for species known to be endemic and keystone. The study was limited to <b>taboos</b> that totally avoid or prohibit any use of particular species and their populations. We call them specific-species <b>taboos.</b> Through a literature review, 70 currently existing examples of specific-species <b>taboos</b> were identified and analyzed. The species avoided were grouped into biological classes. Threat categories were determined for each species, based on the IUCN Red Data Book. We found that ~ 30 % of the identified <b>taboos</b> prohibit any use of species listed as threatened by IUCN. Of the specific-species <b>taboos,</b> 60 % are set on reptiles and mammals. In these two classes, ~ 50 % of the species are threatened, representing all of the threatened species in our analysis, {{with the exception of one}} bird species. Both endemic and keystone species that are important for ecosystem functions are avoided by specific-species <b>taboos.</b> Specific-species <b>taboos</b> have important ecological ramifications for the protection of threatened and ecologically important populations of species. We do not suggest that specific-species <b>taboos</b> are placed on species because they are, or have been, endangered; instead, we emphasize that species are avoided for a variety of other reasons. It is urgent to identify and analyze resource practices and social mechanisms of traditional societies, such as <b>taboos,</b> and to investigate their possible ecological significance. Although it may provide insights of value for conservation, not only of species, but also of ecosystem processes and functions, such information is being lost rapidly...|$|R

40|$|Comparing food <b>taboos</b> across 78 cultures, {{this paper}} {{demonstrates}} that meat, though a prized food, {{is also the}} principal target of proscriptions. Reviewing existing explanations of <b>taboos,</b> we � nd that both functionalist and symbolic approaches fail to account for meat’s cross-cultural centrality and do not re � ect experience-near aspects of food <b>taboos,</b> principal among which is disgust. Adopting an evolutionary approach to the mind, this paper presents an alternative to existing explanations of food <b>taboos.</b> Consistent with the attendant risk of pathogen transmission, meat has special salience as a stimulus for humans, as animal products are stronger elicitors of disgust and aversion than plant products. We identify three psychosocial processes, socially-mediated ingestive conditioning, egocentric empathy, and normative moralization, each of which likely {{plays a role in}} transforming individual disgust responses and conditioned food aversions into institutionalized food <b>taboos...</b>|$|R

40|$|Food <b>taboos</b> {{are widely}} seen {{all over the}} world. This is a {{complicated}} phenomenon in which various elements in each cultural area are intricately intertwined. One of the strictest food <b>taboos</b> is based on religious reasons. Grounds for food <b>taboos</b> in each religion are presented in each doctrine. However, holiness, purity, impurity etc. are vague ideas from an objective viewpoint. Therefore, it might be difficult for those outside of a certain religious group to accept these prohibitions. Food <b>taboos</b> are seen in {{the doctrine of the}} Jainism too. Jainism regards non-violence (ahiṃsā) as the highest virtue and has practiced non-violence for about 2, 500 years in India. There are two kinds of food <b>taboos</b> in Jainism. One is intended for the mendicant and the other is intended for the layperson. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify a part of food <b>taboos</b> of Jainism by focusing on the latter. To consider food <b>taboos</b> in Jainism, this paper adopts the following order. In case of Jainism, it is expected that non-violence has a big influence on food <b>taboos.</b> Therefore, firstly, we survey the Jaina view of life and Jaina bioethics. The Jaina view of life distinguishes immobile beings (sthāvara) and mobile beings (trasa). Furthermore, it holds that the hierarchy of the living thing is based on the number of sense organs. In this paper we confirm that these greatly influence the degree of violence (hiṃsā). Secondly, we investigate the prohibited food on the basis of the original text and the previous works. Concretely, we examine the one that is called "Fundamental virtue (mūlaguṇa) " of the layperson. By this procedure, we clarify the next two points. The first is that the texts are divided into four types. The second is that six kinds of food <b>taboos,</b> i. e. the abandonment of meat, the abandonment of alcohol, the abandonment of honey, the abandonment of five kinds of plants, the abandonment of the midnight snack, and the abandonment of non-filtered water are seen in these texts. Finally, we consider the conditions and the reasons which bring about the above-mentioned food <b>taboos</b> in detail. We can make the following conclusions on the basis of such considerations. That is, the standard of the food <b>taboos</b> of Jainism are extremely lucid from the viewpoint of the non-Jain too, because they are based on non-violence alone...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} feature of human diets is the establishment of food categories according to its preference or avoidance. The literature on fish food preferences points out a general pattern Of preference for fish with scales and an avoidance or prohibition of scaleless fish. The,food preferences, avoidances, and <b>taboos</b> on animal protein items among three caicara communities from the Southeastern Brazilian coast were analyzed. Two aspects of the caicaras choice of food were discussed, regarding their preferences, avoidances, and <b>taboos</b> on the consumption of catfish (Ariidae) and on different species of mullets (Mugilidae). This categorization can be explained both ecologically and culturally: through the environmental availability; of the species, {{their position in the}} food web, or their importance in the economy and in the social relations within the community. A connection between resource conservation and food <b>taboos</b> about certain fish species are unlikely when. compared to the possible relations between hunting <b>taboos</b> and conservation of the terrestrial fauna. For the studied communities, there was no nutritional deprivation resulting from food <b>taboos</b> on fish species...|$|R
