5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E
5|$|Very little flow (less than 10 ml) {{is called}} hypomenorrhea.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack.

5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E

Without treatment, this second stage of {{the natural history of}} HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20years (on average, about eight years). While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50 and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cubs start {{following}} their mothers at six weeks. The mother frequently shifts the cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or {{while they are}} on the move with their mothers. Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of age. The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. The cubs are nursed for <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E

50|$|The {{center is}} a free, 24-hour {{temporary}} family styled residential center offered by the organization to house youth {{between the ages of}} 8 and 18 who have left their homes. In the centers, homeless youths are trained with skills of independence and self-sufficiency. There are 20 beds for boys and 20 beds for girls. Residential application is based on the individuals’ situation as well as direct referrals from teachers, churches and other non-profit organizations. Social workers under the organization are responsible for helping to solve conflicts between teenagers and their parents. The centre allows teenagers to stay at most up to two months, then they are either sent to long-term residential or to other relatives.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to assess the}} {{adaptation}} of middle-aged and older females <b>to</b> a <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> endurance training program. Sixty-nine subjects were divided into four age groups to determine the effect of aging on cardiorespiratory improvements. Two treadmill tests for maximal aerobic power were administered prior to training and following the subjects' ability to run a continuous two miles. As a result of training, maximal oxygen consumption (max V 02) and maximal ventilation (max VE) increased significantly in all age groups with the youngest group exhibiting the greatest gains and the oldest group showing the least improvements. Age tended to effect max V 02 at both T 1 and T 2 but it also played a role in interfering with the ability to improve in the 55 to 65 age range. Training had little effect on the resting variables observed in this study. Nor did age effect basal parameters such as body weight, serum cholesterol and resting heart rate. However, age did become significant when fat percent and blood pressures were observed. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

As the number of ACL surgeries performed each year rise, giving patients a detailed look at their options for replacement is critical. To accomplish this, the best alternative of allograft or autograft, needs to be identified. A systematic literature review has been conducted on the Advantages and Disadvantages of Allograft vs. Autograft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) replacement. Methodology: The purpose of this literature review is {{to determine whether there}} is an advantage to the use of an Allograft vs. Autograft in ACL replacement. Over twenty four peer reviewed articles were reviewed with a primary focus the graft donor site, specifically the patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon. Outcomes were evaluated in <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> increments for up to five years. Results: The literature review showed that there was very little statistical significance in the presence of pain, giving away, effusion, Lachman, and pivot shift results. Conclusion: The main concern with Autograft was graft site morbidity. The main concern with Allograft was risk of disease transmission. The choice of Allograft vs. Autograft ultimately comes down to physician and patient preference...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{introduces}} a new conceptual framework {{to the legal}} literature on pregnancy and pregnancy discrimination: the fourth trimester. The concept of a fourth trimester, drawn from maternal nursing and midwifery, refers <b>to</b> the crucial <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> period after birth when many of the physical, psychological, emotional, and social effects of pregnancy continue. Giving this concept legal relevance extends the scope of pregnancy beyond the narrow period defined by conception, gestation, and birth and acknowledges that pregnancy is a relational process, not an individual event. In the United States, however, antidiscrimination law has failed to acknowledge {{the demands of the}} fourth trimester; it operates from the presumption that pregnancy begins at conception and ends at birth. Without employing a fourth trimester framework, the current federal antidiscrimination regime will continue to permit pregnancy discrimination against women because employers can discriminate on the basis of activities that typify the fourth trimester of the pregnancy. Judges, administrative actors, movement lawyers, and other policy makers should recognize that the law should prohibit {{discrimination on the basis of}} fourth trimester activities like breastfeeding, caring for newborn infants, or recovery. As a matter of law and policy, discrimination arising from these activities during the fourth trimester should be regarded as pregnancy discrimination...|$|R
