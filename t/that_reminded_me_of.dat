500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{compared}} {{the film to}} Hayao Miyazaki's works such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. www.movies.ie called it [...] "a unique animated movie...beautifully made...has a magical other-worldly feel, with a script and visuals <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Hayao Miyazaki's movies (Spirited Away, etc.)...puts other 3D movies with bigger budgets to shame". Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "it pays homage to Celtic culture and design, together with techniques and motifs that evoke Matisse, Miyazaki and the minimalist cartoons of UPA".|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was mostly very well received by media {{for a variety}} of reasons. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield named Meryl as his favourite character for being [...] "a hottie, plain and simple" [...] and [...] "a cute redheaded soldier with a tough-girl attitude and a husky voice." [...] She was the first [...] "gaming crush" [...] of GamesRadar's David Meikleham, who commented: [...] "This mangled mess of fugly 32-bit polygons and even fuglier textures was the equivalent of sex on a CD back in 1999. Sexy, sassy and with a strength <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Ellen Ripley, Meryl was a true pioneer for strong female gaming characters in a time when Lara Croft was a role model for lower back pain." [...] Similarly, Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com placed her {{on the top of his}} 2010 list of [...] "video game crushes". Hanuman Welch of Complex ranked Meryl and Otacon ex equo at fourth place on his 2013 list of video game sidekicks that deserve their own titles.|$|E

60|$|LAMB I'm {{not so sure}} of that. She's got a way of {{shutting}} {{her mouth}} <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my old woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{part from}} {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> him," [...] she said. [...] "Keep the key wherever you please--I shall never want it again." ...|$|R
60|$|Some {{sinister}} note in her father's voice {{caused the}} girl to grow of a sudden calm and to assume a rigidity <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her sister.|$|E
60|$|Moreover, {{they had}} lit large fires, about which they flitted in an ominous and {{unpleasant}} fashion, <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> some mediaeval pictures of hell, which I {{had seen in}} an old book.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it? Does it indeed?" [...] exclaimed Stephen with a snort of rage <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> his father. [...] "Well, if ever I get {{a chance}} I'll make them sad with a vengeance." ...|$|E
60|$|The brown, expressionless, ageless eyes, <b>that</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a monkey's, or of onyx, {{wait for}} me. I feel the {{responsibility}} devolve upon me. I am anxious.|$|R
60|$|And <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a {{distinction}} you suggest between Ossian and Homer. I fashion {{it in this}} way: Homer sometimes nods, but Ossian makes his readers nod.|$|R
6000|$|... "No harm {{in looking}} at a pretty woman, you know. I'm a {{bachelor}} still, thank the Lord! <b>That</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a funny story I heard at the club." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{bystanders}} surged {{to and fro}} {{about the}} speakers in a manner <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> corraled cattle; others hurried towards them, and our broker's voice rang out: [...] "I'll trade with you at two dollars better." ...|$|E
60|$|The head of {{the valley}} had that half-tamed, ancient aspect <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the Romans. I could only expect the Roman legions to be encamped down there; and the white goats feeding on the bushes belonged to a Roman camp.|$|E
6000|$|To Clemantiny {{she added}} in a low, gentle tone, [...] "There's a {{look on his face}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Johnny. It came out so strong when he sat up just now that it made me feel like crying. Don't you notice it, Clemantiny?" ...|$|E
60|$|LESBIA. <b>That</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} very important. Boxer believes in vaccination: I do not. There {{must be a}} clause that I am to decide on such questions as I think best.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Lady Merton; 'though Lizzie's whole countenance and air {{is almost}} exactly her mother's, {{yet there is}} nothing about Kate but her voice, which they have in common, <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. It {{had better}} be done by {{somebody}} else, Dan'l,' said Mrs. Gummidge. 'I'm a lone lorn creetur' myself, and everythink <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> creetur's <b>that</b> ain't lone and lorn, goes contrary with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You!' she says, {{with a smile}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> lemon sherbet. I {{was waiting}} up-stairs in the slosh, then, and I was right down here by the door, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco, and I heard all they said.|$|E
60|$|The robber again paused with agitation. I sat musing {{upon his}} last Frightful words, which proved to what excess the passions may be carried when escaped from all moral restraint. There {{was a horrible}} verity in this story <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> some of the tragic fictions of Danté.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mention this}} lady {{particularly}} to you, Mrs. Butler," [...] said the Duke, [...] "because she has {{something in the}} sound of her voice, and cast of her countenance, <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> you--not when you look so pale though--you have over-fatigued yourself--you must pledge me in a glass of wine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't say, I'm sure," [...] she answered. [...] "I haven't seen {{anything}} here yet <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> fairies, but Cap'n Bill said a floating {{island in the}} sky was {{sure to be a}} fairyland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, what, Miss Effingham--there is, in all this, {{a slight}} {{return to the}} cosmopolitism, <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> our days of peril and adventure. Do not conceal a thought, {{if you wish to}} {{preserve}} that character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. Bring Ann--Oh, Peter, <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> what I {{wanted to}} say to you, which this dreadful thing in the paper drove {{completely}} out of my mind. Lord Wisbeach has asked Ann to marry him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He slipped round it, {{making a}} wide circle {{with his usual}} caution, then, seeing the snake which was, by the way, I think, the biggest immamba I ever killed, {{suddenly}} froze, as it were, in a stiff attitude <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a pointer when it scents game. Having made {{sure that it was}} dead, he nodded and said, ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me a while again, and then she said, in a little {{reasoning}} voice <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her mother's, only that it was conscious and studied, [...] "I was not aware that I am under any particular obligation to please you!" [...] And then she gave a clear laugh, quite at variance with her voice.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me a while again, {{and then she said}} in a little {{reasoning}} tone <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her mother’s, only that it was conscious and studied, “I wasn’t aware that I’m under any particular obligation to please you!” But she also gave a clear laugh, quite at variance with this stiffness. Suddenly I thought her adorable.|$|E
5000|$|Kenneth: <b>That</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a story <b>that's</b> {{in no way}} related. I {{was working}} with John Gielgud in a {{production}} of Troilus and Cressida, when I discovered I had no control OVER THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Nada Que Me Recuerde a Ti" [...] ("Nothing <b>That</b> <b>Reminds</b> <b>Me</b> <b>of</b> You") {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{recorded}} by Marco Antonio Solís. Released in October of 2008, this is his second single from his 8th studio album No Molestar.|$|R
2500|$|Macbeth is then {{shown the}} ghost of Banco and his descendants, eight future Kings of Scotland, verifying the {{original}} prophecy. (Macbeth: Fuggi regal fantasima / [...] "Begone, royal phantom <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Banco"). He collapses, but regains consciousness in the castle.|$|R
60|$|There {{are four}} painted glass windows, {{given by the}} King of Bavaria. I have got for H. the {{photograph}} of two of them, representing the birth and death of Christ. They are gorgeous paintings by the first masters. The windows round the choir were painted in a style <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> our forests in autumn.|$|E
60|$|The {{first morning}} I noticed a white object on the rocks, {{about half a}} mile away, and turned my glass on it. There--apparently within a stone's throw of me--was a young man. He was {{lounging}} on a rock, looking dreamily out to sea. There was something about his face <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> someone I know, but I cannot remember whom.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Rollo; [...] "I am sure I {{put it in}} this pocket. Besides, I think I {{felt the}} robber's hand when he took it. I felt {{something}} there, at any rate; and <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my purse; and I {{thought it would be}} best for me to give it to you. But when I went to feel for it, it was gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} it is," [...] he said at last, [...] "but there's a {{something}} about you <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her. It ain't your voice, 'cos {{she had a very}} nice voice--when she wasn't in a temper--and it ain't your face, because--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Until {{you came}} into {{your money and}} found you didn't have to worry over your next meal," [...] she interjected. [...] "Well, that ought to make you still more content. And <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the second object of my visit. I want some money." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Open Source Movement's {{ideology}} is utopian balderdash <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> communism. ... Linux like organic software grown in utopia by spiritualists ... When they bring organic fruit to market, you pay extra for small apples with open sores - the Open Sores Movement. When 2000 gets here, goodbye Linux.|$|R
