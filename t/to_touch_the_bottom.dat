60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the three lads were {{swimming}} out towards the rocks which, as Francis had anticipated, rose from twenty to thirty feet above the level of the sea. The water deepened fast, and for the last thirty or forty yards, they were unable <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> even when thrusting down their rods to the fullest depth. They then tried the depth in the passages {{at the end of the}} rocks, and found that there was ample water for the Lido.

For it is a planned thing, undoubtedly. The actual perpetrator seems to have been led by the hand to the spot, and then abandoned hurriedly to his own devices. The inference is that he was imported from abroad for the purpose of committing this outrage. At the same time one is forced to the conclusion {{that he did not know}} enough English to ask his way, unless one were to accept the fantastic theory that he was a deaf mute. I wonder now—But this is idle. He has destroyed himself by an accident, obviously. Not an extraordinary accident. But an extraordinary little fact remains: the address on his clothing discovered by the merest accident, too. It is an incredible little fact, so incredible that the explanation which will account for it is bound <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of this affair. Instead of instructing Heat to go on with this case, my intention is to seek this explanation personally—by myself, I mean—where it may be picked up.

40|$|The final {{research}} cruise {{described in}} this report had the objective to compare the physical and biological impact of <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> trawl modifications developed during the EU DEGREE project to a standard bottom trawl used in the Barents Sea cod fisheries. The “new” trawl was fitted with the last modification of the plate gear developed during the project as well as trawl doors (standard Thyborøn doors) rigged <b>to</b> barely <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> <b>The</b> commercial trawl used for comparison was rigged with a conventional rockhopper ground gear and the doors were rigged to go heavy on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> as normally rigged during commercial bottom trawling. We looked for combinations enabling us to fish with the doors off, or nearly off, <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> while <b>the</b> ground gear was still on <b>bottom</b> and <b>the</b> door spread was maintained. This enabled almost no impact of the doors on the seabed while hopefully keeping an acceptable fishing efficiency for species not sensitive to herding effects of doors. More fishing experiments are therefore needed before it may be concluded that this rigging can be recommended for commercial use by the fishing fleet. The physical and biological impact on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> habitat of <b>the</b> two trawls was compared. Only two valid impact hauls was done with each trawl, both on very soft sediments. This is of course too few hauls to obtain a full statistical comparison between the two trawls. However, all parameters measured indicated that the plate gear trawl had a lower impact on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> substrate and benthic organisms than the conventional rockhopper trawl. The physical impact on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> was visually inspected and measured by ROV technique. Although the number of hauls was low, {{the results indicated that}} the rockhopper dug up more living material than the plate gear. This tendency was confirmed by the ROV investigations...|$|R

For every key, the conductive traces on the bottom layer are normally separated by a non-conductive gap. Electric current cannot flow between them; the switch is open. When pushed down, conductive material {{on the underside of the}} top layer bridges the gap between those traces; the switch is closed, current can flow, and a keypress is registered.|$|E

The general rule of length for skirts is mid-thigh and can be sized simply by using the [...] "fingertip" [...] rule. Modern skirts are offered in various rises as well. Traditionally the skirt should be worn at the natural waistline, at the navel area. The traditional skirt should be high enough <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the shell slightly. However some squads elect to wear low-rise skirts either with longer shells or with a normal length shell creating a midriff look. Bundies must be worn under the skirt.|$|E
5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to print objects [...] "bottom up" [...] by using a vat with a transparent bottom, and focusing the UV or deep-blue polymerization laser upward through {{the bottom of the}} vat. For example, the Form 1 stereolithography machine starts a print by lowering the build platform <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the resin-filled vat, then moving upward the height of one layer. The UV laser then writes the bottom-most layer of the desired part upward through the transparent vat bottom, and the photopolymer hardens selectively where the laser strikes. Then the vat is [...] "rocked", flexing and peeling the bottom of the vat away from the hardened photopolymer; the hardened material detaches {{from the bottom of the}} vat and stays attached to the rising build platform, and new liquid photopolymer flows in from the edges of the partially built part. The UV laser then writes the second-from-bottom layer and repeats the process. An advantage of this bottom-up mode is that the build volume can be much bigger than the vat itself, and only enough photopolymer is needed to keep the bottom of the build vat continuously full of photopolymer.|$|E

As the foam generation started, the height of the foam column started increasing. When the rise in foam height stops due to reaching equilibrium (new bubble generation equals bubble collapse), the N 2 injection was stopped, the stopwatch was started to begin counting the lapse time, photographs were taken intermittently, and the height of the foam column was noted periodically. This process continued for about one day after which the test was closed.|$|E
