5|$|Possibly {{the first}} venture into fictional {{treatments}} of Chopin's {{life was a}} fanciful operatic version {{of some of its}} events. Chopin was written by Giacomo Orefice and produced in Milan in 1901. All <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> derived from that of Chopin.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it was very similar to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as running water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal, but <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> closer to ambient.|$|E

5|$|After {{about two}} months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was {{recorded}} in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Music from Nier {{has been}} {{arranged}} into two jazz EPs. The albums, titled NieR Gestalt & Replicant: Jazz Arrange Version and Jazz Arrange Version Vol. 2, contain six tracks each from the soundtrack licensed by Joypad Records.

5|$|Ocarina of Times {{music was}} written by Koji Kondo, the {{composer}} in charge of music {{for most of the}} games in The Legend of Zelda series. In addition to characters having musical themes, areas of Hyrule are also associated with pieces of music. This has been called leitmotif in reverse—instead of music announcing an entering character, it now introduces a stationary environment as the player approaches. In some locations, <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> a variation of an ocarina tune the player learns, related to that area.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>was</b> {{scored in}} Sevilla and London by the {{composer}} Cato Hoeben. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>was</b> recognised when <b>the</b> film won Best Short at <b>the</b> Parma International <b>Music</b> Festival in Italy. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>was</b> rescored by <b>the</b> composer Rob Steel at the Sound of Silent Film Festival at <b>the</b> <b>Music</b> Box Theatre (Chicago) in Chicago in 2014 when the orchestra played {{live to the}} film.|$|R
5|$|The {{critically}} successful Solaris features Natalya Bondarchuk (Hari), Donatas Banionis (Kris Kelvin), Jüri Järvet (Dr. Snaut), Vladislav Dvorzhetsky (Henri Berton), Nikolai Grinko (Kris Kelvin's Father), Olga Barnet (Kris Kelvin's Mother), Anatoli Solonitsyn (Dr. Sartorius), and Sos Sargsyan (Dr. Gibarian); <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> by Johann Sebastian Bach and Eduard Artemyev. At the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, it won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury, the FIPRESCI {{prize and}} {{was nominated for}} the Palme d'Or. The film is often cited {{as one of the}} greatest science fiction films in the history of cinema.|$|E
5|$|The film is also {{noteworthy}} {{because its}} soundtrack {{is the first}} in Indian cinema to be released in DVD-Audio in addition to other audio formats. The tracks have been mixed in London in 5.1 Surround Sound and audiophiles can choose the format from the audio menu. Four bonus tracks from other films are included, and the lyrics of all 10 tracks can be viewed on-screen while <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> playing, enabling karaoke sing-along.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> concertante and virtuoso {{for both}} the trumpet and the soloist. The first aria and the {{concluding}} Alleluja are {{in the style of}} an Italian concerto. Dürr observes that the five movements are in five different musical forms: concerto, monody, variation, chorale fantasia and fugue. The scoring is richest in the outer movements (with the trumpet), and reduced to just continuo in the central aria.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack in MediEvil: Resurrection is orchestrated, {{unlike the}} first instalment. Approximately {{half of the}} themes from the {{original}} were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> split into two halves; the cues from the first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of cues from the original game {{with the addition of}} extra thematic elements to strengthen them. The other half of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> original and composed exclusively for Resurrection. The new soundtrack was composed by Bob & Barn and features performances from members of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra that was recorded in the Czech Republic. The orchestra, headed by Nic Raine, consisted of approximately 80 performers and in addition benefits from a 32 piece choir, also recorded in the same venue. This was in similar vain to SCE Cambridge Studio's previous orchestral game Primal, which was also recorded in Prague by the same performers.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} the work is Jesus as the conqueror of the works of the devil, who is {{frequently}} mentioned as the serpent. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> festively scored, using two horns, similar to Part IV of Bach's later Christmas Oratorio. The text by an unknown poet is organised in eight movements, beginning with a choral movement on the biblical text, followed by a sequence of recitatives and arias which is structured as three stanzas from three different hymns. Only two of these hymns are Christmas carols.|$|E

5|$|The use of John Williams' soundtrack {{from the}} Star Wars films {{was met with}} praise, though one {{reviewer}} believed that <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> overused in Star Wars video games. The sound effects were also lauded, and seen as providing a good atmosphere for the game, in particular the lightsaber sound and its implementation.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the order}} in which the musical numbers appear in the libretto. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> known to survive for numbers shown in bold; a ballet also survives, but its {{location}} is uncertain. Reviews of the opera hint at three additional numbers not in the libretto, but as their names and exact locations are unknown, they are not listed.|$|E
5|$|Through the mid-1980s, Lutosławski {{composed}} {{three pieces}} called Łańcuch ("Chain"), {{which refers to}} the way <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>is</b> constructed from contrasting strands which overlap like the links of a chain. Chain 2 was written for Anne-Sophie Mutter (commissioned by Paul Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier Partita for violin and piano, providing a new linking Interlude, so that when played together the Partita, Interlude and Chain 2 form his longest work.|$|E
