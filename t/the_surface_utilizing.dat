In particular, the generation of nonspherical nanostructures has attracted much attention recently, {{as it has been}} demonstrated that shape affects function in a biomedical context. Until now, nonspherical polymersomes have only been constructed from nondegradable building blocks, hampering a detailed investigation of shape effects in nanomedicine for this category of nanostructures. Herein, we demonstrate the spontaneous elongation of spherical polymersomes comprising the biodegradable copolymer poly(ethylene glycol) -b-poly(d,l-lactide) into well-defined nanotubes.

40|$|Synthesis of densely {{grafted polymer}} brushes from good solvent polymer {{solutions}} is difficult when the surface interaction is only weakly attractive {{because of the}} strong steric repulsion between the polymer chains. To circumvent this difficulty we graft polymer layers in a poor solvent to exploit attractive polymer-polymer interactions which largely nullify the repulsive steric interactions. This simple strategy gives rise to densely grafted and homogeneous polymer brush layers. Model end-grafted polystyrene chains (Mw = 105, 000) are prepared in the poor solvent cyclohexane (9. 5 °C) where the chains are chemically attached to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>utilizing</b> a trichlorosilane end-group. Polished silicon wafers were then exposed to the reactive polymer solutions {{for a series of}} “induction times” τI and the evolving layer was characterized by X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Distinct morphologies were found depending on τI. For short τI, corresponding to a grafting density less than 5  mg/m 2, the grafted layer forms an inhomogeneous island-like structure. At intermediate τI, where the coverage becomes percolating, a surface pattern develops which appears similar to spinodal decomposition in bulk solution. Finally, after sufficiently long τI, a dense and nearly homogeneous layer with a sharp interface is formed which does not exhibit surface pattern formation. The stages of brush growth are discussed qualitatively in terms of a random deposition model...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} the laminar and compressible boundary layer, about a circular cone in a supersonic free stream, is presented. It is thought that if accurate and efficient numerical schemes can be produced to solve the boundary layer equations, they can be joined to numerical codes that solve the inviscid outer flow. The combination of these numerical codes is competitive with the accurate, but computationally expensive, Navier-Stokes schemes. The primary goal {{is to develop a}} finite element method for the calculation of 3 -D compressible laminar boundary layer about a yawed cone. The proposed method can, in principle, be extended to apply to the 3 -D boundary layer of pointed bodies of arbitrary cross section. The 3 -D boundary layer equations governing supersonic free stream flow about a cone are examined. The 3 -D partial differential equations are reduced to 2 -D integral equations by applying the Howarth, Mangler, Crocco transformations, a linear relation between viscosity, and a Blasius-type of similarity variable. This is equivalent to a Dorodnitsyn-type formulation. The reduced equations are independent of density and curvature effects, and resemble the weak form of the 2 -D incompressible boundary layer equations in Cartesian coordinates. In addition the coordinate normal to the wall has been stretched, which reduces the gradients across the layer and provides high resolution near <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>Utilizing</b> the parabolic nature of the boundary layer equations, a finite element method is applied to the Dorodnitsyn formulation. The formulation is presented in a Petrov-Galerkin finite element form and discretized across the layer using linear interpolation functions. The finite element discretization yields a system of ordinary differential equations in the circumferential direction. The circumferential derivatives are solved by an implicit and noniterative finite difference marching scheme. Solutions are presented for a 15 deg half angle cone at angles of attack of 5 and 10 deg. The numerical solutions assume a laminar boundary layer with free stream Mach number of 7. Results include circumferential distribution of skin friction and surface heat transfer, and cross flow velocity distributions across the layer...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{sustainability}} of livestock production in Sardinia, considering some externalities, Landscape, Ecosystem services and Water Footprint. The use of environmental resources as farm externalities, under the Common Agricultural Policies (CAP) framework, was reviewed. Two specific indexes were developed (Livestock Index and Grazing Impact Index), and georeferenced maps were made to determine {{the environmental impact of}} stocking rate and identify overgrazed areas.

In particular, resist strip and mask clean processes seriously affect <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> properties of CoG-reticles and therefore increase the chrome-CD-measurement uncertainty. In extreme cases, {{the change of}} chemo-physical properties of the top Chromium oxide layer can have dramatically impact on the electrons emitted by <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>utilized</b> by <b>the</b> imaging process of CD SEMs. This change leads to a decreased secondary electron yield, and even more dramatic, induces charging near isolated chromium structures. Although <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> changes appear to be reversible with typical charge decay times {{in the order of}} days, the associated charging effect is in severe conflict to the common demand for low cycle times and high measurement accuracy experiments for the CD-measurement processes. In this work, we present fundamental experiments on Chromium oxide layers taking into account the effect of hydrophilicity on the optical {{as well as on the}} electrical behavior. We observe that the dependence of secondary electron yield on primary electron energy turns out to be the main issue effecting charging of electrically floating chromium structures. This charging effect thus can be understood in terms of shifting the so-called “iso-electrical point”, ultimately resulting in contrast reversion. Furthermore, our data are compared to a simple model respecting electron induced charging during mask surface activation. Our model is supported by numerical calculations of <b>the</b> effective <b>surface</b> potentials near isolated chromium structures. Moreover, the model provides ways to find novel routes for improved surface preparation prior to CD-measurement that allow a good SEM imaging behavior. status: publishe...|$|R
