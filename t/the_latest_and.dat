5|$|In {{partnership}} with the goddess Brìghde, the Cailleach {{is seen as a}} seasonal deity or spirit, ruling the winter months between Samhainn (1 November or first day of winter) and Bealltainn (1 May or first day of summer), while Brìghde rules the summer months between Bealltainn and Samhainn. Some interpretations have the Cailleach and Brìghde as two faces of the same goddess, while others describe the Cailleach as turning to stone on Bealltainn and reverting to humanoid form on Samhainn in time to rule over the winter months. Depending on local climate, the transfer of power between the winter goddess and the summer goddess is celebrated any time between Là Fhèill Brìghde (1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) at <b>the</b> <b>latest,</b> <b>and</b> the local festivals marking the arrival of the first signs of spring may be named after either the Cailleach or Brìghde.|$|E

25|$|As {{the siege}} of Baghdad wore on, it began to have its {{intended}} effect. Food and money slowly became scarce, and discontent among the populace began to emerge. As early as August, a group {{of members of the}} Abbasid family complained to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah that their stipends were not being paid. As conditions in the city deteriorated, Muhammad gradually became convinced that victory through force of arms was impossible. By November at <b>the</b> <b>latest,</b> <b>and</b> without the knowledge or permission of al-Musta'in, he had opened negotiations with al-Mu'tazz regarding al-Musta'in's surrender.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} principle of CCC equipment requires a column consisting {{of an open}} tube coiled around a bobbin. The bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion (a cardioid), which causes a variable gravity (G) field {{to act on the}} column during each rotation. This motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two immiscible liquid phases used. There are many types of CCC available today. These include HSCCC (High Speed CCC) and HPCCC (High Performance CCC). HPCCC is <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>and</b> best performing version of the instrumentation available currently.|$|E
25|$|The sudden {{spread of}} the rumours {{in the spring of}} 1915, six months after the events and Machen's story was {{published}}, is also puzzling.

As {{it was a time of}} allied problems with the Lusitania sinking, Zeppelin attacks and failure to achieve a breakthrough on the Western Front, the timing would make military sense. Some of the stories conveniently claimed that sources could not be revealed for security reasons.|$|E
