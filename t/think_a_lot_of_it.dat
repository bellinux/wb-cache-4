I knew from {{experience}} that these ocean liners fetch up at the dock at a deucedly ungodly hour. It wasn't much after nine by the time I'd dressed and had my morning tea and was leaning out of the window, watching the street for Bicky and his uncle. It was one of those jolly, peaceful mornings that make a chappie wish he'd got a soul or something, and I was just brooding on life in general when I became aware of the dickens of a spate in progress down below. A taxi had driven up, and an old boy in a top hat had got out and was kicking up a frightful row about the fare. As far as I could make out, {{he was trying to get}} the cab chappie to switch from New York to London prices, and the cab chappie had apparently never heard of London before, and didn't seem to <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> now. The old boy said that in London the trip would have set him back eightpence; and the cabby said he should worry. I called to Jeeves.|$|E

He was very, very smart and he always put that into his music. He was very esoteric as far as his jazz was concerned. I just sort of tagged along.

Asked what has prevented her from playing louder on Yours Truly, Cellophane Nose, Du Blonde said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{had to do with the}} way I learnt how to write and play guitar. I taught myself, and therefore had no concept of time signatures and keys, so often my songs would turn out pretty experimental because, well, they were experiments… Due to the complex or odd nature of the songs I was writing, putting distortion on things just didn’t work.

5000|$|No {{publicly}} named {{person from}} Syco {{has made an}} on-the-record comment {{about the end of}} the company's relationship with McElderry. In an interview that aired on 18 May 2011 on the television programme North East Tonight, McElderry made his first public comments about his departure from the company. In radio interviews during the month of July 2011, McElderry spoke further about the circumstances of the end of his relationship with Syco. He told Terry Wogan in an interview on BBC Radio 2 that he had actually parted ways with Syco in February 2011. [...] In an interview with Real Radio that aired on 13 July 2011, McElderry, when speaking about his commercial struggles, said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was to do with the fact that I went away for so long ...

5000|$|The album artwork of Crazy for You {{features}} Snacks, Cosentino's cat, alongside images reflecting [...] "the beach, hazy summertime nostalgia" [...] and {{her home}} state of California. The cover was designed by California native David Rager, who was contacted by producer Lewis Pesacov. The two attended college in San Francisco together and he had previously designed artwork for Pesacov's band Fool's Gold. Rager was told to complete the design in a week and his only instruction is that Cosentino wanted Snacks on the cover. Rager, who lived in Paris, met the duo while on a European trek and showed them his near-complete first version, which the band chose. [...] "They gave {{me a copy of}} the album, and I was listening to it and just working, often late at night," [...] said Rager. [...] "My in-laws were in town at the same time. I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was winding {{down at the end of}} the day, having a drink, and hashing it out." [...] The original photograph supplied of Snacks had his tail end cut off, which worked to Rager's favor: he placed an outline of California in the area to disguise the error.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the on-air announcers {{started their}} career at WOWI. The late Rollie Bristol (d. December 4, 2008) {{went on to}} an active career at WGH and WHRO/WHRV where he did the Art and Rollie Show, later called Rollie Radio. His {{extensive}} knowledge of all things music and his humble approach to sharing his enthusiasm with his friends and listeners gained him a huge following and a deep respect. In speaking with Bob Conwell via a WOWI Reunion Show on K-94's Rare and Imported Tracks in 1981, Rollie said, [...] "There was something about those old days, {{when we had a}} good group of individuals together at the station, because it was all a free-form kind of format. There was nobody saying you’re going to play this, you’re going to play that—it was all up to our own musical judgment as to what got played. And {{there was a lot of}} work involved in that effort. We really listened to the music, trying to find what was good, no matter what kind of music it was. We had a lot of meetings where we got together and talked about what we were playing and if we thought someone was playing too much of one kind of thing, or maybe not enough, we tried to remedy that. Our goal was to provide an overall balanced sound. There was a certain element of excitement in creating a program as you go—live on the air. There was something about the late 60s and early 70s that was happening at the time in music. There was a whole realm of great, exciting music coming out on top of each other—a whole mushrooming of creative music—progressive type music of all kinds. BC—I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is still coming out. It just doesn’t get played. Rollie, “That could be. One of the things about WOWI as that we tried to give exposure to relatively unknown things”. BC “You can count stations that do that now on less than one hand”.|$|E

The interview was conducted in 2014, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question 'How {{would you describe the}} classroom dynamics?'Brief excerpt from interview: The relationships between the students themselves was very positive, and friendly and open... I was able to make friends easily... Everyone in the class seemed to have someone to talk to... At the same time, Dr. Das made it feel that way as well... Even when she was lecturing to us, there was a sort of that feeling of just being together in a big group where we could shout out our suggestions and ideas, and share willingly and comfortably without being shut down or anything... I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> [the dynamic] came from some group projects we did... We had an urban planning project where we had to design fictional redevelopment for a city... We had these groups [of about 5 people], and we had to work extensively on that. It was really fun. About half were local. A lot of them were architecture students... {{a lot of them were}} from Hong Kong, Korea... It was really mixed, there was a guy from Australia, people from the mainland.

40|$|Norah, {{an urban}} voice: [Teaching {{is not what}} I {{expected}}!] Not at all! I guess I really {{expected it to be}} a lot more enjoyable than it has been. I know it has been rough because it is the first year. And it is always going to be rough in your first year. But I never expected it to be like this. I never thought I’d feel so down and so incompetent. It has been very difficult and I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> didn’t have to happen. A lot of my grief and a lot of my uncertainties about myself as a person, about myself as a teacher, and about the teaching profession—I just don’t think they were necessary…I have always been a go-getter and throughout the I [have] always continued to do my best. But there have been times this year when I felt so small that I couldn’t even scrape myself off the floor. False expectations, shattered dreams, and serious attacks on one’s competence and self-worth— these are the all too common experiences of beginning teachers. Teaching is a demanding and at times debilitating job that requires extraordinary expertise in human relations, tremendous organizational abilities, profound patience, and the wherewithal to makes hundreds of situation-specific decisions over the course of a school day. And, as Norah so vividly illustrates by her comments, the first year of teaching is often an especially trying and even traumatic time for those new to the profession. The difference between a beginning teacher and an experienced one is that the beginner asks, 2 ̆ 2 How am I doing? 2 ̆ 2 and the experienced teacher asks, 2 ̆ 2 How are the children doing? 2 ̆ 2 In Educating Esme: Diary of a Teacher 2 ̆ 7 s First Year, Esme Raji Codell reports that her own mentor shared that wisdom with her. Probably most teachers would find that the comparison rings true: The survival priority is no joke for those aspiring to join the ranks. What beginners and career teachers have most in common, however, is care for children. To be an effective and a caring teacher, a new teacher must ask many more questions than 2 ̆ 2 How are the kids and I doing? 2 ̆ 2 during the first years. Among them: How do I get their attention; lead a class discussion; keep, but expand, their interests; discipline fairly; organize a classroom; make curriculum and assessments meaningful; value diversity; build character; use technology; and continue learning as a teacher? The list goes on. It will not do for those who want to be master teachers to put off asking questions that do not begin with the how word; from the very beginning, they must attempt to discover whom, what, and why they teach. Besides offering advice and sympathy (a stapler and an aspirin, as one teacher put it), what can the profession of teaching do to support its newest colleagues? That it is becoming increasingly necessary for the profession to do more for beginners than it has in the past is clear. A baby boomlet combined with a retirement boom will result in a need for 2 million new teachers in the next 10 years. The cost of preparing and recruiting teachers grows higher in light of the statistic that tells us that 50 percent of newcomers will quit within their first five years in the classroom. The public is expressing its concerns, too [...] concern with unprepared teachers, concern with out-of-field teachers, concern that the best teachers are spread too thin. Teaching is one of the few careers in which the least-experienced members face the greatest challenges and the most responsibilities. The problems that beginners experience are intrinsic to the teaching profession and to the conditions of the school environment (Brock 2 ̆ 6 Grady, 2001; Gordon, 1999). Beginning teachers are making decisions and judgments about themselves in their first-year of teaching. What will these decisions and judgments be if they are not given the opportunities to reflect, both personally and professionally about themselves around the following three concepts: 1) competence, 2) performance, and 3) effectiveness (Debolt, 1992). This research looks at the three beginning teachers as they make their way through the first year of teaching. The voices of the beginning teachers studied will provide eloquent and authentic testimony to the importance and vital nature of teaching and the impact of relationships begun, sustained and renewed along the way...|$|E
