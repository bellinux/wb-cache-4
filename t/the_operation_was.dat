5|$|Operation Perch was a British {{offensive}} of the Second World War {{which took}} place from 7 to 14 June 1944, {{during the early stages}} of the Battle of Normandy. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> intended to encircle and seize the German occupied city of Caen, which was a D-Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division in the early phases of Operation Overlord. Operation Perch was to begin immediately after the British beach landings with an advance to the south-east of Caen by XXX Corps. Three days after the invasion the city was still in German hands and <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> amended. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> expanded to include I Corps for a pincer attack on Caen.|$|E

5|$|The JNA {{learned about}} Croatia's {{intention}} {{to develop its}} own military force from JNA Captain Vladimir Jager, a double agent employed by Croatia and the JNA Counterintelligence Service (KOS). The JNA devised Operation Shield (Štit), aimed at disarming the Croatian forces and the arrest and trial of the Croatian leadership, in response. Although <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> prepared by December 1990, federal Defence Minister General Veljko Kadijević never sought authorisation {{to carry it out}} from the Yugoslav Presidency. Instead, he ordered the KOS to stand down on the morning <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> scheduled to begin.|$|E
5|$|The {{airborne}} forces made several mistakes, most notably when pilot error caused paratroopers from the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a regiment of the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, to miss their drop zone and {{land on a}} British drop zone instead. However, <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> a success, with both divisions capturing Rhine bridges and securing towns {{that could have been}} used by Germany to delay the advance of the British ground forces. The two divisions incurred more than 2,000 casualties, but captured about 3,500 German soldiers. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> the last large-scale Allied airborne operation of World War II.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> mounted {{too late}} to prevent the attacks on Saigon, the Australians and New Zealanders {{successfully}} disrupted the communist lines of communication, limiting their freedom of manoeuvre to attack the Long Binh–Bien Hoa complex, while they were also able to successfully interdict their withdrawal, causing heavy casualties. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> also significant {{as it was the}} first deployment of 1 ATF outside its Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR) in Phuoc Tuy, and in this it set a precedent for later operations outside the province. Meanwhile, the remaining Australian forces in Phuoc Tuy Province also successfully repelled repeated Viet Cong attacks against Ba Ria and Long Dien, as part of the Tet Offensive that had engulfed population centres across South Vietnam.|$|E

She was able to free herself, and repairs were effected in Hamburg at the Reihersteig Dockyard until 1 February 1917. The ship was part of the force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage and had to be towed back to port. Nassau, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlußstein, a planned occupation of Saint Petersburg. On 8 August, Nassau took on 250 soldiers in Wilhelmshaven and then departed for the Baltic. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August, and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.|$|E

5|$|Following the battle, Scheer joined those {{calling for}} {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare against the Allies, a move the Kaiser eventually permitted.

5|$|Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Allied {{invasion}} of Southern France on 15August 1944. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> <b>was</b> initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in the Normandy, {{but the lack of}} available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops.
