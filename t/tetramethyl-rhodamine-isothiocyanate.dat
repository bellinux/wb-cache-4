(1994) J. Immunol. 152, 3353; Bene et al. (1994) Eur. J. Immunol. 24, 2115). Expression of beta 2 m-free HLA heavy chains and exogenous beta 2 m have been shown as potential regulation factors of HLA-I clustering, which in turn may affect cytotoxic activity of CD 8 + effector cells. Here we report a study on the effect of plasma membrane-modification (by exogenous cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine) on the expression of free HLA heavy chains and beta 2 m-bound HLA-I molecules on JY human B-lymphoblasts. The modulating effect of these two treatments on the lipid fluidity of cells was demonstrated by fluorescence anisotropy of DPH lipid probe. The lateral clustering (association) of HLA-I molecules was detected by flow cytometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FCET) and digital imaging microscopic photobleaching energy transfer (pbFRET) methods, using flourescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) (donor) - and <b>tetramethyl-rhodamine-isothiocyanate</b> (TRITC) (acceptor) -labeled W 6 / 32 or KE 2 antibodies directed against intact HLA-I molecules. Cholesterol enrichment of the plasma membrane increased membrane fluidity and reduced the expression of heavy- and light-chain determinants of HLA-I molecules and free heavy chains (FHCs). This was accompanied with a higher degree of HLA-I clustering as shown by the enhanced intermolecular energy transfer efficiency. In contrast, cholesterol depletion resulted in membrane fluidization and increased expression of HLA-I epitopes. Our results suggest that both cholesterol level and lipid structure/fluidity of the plasma membrane in lymphoblastoid cells may also potentially regulate lateral organization and consequently the presentation efficiency of HLA-I molecules. újratöltve - BIBFORM 00606...|$|E
