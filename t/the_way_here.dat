[...] Jiang Gan replied, [...] "I'm an old friend of yours but we've not been in contact for years. When I heard you have become famous now, I travelled here to visit you and reminisce our past days, as well as to tour the region. Are you suspecting my intentions when you called me a 'spokesman'?" [...] Zhou Yu said, [...] "I may not be as good as the musicians of ancient times, but I still know how to appreciate a beautiful piece of music." [...] Zhou Yu then invited Jiang Gan to dine with him. After the meal, before he left, Zhou Yu told Jiang Gan, [...] "I've something confidential to attend to, and I need to leave now.

2500|$|Hugo {{copyrights}} {{were acquired}} by the German game publisher Krea Medie A/S, {{a part of the}} media company Kraemedie. New Hugo owner Henrik Kølle stated in October 2012 that Hugo Games A/S [...] "is happy that the traditional Hugo countries, where Hugo was aired in the '90s, still love Hugo and seemingly can’t get enough of him. [...] Angry Birds have shown us <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>here,</b> so now we are hard at work on, among other things, a film project, exciting licensing deals for toys and finally we hope to release another Hugo game in time for summer 2013." [...] On 28 November 2012, Krea Medie was acquired by Egmont Group, but Hugo Games and the rights to Hugo were not part of the sale agreement with Egmont. A possible new Hugo live show was hinted in July 2014. Hugo Games is owned and managed by Henry Mallet, and was valued at DKK 56 million and generating an annual income of about DKK 10 million as estimated in September 2014 when the company was listed for investment as HUGO NewHold ApS.|$|E
