40|$|Applications of {{the thermal}} energy storage (TES) {{principle}} (storage of sensible heat or latent heat, or heat storage in reversible chemical reactions) in power systems are evaluated. Load leveling behind the meter, load following at conventional thermal power plants, solar thermal power generation, and waste heat utilization are the principal TES applications considered. Specific TES examples discussed include: storage heaters for electric-resistance space heating, air conditioning TES {{in the form of}} chilled water or eutectic salt baths, hot water TES, and <b>trans-seasonal</b> <b>storage</b> in heated water in confined aquifers...|$|E
