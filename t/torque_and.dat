40|$|The direct {{torque control}} (DTC) for {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) {{under the control}} of switching table suffers from high <b>torque</b> ripple <b>and</b> variable switching frequency. For PMSM DTC system, voltage vector selection strategy as the hysteresis control principle determines the systems performance. The angle (a) between stator flux vector and the applying voltage vector determines effect of the voltage vector on the amplitude of stator flux <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> angle. The effect of the voltage vector on toque is dependent on a, <b>torque</b> angle <b>and</b> parameters of PMSM. A voltage vector selection strategy based on the technology of space vector modulation (SVM) is proposed to control stator flux, <b>torque</b> angle <b>and</b> <b>torque.</b> Experimental results for a 15 -kW interior PMSM show it can decrease stator current <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> ripples <b>and</b> fix the switching frequency...|$|R

5|$|Many fixed-speed {{motor load}} {{applications}} that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy {{when they are}} operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
40|$|Walking gait {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{components}} of human movements. With the rising obesity epidemic and implied health complications, it is pertinent {{to examine the relationship between}} body mass index <b>and</b> the joint <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> powers at the hip, knee, and ankle joints required to produce gate. The purpose of this study was to identify the relationships between ground reaction forces, joint <b>torques,</b> <b>and</b> joint powers at the hip, knee, and ankle and BMI in a group of people with BMIs ranging from 18 - 44 kg/m², while walking at a self-selected normal speed and at a safe self-selected maximum speed. We proposed a direct relationship between BMI <b>and</b> ankle <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> powers. Additionally, we proposed that hip <b>and</b> knee joint <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> powers would have a direct relationship to BMI up until approximately 35 kg/m² at which point individuals would begin to modulate their hip <b>and</b> knee joint <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> powers to mimic those used by healthy individuals. Gait biomechanics were collected for twenty-one healthy adults with BMI between 18 kg/m² and 44 kg/m² using an eight-camera Qualysis motion capture system and evaluated using Visual 3 D. Each subject was tested while walking at a normal speed and a safe-maximum speed. The data showed a statistically significant relationship between maximum hip extensor torque at both a normal speed and a safe-maximum speed. No significant relationships were found between knee <b>torques</b> or powers <b>and</b> BMI. Maximum ankle plantarflexor <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> maximum positive ankle powers were found to be significantly correlated with BMI for both speeds. Additionally, first and second maximum ground reaction forces and maximum braking and propulsive forces were found to be significantly correlated with BMI at both speeds. We were unable to fully evaluate the specific hypothesis due to an inadequate sample size however, our results suggest that further investigation may support the hypothesis. Additionally, our subject sample was largely skewed towards females. We intend to continue subject recruitment in order to wholly test our original hypothesis as well as evaluate possible differences between the gait biomechanics of Class III obese males and females.

During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, Lilac and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical tent and sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the contributions of lower extremity joint <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> the mechanical power of lower extremity muscle groups to further elucidate the loadings on hamstring and the mechanics of its injury. Eight national-level male sprinters performed maximum-velocity sprint running on a synthetic track. The 3 D kinematic data and ground reaction force (GRF) were collected synchronously. Intersegmental dynamics approach was used to analyze the lower extremity joint <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> power changes in the lower extremity joint muscle groups. During sprinting, the GRF during the stance phase <b>and</b> the motion-dependent <b>torques</b> (MDT) during the swing phase had a major effect on the lower extremity movements and muscle groups. Specifically, during the stance phase, <b>torque</b> produced <b>and</b> work performed by the hip and knee muscles were generally used to counteract the GRF. During the swing phase, the role of the muscle torque changed to mainly counteract the effect of MDT to control the movement direction of the lower extremity. Meanwhile, during the initial stance and late swing phases, the passive torques, namely, the ground reaction <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> MDT produced by the GRF and the inertial movement of the segments of the lower extremity, applied greater stress to the hamstring muscles...|$|R

40|$|SummaryDo neurons {{in primary}} motor cortex encode the {{generative}} details of motor behavior, such as individual muscle activities, {{or do they}} encode high-level movement attributes? Resolving this question has proven difficult, {{in large part because}} of the sizeable uncertainty inherent in estimating or measuring the joint <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> muscle forces that underlie movements made by biological limbs. We circumvented this difficulty by considering single-neuron responses in an isometric task, where joint <b>torques</b> <b>and</b> muscle forces can be straightforwardly computed from limb geometry. The response for each neuron was modeled as a linear function of a “preferred” joint <b>torque</b> vector, <b>and</b> this model was fit to individual neural responses across variations in limb posture. The resulting goodness of fit suggests that neurons in motor cortex do encode the kinetics of motor behavior and that the neural response properties of “preferred direction” and “gain” are dual components of a unitary response vector...|$|R
