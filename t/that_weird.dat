5|$|In August 2012, Weird Tales became {{involved}} in a media altercation after the editor announced the magazine was going to publish an excerpt from Victoria Foyt's controversial novel Save the Pearls, which many critics accused of featuring racist stereotyping. The decision was made despite the protests of VanderMeer, and prompted her to end her association with the magazine. The publisher subsequently overruled the editor, and announced <b>that</b> <b>Weird</b> Tales no longer had plans to run the excerpt.|$|E

According to Lhermitte, Scharr accompanied her and Moqadem on their honeymoon and stayed in their room. Lhermitte stated, [...] "We [...] had to wait until he fell asleep before we could make love. I found <b>that</b> <b>weird</b> but Bouchaib said he regarded him as his stepfather. I think the doctor loved my husband in a platonic way." ...|$|E

[...] By the time Freak Out! was edited and shaped into an album, Wilson had spent $25–35,000 of MGM's money. In Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that [...] "Wilson was sticking his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too much money on the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all <b>that</b> <b>weird</b> shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and {{it is the first time}} we really see George as the character we know and love, <b>that</b> <b>weird</b> dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{magazine}} was, unusually for a pulp, included by {{the editors}} of the annual Year in Fiction anthologies, and was generally regarded with more respect than most of the pulps. [...] This remained true long after the magazine's first run ended, as it became the main source of fantasy short stories for anthologists for several decades. [...] Weinberg argues that the fantasy pulps, of which, in his opinion, Weird Tales was the most influential, helped to form the modern fantasy genre, and that Wright, [...] "if he was not a perfect editor... was an extraordinary one, {{and one of the most}} influential figures in modern American fantasy fiction", adding <b>that</b> <b>Weird</b> Tales and its competitors [...] "served as the bedrock upon which much of modern fantasy rests". [...] Everett and Shanks agree, and regard Weird Tales as the venue where writers, editors and an engaged readership [...] "elevated speculated fiction to new heights" [...] with influence that [...] "reverberates through modern popular culture". [...] In Ashley's words, [...] "somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. [...] (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of Weird Tales".|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} lost {{a considerable}} amount of money under Baird's editorship: after thirteen issues, the total debt was over $40,000. [...] In the meantime, Detective Tales had been retitled Real Detective Tales and was making a profit, as was College Humor. [...] Henneberger decided to sell both magazines to Lansinger and invest the money in Weird Tales. [...] This did not address the $40,000 in debts, much of which was owed to the magazine's printer. [...] The printing company was owned by B. Cornelius, who agreed to Henneberger's suggestion that the debt should be converted to a majority interest in a new company, Popular Fiction Publishing. [...] This did not eliminate all of the magazine's debts, but it meant <b>that</b> <b>Weird</b> Tales could continue to publish, and perhaps return to profitability. [...] Cornelius agreed that if the magazine ever became profitable enough to repay him the $40,000 he had been owed, he would give up his shares in the company. [...] Cornelius became the company treasurer; the business manager was William (Bill) Sprenger, who had been working for Rural Publishing. [...] Henneberger had hopes of eventually refinancing the debt with the help of another printer, Hall Printing Company, owned by Robert Eastman.|$|E
500|$|... "Pusher" [...] {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave it an A–, describing it as [...] "smart, well-paced, and exciting, and Modell is memorable {{for being a}} very human monster who manages to be both well-drawn and unsympathetic". Though he praised Modell and the climax, he felt that Holly was a stereotype and [...] "the implication that Modell is {{able to get through}} to her because of her fear walks <b>that</b> <b>weird</b> line between plausible and not entirely necessary". Handlen also felt that it was [...] "an excellent starting point" [...] for someone who wanted to get into the series. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Pusher" [...] a B+, writing, [...] "Much inscrutable warmth between Mulder and Scully parallels some inscrutable detective work. But the climactic mental tug-of-war between Mulder and Pusher makes up for any lapses in logic". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two called Gilligan's script [...] "witty and clever" [...] and noted that it was [...] "a triumph". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Wisden's performance as Robert Modell, calling his portrayal [...] "spot on". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it a rare four stars out of four. She called it an [...] "intense nail biter" [...] that [...] "ranks with the best of The X-Files".|$|E

500|$|The {{third and}} final session, in the evening on 15 October, {{produced}} four more recordings that completed the album— [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do" [...] "Sweet Thing", [...] "Ballerina" [...] and [...] "Slim Slow Slider". Davis expressed to Rolling Stone {{that there was a}} [...] "certain feel about a seven-to-ten o' clock session" [...] and that [...] "the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played". Both [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] and [...] "Ballerina" [...] were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time. [...] They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested [...] "Slim Slow Slider". [...] "I don't think we'd ever done [...] live," [...] recalls Payne. [...] " [...] had a book full of songs... I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van— all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.'" [...] It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] was easily the most substantial. [...] "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," [...] says Payne. [...] "We went through stages [...] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice – all <b>that</b> <b>weird</b> stuff we're playing – but there was a whole progression to that." [...] According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda [...] "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [...] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Motion Picture Association of America {{initially}} {{gave the}} film an NC-17 rating for [...] "some graphic sexuality". Smith submitted two additional cuts {{of the film}} with certain footage removed and was told the movie was getting much closer to an [...] "R" [...] rating, but that he should remove a small 14-frame shot first. Smith felt that the scene should stay in so he appealed the rating and the film was again screened by the MPAA. Seth Rogen commented [...] "It's a really filthy movie. I hear they are having some problems getting an R rating from an NC-17 rating, which is never good." [...] He continued, complaining that [...] "They fight against sex stuff. Isn't <b>that</b> <b>weird?</b> It's really crazy to me that Hostel is fine, with people gouging their eyes out and shit like that... But you can't show two people having sex — that's too much". On August 5, the rating was successfully appealed to an R with no further cuts. It attained the rating for [...] "strong crude sexual content including dialogue, graphic nudity and pervasive language".|$|E
