5|$|Mother Gothel {{appears in}} Tangled (2010). For {{hundreds}} of years, Gothel, a vain old woman, hoards the rejuvenation powers of a magical flower {{in order to}} remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret {{from the rest of the}} kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what is essentially the only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her hair to stay young.|$|E
5|$|The law courts' {{jurisdiction}} over the guardianship of children {{is said to have}} come from the King's prerogative of parens patriae. The Chancery had administered this area of law from an early period, since it primarily concerned the holding of land– a form of trust. Since these were mainly dealt with orally there are few early records; the first reference comes from 1582, when a curator was appointed to deal with the property of an infant. While the common law courts regularly appointed guardians, the Chancery had the right to remove them, replace them or create them in the first place. Similarly, while there were actions against guardians which the child could undertake in the common law courts, these were regularly undertaken in the Court of Chancery. This jurisdiction was first regularly recognised from 1696 onwards, and its main focus was the welfare of <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> <b>As</b> such, wards of the court had certain principles: their estates had to be administered {{under the supervision of the}} Court, they had to be educated under the same supervision, and any marriage had to be sanctioned by the Court.|$|E
5|$|Togusa tracks {{down one}} of the missing children, now {{assigned}} to an elderly man in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.|$|E

This legal writing used normative legal research, i. e. a research focusing on positive legal normal and this research needed secondary data as primary data.

The result of this research after conducted the research from any books and based on the interview is that in fact, legal protection to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> victim of narcotic misuse is still far from the expectation by reason there are still many <b>children</b> that is <b>the</b> victims of narcotic misuse perceived as the criminal who should be sentenced prison punishment. <b>The</b> <b>children</b> who become <b>the</b> victim of narcotic misuse should be positioned as the victim. Moreover, legal protection of which should be given to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> victim of narcotic misuse is conducting rehabilitation process that is purposed to relieve the physical and psychical condition of children that is conducted by either government and society, conducting guidance and educational/ training program to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> victim of narcotic misuse. The government, legal upholding apparatus, parent and society are demanded to play more role in protecting children in order not to be the victim of narcotic misuse that should be conducted through preemptive, preventive, repressive pattern, treatment and rehabilitation. Legal protection to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> victim of narcotic misuse has not been conducted as appropriately, thus it is responsibility of government to actualize excellent and profitable legal protection to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> victim of narcotic misus...|$|R

25|$|Although {{adolescent}} {{mothers have}} been found to display lower maternal sensitivity, {{there is no evidence that}} maternal age itself has a negative effect on child development, as other factors at that age such as education and financial status may play a role in the insensitivity of the mother towards <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with gender}} equality, {{the issue of}} {{parenting}} under the communal way of life was a concern.

They also thought it was selfish of parents to want to control their children and that this did not give room for the child to grow as their own person.|$|E

25|$|Strabo, giving {{credits to}} Metrodorus of Scepsis and Hypsicrates, {{mentions}} that at his time the Amazons {{were believed to}} live on the borders of the Gargareans. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargareans to whom a child is brought would adopt <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> his own, regarding <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> his son because of his uncertainty. He also stated that the Gargarians went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.|$|E
25|$|Robespierre visited Marie-Thérèse on 11 May, but no one, {{according}} to the legend, entered the dauphin's room for six months until Barras visited the prison after the 9th Thermidor (27 July 1794).

25|$|The OECD {{reported}} on Irish schools {{and levels of}} education in 1962-68, as {{an essential part of}} the process of Ireland's 1973 accession into the EEC, providing the vital external stimulus for reform. Finally the 1970 Kennedy Report, prepared in 1967-70, though flawed in parts, led to the abolition of the schools over the next decade, starting with Artane in 1969. In the interim, tens of thousands of children had been inmates, some from infancy. Despite frequent complaints and enquiries that called for reforms, the official line until the 1990s was that nobody in government, the church or the civil service really knew what was taking place. Notably, Micheal Martin stated on 13 May 1999 that: The concept of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> a separate individual with rights came late to this country.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} if one stole from one's father and, when charged by the father, denied it on oath, and the father then died before the child confessed to the father's heirs, then the child would have to repay the {{principal}} and a fifth to the father's other children or to the father's brothers (the child's uncles) if the child had no siblings. But if the child was unwilling to forfeit the child's share in the payment that child had to make, or if the child had no resources, then the child was to borrow the amount from others and perform the duty of restoration to the heirs, and the creditors could subsequently come and demand to be paid the portion that would by law have belonged to <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> heir..|$|E
25|$|Open {{adoption}} allows {{identifying information}} to be communicated between adoptive and biological parents and, perhaps, interaction between kin and the adopted person. Rarely, it is the outgrowth of laws that maintain an adoptee's right to unaltered birth certificates and/or adoption records, but such access is not universal (it is possible in a few jurisdictions—including the UK and six states in the United States). Open adoption can be an informal arrangement subject to termination by adoptive parents who have sole authority over the child. In some jurisdictions, the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a legally enforceable and binding agreement concerning visitation, exchange of information, or other interaction regarding <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> <b>As</b> of February 2009, 24 U.S. states allowed legally enforceable open adoption contract agreements {{to be included in}} the adoption finalization.|$|E

25|$|Corresponding {{with the}} attitudes of {{humanistic}} psychology, the developmental potential of the child- as in the acknowledgement of their strengths {{as well as their}} handicaps, and the importance of the therapist- child relationship are central factors in Orff music therapy. Theoretical foundations are also influenced by the strong emphasis on social integration and the involvement of parents in the therapeutic process found in social paediatrics. Knowledge of developmental psychology puts into perspective how developmental disabilities influence <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> <b>as</b> do their social and familial environments. The basis for interaction in this method is known as responsive interaction, in which the therapist meets the child at their level and responds according to their initiatives, combining both humanistic and developmental psychology philosophies. Involving the parents in this type of interaction, by having them participate directly or observe the therapist's techniques, equips the parents with ideas of how to interact appropriately with their child, thus fostering a positive parent-child relationship.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{potential}} victim {{has come into}} contact with state authorities, identifying <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child’s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.|$|E
25|$|Some {{art historians}} once {{identified}} <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> a young Cosimo I de' Medici, {{but it is}} now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait {{appears to be a}} little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait might {{be one of the first}} in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry. This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
