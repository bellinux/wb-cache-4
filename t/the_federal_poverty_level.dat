One 2016 {{analysis}} reported that while 81% of the population with incomes from 100-150% of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>level</b> signed up, only 45% of those from 150-200% did so.

5|$|Households {{with incomes}} between 100% and 400% of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>level</b> were {{eligible}} to receive federal subsidies for policies purchased via an exchange.

Under the law, workers whose employers offer affordable coverage will not be eligible for subsidies via the exchanges. To be eligible the cost of employer-based health insurance must exceed 9.5% of the worker's household income.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} the subsidy given to a family {{to cover the cost}} of a premium is {{calculated}} using a formula that includes the family's income relative to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>level.</b> <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>level</b> is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. For instance, under the House Bill, a family at 200% of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>level</b> will spend no more than 5.5% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. Under the Senate Bill, the same family would spend no more than 6.3% of its annual income on health insurance premiums. The difference between the family's maximum contribution to health insurance premiums and the cost of the health insurance premium is paid for by the federal government.|$|E
