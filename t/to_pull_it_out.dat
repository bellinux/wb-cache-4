Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its lower half falling back into the well and contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E
25|$|Stout's second {{government}} lasted considerably {{longer than}} his first. Its primary achievements were {{the reform of}} the civil service and a program {{to increase the number}} of secondary schools in the country. It also organised the construction of the Midland railway line between Canterbury and the West Coast. The economy, however, did not prosper, with all attempts <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of depression failing. In the 1887 election, Stout himself lost his seat in parliament to James Allen by twenty-nine votes, thereby ending his premiership. Harry Atkinson, Stout's old rival, was able to form a new government after the election.|$|E
25|$|A stuff gag is {{very similar}} to, and works {{in the same way}} as, the ball gag. The person's mouth is stuffed with handkerchiefs, scarves, socks, hosiery, panties, day sheers, bandanas or any item rolled into a ball, acting as a stopper. To reduce the chances of choking, the stuff gag is never pushed all the way into the person's mouth. Instead, a large part of it hangs out of the mouth, {{allowing}} the top <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> easily when he/she has to. Sometimes, to further ensure that the gag does not accidentally slip deeper into the person's mouth, the top may use a larger gag. It is then secured with a cleave gag, cloth gag or tape gag.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, {{after she}} had printed a story about an extramarital affair between Joseph Cotten and Deanna Durbin, Cotten ran into Hopper at a social event and pulled out her chair, only <b>to</b> {{continue}} <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> from under her when she sat down.|$|R
50|$|Most commonly, {{one or two}} handles or drawer <b>pulls</b> are {{attached}} <b>to</b> the front face of the drawer <b>to</b> facilitate <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> from its enclosure. In some cases, drawers may have another means by which <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it,</b> including holes cut in the front face or a hollowed-out area to insert the fingers on the bottom side of the front face of the drawer.|$|R

500|$|During {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by Ted Kravitz, {{a reporter for}} Sky Sports F1, Lewis Hamilton expressed delight at his victory, saying that he needed the victory after the disappointment of Monaco. While he stated that the car suffered from understeer throughout the race, {{he felt that he}} [...] "always had it under control", saying: [...] "I had a bit of time in my pocket to be able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> when I needed to, so it was never too serious." [...] In turn, Nico Rosberg felt that his qualifying performance on Saturday [...] " [...] that big difference" [...] and had cost him the chance at victory.|$|E
2500|$|In {{another version}} of Scottish sword dancing, the Highlander danced on a targe shield, this has {{similarities}} with an ancient Roman exercise in which the man standing on a shield had to defend himself and stay upright while others tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> from under him. Many of the Highland dances now lost to us were once performed with traditional weapons that included the Lochaber axe, the broadsword, targe & dirk and the flail, the old Skye dancing song, [...] "Buailidh mi thu anns a' cheann," [...] (I will strike your head) indicate some form of weapon play to music, 'breaking the head' was the winning blow in cudgelling matches throughout Britain, [...] "for the moment that blood runs an inch anywhere above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs is beaten, and has to stop." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1989, Symington {{announced}} {{his bid for}} Governor of Arizona in the 1990 election, promising to run the state like a business. Beginning with {{the initial stages of}} his campaign, Symington had placed his business expertise and his success as a real estate developer center stage, stating, [...] "What Arizona needs right now is a business mind. The state needs a man who can provide experienced, professional fiscal management <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of its economic crisis. I am that man." [...] In the Republican primary held on September 11, 1990, Symington was opposed by several high-profile career politicians, including former Governor Evan Mecham, who had been impeached in 1988 and was attempting to make a comeback. Former U.S. Congressman Sam Steiger, who had previously run for U.S. Senate as the Republican nominee in 1976 and for Governor as the Libertarian nominee in 1982 also ran against Symington, but placed a distant fourth behind Mecham and State Senator Fred Koory. Despite being portrayed as a liberal by his primary opponents, Symington received nearly 44% of the vote in the primary. In his election night speech, Symington immediately began his general election campaign message by stating that his Democratic opponent, Terry Goddard, was [...] "a professional politician, a tax-and-spend Dukakis liberal Democrat," [...] and, in contrast, that he was a Barry Goldwater conservative, and [...] "proud of it." [...] At the time, Goldwater was seen as the ideological godfather of the modern Republican Party, and had endorsed Symington's campaign. Symington's father was also personal friends with Goldwater.|$|E
5000|$|Band {{members have}} readily {{admitted}} {{that there are}} numerous theories {{about the origin of}} the band's name. Clayton Colwell stated in a 2006 profile that he had forgotten how the name was selected mentioning theories related to a neighborhood resident named Hector who threw rocks at his dog, Jeb's brother possibly creating the name, and the definition of hector as [...] "to bully." [...] Colwell finally stated: [...] "Sometimes I think it comes down <b>to</b> we <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of a hat." ...|$|R
60|$|Close on the Dowager Countess {{followed}} a visitor of low degree. Madonna--looking {{as if she}} was a little afraid of the boldness of her own imitation--began chewing an imaginary quid of tobacco; then pretended <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> suddenly <b>out</b> of his month, and throw it away behind her. It was all over in a moment; but it represented to perfection Mangles, the gardener; who, though an inveterate chewer of tobacco, always threw away his quid whenever he confronted his betters, as a duty that he owed to his own respectability.|$|R
5000|$|Graham spent decades {{working in}} education, {{and served as}} {{chairman}} of the New Zealand Education Scholarship Trust. He was critical of much of what is produced by contemporary educationalists, believing that [...] "To assume, as so many teachers do today, that the knowledge has to come from the children and all they have <b>to</b> do is <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> is educational nonsense." ...|$|R

5000|$|BHP, {{the last}} of the four {{partners}} still funding the project, announced that it was suspending all expenditure on the VFT project the following day.

50|$|Even if {{a living}} victim is roped, they cannot simply be removed that way. Grain creates {{friction}} that resists the force used <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> them <b>out.</b> <b>It</b> requires 400 lb {{of force to}} lift a victim buried up to their waist; removing a human completely trapped in grain takes 900 lb. Both of these amounts are above the level that can cause permanent spinal column injury.|$|R
60|$|At last I gave up, {{crouching}} in {{the secure}} fork of a tree. Lop-Ear went right on. I called to him--most plaintively, I remember; {{and he stopped}} and looked back. Then he returned to me, climbing into the fork and examining the arrow. He tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> but one way the flesh resisted the barbed lead, and the other way it resisted the feathered shaft. Also, it hurt grievously, and I stopped him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Marty South." [...] Melbury {{persisted in}} his narrative, to divert {{her from her}} present grief, if possible. [...] "Before he went away she wrote him a letter, which he kept in his, pocket a long while before reading. He chanced <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in Mrs. Charmond's, presence, and read it out loud. It {{contained}} something which teased her very much, and {{that led to the}} rupture. She was following him to make it up when she met with her terrible death." ...|$|E
60|$|The hound did {{not look}} guilty. He limped to her and held up his right fore paw. The action was unmistakable. Helen {{examined}} the injured member and presently found a piece {{of what looked like}} mussel-shell embedded deeply between the toes. The wound was swollen, bloody, and evidently very painful. Pedro whined. Helen had to exert all the strength of her fingers <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Then Pedro howled. But immediately he showed his gratitude by licking her hand. Helen bathed his paw and bound it up.|$|E
60|$|The drawer was of {{considerable}} length. When he tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> completely <b>out</b> from the grooves {{in which it}} ran, it resisted him. In his present frame of mind, this was a suspicious circumstance in itself. He cleared away the litter {{so as to make}} room for the introduction of his hand and arm into the drawer. In another moment his fingers touched a piece of paper, jammed between the inner end of the drawer and the bottom of the flat surface of the washhand-stand. With a little care, he succeeded in extricating the paper. Only pausing to satisfy himself that there was nothing else to be found, and to close the drawer after replacing its contents, he left the cottage.|$|R

50|$|Salesman Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) {{is fired}} {{from his job}} of 16 years {{following}} an unspecified incident in Denver related to his alcoholism. He sits in the parking garage after leaving the office, drinking from a flask. He then takes the Swiss Army Knife he was given as a farewell gift and stabs it into his supervisor's car tires, only to leave the knife (which has his name on it) and run away when he is unable <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> back <b>out</b> from the tire. He immediately drives to a convenience store and buys {{a large amount of}} beer. When he returns home, he finds his wife is gone, the locks have been changed, and his belongings have been strewn all over his front lawn. His wife has left him a letter telling him that she is leaving him, also over the Denver incident, and to not contact her.|$|R
60|$|He {{told the}} boy to bring a lantern {{and the three of}} them made their way back to the place. They hunted about the ground, but could not find what they sought. Suddenly the boy gave a {{guttural}} cry. They turned to look. He held up the lantern, and there, sinister in the light that cut the surrounding darkness, was a long knife sticking into the trunk of a coconut tree. It had been thrown with such force that it required quite an effort <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lop-Ear took a smashing fall {{as he ran}} beside me. An arrow {{had driven}} through the calf of his leg and tripped him. He tried to run, but was tripped and thrown by it a second time. He sat up, crouching, {{trembling}} with fear, and called to me pleadingly. I dashed back. He showed me the arrow. I caught hold of it <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> but the consequent hurt made him seize my hand and stop me. A flying arrow passed between us. Another struck a rock, splintered, {{and fell to the}} ground. This was too much. I pulled, suddenly, with all my might. Lop-Ear screamed as the arrow came out, and struck at me angrily. But the next moment we were in full flight again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} a thing like that," [...] he said. [...] "The trader at the great fresh-water lake had one. He carried it in a small bag at his waist, and used often <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and look at it. He never told {{me what it was}} for, but once he let me hear it speak. It went on just like this one--tik, tik, tik--but it did not require shaking or squeezing. I think it had a tongue like some of our squaws, who never stop speaking. One day when I went into the trader's house I saw it lying on the thing with four legs which the white men put their food on when they want to eat, and it was talking away to itself as fast as ever." ...|$|E
50|$|Finally Hortense {{swallows}} Donald's {{radio and}} her body begins to react to what is playing on the radio. Donald realizes Hortense has swallowed the radio and grabs a pair of forceps <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> try <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> (but ends up getting the concertina out instead). But when Hortense starts to react to a broadcast car race, Donald is unable to control her. Hortense finally crashes through a door which at last knocks the radio out of her, but she also gives Donald the hiccups.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, the Speedway SuperAmerica {{chain of}} gas {{stations}} and convenience stores exited the Southeastern United States and sold {{most of their}} operations to Sunoco. Shortly prior to this, Sunoco acquired many service stations from Coastal Petroleum, especially its stations in Florida. This {{has led to the}} reintroduction of the Sunoco brand <b>to</b> areas <b>it</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> of ten years earlier. Coincidentally, Speedway would later re-enter the Southeast with its purchase of Hess Corporation's downstream operations in 2014, mirroring that of Sunoco's return to the Southeast.|$|R
5000|$|Then the {{instrument}} begins the [...] "playing-in" [...] process, as its parts {{adjust to the}} string tension. The sound of a violin is said to [...] "open up" [...] in the first weeks and months of use, a process which continues more gradually over the years. However, this process may be aborted at some point. If you put a violin <b>to</b> storage and <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> a while later, you will notice when you first play that the violin has lost volume (this is a very common sign of violin inactivity), and loss of quality (this is in more severe cases of inactivity). If you put a violin into storage, <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> a while later, and play {{it for a few}} weeks, you will notice the violin's sound start to open up again.|$|R
60|$|That the Papacy was Christ's Vicarage was a {{fact that}} had long since been {{obscured}} by the conception that the Papacy was a kingdom of this world. In striving, then, for worldly eminence by every means in his power, Alexander is no more blameworthy than any other. What, then, remains? The fact that he succeeded {{better than any of}} his forerunners. But are we on that account to select him for the special object of our vituperation? The Papacy had tumbled into a slough of materialism in which it was to wallow even after the Reformation had given it pause and warning. Under what obligation was Alexander VI, more than any other Pope, <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of that slough? As he found it, so he carried it on, as much a self-seeker, as much a worldly prince, as much a family man and as little a churchman as any of those who had gone immediately before him.|$|E
60|$|Being thus rid, for a time, {{of these}} opposers, the Giant {{picked up his}} club, and, {{followed}} by the Prince and Trumkard, advanced towards the tower. Although Tur-il-i-ra strode along at a great rate, the Prince got to the tower first, and immediately commenced shouting to his Princess. She, however, did not make her appearance, for {{she was still in}} a swoon. So the Prince ran around to the door to see if, by chance, it was open, but found it locked. He saw, however, the hilt of his sword still in the lock, and, seizing it, he again used his utmost strength <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> but in vain. The Giant, who had just come up, perceiving {{what he was trying to}} do, stooped down, and, taking hold of the hilt in his finger and thumb, gave it a jerk, and out it came. He handed it, with a smile, to the Prince, who, overjoyed at regaining his favorite weapon, jumped around to see if there was anybody he could stick it into; but as all the Yabouks and other cattle were standing at a respectful distance, and there was only old Trumkard running up, he thought better of the matter, and put his sword into its scabbard, feeling himself a man again. The Giant walked round the tower, putting his eye to the windows, but said he could see nothing.|$|E
6000|$|The little tailor now {{demanded the}} promised reward from the King, but he repented his promise, and pondered once more {{how he could}} rid himself of the hero. [...] "Before you obtain the hand of my {{daughter}} and half my kingdom," [...] he said to him, [...] "you must do another deed of valor. A unicorn is running about loose in the wood, and doing much mischief; you must first catch it." [...] "I'm even less afraid of one unicorn than of two giants; seven at a blow, that's my motto." [...] He took a piece of cord and an axe with him, {{went out to the}} wood, and again told the men who had been sent with him to remain outside. He hadn't to search long, for the unicorn soon passed by, and, on perceiving the tailor, dashed straight at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot. [...] "Gently, gently," [...] said he, [...] "not so fast, my friend"; and standing still he waited till the beast was quite near, when he sprang lightly behind a tree; the unicorn ran with all its force against the tree, and rammed its horn so firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> again, and was thus successfully captured. [...] "Now I've caught my bird," [...] said the tailor, and he came out from behind the tree, placed the cord round its neck first, then struck the horn out of the tree with his axe, and when everything was in order led the beast before the King.|$|E

But the next morning, he having heard me up about my room before him, he called to me, and I answering, {{he asked me to}} come into his chamber. He was in bed when I came in, and he made me come and sit down on his bedside, for he said he had something to say to me which was of some moment. After some very kind expressions, he asked me if I would be very honest to him, and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me. After some little cavil at the word 'sincere,' and asking him if I had ever given him any answers which were not sincere, I promised him I would. Why, then, his request was, he said, to let him see my purse. I immediately put my hand into my pocket, and, laughing <b>to</b> him, <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> and there was in it three guineas and a half.

Once the Instrument of Accession was signed, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir with orders to evict the raiders. India took the matter to the United Nations.

Land acquisition began as early as 1974, but the project was delayed. Construction began in 1998, and was completed in twenty-two months.
