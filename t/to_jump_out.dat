Dooley manages <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> a nearby window before the vest explodes and kills him, saving the SSR agents.|$|E
5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and {{meet the needs of}} the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> of the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E

5|$|Isaac and Garet pursue Saturos' {{group to}} the Mercury Lighthouse, joined by Ivan and Mia. Despite their best efforts, they fail to prevent Saturos from {{activating}} Mercury Lighthouse with the Mercury Star. Saturos' group leaves for the next Lighthouse with Isaac's party remaining in pursuit. In the ensuing chase, Isaac learns that Saturos has taken another Adept hostage: the female Jupiter Adept, Sheba. Saturos and Menardi activate the Venus Lighthouse with the Venus Star, and are confronted by Isaac's party immediately thereafter. Attempting to annihilate their opponents, Saturos and Menardi magically merge to form a massive two-headed dragon, but Isaac's party slay Saturos and Menardi. Directly following this, Sheba falls from the lighthouse and Felix proceeds <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> after her. The remnants of Saturos' group (unbeknownst to the players until Golden Sun: The Lost Age), headed by Felix and Alex, continue their quest to light the remaining two Lighthouses, with Jenna, Sheba, and Kraden still with them. The game ends as Isaac's party boards a ship and sail out into Weyard's open seas to continue their mission.|$|E
5|$|The Tar Heels' {{began to}} strain Kansas' defense with several players making {{perimeter}} shots, and {{when combined with}} Kansas' inability to convert from the field, this allowed the Tar Heels <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> to a 114 lead. This led to Harp changing Kansas' defensive formation to a 23 zone, with Chamberlain under the basket. Rosenbluth — who was now relatively unguarded when compared to Kansas' previous formation — made a contested seventeen foot jumper. Kansas retaliated by giving the ball to Chamberlain who was subsequently fouled as he went up for a shot. He went to the free throw line and made one of two. As Kansas went up the floor coach Harp ordered his squad to revert to their original boxandone. Carolina's Kearns made a jumper from the floor after pump faking to lose a defender, which brought the score to 157 in favor of Carolina. Kansas came up the floor and missed their shot, but Chamberlain grabbed the rebound and was then fouled in air. He went to the line for a one–and–one and missed the first shot, while Rosenbluth caught the rebound.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a new language}} feature that is a hybrid of labels and procedures. It is closely related <b>to</b> <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> of a functional subroutine, and includes conventional labels and jumping as a special, but probably not most useful, case. It is independent of assignment, i. e., it {{can be added to}} a “purely-functional” (“non-imperative”) system (such as lisp without pseudo-functions or program feature). Experiments in purely functional programming suggest that its main use will be in success/failure situations, and failure actions. This innovation is incorporated in the projected experimental system, iswim.

25|$|In another Regional Final {{overtime}} game (and {{a preview}} of a future Big East rivalry), West Virginia opened up the game at a blistering pace, using five three-pointers <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> to a 19-5 lead.

West Virginia led by thirteen at halftime, but Louisville finally went to a zone defense coming out of the half, and West Virginia began to go cold. Louisville cut the lead to three nine minutes into the second half, but Kevin Pittsnogle extended the West Virginia lead to ten with six minutes to play with a three. But West Virginia missed their last four field goals and Louisville tied the game with 38 seconds to play on Larry O'Bannon's layup. Louisville had grabbed the momentum and scored sixteen points in overtime to secure a berth in the Final Four.|$|E

25|$|Several reasons {{have been}} given for the Lakers' early success {{including}} improved play by Lamar Odom, Pau Gasol and a better bench. The Lakers also have a light schedule during {{the early part of}} the season, playing most games at home while only three of the first 14 teams they've played have had winning records. This has also allowed Bryant to play a reduced role and stay fresher. The Lakers managed <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> to a 13–2 start before losing their final three games of November. The Lakers extended their losing streak to four before beating the Sacramento Kings 113–80 on December 3. The Lakers started a seven-game December road trip by beating the Los Angeles Clippers 87–86 after Derek Fisher made the game winning layup as time expired. During the road trip they visited President Barack Obama in Washington, D.C. for the second time in 2010. Bynum played his first game of the season coming of the bench against the Washington Wizards on December 14 after missing the first 24 games of the season. On December 15, the Lakers were involved in a three-way trade that sent Sasha Vujačić and a protected (No.1-No.18) 2011 first round draft pick to the New Jersey Nets in return for Joe Smith and the Nets' second round picks they acquired from the Golden State Warriors and Chicago Bulls, respectively. The Lakers will also receive the draft rights to Sergei Lishouk from the Houston Rockets, as well as a trade exception.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{described}} his biggest challenge in writing Rivens music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, [...] "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, {{and people are}} just standing in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is [...] "appealingly atmospheric", but [...] "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's going <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E
