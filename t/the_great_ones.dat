25|$|Randolph Carter's quest is {{interrupted}} {{when he is}} captured by the turbaned men and flown to the moon {{on one of their}} notorious black galleys. Once there, he learns that the turbaned men are slaves to the terrifying moon-beasts. A procession of moon-beasts and their slaves escort Carter across the moon to deliver him to the Crawling Chaos Nyarlathotep (one of the Other Gods who rule space, in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Ones,</b> the gods of earth). He is saved by the cats of Ulthar, who slay his captors and return Carter to earth's Dreamlands in the port of Dylath-Leen.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{performance}} drew {{praise from}} the national media. The Wall Street Journal called Robinson [...] "the breakout star of the young 2010 season" [...] and drew attention to his [...] "absurd rushing totals." [...] Columnist Mitch Albom wrote: [...] "Denard Robinson redefined the term 'offensive weapon' on Saturday against Notre Dame." [...] ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit noted the [...] "confident aura" [...] around Robinson:"The body language he exudes is, 'I'm a winner.' He's small in stature, but his heart you can almost see it pounding through his jersey. And then he has, like all <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>ones,</b> he plays with a swagger like, 'You can't stop me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|He {{had a great}} {{influence}} {{on the development of}} Armenian music in the 20th century. [...] "Naturally, he immediately became an example for young national composers and a hero in Armenia," [...] suggests Maya Pritsker. Khachaturian's influence can be traced in nearly all trends of Armenian classical music traditions (symphonic and chamber), including on Arno Babajanian, a significant Armenian composer of the late Soviet period. His unique symphonic interpretation has influenced Edvard Mirzoyan, Konstantin Orbelyan and others. Khachaturian is credited for bringing Armenian music recognized worldwide. Poet Hamo Sahyan said about Khachaturian: [...] "He became the big denial of our myth of smallness, [...] became the symbol of measuring our small people with <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>ones...</b> became our certificate of civilization." ...|$|E

500|$|Billboard Bill Holland called James and the {{material}} on Blue Gardenia a [...] "near-perfect fit" [...] after noting her [...] "hit-or-miss relationship with standards" [...] in the past. Holland felt that Walton's arrangements were designed for a singer with a [...] "less robust style", but considered [...] "Blue Gardenia" [...] and [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] to be [...] "riveting". Lorraine Ali's review for Newsweek called Blue Gardenia a [...] "smooth cocktail", suggesting that James' vocal performance reflected her difficult past. Dave Nathan of All About Jazz concluded that [...] "James may have slowed a bit {{when it comes to}} technical skills. But the fervency, the soul and the passion not only are still there, but have grown keener with age. This is an album of more than an hour of from the heart singing by one of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>ones</b> and is recommended." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after their}} arrival in Yharnam, the player enters a {{spectral}} realm called the Hunter's Dream, which acts {{as both a}} sanctuary and workshop. The player encounters two entities: Gehrman, an elderly, wheelchair-bound man who provides advice to Hunters like the player; and the Doll, a living life-size doll that assists the player in leveling up and emotionally bonds with the Hunter {{over the course of}} the game. Gehrman informs the player that in order to obtain the blood they seek, they must hunt down the various monsters plaguing Yharnam, and halt the source of the plague. As the Hunter delves deeper into the city, they begin to learn its dark secrets, as well as the origin of the plague that's destroying it. Long ago, the residents of Yharnam began worshiping ancient, eldritch cosmic beings known as <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Ones</b> after scholars from the College of Byrgenwerth discovered something referred to as a [...] "medium" [...] in the ruins of an ancient, highly advanced civilization that Yharnam was built on top of. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Ones</b> provided the healing blood Yharnam was famous for, which are also the source of the plague.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{change was}} that Serbia was {{permanently}} granted its independent status. This pleased both Austria, who feared a Serbian revolt on its borders, and Russia who long supported the Slavic nation's independence. Other changes arose as Europeans {{for the first}} time saw the trading opportunity of Turkey. [...] The amount of money entering the nation through trade was soon dramatically increased. As well the government received a great deal of extra money from a uniform tax system with little corruption. The Sultan also managed to get a tighter grip on the provincial beys and increased the tribute they had to pay. [...] Regrettably Abdülaziz, the Sultan at the time, used much of this money on furnishing and creating great palaces to rival <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>ones</b> in England and France, which he had visited. The Empire was undergoing a revolution, throughout Anatolia a new Ottoman nationalism was appearing, [...] It seemed as though it might be possible for the Empire to turn its decline around.|$|E
