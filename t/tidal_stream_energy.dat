Meanwhile, <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>energy</b> is easy for predication and its utilization has less harm to the environment. The <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>energy</b> in China could theoretically supply more than 8. 2 GW, and most of them come from Zhoushan Islands, Zhejiang Province.

40|$|So far, the {{economic}} assessments of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>energy</b> {{have been conducted}} from a sectorial, spatially dimensionless point of view; or in other words, {{on the basis of}} mean values obtained as representative of the average across the tidal industry. However, as this marine technology progresses, such assessments will need to be performed on a per-project basis, which inevitably requires the consideration of site-related variables: from the tidal resource to the local topography and accessibility. With this in view, this thesis develops a new methodology to include the spatial dimension into {{the economic}} analysis of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>energy</b> projects, and more specifically into the LCOE, in a continuous manner – thereby allowing for macro-micro linkages: impacts of a project over an entire region and vice versa.

40|$|Characterisation of a <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> site before device {{deployment}} {{is important}} for the marine tidal industry, in order to optimise the device design and accurately predict its performance during operation. Understanding the short-term uctuations in <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> velocity, resulting from turbulence and wave-current interactions, is essential for proper evaluation of the transient performance of a <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbine. Several aerodynamic models have been proposed for the design of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbines and <b>energy</b> production calculation, most of which have proved to predict accurately mean quantities within the ow regime. Unfortunately, these models cannot accurately predict the instantaneous ow variation and resulting forces within the ow regime acting on <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> systems which is of central importance to the tidal energy industry. The reasons for this may not be unconnected to the signi cant differences between wind and tidal turbines. Given the uncertainties which exist in the assumptions of resource modelling and the need for an accurate energy capture assessment at a speci c site, accurate on-site measurements that can predict the ow velocity (and its directional component) at a given location, are needed. This thesis is devoted to characterisation of ow in a typical <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> site (the Fall of Warness, of the European Marine Energy Center (EMEC), Orkney) through measured data. The high-frequency Acoustic Doppler Current Pro ler (ADCP) surveys were conducted at different locations within this site by EMEC. This dataset allows for the rst time a statistical and thorough analysis of the vertical turbulence structure at the EMEC's <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> test site. Detailed analyses of the directional components of the wave elds using a non-phase-locked method and in uences of seabed and <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> on wave elds, were performed. The bulk turbulence parameters within the <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> were estimated using the variance method. The results suggest a signi - cant effect of directionality and short-term uctuations in stream velocity resulting from turbulence and wave-current interactions, on the hydrodynamics in a typical tidal energy test site.

Today {{it is known that}} a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested.

50|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>stream</b> {{generators}} draw <b>energy</b> {{from water}} currents {{in much the}} same way as wind turbines draw energy from air currents. However, the potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine. The higher density of water relative to air (water is about 800 times the density of air) means that a single generator can provide significant power at low tidal flow velocities compared with similar wind speed. Given that power varies with the density of medium and the cube of velocity, water speeds of nearly one-tenth the speed of wind provide the same power for the same size of turbine system; however this limits the application in practice to places where tide speed is at least 2 knots (1 m/s) even close to neap tides. Furthermore, at higher speeds in a flow between 2 and 3 metres per second in seawater a tidal turbine can typically access four times as much energy per rotor swept area as a similarly rated power wind turbine.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen {{selecting}} suitable {{sites for}} <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>energy</b> arrays {{a wide range}} of factors must be considered, from the magnitude of the tidal stream resource, to realistic oceanographic conditions. Previous computational and laboratory-scale investigations into the impact of waves upon tidal turbines (such as turbine blade loadings) and turbine arrays (such as array configuration) typically assume that waves propagate “inline” to the tidal current (waves following or waves opposing the tidal current with a 20 ° tolerance limit). We investigated the wave climate at typical <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>energy</b> sites across the British Isles. The wave climate was simulated at 18 sites using a 7 -year (2005 – 2011) SWAN wave model simulation of the northwest European shelf seas. The principal semi-diurnal lunar constituent (M 2) was also estimated at these sites using the three-dimensional ROMS tidal model. A significant proportion of the wave climate (between 49 % and 93 % of the time), including extreme wave events (> 10 m wave heights), was found to be propagating in a direction which was “oblique” to the major axis of tidal flow (i. e. waves which propagate at an angle to the tidal current with a 20 ° tolerance limit) at all 18 selected sites. Furthermore, the average “inline” wave climate was 2. 25 m less in height and 2 s less in wave period in comparison to the oblique wave climate. To understand the direct effect of waves upon the tidal stream resource, the dynamically wave-tide coupled COAWST modelling system was applied to an idealized headland case study, which represented the typical tide and wave conditions expected at first generation <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>energy</b> sites. Waves were found to alter the simulated tidal velocity profile, which, because tidal stream power is proportional to velocity cubed, reduced the theoretical resource by 10 % for every metre increase in wave height (R 2 94 % with 22 degrees of freedom) – depending upon wave period and direction. Our research indicates that wave angle should be considered when quantifying the impact of waves upon tidal turbines, such as computational fluid dynamic (CFD) studies, or laboratory-scale experiments of wake characteristics and turbine fatigue loading. Further, dynamically coupled tide-wave models may be necessary for a thorough resource assessment, since the complex wave-tide interaction affected the tidal resource; however, in situ observations of tidal velocity profiles during a range of wave events will be essential in validating such modelling approaches in the future...|$|E

However, a refined evaluation of circulation pathways is fundamental to assess water-quality changes induced by tidal energy converters. The present study investigates the tide-induced Lagrangian circulation in northwestern coastal waters of Brittany (France, western Europe), including numerous islands, shoals and straits with strong potential for turbine farm implementation. Particular attention {{is dedicated to the}} hydrodynamic impact of tidal stream power extraction from a series of horizontal-axis turbines. An original approach, based on the coupling of the Lagrangian barycentric method with predictions from a model with high spatial resolution, is considered to assess circulation pathways in a single synoptic view. Spatial results reveal a complex Lagrangian circulation highly controlled by bathymetry and islands geometry. The residual flow in the Fromveur Strait, separating Ushant island fromMoì ene archipelago, displays thus a strong asymmetry, between a prominent northeastern pathway with residual currents up to 0. 45 m s − 1 and a southward circulation. The positions of cyclonic and anti-cyclonic recirculations, both upstream and downstream the Strait, are furthermore precisely defined. The north eddy is found closely located to the sand bank of the Four. The extraction of tidal stream power impacts mainly the residual Lagrangian circulation along the current stream emerging from the Strait, with a tendency for surrounding eddies to get closer to the <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> <b>energy</b> site.

We also confirm these detections running numerical simulations of the Sagittarius dwarf plus the Milky Way. This model reproduces the present position and velocity of the Sagittarius main body and presents a long <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> formed by <b>tidal</b> interaction with the Milky Way potential. The <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> of th...|$|R

In this paper, preliminary results of an assessment at the Strait of Larantuka are presented. The <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> power potential is evaluated {{on the basis of}} a calibrated and validated numerical model. It was found that the average <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> power density at some of the locations can exceed about 6 kw/m 2 and the practically exploitable energy yield from the Strait of Larantuka is about 20 Gwh per year...|$|R
