5|$|The idea of {{reviving}} the ancient Olympic Games {{had been raised}} {{from time to time}} during the early and mid 19th century, inspired to a certain degree by romanticism and patriotism. In 1833, the romantic poet Panagiotis Soutsos, in his work Dialogue of the Dead, proposed <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> of the Games in the newly formed Greek state, as part of <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> of ancient Greek tradition.

50|$|Chun Beh Im (2000) {{compared}} the evangelistic method and {{results of the}} Third Great Awakening in America with <b>the</b> Korean <b>revivals</b> of 1884-1910. Many techniques of the Second and Third Great Awakenings were transposed from America to Korea, including the circuit-riding system of the Methodists, the Baptist farmer preachers, <b>the</b> campus <b>revivals</b> of <b>the</b> eastern seaboard, the camp meetings in the West, the new measures of Charles G. Finney, <b>the</b> Layman's Prayer <b>Revival,</b> urban mass revivalism of D. L. Moody, and the Student Volunteer Movement. Im discovered four areas of influence from a comparison {{and analysis of the}} two countries' revivals: the establishment of tradition, the adoption of similar emphases, the incorporation of evangelistic methodologies, and the observation of the results of <b>the</b> <b>revivals.</b> <b>The</b> American <b>revivals</b> had a major influence on <b>the</b> Korean <b>revivals,</b> and <b>the</b> American <b>revival</b> tradition and enthusiasm toward missions helped Korean Christians develop their own religious experience and tradition. This tradition has influenced Korean churches even into the 21st century.|$|R

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E

5|$|Morris {{took up the}} {{practical}} art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He {{spent much of his}} time at Staffordshire dye works mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, such as the red derived from madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> of carpet-weaving as a fine art.|$|E
