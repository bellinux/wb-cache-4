5|$|Among the Normans who {{returned}} to <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> was Walter de Clifford, who reclaimed Cantref Bychan, then invaded Rhys's lands in Cantref Mawr. An appeal to the king produced no response, and Rhys resorted to arms, first capturing Clifford's castle at Llandovery then seizing Ceredigion. King Henry responded by preparing another invasion, and Rhys submitted without resistance. He was obliged to give hostages, probably including his son Hywel.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Anna Eliza Corwin {{divorced}} Brannan. They {{had grown}} apart as Eliza lived in Europe {{for quite some}} time while Brannan remained in California. Because of the divorce he lost much of his personal fortune, as it was ruled that his wife was entitled to half of <b>their</b> <b>holdings,</b> payable in cash. Because the vast majority of Brannan's holdings were in real estate, he had to liquidate the properties to pay the full divorce settlement.|$|E

5|$|The {{holding company}} of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, {{is a private}} limited company, with {{approximately}} 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand small shareholders.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066AD, {{the land}} in the East Riding was granted to {{followers}} of the new Norman king and ecclesiastical institutions. When some of the northern earls rebelled, William retaliated with the Harrying of the North which laid waste many East Riding villages. The land was then distributed among powerful barons, such as the Count of Aumale in Holderness and the Percy family in the Wolds and the Vale of York. These lay lords and ecclesiastical institutions, including the monasteries, continued to improve and drain <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> throughout the Middle Ages to maximise the rents they could charge for them.|$|E

5|$|After {{the revolt}} had largely been suppressed, those who {{accepted}} Ottoman suzerainty were initially allowed to retain <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> and partial autonomy. Many timars were also granted to local Albanians holding high posts of the administration, {{especially during the}} rule of Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg. Throughout the pacification process, various primarily rural areas were still in revolt and new rebellions erupted, like that of Teodor Korona Muzaka in 1437. As the empire further extended its area of rule in the Balkans, centralization attempts and the replacement of local timar holders with Ottoman landowners resumed. These policies would lead {{in part to the}} formation of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444, and a new era in the Ottoman–Albanian wars.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> increase 63-fold.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} “confidential {{holdings}}” of hedge funds, where the quarter-end equity holdings are disclosed with a delay through amendments to Form 13 F. Funds managing large risky portfolios with nonconventional strategies seek confidentiality more frequently. Stocks in these holdings are disproportionately associated with information-sensitive events or share characteristics indicating greater information asymmetry. Hedge funds trade approximately {{three times more}} and take about three times as long to accumulate their confidential stakes compared to <b>their</b> original <b>holdings.</b> Confidential holdings exhibit significantly higher abnormal performance compared to <b>their</b> original <b>holdings,</b> with the annualized outperformance over the 12 -month horizon ranges from 5. 2 % to 7. 5 %. Together our evidence reveals that private information is the dominant motive for seeking confidentiality and that hedge funds have stock picking skill in <b>their</b> confidential <b>holdings...</b>|$|R

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{people moved}} out of the {{surrounding}} Manhattan Valley neighborhood. Consequently, the Master Apartments' museum and cultural center closed by 1971, <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> dispersed elsewhere, although the building's auditorium was still used for cultural events. After Louis's death in 1979, the building was bought by real estate investor Sol Goldman, who converted it to a housing co-operative over the next decade. Further renovations, which were completed in 2005, resulted in many of the one-bedroom studios being combined into two- and three-bedroom units. These renovations attracted more families and made the building more luxurious by both quality-of-life and purchase-price measures. The Master Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 1762, {{as part of}} the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded {{the portion}} of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain. Spain had {{assisted}} France against Britain in the Seven Years' War, and lost both Manila and Havana to the British. Although the Louisiana colony was a financial liability, King Carlos III of Spain reluctantly accepted it, as that meant France was finally ceding its claim to Texas. At the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763, Great Britain recognized Spain's right to the lands west of the Mississippi. Great Britain received the remainder of France's North American territories, and Spain exchanged some of <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> in Florida for Havana.|$|E
5|$|Unusually, from c. 1100 onwards the Norse jarls owed {{allegiance}} both to Norway for Orkney {{and to the}} Scottish crown through <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> as Earls of Caithness. In 1231 {{the line}} of Norse earls, unbroken since Rognvald, ended with Jon Haraldsson's murder in Thurso. The Earldom of Caithness was granted to Magnus, second son of the Earl of Angus, whom Haakon IV of Norway confirmed as Earl of Orkney in 1236. In 1290, {{the death of the}} child princess Margaret, Maid of Norway in Orkney, en route to mainland Scotland, created a disputed succession that led to the Wars of Scottish Independence. In 1379 the earldom passed to the Sinclair family, who were also barons of Roslin near Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|William's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} {{difficulties}} in his continental domains, troubles with his eldest son, and threatened invasions of England by the Danes. In 1086 William ordered the compilation of the Domesday Book, a survey listing all the landholders in England along with <b>their</b> <b>holdings.</b> William died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in Caen. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, the settling of a new Norman nobility on the land, and change {{in the composition of}} the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire, but instead continued to administer each part separately. William's lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to his eldest son, Robert Curthose, and his second surviving son, William Rufus, received England.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, the Manhattan Valley {{neighborhood}} (then {{known as}} Bloomingdale), where the Master Building is located, saw its culturally-oriented middle class renters depart. Many of them, it was said, opted to buy {{houses in the}} suburban New York metropolitan area. As a consequence, the museum and cultural center lost their audience and in 1971 {{they were forced to}} close. <b>Their</b> <b>holdings</b> were donated to Brandeis University and cultural initiatives such as the Master Institute Chorus, founded in 1960, either folded, or, {{as in the case of}} the chorus, became affiliated with other organizations, such as the New Amsterdam Singers. The Horches' daughter, Oriole, became advisory consultant for the collection at Brandeis. The building's auditorium continued to present concerts, plays, readings, and lectures in the 1940s and into the 1950s. From 1961 through 1978 the Equity Library Theater leased it for productions showcasing the talents of New York actors.|$|E
5|$|In 972 Oswald {{was made}} Archbishop of York and journeyed to Rome {{to receive a}} pallium from Pope John XIII. It is {{possible}} that he also traveled on Edgar's behalf {{to the court of}} the Emperor Otto I, and that these two journeys had been combined. He continued to hold the see of Worcester in addition to York. The holding of Worcester in addition to York became traditional for almost the next fifty years. Although it was uncanonical, it had many advantages for York in that it added a much richer diocese to <b>their</b> <b>holdings,</b> and one which was more peaceful as well. When Edgar died in 975, Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, broke up many monastic communities, some of which were Oswald's foundations. Ramsey, however, was not disturbed, probably due to the patronage of Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia, son of Æthelstan Half-King. Ælfhere was a supporter of Ethelred the Unready, the son of Edgar's third marriage, while Oswald supported the son of Edgar's first marriage, Edward the Martyr, in the dispute over who would succeed King Edgar.|$|E

5|$|The {{journey to}} the Eastern Mediterranean was inevitably long and eventful. Travelling overland, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, drowned in the Saleph River, and few of his men reached the Eastern Mediterranean. Travelling by sea, Richard the Lionheart, King of England conquered Cyprus in 1191 in {{response}} to his sister and fiancée, who were travelling separately, being taken captive by the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos. Philip II of France was the first king to arrive at the siege of Acre; Richard arrived on 8June 1191. The arrival of the French and Angevin forces turned the tide in the conflict, and the Muslim garrison of Acre finally surrendered on 12July. Philip considered his vow fulfilled and returned to France to deal with domestic matters, leaving most of his forces behind. But Richard travelled south along the Mediterranean coast, defeated the Muslims near Arsuf, and recaptured the port city of Jaffa. He twice advanced to within a day's march of Jerusalem before judging that he lacked the resources to successfully capture the city, or defend it in the unlikely event of a successful assault, while Saladin had a mustered army. This marked the end of Richard's crusading career and was a calamitous blow to Frankish morale. A three-year truce was negotiated that allowed Catholics unfettered access to Jerusalem. Politics in England and illness forced Richard's departure, never to return, and Saladin died in March 1193. Emperor HenryVI initiated the German Crusade to fulfil the promises made by his father, Frederick, to undertake a Crusade to the Holy Land. Led by Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, the army captured the cities of Sidon and Beirut. However, in 1197 Henry died and most of the Crusaders returned to Germany to protect <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> and take part in the election of his successor as Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{support for}} Diệm {{came from the}} Australian Catholic media. Diệm was a Catholic in a {{majority}} Buddhist country, and he had close religious links with the Vatican, who had helped him rise to power. He had stayed in a seminary run by Cardinal Francis Spellman in the United States in the early 1950s before his elevation to power. Diệm's elder brother Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic figure in Vietnam and a classmate of Spellman when the pair studied in Rome. Spellman was {{widely regarded as the}} most powerful Catholic figure in the United States and he helped to organise support for Diệm among American politicians, particularly Catholics. In 1957, Diệm dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary and ruled {{on the basis of a}} Catholic doctrine known as personalism. His younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu ran the secret and autocratic Catholic Cần Lao Party (Personalist Labor Party), which provided a clandestine network of support and police-state mechanisms to protect Diệm's rule. It counted many leading public servants and military officers among its members. Diệm also maintained land policies that were preferential to the Roman Catholic Church, the largest property owner in the country. <b>Their</b> <b>holdings</b> were exempt from redistribution under land reform schemes, while the construction of Buddhist temples was restricted; military and civil service promotions were given preferentially to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies and in some areas, forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas occurred.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, {{efforts have been}} made to {{identify}} which vineyards in the Barolo zones produce the highest quality of wine. Inspired by the prestige and high prices charged for Grand cru bottlings of Burgundy wine, Barolo producers began separating <b>their</b> <b>holdings</b> into individual vineyard lots and labeling the wines with these single vineyard designations. The practice became so extensive that some producers were doing single vineyard bottlings and charging high prices on all <b>their</b> <b>holdings,</b> regardless of whether the particular vineyard quality merited such a practice.|$|E
