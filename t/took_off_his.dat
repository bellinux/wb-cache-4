5|$|Tallon {{retired in}} {{dramatic}} circumstances {{after the first}} match of the 195354 Sheffield Shield season. During the match, he suddenly <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> gloves and handed the keeping duties to Peter Burge. He scored 21 and 54 not out in a drawn match against New South Wales. Two months later, he played for Arthur Morris's XI against Hassett's XI, a testimonial match for the latter. Tallon made 17 not out and nine in a 121-run win. Tallon continued to play local cricket in Bundaberg for another decade.|$|E
5|$|Phil Boersma {{opened the}} scoring for Liverpool in the 20th minute {{when he was}} first to reach the loose ball that had been blocked by David Harvey from a shot by Keegan. Later in the first half, a shot by Emlyn Hughes from outside the penalty area hit the Leeds crossbar. The match was notorious for the fistfight between Bremner and Keegan, who were jointly {{dismissed}} by referee Bob Matthewson after sixty minutes' play. Keegan, who was angry with the decision because he claimed provocation, <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> shirt as he left the field and threw it away. Bremner, several yards behind him, then did the same. Trevor Cherry headed home the Leeds equaliser in the 70th minute and the match finished 1–1.|$|E

5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the battle}} began, Yudhishthira did {{something}} unexpected. He suddenly dropped his weapons, <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> armour {{and started walking}} towards the Kaurava army with folded hands in prayer. The Pandava brothers and the Kauravas looked on in disbelief, thinking Yudhishthira was surrendering before the first arrow was shot. Yudhishthira's purpose became clear, however, when he fell on Bhishma's feet to seek his blessing for success in battle. Bhishma, grandfather to both the Pandavas and Kauravas, blessed Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira returned to his chariot and the battle was ready to commence.|$|E
25|$|Legend {{has it that}} in 1191, Dietmar der Anhanger - a miller's son - {{obtained}} the market town of Ried as a fiefdom from Frederick I. (Barbarossa). Allegedly, Dietmar boosted {{the morale of the}} troops during the crusade: When the enemy had overthrown the flag of the army in Iconium, Dietmar <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> boot and put it onto a lance; under that sign, the crusaders took new courage and managed to conquer the city. The peasants' boot of this legend is now part of the city's coat of arms.|$|E
25|$|Most goalkeepers also wear {{gloves to}} improve their grip on the ball, and to protect {{themselves}} from injury. Some gloves now include rigid plastic spines down each finger to help prevent injuries such as jammed and sprained fingers. Though gloves are not mandatory attire, it is uncommon for goalkeepers to opt against them due to the advantages they offer. At UEFA Euro 2004, Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo famously <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> gloves for the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against England. He then went on to score a penalty in sudden death before saving Darius Vassell's penalty to win it for the Portuguese.|$|E

25|$|On 8 February 1814 Phoebe and Cherub {{arrived at}} Valparaíso, a neutral port, where Essex and her prizes were anchored. Having trapped Essex in the harbour, Hillyar waited six weeks {{for her to}} come out and thwarted all of the efforts of her captain, David Porter, to escape. Eventually, on 28 March, Porter {{attempted}} {{to break out of the}} harbour. A squall <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> main topmast and he attempted to return to harbour but Phoebe and Cherub drove Essex into a nearby bay and defeated her in a short engagement. Phoebe and Cherub also captured Essex's tender, Essex Junior, the ex-British whaler Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|The {{substitute}} sat on {{the bench}} and began the game wearing a green vest over his playing guernsey. He was not permitted to enter the field of play, nor be interchanged while wearing the green vest. At any time during the game, he could be substituted for one of the other players in the team - either on the ground or on the bench. He <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> green vest, and the player he substituted put on a red vest. The player in the red vest could take no further part in the game. Teams were limited to a single substitution per game. Players were substituted for tactical reasons or to replace an injured player.|$|E
25|$|Led {{from the}} front by Steve Waugh, Australia began the day at a {{precarious}} 291/8 but that {{would prove to be}} the high of the day for India. The 35 yr old Waugh batted well with Gillespie and then Glenn McGrath – and crossed numerous landmarks on the way – as he took Australia to a total of 445. In the process the Australian captain notched up his 25th Test century, crossing Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 24 hundreds at the time. Having never made a Test hundred in India, Waugh was more emotional than normal as he tugged at the red handkerchief in his pocket, <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> helmet and raised his bat to a full house Eden crowd. He also passed Javed Miandad to become the (then) 4th highest run getter in test cricket.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{it is well}} {{established}} that Caspar had been niggling Coleman since the very start of the match, which included making persistent and heavy contact with a nasty boil on Coleman's neck; and that Caspar had punched Coleman twice whilst play was {{at the other end}} of the ground, immediately before Coleman retaliated; and that, apart from his reaction to Caspar's thuggery, Coleman had not been proactive in any way. The match to that time had been a somewhat brutal encounter, and the crowd was highly agitated. During the match bottles were thrown at Coleman, and as he came off the ground at half-time, and walked up the players race, a Carlton fan spat at him through gaps in the cyclone wired barriers that separated the spectators from the players. Coleman snapped, and smashed the fan in the face, badly hurting his hand. He went into the Essendon rooms, shouting with rage at the total absence of any protection from the match officials, <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> jumper, and spoke of not returning to the field.|$|E
25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, Duggan started a short feud with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase after Rhodes and DiBiase tried to {{convince}} Duggan to retire and let the young talent run the show. Soon after, Duggan would come out and announce {{that he would take}} Rhodes and DiBiase's advice and retire, but Jerry Lawler stopped him by convincing Duggan to stay. Duggan and Lawler then wrestled Rhodes and DiBiase on the August 25, 2008 edition of Raw, but lost the match. On the October 20 edition of Raw, Duggan confronted Santino Marella and Beth Phoenix during one of Marella's tirades against his three possible opponents at Cyber Sunday (Roddy Piper, Goldust, and The Honky Tonk Man). Upset at being interrupted, Marella <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> clothes, getting ready to fight Duggan. Yet before a fight could begin, Marella instructed Phoenix to throw the clothes in Duggan's face, a move that temporarily distracted Duggan. Marella then smashed a guitar over Duggan's head, ending the segment. Duggan would appear on Raws 800th episode during Kung Fu Naki's in-ring dance segment, which also involved various other members of the WWE roster.|$|E
