40|$|This {{paper is}} in three parts {{describing}} {{the analysis and}} simulation of the grinding process. This first part {{is concerned with the}} generation of the wheel surface by single point <b>diamond</b> <b>dressing.</b> In grinding, the grinding wheel has to be dressed periodically to restore wheel form and cutting efficiency. Understanding the process of generating the grinding wheel surface is important for the control of the grinding process. Generation of the wheel surface is simulated as a single <b>diamond</b> <b>dressing</b> process on a computer generated wheel. The wheel is simulated by grains randomly spaced in the wheel volume. The topography of the wheel cutting surface is generated by simulating the action of an ideal dressing tool as it dresses the wheel. The simulation of the wheel topography takes account of the motion of the dressing tool, grain size, grain spacing, grain fracture and grain break-out. The simulated cutting surface is used for further simulations of grinding. The simulation of grinding using the simulated grinding wheel surface is described in Sections 2 and 3 where a comparison is made of results predicted from simulation with results obtained from experiments. By matching simulated and experimental results, it is possible to explain the relative importance of dressing and grinding parameters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Gear honing with globoid honing worms {{is seldom}} used {{because it has}} no {{distinct}} advantages to honing with internal geared honing rings. The paper puts forward a new process to honing gear with globoid honing worms on hobbing machines. First the globoid honing worm is profiled by <b>diamond</b> <b>dressing</b> gears, which has the same geometric parameters with the machined gears. Then the profiled globoid honing worm is used to hone workpieces. Both the profiling process and honing process are implemented on same hobbing machines. Meshing and Tooth contact analysis of globoid honing worm profiling has been considered. Meshing equation of profiling process and equation of globoid honing worm tooth flank after profiling are obtained. Experiment testified {{that it is an}} applied process and has many advantages...|$|R

40|$|Between {{different}} machining processes, {{dry grinding}} {{is one of}} the most difficult processes because of the nature of chip formation in grinding. This paper presents some of the interesting results of the systematic research work which was done by the authors to make a step forward in pure dry grinding based on: - The optimisation of the chip formation reduces the friction and rubbing in the process - Process heat transfer without using coolant lubricant Results focused on grinding forces and the corresponding heat generation. A new method is presented to reduce heat energy by special conditioning using a <b>diamond</b> <b>dressing</b> disc, for dressing of the CBN vitrified bond wheel, based on a new innovative concept. The results showed a drastic reduction in grinding forces with the same material removal rate compared to that of a normal process without conditioning, and no burning or workpiece surface damage were noted...|$|R
