The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers.

A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment.

500|$|Thirty {{critically}} wounded U.S. {{troops were}} stranded {{at the top}} of a mountain. Attended to by only two non-combatants, a chaplain and a medic, the wounded were discovered by a North Korean patrol. Though <b>the</b> <b>medic</b> was able to escape, the North Koreans executed the unarmed chaplain as he prayed over the wounded, then killed the rest of them. The massacre was one of several incidents that led U.S. commanders to establish a commission in July to look into war crimes during the war. The same month, the North Korean commanders, concerned about the way their soldiers were treating prisoners of war, laid out stricter guidelines for handling enemy captives. [...] Other than this change, the historiography of the incident in North Korean sources is largely unknown; as a result, sources detailing the incident are almost exclusively from the United States and other United Nations allies.|$|E

500|$|The {{operation}} did {{not include}} soldiers to handle the evacuation control center (ECC), which {{was set up in}} the JAO. A 44-person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the ECC was planned for insertion with the CH-53E Super Stallions after they had returned to the Guam. However, this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail. The deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail. The evacuees were grouped into 15-person [...] "sticks" [...] to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece. Some attempted to bring more, resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation. Furthermore, many evacuees had pets they wanted to bring, which were not allowed. Most pets were killed by their owners; some were given poison. Meanwhile, the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy's commissary, such as candy, sodas, and souvenirs (most had been stationed on ships for several months). They were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy; <b>the</b> <b>medic</b> filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship.|$|E
500|$|Task Force Smith {{managed to}} hold its lines for three hours, but at 14:30 Smith ordered the Americans to withdraw, {{suffering}} from low ammunition and a breakdown of communications. At this point North Korean forces were moving on both flanks of the American force and toward {{the rear of the}} formation. Smith ordered an orderly withdrawal of the force one unit at a time, allowing the rest of the force to cover it as it withdrew. C Company pulled back, followed by the American medics, the headquarters, and finally B Company. 2nd Platoon, B Company, however, did not receive the withdrawal order. When the platoon discovered that it was alone, {{it was too late for}} an orderly withdrawal and it could not move its wounded quickly enough. The platoon left most of its equipment in its positions, which was captured by the North Koreans. Most of the survivors were able to escape captivity but a number of wounded litter-borne U.S. soldiers were left behind along with an attending medic. The American wounded were later found shot to death in their litters; <b>the</b> <b>medic</b> was never seen again. One North Korean officer later told historian John Toland that the American forces at the battle seemed [...] "too frightened to fight".|$|E
500|$|De la Rúa {{started to}} work in {{politics}} from a very young age. He was nicknamed [...] "Chupete" [...] (...) because of this; the nickname was still used when he grew up. During Carlos Menem's administration he was perceived as a serious and formal politician, in stark contrast with Menem's style. De la Rúa took advantage of this perception during the electoral campaign of 1999. When he became president and the economic crisis worsened, he was perceived as a weak and tired man who was unable {{to react to the}} crisis. He was perceived as a man without leadership who could not make use of his presidential authority. De la Rúa considers that the parody of the television comedian Freddy Villarreal helped to establish that image. He sought to change his image by appearing on the television comedy show El show de Videomatch, but it backfired. He confused the names of the show and that of the host Marcelo Tinelli's wife. After De la Rúa's participation ended, Tinelli began to close the program; De la Rúa could be seen seeking an exit from the set in the background. The popular image was further strengthened when he was hospitalized for peripheral artery disease caused by high blood cholesterol. Although it is a standard, simple medical intervention, <b>the</b> <b>medic</b> told the press De la Rúa suffered from arteriosclerosis, which is usually linked with a lack of speed and reflexes.|$|E

He engaged the group, killing one of the attackers, and Fennell fired several grenades.
