Maria, while escaping, encounters him, who just mimics her, and they escape into a women's bathroom. Sarah Jane then enters, and although they are surprised to see each other, they manage to escape the factory, albeit without Kelsey.

5|$|The novel {{begins in}} Gotham City where Batman {{attempts}} to thwart a crime {{but he is}} being pursued by the police force who consider him a villain. In Metropolis Superman {{is seen as a}} hero as he rescues a sinking passenger boat. Lex Luthor, head of LuthorCorp, is allying himself with Soviet General Anatoly Ceridov who is mining and experimenting with kryptonite in Siberia. Luthor intends to stoke fears of an alien invasion and sell anti-alien defenses to world governments. What appears to be an alien spacecraft flies over United States airspace and is confronted by the air force and Superman, but is ultimately stopped by LutherCorp airplanes. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter-ego, discovers that Lex Luthor is blackmailing members of Wayne Enterprises' board of directors to steal technology designs, allowing him to beat Wayne Enterprises on military contracts. As Batman, Wayne infiltrates Luthor's mansion to gather evidence but also steals Luthor's sample of kryptonite which sets off alarms. Superman and Batman confront each other, suspicious of the other's motives, but both flee as security forces respond to <b>the</b> <b>alarms.</b> Wayne turns his board of directors into double agents, having them give faulty technology to Luthor. To demonstrate his defensive capabilities, Luthor has Ceridov launch nuclear missiles from Russia to the US but Luthor's faulty systems fail and Superman stops the missiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that <b>the</b> <b>alarms</b> were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the bronze statue of Perseus and the medallions previously referred to, the works of art in existence today are a medallion of Clement VII commemorating the peace between the Christian princes, 1530, with a bust of the pope on the reverse and a figure of Peace setting fire to a heap of {{arms in front of}} the temple of Janus, signed with the artist's name; a signed portrait medal of Francis; a medal of Cardinal Pietro Bembo; and the celebrated gold, enamel and ivory salt cellar (known as Saliera) made for Francis I of France at Vienna. This intricate 26-cm-high sculpture, of a value conservatively estimated at 58,000,000 schilling, was commissioned by Francis I. Its principal figures are a naked sea god and a woman, sitting opposite each other with legs entwined, symbolically representing the planet Earth. Saliera was stolen from the Kunsthistorisches Museum on 11 May 2003 by a thief who climbed scaffolding and smashed windows to enter the museum.

25|$|By {{the end of}} July a large Viet Cong {{force had}} been {{detected}} by SAS patrols east of Nui Dat, near the abandoned village of Long Tan. In response, 6 RAR launched a battalion search and destroy operation. During a series of fire-fights on 25 July a company from D445 Battalion bounced off C Company, {{and in the process}} of retreating assaulted B Company occupying a blocking position, before being driven off with heavy casualties. In the following days further clashes occurred around Long Tan, resulting in 13 Viet Cong killed and 19 wounded, and Australian losses of three killed and 19 wounded. Yet with the inhabitants resettled, the village fortified and the perimeter regularly patrolled, the Australians considered the area secure. However, with the 274th and 275th Regiments still at large, uncertainty resulted in growing tension in 1 ATF. Believing Viet Cong sympathisers had returned to Long Tan, they planned to search the area again on 29 July. That afternoon, as 6 RAR commenced a detailed search following its initial sweep, Jackson ordered its immediate return to Nui Dat in response to South Vietnamese reports of a large Viet Cong presence close to the base, with the battalion airlifted out by early evening. Although the warnings were unconfirmed and an attack against Nui Dat was considered unlikely, 1 ATF was re-postured. Company patrols were sent out in each direction over the following days, but found little of significance. Jackson had seemed to over-react, and his requests for assistance from US II FFV were denied. Later intelligence discredited the original reporting and the crisis subsided, yet it was indicative of <b>the</b> <b>alarms</b> 1 ATF experienced during the first months of its lodgement and their effect.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were mostly positive. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio felt that [...] "most of Ortved's work {{provides}} a solid basic history." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a [...] "B+", writing, [...] "you have to admire all the work that went into this unauthorized history." [...] He noted that he [...] "felt a little bad afterward for the central players who got sucker punched. [...] The subsequent testimony about the empire Groening created is contentious and mesmerizing. It's also conflicting and compromised, since {{some of the biggest}} fishies of all did not talk to Ortved. [...] The reader should be wary when sources assert that Groening is little more than an affable frontman for the show or that Brooks sometimes wielded his power imperiously: The guys aren't there to defend themselves. In most cases, though, Ortved amasses quotes from many sources to establish such points, so the negative stuff doesn't seem gratuitous." [...] Michael C. Lorah of Newsarama described the book as a [...] "very effective, very worthwhile read" [...] but felt that Ortved's [...] "editorializing" [...] was [...] "probably the most distracting element {{of the book}}." [...] Michael Hingston of See Magazine called the book [...] "a well-told patchwork that shines formidable light on the show" [...] and gave it three and a half stars. However, he felt the book was released prematurely and should have been published {{after the end of the}} show, also criticizing Ortved's narration and the lack of quotes from Matt Groening or James L. Brooks. Kyle Ryan of The A.V.

50|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is how the}} sensor (through its cable, if applicable) is attached to its alarm or transmitter {{in the case of}} wired alarms or wireless alarms. Some wireless alarms are truly wireless, with the transmitter being part of the sensor and completely self-contained. For wired <b>alarms,</b> <b>the</b> sensor's wire (or cable) runs from the sensor (located at the point of urination) underneath the user's pajama shirt to wherever <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> is located on the body (frequently on the collar of the pajama shirt, so that it is close to the ear). The attachment mechanism to <b>the</b> <b>alarm,</b> through which <b>the</b> electric current flows to <b>the</b> <b>alarm,</b> is important. If it is easily detached (unintentionally comes out from <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> during use) <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> may not be triggered. Most connectors are plastic telephone jacks which are very unlikely to be detached unintentionally (RJ-11, RJ-12, 616E, etc.).|$|R

2500|$|Many {{crossings}} in {{the country}} now are composed of lights, alarms and full, half or no barriers.

2500|$|The use of {{acoustic}} alarms {{to mitigate}} by-catch {{and also to}} protect aquaculture sites has been proposed but has advantages and risks associated with <b>the</b> <b>alarms.</b> Acoustic deterrent devices, or pingers, have {{reduced the number of}} cetaceans caught in gill nets. Harbour porpoises have been effectively excluded from bottom-set gill nets during many experiments for instance in the Gulf of Maine, along the Olympic Peninsula, in the Bay of Fundy, and in the North Sea. All of these studies show up to a 90% decrease in harbour porpoise bycatch. Pingers work because they produce a sound that is aversive (20; 15).

50|$|Belding's ground {{squirrel}} provides an example. The {{ground squirrel}} gives an alarm call to warn its local {{group of the}} presence of a predator. By emitting <b>the</b> <b>alarm,</b> it gives its own location away, putting itself in more danger. In the process, however, the squirrel may protect its relatives within the local group (along {{with the rest of the}} group). Therefore, if the effect of the trait influencing <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> call typically protects the other squirrels in the immediate area, it will lead to the passing on of more copies of <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> call trait in the next generation than the squirrel could leave by reproducing on its own.

2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 10 March the radar station at Geraldton repeatedly detected what its crew believed was an unidentified aircraft. Acting upon advice from Brownell, the commanding officer of III Corps Lieutenant General Gordon Bennett ordered an air raid warning for Fremantle and Perth. This led to No. 85 Squadron being readied, air raid sirens being sounded, air raid wardens taking their posts and the evacuation of hospitals. However, no raid eventuated and the [...] "all clear" [...] siren was soon sounded.

Several businesses, including cafes, theaters and night clubs, lost many customers. One business reported a 20% drop. The evenings were hopping, but the streets were practically deserted when dawn approached. The city became a virtual ghost town. Because of the drop in business, liquor stores closed at 9:30 and posted a statement in the paper saying, [...] "We fully understand the state of mind in which Texarkana is now gripped.

[...] Since citizens were so jittery and armed with guns, Texarkana was a very dangerous place. Officers had to turn their siren on when they drove up, get out and stand in their headlights and announce themselves to keep from being shot by a nervous homeowner. In order to go to someone's house, you had to call in advance and let them know to expect you. A fearful tavern proprietor had shot a customer in the foot who was in search of beer.|$|E
