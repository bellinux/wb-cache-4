Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind {{at the last moment}} and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from diarrhoea.

5|$|Mary, disspirited, yields to Gilmore's importunements, warning {{him that}} theirs {{must be a}} long {{engagement}} and that she will end it if Captain Marrable finds himself able to marry a woman without a fortune. This comes to pass: {{the death of the}} Captain's cousin, <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family's baronetcy, makes him the likely eventual heir. The current Baronet accepts the Captain as his heir, buying out the Colonel's interest to prevent his squandering the family fortune. The two lovers are reunited, leaving Gilmore bitter and despondent.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1914 the Bosnian-Serb Gavrilo Princip assassinated <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{throne of}} Austria-Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{in the name}} of Serbian nationalism.

50|$|Hornblower {{finds his}} new duties {{different}} from that of commanding a naval vessel or squadron. He finds his role demanding, in part because he is such a demanding perfectionist.

5|$|The Prince of Wales – {{the future}} Edward VIII – was keen to {{participate}} in the war but the government refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne were captured. Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare at first hand and attempted to visit the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The citadel was {{not used}} during the rule of Gia Long and the only {{military}} action occurred after his son had ascended the throne as Minh Mạng.

Tension between the pair surfaced when Gia Long made Minh Mang <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne.

5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Haiko, {{the family moved to}} a rented house in Porvoo where, in August 1917, Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, her only son and <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dynasty. The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir. She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young man}} destined {{to serve in the}} navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who was {{stationed}} in Malta. There, he grew close to {{and fell in love with}} his uncle's daughter, Princess Marie. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but the mothers—the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Edinburgh—both opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. Marie's mother was the only daughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. She resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married Ferdinand, <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King of Romania, in 1893.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Duke's {{marriage}} in 1815, it seemed to have little dynastic significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince Regent, was the King's only legitimate grandchild. The young Princess was expected to have children who would secure the British succession, especially after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1816. Both the Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, while the next two brothers, the Dukes of Clarence and Kent, were unmarried. On 6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King George was left with twelve surviving children, and no surviving legitimate grandchildren. Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable brides and hastened to the altar, hoping to father <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne.|$|E
5|$|Before Cyrus and {{his army}} crossed the Aras River to {{battle with the}} Armenians, he {{installed}} his son Cambyses II as king in case he should not return from battle. However, once Cyrus had crossed the Aras River, he had a vision in which Darius had wings atop his shoulders and stood upon the confines of Europe and Asia (the known world). When Cyrus awoke from the dream, he inferred it as a great danger to the future security of the empire, as it meant that Darius would one day rule the whole world. However, his son Cambyses was <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne, not Darius, causing Cyrus to wonder if Darius was forming treasonable and ambitious designs. This led Cyrus to order Hystaspes {{to go back to}} Persis and watch over his son strictly, until Cyrus himself returned. Darius did not seem to have any treasonous thoughts as Cambyses II ascended the throne peacefully; and, through promotion, Darius was eventually elevated to be Cambyses's personal lancer.|$|E
5|$|Before her marriage, Louise {{served as}} an {{unofficial}} secretary to her mother, the Queen (1866–1871). The question of Louise's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s. Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested, but Victoria wanted new blood {{in the family and}} therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the aristocracy. Despite opposition from members of the royal family, Louise fell in love with John, Marquess of Lorne, <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Argyll. Victoria consented to the marriage, which took place on 21 March 1871. Despite a happy beginning, the two drifted apart, possibly because of their childlessness and the Queen's constraints on their activities.|$|E
