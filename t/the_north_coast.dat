5|$|<b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha was a {{streamlined}} {{passenger train}} operated by Amtrak between Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington, in the United States. It operated from 1971 to 1979. The train was {{a successor to}} the Northern Pacific Railway's North Coast Limited and Mainstreeter, although it used {{the route of the}} Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad ("Milwaukee Road") east of Minneapolis–Saint Paul. The train's name combined <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Limited with the Milwaukee Road's famed Hiawathas. Created {{at the behest of the}} United States Congress, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha enjoyed an uncertain existence before being discontinued in 1979. Since then there have been several attempts to restore the service, without success.|$|E

5|$|On November 14, 1971, Amtrak {{formally}} named {{this service}} <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha, with a tri-weekly schedule between Chicago and Spokane {{independent of the}} Empire Builder. In Spokane it combined with the Empire Builder {{for the trip to}} Seattle. On the other four days of the week the train terminated in Minneapolis. Amtrak initially named the Minneapolis train Hiawatha, but adopted the Twin Cities Hiawatha name on January 16, 1972. Amtrak reverted to Hiawatha on October 29, and this name remained until <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha went daily {{for the first time on}} May 19, 1974.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 that <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after a rash of derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Coast</b> Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E
