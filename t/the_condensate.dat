40|$|We {{review the}} recent {{developments}} which {{had taken place in}} the domain of quasi one dimensional BECs from the viewpoint of integrability. To start with, we consider the dynamics of scalar BECs in a time independent harmonic trap and observe that the scattering length (SL) can be suitably manipulated either to compress the bright solitons to attain peak matter wave density without causing their explosion or to broaden the width of <b>the</b> <b>condensates</b> without diluting them. When the harmonic trap frequency becomes time dependent, we notice that one can stabilize <b>the</b> <b>condensates</b> in <b>the</b> confining domain while the density of <b>the</b> <b>condensates</b> continue to increase in the expulsive region. We also observe that the trap frequency and the temporal SL can be maneuvered to generate matter wave interference patterns indicating the coherent nature of the atoms in <b>the</b> <b>condensates.</b> We also notice that a small repulsive three body interaction when reinforced with attractive binary interaction can extend the region of stability of <b>the</b> <b>condensates</b> in <b>the</b> quasi-one dimensional regime. On the other hand, the investigation of two component BECs in a time dependent harmonic trap suggests {{that it is possible to}} switch matter wave energy from one mode to the other confirming the fact that vector BECs are long lived compared to scalar BECs. The Feshbach resonance management of vector BECs indicates that the two component BECs in a time dependent harmonic trap are more stable compared to <b>the</b> <b>condensates</b> in a time independent trap. The introduction of weak time dependent Rabi coupling rapidly compresses the bright solitons which however can be again stabilized through Feshbach resonance or by finetuning the Rabi coupling while the spatial coupling of vector BECs introduces a phase difference between <b>the</b> <b>condensates</b> which subsequently can be exploited to generate interference pattern in the bright or dark solitons.

25|$|The Gross–Pitaevskii {{model of}} BEC is a {{physical}} approximation valid for certain classes of BECs. By construction, the GPE uses the following simplifications: it assumes that interactions between condensate particles are of the contact two-body type and also neglects anomalous contributions to self-energy. These assumptions are suitable mostly for the dilute three-dimensional condensates. If one relaxes any of these assumptions, the equation for <b>the</b> <b>condensate</b> wavefunction acquires the terms containing higher-order powers of the wavefunction. Moreover, for some physical systems the amount of such terms {{turns out to be}} infinite, therefore, the equation becomes essentially non-polynomial.

25|$|The {{water is}} {{pressurized}} in two stages, and flows {{through a series}} of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage.

25|$|In {{each of the}} {{examples}} discussed so far the constituents have been miscible in all proportions with each other. For example, any amount of ethanol can be mixed with any amount of water to form a homogeneous solution. There are pairs of solvents for which {{this is not the}} case. For example, if equal volumes of chloroform (water solubility 0.8 g/100 ml at 20°C) and water are shaken together and then left to stand, the liquid will separate into two layers. Analysis of the layers shows that the top layer is mostly water {{with a small amount of}} chloroform dissolved in it, and the bottom layer is mostly chloroform with a small amount of water dissolved in it. If the two layers are heated together, the system of layers will boil at 53.3°C, which is lower than either the boiling point of chloroform (61.2°C) or the boiling point of water (100°C). The vapor will consist of 97.0% chloroform and 3.0% water regardless of how much of each liquid layer is present (provided both layers are indeed present).

500|$|The {{building}} {{will have a}} total of 59 elevators, five {{of which will be}} double-deck elevators, as well as 12escalators. It will also have the highest observation deck in the world, to which high speed elevators will travel at up to 10 metres (33feet) per second (slightly over [...] ) in both directions. The elevators cannot go faster because the change in air pressure at such a rapid speed could cause nausea; at , the air pressure is over 10 kPa (1.5 psi) lower than at ground level (a 10% reduction in air pressure). They must also be efficient so the cables are not unbearably heavy. Jeddah Tower will have three sky lobbies where elevator transfers can be made, and no elevator will go from the bottom to the highest occupied floor. No official floor count has been given; however, Smith stated in a television interview that it will be about 50 floors more than the Burj Khalifa, which has 163occupied floors, leading to the inference that Jeddah Tower will have over 200floors. The tower will also feature a large, roughly [...] diameter outdoor balcony, known as the sky terrace, {{on one side of the}} building for private use by the penthouse floor at level 157; it is not the observation deck.

The building's large notches will also serve as shaded terraces for other areas of the tower and the exterior of the {{building will}} use low-conductivity glass to save on cooling costs by reducing thermal loads. In addition, the lower air density, exacerbated by the thin desert atmosphere, will cause the outdoor air temperature towards the top of the tower to be lower than the ground level air, which will provide natural cooling.
