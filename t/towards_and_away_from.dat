5|$|The slight {{eccentricity}} of Europa's orbit, {{maintained by}} the gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point to oscillate around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate <b>towards</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes. The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.|$|E
25|$|The {{orbit of}} the Moon is {{distinctly}} elliptical, {{with an average}} eccentricity of 0.0549. The non-circular form of the lunar orbit causes variations in the Moon's angular speed and apparent size as it moves <b>towards</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> an observer on Earth. The mean angular movement relative to an imaginary observer at the barycentre is ° per day to the east (Julian day 2000).|$|E

Along this line, the North American Plate has been rupturing. Earth's lithosphere consists of several large tectonic plates, which slowly move <b>towards</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> one another, either converging and subducting or diverging and rifting; volcanoes and earthquakes are generated by these activities.

25|$|Because {{the lunar}} orbit is also {{inclined}} to Earth's ecliptic plane by 5.1°, the rotational {{axis of the}} Moon seems to rotate <b>towards</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth during one complete orbit. This {{is referred to as}} latitudinal libration, which allows one to see almost 7° of latitude beyond the pole on the far side. Finally, because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth's centre of mass, an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter. This gives rise to a diurnal libration, which allows one to view an additional one degree's worth of lunar longitude. For the same reason, observers at both of Earth's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree's worth of libration in latitude.|$|E
25|$|COROT-7b has {{a maximum}} surface {{temperature}} between 1800 and 2600°C (3300 to 4700 degrees Fahrenheit). Due to the high temperature, it may be covered in lava. The composition and density of the planet, though weakly constrained, make COROT-7b a probably rocky planet, like Earth. It could belong to a class of planets that are thought to contain up to 40% water (in the form of ice and/or vapor) in addition to rock. However, {{the fact that it}} formed so close to its parent star may mean that it is depleted of volatiles. A strong possibility exists that the planet's rotation is tidally locked to the orbital period, so that temperatures and geologic conditions {{on the sides of the}} planet facing <b>towards</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the star may be dramatically different. Theoretical work suggests that CoRoT-7b could be a chthonian planet (the remains of a Neptune-like planet from which much of the initial mass has been removed due to close proximity to its parent star). Other researchers dispute this, and conclude COROT-7b was always a rocky planet and not the eroded core of a gas or ice giant, due to the young age of the star system.|$|E

500|$|The Constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia [...] "commit Anglicans to {{mainstream}} Christian orthodoxy", but its ruling principles direct {{it to that}} particular tradition within as [...] "represented by the Church of England". The Australian church had {{to work out the}} meaning of its common heritage [...] "in the context of the different cultures of the separate colonies" [...] but [...] "the way in which that faith pedigree was appealed to and interpreted... has highlighted differences." [...] Peter Carnley, former primate of the Anglican Church of Australia, has described Anglicanism's [...] "unique or essential identity" [...] as having [...] "not so much a body of theological teaching, as a style of theological reflection" [...] that goes back to the Elizabethan theologian Richard Hooker. St James' conforms to this Anglican tradition, part of which is a general dislike {{of what used to be}} referred to as 'Enthusiasm': that is, a dislike of [...] "pious individualism and emotional exuberance". St James' theological position in the liturgy is evidently consistent with Carnley's explanation that incarnational reality [...] "might be experienced with the aid of aesthetic, symbolic or sacramental aids to worship." [...] Such an adherence to the importance of the sacred and the sublime in worship remains in sharp contradistinction to practice in the surrounding mostly evangelical diocese, which typically eschews beauty and holds to an [...] "ultra-low ecclesiastical aesthetic" [...] that is combined with [...] "ultra-conservative social values". Teaching at St James' takes account of both the Biblical and contemporary historical context. In the Sydney diocese, St James's differing view has therefore been controversial since the 19th century as the various rectors led the church <b>towards</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Anglo-Catholicism.

Visitors are only allowed on the 41st floor as the 42nd floor can only be used by the tenants of the building.|$|E
2500|$|Because the Moon's mass is a {{considerable}} fraction of that of Earth (about 1:81), the two bodies {{can be regarded as}} a double planet system, rather than as a planet with a satellite. [...] The plane of the Moon's orbit around Earth lies close to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic), rather than in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of Earth (the equator) as is usually the case with planetary satellites. [...] The mass of the Moon is sufficiently large, and it is sufficiently close, to raise tides in the matter of Earth. In particular, the water of the oceans bulges out <b>towards</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Moon. The average tidal bulge is synchronized with the Moon's orbit, and Earth rotates under this tidal bulge in just over a day. However, Earth's rotation drags the position of the tidal bulge ahead of the position directly under the Moon. As a consequence, there exists a substantial amount of mass in the bulge that is offset from the line through the centers of Earth and the Moon. Because of this offset, a portion of the gravitational pull between Earth's tidal bulges and the Moon is not parallel to the Earth–Moon line, i.e. there exists a torque between Earth and the Moon. This boosts the Moon in its orbit, and slows the rotation of Earth.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{players such}} as Robbie Breathnach, Tommy Hayes, Aidan [...] "Scobie" [...] McDonnell, Abe Doron, and Damien Quinn {{developed}} sophisticated pitch-varying techniques which allow players to follow the tune being played. This was {{the birth of the}} [...] "top-end" [...] style. Their breakthrough in this style has achieved local and international acclaim with many beginners now being educated in this manner. This [...] "top-end" [...] style, is often played on a smaller (14–15inch) and deeper (4–6inch) drum with a thinner resonant skin, prepared like the skin of a Lambeg drum. The tipper in this style is usually straight and most of the expressive action is focused on the top end of the drum. [...] The concept involves allowing a greater vs. lesser amount of the skin to resonate, with the [...] "skin hand" [...] acting as a moving bearing edge. [...] Top-end players move the skin hand from the bottom and towards the top of the drum to generate increasingly high pitches. [...] By making a [...] "C" [...] shape with the skin hand, the player can help enhance and even amplify the sound. [...] The same concept can be employed while playing {{at the front of the}} drum (the skin hand moving <b>towards</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the player) or in a [...] "bottom end" [...] style, which is essentially top end, but upside down, with the majority of tipper strikes at the bottom of the head. [...] In any of these styles, crossbars are most often absent, allowing a more unrestricted access for the left hand to modify the tone. This enables a more melodic approach to this rhythm instrument, with a wide range of tones being employed.|$|E
