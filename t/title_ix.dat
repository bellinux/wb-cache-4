5|$|On June 23, 1972, <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> {{was enacted}} and had {{tremendous}} repercussions for the women's rights movement. <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> prevented organizations from excluding members based on sex. Although social fraternities were {{exempt from the}} law, Kappa Kappa Psi, as a recognition society, fell under its purview. Rutgers University's board of trustees decided that Rutgers {{should serve as a}} model for the rest of the United States in <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> implementation and mandated that all organizations on campus become coeducational or face disciplinary actions. The men of the Alpha Phi chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi regarded this issue as minor given the ongoing Vietnam War. With dwindling numbers, Alpha Phi looked to the new women members of the Rutgers band as potential members. The national constitution of Kappa Kappa Psi prohibited women from holding membership, so the Alpha Phi chapter explored the possibility of establishing a chapter of Tau Beta Sigma. This was unrealistic, as the undergraduate college for women prohibited the formation of or membership in any sorority.|$|E
5|$|With the {{implementation}} of <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> in the mid-1970s, Cornell significantly expanded its athletic offerings for women. The Department of Physical Education and Athletics moved from having all women's activities housed in Helen Newman Hall to having men's and women's programs in all facilities.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{addresses}} {{three issues}} surrounding <b>Title</b> <b>IX’s</b> application to women’s sports {{that have been}} largely eclipsed by the recent controversy over <b>Title</b> <b>IX’s</b> three-part test: the increasingly male composition of athletic leadership positions; the focus on cutting men’s sports as a remedy to discrimination against women; {{and the role of}} revenue and massive spending on men’s elite sports in justifying gender inequality in sports. The essay links each of these issues to broader questions and concerns in discrimination law more generally, and concludes that deeper cultural change is necessary to fulfill <b>Title</b> <b>IX’s</b> promise...|$|R

However, she was asked by Melvin Hemphill, the recruiter for coach Margaret Wade, who was restarting a collegiate women's team, if she would attend Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. This was before <b>Title</b> <b>IX,</b> so there were no sports scholarships for women. She attended school on a combination of academic scholarships and work study funds.|$|E
5|$|The men's {{gymnastics}} team at MSU won {{one national}} title, which they {{shared with the}} University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1958. In 2001, the MSU Board of Trustees disbanded the team in order to comply with <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> regulations. The women's team retained its varsity status. Its coach is Kathie Klages, who has had 16 winning seasons in a row. In 2008, the team ranked 17th {{in the nation in}} the final season standings, the highest placement in program history.|$|E
5|$|Historically, UM {{regulated}} {{female student}} conduct more than men's conduct {{with a staff}} under the Dean of Women watching over the women. UM combined the separate Dean of Men and Dean of Women positions in 1971. In 1971, UM formed a Women's Commission which issued a 1974 report {{on the status of}} women on campus. The result was UM's first female commencement speaker, day care, and a Women's Study minor. Following the enactment of <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> in 1972, and decades of litigation, all organizations, including honorary societies were open to women. The Women's Commission also sought more equitable funding for women's sports. Terry Williams Munz became the first woman in America awarded an athletic scholarship when she accepted a golf scholarship from UM in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Orders {{were given}} to the 13th SS Division to provide a cadre for the new division, and SS Standartenführer (Colonel) Helmuth Raithel, a regimental {{commander}} from the 13th SS Division, was appointed as the new division's commanding officer. The formation of the division was delayed by Operation Vollmond to which the 13th SS Division was heavily committed, so formation did not begin until 19 June. On 21 June, Himmler promoted Sauberzweig to SS Gruppenführer and Generalleutnant of Waffen-SS (major general) and appointed him to command the Bosnian corps, which was given the <b>title</b> <b>IX</b> Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian). The corps was to form at Bácsalmás in southern Hungary, where the 18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Horst Wessel was deployed.|$|E
5|$|During the 1973–1975 biennium, {{pressure}} {{was put on}} Kappa Kappa Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with <b>Title</b> <b>IX.</b> The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of {{an equal number of}} members from Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger—Kappa Kappa Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. With the idea of a merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{election}} saw the Republicans capture {{not just}} the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party {{for the first time}} in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism. He chose to become the ranking member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career. Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan's actions and preserve and improve the Voting Rights Act, funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under <b>Title</b> <b>IX.</b> To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him. Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.|$|E
50|$|Stunt (or as usually stylized STUNT) {{is a new}} {{and growing}} sport that {{is very similar to}} cheerleading in terms of {{athletic}} skills. In spring 2011, USA Cheer announced that 21 universities are now committed to this sport. STUNT requires high athletic skills and its competition format and scoring systems are unique. The maximum number of players on each team can reach 30 athletes. STUNT athletes are engaged from multiple backgrounds, including traditional cheerleading schools, “All Stars” who are non-school cheerleaders and acrobatics and/or gymnastics athletes. STUNT is being considered for NCAA Emerging Sport status and has been designed to meet <b>Title</b> <b>IX's</b> requirements for intercollegiate sports.|$|R

5000|$|Past teachings on {{transgender}} and genderqueer individuals include Church President Kimball's 1974 {{statement that}} sex reassignment surgery was appalling and a travesty, and that individuals seeking gender confirming surgery would surely regret it. Two {{months later he}} stated in general conference that transgender persons are ignorant and vicious and attempting to destroy the concept of femininity and masculinity, and that if they undergo sex reassignment surgery the will answer to God. Church President Harold Lee also taught that the [...] "so-called transsexuality doctrine" [...] was hellish and false since God didn't place female spirits in male bodies and vice versa. In an amicus brief filed with the US Supreme Court in February 2017 over a transgender bathroom case (G. G. v. Gloucester County School Board), church leaders stated that they acknowledge the [...] "heavy burdens" [...] of gender dysphoria and stated that those who experience it [...] "deserve compassion and respect", but that they oppose {{the interpretation of the}} word [...] "sex" [...] in <b>Title</b> <b>IX's</b> wording as applicable to gender identity.|$|R

In March 2011 a <b>Title</b> <b>IX</b> complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine Broad Recognition, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.

5000|$|On April 19, 2016, a {{three-judge panel}} of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals {{ruled in favor of}} {{transgender}} high school student Gavin Grimm in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board. The ruling upheld the Department of Education's interpretation that <b>Title</b> <b>IX's</b> prohibition against {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex should be read broadly to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Although House Bill 2 was not at issue in Grimm's lawsuit, which originated in Virginia, the ruling has controlling status in the Fourth Circuit, which includes North Carolina. President pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate Phil Berger reacted negatively to the Fourth Circuit decision: People need to wake up: Roy Cooper, Barack Obama and two unelected federal judges are on the verge of completing their radical social reengineering of our society by forcing middle school-aged girls to share school locker rooms with boys. House Bill 2 was our effort to stop this insanity, and I hope this proves the bathroom safety bill has nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with protecting women's privacy and keeping men out of girls' bathrooms.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{responds}} to The Sex Bureaucracy, in which Jacob Gersen and Jeannie Suk condemn regulations of sexual conduct they see metastasizing on college campuses, pursuant to <b>Title</b> <b>IX’s</b> mandate for equal educational opportunities in institutions receiving federal funds. We {{focus on the}} authors’ most trenchant critique, which slams efforts to teach sexual health principles and practices on the ground that, in doing so, universities are “regulating sex itself” and interfering with “ordinary sex. ” By placing recent sexual health and violence prevention measures in historical and cultural context, we challenge the authors’ assumption that, absent such instruction, sex occurs naturally and unproblematically on college campuses. In addition, contrary to the authors’ negative assessment, we highlight the value and promise {{of some of the}} newer developments they contest. We understand such interventions as a form of sex education, which we call “higher sex education,” given both the campus loci and the advancements apparent when compared to many more familiar sex curricula. We show, in context, why such instruction belongs in higher educational institutions and how {{it has the potential to}} transform campus sexual cultures and enhance students’ sexual unfolding—preparing them for healthier and more pleasurable sexual futures. We conclude by noting ways in which higher sex education might improve as it continues to evolve...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 <b>Title</b> <b>IX's</b> passage {{into law}} in 1972 set women’s sports on a course toward gender equity with men's sports at the {{scholastic}} and collegiate levels, leading to a definitive growth in women’s professional leagues, corresponding athlete salaries, and athletic marketing and promotional prospects. However, disparities currently exist in the availability and type of marketing and promotional opportunities {{between male and female}} athletes, and more specifically, between white and black female athletes. As today's American culture has sought to reward women that push the envelope of their sexual identity and presentation, it is important to thoroughly explore the concept of selling sex in women's professional sports and then examine who is selling sex and why they are able to do so successfully. The general objective {{of this study is to}} contribute to the field of critical race theory, particularly in the area of selling sex in women's professional sports. Specifically, the aim of this study is to uncover disparities and highlight differing goals as they pertain to the commodification of white and black female athletes. In achieving that goal, this study analyzes the visual depictions of tennis stars, Anna Kournikova and Venus Williams, on Sports Illustrated magazine covers and in print advertising through the lens of critical race theory to identify how these women were depicted and represented in the public eye as white and black female athletes. This study seeks to investigate, reveal, explain, and reason why white and black female athletes sell themselves differently within contemporary Western societies...|$|R
