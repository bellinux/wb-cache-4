5|$|Anthropogenic ecology {{refers to}} the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might {{indicate}} that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, {{with the exception of}} invasive species such as <b>tumbleweed</b> and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Cricket {{characters}} {{feature in}} the Walt Disney animated movies Pinocchio (1940), where Jiminy Cricket becomes the title character's conscience, and in Mulan (1998), where Cri-kee is carried in a cage {{as a symbol of}} luck, in the Asian manner. The Crickets was the name of Buddy Holly's rock and roll band; Holly's home town baseball team in the 1990s was called the Lubbock Crickets. Cricket is the name of a US children's literary magazine founded in 1973; it uses a cast of insect characters. The sound of crickets is often used in media to emphasize silence, often for comic effect after an awkward joke, in a similar manner to <b>tumbleweed.</b>|$|E

25|$|Husky's {{move into}} the area spurred {{drilling}} and production. Within two years of Husky's arrival, there were oversupplies of heavy oil and shortages of storage space.

For a while Husky bought the oil by weight rather than volume since it was clogged with earth, <b>tumbleweed</b> and jackrabbits.

5000|$|After <b>Tumbleweeds,</b> Hart {{retired to}} his Newhall, California, ranch home, [...] "La Loma de los Vientos", which was {{designed}} by architect Arthur R. Kelly.

25|$|Hebard was a <b>tumbleweed</b> of activity. Summers {{often found}} her {{bouncing}} along Wyoming's sagebrush rangeland, sometimes by horse and wagon {{and later by}} automobile, searching for Oregon Trail ruts or seeking to locate yet another historic site or pioneer to corner for an interview. Only after the High Plain's long winter had retreated would conditions become favorable for Hebard's expeditions. Although the record shows that she sometimes strapped on snowshoes to continue her explorations in the winter. But even summer treks presented difficulties. Thunder boomers easily turned the primitive tracks that then served as roads into impassable quagmires of Wyoming mud.|$|E

25|$|Gundelia {{is a low}} to high (20–100cm) thistle-like {{perennial}} {{herbaceous plant}} with latex, spiny compound inflorescences, reminiscent of teasles and eryngos, that contain cream, yellow, greenish, pink, purple or redish-purple disk florets. It is assigned to the daisy family. Flowers can be found from February to May. The stems of this plant dry-out when the seeds are ripe and break free from the underground root, and are then blown away like a <b>tumbleweed,</b> thus spreading the seeds effectively over large areas with little standing vegetation. This plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle-East. Opinions differ {{about the number of}} species in Gundelia. Sometimes the genus is regarded monotypic, Gundelia tournefortii being a species with a large variability, but other authors distinguish up to nine species, differing in floret color and pubescence. Young stems are cooked and eaten in the Middle-East and are said to taste like a combination of artichoke and asparagus. The plant also contains compounds that have been demonstrated to be effective against a range of ailments. A large quantity of pollen assigned to Gundelia has been found on the Shroud of Turin, which may suggest that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia, but this finding has been contested.|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{reviews of}} <b>Tumbleweeds</b> have lauded {{it as the}} high point of Hart's career and as a seminal film of the silent era that was unique for its era in its {{depiction}} of Native Americans and African Americans. Gary Johnson in Images Journal said that although <b>Tumbleweeds</b> was only a mild box-office success, it is arguably Hart's finest film. [...] "The movie's most impressive sequence remains the land rush", wrote Johnson. [...] "All manners of vehicles -- covered wagons, surreys, stagecoaches, even a large-wheeled bicycle -- bounce over the prairie in the mad rush to claim land. Other films would attempt to recreate the Oklahoma land rush -- such as Cimarron, which won the Best Picture Academy Award in 1931 -- but <b>Tumbleweeds</b> remains the best example." ...|$|R
