500|$|In July 2011, Ouellet asked a {{judge for}} {{protection}} from 61-year-old [...] "crazed fan" [...] Lee Silber, and filed {{a request for a}} permanent restraining order. She claimed that Silber had sent [...] "numerous terrifying letters <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>home</b> and left more than 50 voicemails on my personal cell phone all of which are extremely disturbing and delusional." [...] In the filed documents and an interview for TMZ, Ouellet stated that she [...] "feared for [...] life". She also explained that she had beefed up her personal security, and noted that Silber was a [...] "crazy stalker ... who needs to either be in a psychiatric hospital or jail!". On August 3, the court granted her the restraining order.|$|E
500|$|When {{the head}} of {{household}} finds a suitable tree, he {{stands in front of}} it facing east. After throwing grain at the tree, he greets it with the words [...] "Good morning and happy Christmas Eve to you", makes the Sign of the Cross, says a prayer, and kisses the tree. He may also explain to the badnjak why it will be cut: [...] "I have come to you to take <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>home,</b> to be my faithful helper to every progress and improvement, in the house, in the pen, in the field, and in every place." [...] He then cuts it slantwise on its eastern side, using an axe. Some men put gloves on before they start to cut the tree, and from then on never touch the badnjak with their bare hands. The tree should fall to the east, unhindered by surrounding trees. It must not be left half-cut, as then it will curse the house of the man. In some regions, if the tree is not cut down after the third blow of the axe, then it must be pulled and twisted until its trunk breaks. The resulting badnjak has a so-called [...] "beard", the part of the trunk at which it broke off {{from the base of the}} tree. In Šumadija, half of a circular loaf of bread is left on the stump, the other half being eaten on the way back home. In Zagarač, the stump is covered with moss or dry leaves, and it will be visited again in spring: the stump sprouting through the cover is an omen of good luck and prosperity.|$|E

In a statement, Oprah Winfrey said [...] "I thank Rosie {{from the bottom of my}} heart for joining me on this journey. She has been an incredible partner, working to deliver the best possible show every single day. As I have learned in the last 15 months, a new network launch is always a challenge and ratings grow over time as you continue to gather an audience. I'm grateful to Rosie and the dedicated Rosie Show team for giving it their all." [...] O'Donnell responded to the cancellation by thanking her viewers and the host city of Chicago: [...] "I loved working with Oprah in the amazing city of Chicago. I was welcomed with open arms and will never forget the kindness of all I encountered. It was a great year for me—I wish the show was able to attract more viewers—but it did not. So I am headed back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>home</b> in New York—with gratitude. On we go!" ...|$|E
