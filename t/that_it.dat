Total UK argued <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot.

Sony Computer Entertainment Europe issued a statement, stating that {{they were aware of}} the concerns expressed by the Bishop of Manchester and the Cathedral authorities, and take them seriously. However, they added that Resistance: Fall of Man is a fantasy science fiction game and not based on reality and that they believed they had sought and received all permissions necessary.

Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not be raided while he was there; but other citizens felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E

Phthalazine derivatives have applications as therapeutic agents, chemiluminescent materials, ligands in transition metal catalysis, and as optical materials. Some time ago, our research group developed a methodology for the preparation of phthalazine derivatives in three steps, affording halo-thienyl-phthalazine derivatives that {{play an important role}} in diazine chemistry since they offer great potential for further functionalization by nucleophilic displacement of the halogen, making numerous otherwise inaccessible diazines become available. In continuation of the work developed before by our research group, we report in this communication the synthesis and the evaluation of the optical properties of two novel thienyl-phthalazine derivatives, having in mind further functionalization to prepare push-pull heterocyclic systems for several optical and photovoltaic applications. These studies showed that the optical properties could be readily tuned by varying the π-conjugation path length through the introduction of a second thiophene unit.
