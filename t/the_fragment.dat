5|$|Before King {{published}} {{the discovery of}} <b>the</b> <b>fragment,</b> she asked AnneMarie Luijendijk and fellow papyrologist Roger S. Bagnall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University to review <b>the</b> <b>fragment.</b> They determined that it was likely authentic, both because of the skills {{which would have been}} required to forge <b>the</b> <b>fragment,</b> and because the papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted that the text was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> as fake. In a television documentary about <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> that was presented on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2012, Professor Alberto Camplani of Sapienza University of Rome suggested that he considered it more likely to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fragment</b> {{was found}} by itself in the topsoil near Roskilde. Though the larger helmet may have {{accompanied}} the eyepiece into the earth and later been destroyed by ploughing, <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> may instead have been lost or discarded. It could alternatively have been buried by itself, possibly in an invocation of the one-eyed god Odin.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiocarbon}} dating {{analysis of the}} papyrus by the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in 2013 dated the papyrus to between 404 and 209 BC. However, the cleaning protocol had to be interrupted during processing to preserve <b>the</b> <b>fragment.</b> A second analysis was performed by Harvard University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found a mean date of AD 741. A Raman spectroscopy analysis at Columbia University found that the ink was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 BC to AD 700–800. These analyses suggest that <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a separating device for solid fragments, comprising {{a conveyor belt}} for supplying <b>the</b> <b>fragments,</b> at least one sensor for detecting <b>the</b> <b>fragments,</b> and an ejector for dislodging <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> from <b>the</b> belt.

40|$|Important steps {{towards a}} {{realistic}} modeling of statistical fragmentation of hot nuclei are taken. The long-range Coulomb interaction and the excluded volume of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> are treated rigorously. <b>The</b> <b>fragments</b> {{are allowed to}} explore their isospin degree of freedom. The experimental binding energies of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> are taken for all masses in the 1985 -Wapstra table and the experimental excited states are used for A ≤ 40 wherever available. Unbound neutron resonances of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> are treated in semiclassical approximation to the second virial coefficient. Angular momentum is incorporated...|$|R

5|$|Daniel B. Wallace of the Dallas Theological Seminary {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> {{appears to have been}} intentionally cut, most likely in modern times. They further suggest that this leads to the possibility that in context Jesus may not have even been speaking of a literal wife.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{discovery}} in 2000 <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> {{has been in}} the collection of the Lejre Museum. It has previously been exhibited in Britain and Germany as part of a traveling exhibition on Vikings.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{the work}} has two large concerto {{movements}} for organ and orchestra, probably from a lost concerto for keyboard, oboe or violin, perhaps indicating that the cantata was composed for a seasonal choral absentia at Thomaskirche. The first nine bars of the opening sinfonia are practically identical to <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> BWV 1059.|$|E
2500|$|When a [...] "reasonable {{picture of}} the {{original}} helmet" [...] was in view, more than nine months of work into the second reconstruction, <b>the</b> repositioned <b>fragments</b> were placed against a [...] "featureless plaster dome." [...] This dome was itself built outwards with [...] "oil-free plasticine" [...] to match the original dimensions of <b>the</b> helmet. <b>The</b> <b>fragments</b> were held in place with [...] "long pins" [...] until a mixture of jute and adhesive was molded {{to the shape of}} the missing areas, and adhered to <b>the</b> <b>fragments.</b> <b>The</b> edges of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> were then coated with water-resistant resin, and plaster was spread atop the jute to level and smooth the helmet's surface. The plaster was painted light brown to resemble the colour of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> while allowing <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> themselves to stand out; lines were then drawn to indicate the edges of the panels. The result was a hollow helmet in which the backs of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> remain visible. On 2 November 1971, after eighteen months of time and a full year of work by Williams, the second and current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was put on display.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fragments</b> in <b>the</b> four {{reactions}} are electrophoresed {{side by side}} in denaturing acrylamide gels for size separation. To visualize <b>the</b> <b>fragments,</b> <b>the</b> gel is exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography, yielding a series of dark bands each showing the location of identical radiolabeled DNA molecules. From presence and absence of certain <b>fragments</b> <b>the</b> sequence may be inferred.|$|R
40|$|Quasistatic {{compression}} {{tests for}} alumina (Al 2 O 3) cylinders were {{conducted for the}} investigations of the compressive strengths and the dynamic fragmentation properties of the material. We focused on the post-failure dynamic fragmentation phenomenon. Most of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> were collected after tests, the shapes and sizes of these fragments were measured and statistically analyzed. <b>The</b> <b>fragments</b> were divided into three types on basis of their shapes and sizes, namely: the flaky medium sized <b>fragments,</b> <b>the</b> tiny debris, and the remaining large blocks, each type of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> were formed {{at different stages of}} the compressive failure-fragmentation process. The tiny debris were mainly generated from the ”explosion” of the cylindrical specimen, in this stage the stored elastic energy within the specimen was released rapidly. <b>The</b> tiny <b>fragments</b> accounted <b>the</b> most part of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> in numbers. <b>The</b> average <b>fragment</b> size calculated by the proposed formula agree well with the experimental data...|$|R
5|$|Part {{of the arm}} of a 9th- or 10th-century stone cross was {{discovered}} when a house in the village—Styles House, near the River Piddle—was demolished.

5|$|While the arthroscopic {{classification}} of bone and cartilage lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging {{is the main}} form of staging used in this article. StagesI and II are stable lesions. StagesIII and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the cartilage has allowed synovial fluid between <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> and bone.|$|E

An optional fragment identifier, preceded by #, may be present at the end of a URI reference. The part of the reference before the # indirectly identifies a resource, and <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> identifier identifies some portion of that resource.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} issue of fragmentation and homogenization of forest communities in urban areas. The habitat fragmentation could be natural or anthropogenic. The {{main cause of}} the habitat fragmentation is currently human activity. We can count urbanization among the most significant of these activities. The extinction {{is one of the}} few effects, which is however very significant for the biodiversity of <b>the</b> <b>fragmented</b> habitat. <b>The</b> extinction of species in <b>the</b> <b>fragmented</b> habitat does not necessarily occur immediately. In <b>the</b> <b>fragmented</b> habitat, a decrease in the number of species can take place with some delay. There is another fact connected to the extinction in <b>the</b> <b>fragmented</b> habitat. <b>The</b> biotic homogenization can also occur in <b>the</b> <b>fragmented</b> habitat. <b>The</b> biotic homogenization is distinctive and easily observable particularly in urbanized area.

5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in <b>the</b> <b>fragment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eight centimeters {{wide and}} five tall, the Gevninge {{eyepiece}} was molded from bronze and then gilded. An oval eye opening is overlain by a sculpted eyebrow with grooves forming individual hairs, while grooves around the oval may represent eyelashes. The {{top and the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> each have three holes, presumably used to attach it to the helmet; the top three may have attached it to the helmet cap, the bottom three {{to some form of}} face protection such as a facemask or camail.|$|E

Meanwhile, as Mulder and Krycek hike through the forests of Krasnoyarsk, the former theorizes that <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> may be tied to the Tunguska event, a mysterious cosmic impact {{that occurred in the}} area in 1908. The two men come across a slave labor camp, but are captured by the taskmasters and thrown into a gulag.|$|E
50|$|As it collapses, a {{molecular}} cloud breaks into {{smaller and smaller}} pieces in a hierarchical manner, until <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> reach stellar mass. In each of these <b>fragments,</b> <b>the</b> collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by the release of gravitational potential energy. As the density increases, <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away their energy. This raises {{the temperature of the}} cloud and inhibits further fragmentation. <b>The</b> <b>fragments</b> now condense into rotating spheres of gas that serve as stellar embryos.|$|R

30|$|The {{results from}} the {{displacement}} transducers for the relative movement of the bone showed that at direct weight loading, both bone fragments were pushed towards {{each other in the}} direction of the osteotomy. The proximal and <b>the</b> distal <b>fragment</b> covered <b>the</b> same distance in relation to a ring level, which is half of the defect size. Upon contact of both bone ends in the osteotomy, there were no more relative movements of <b>the</b> <b>fragments.</b> At indirect loading, only <b>the</b> proximal <b>fragment</b> moved distally {{in the direction of the}} osteotomy and <b>the</b> distal <b>fragment.</b> <b>The</b> proximal segment covered the total defect distance of 3.5  mm. <b>The</b> distal <b>fragment</b> did not move until it was contacted by <b>the</b> proximal bone <b>fragment.</b> Upon contact of the bone ends in the osteotomy, <b>the</b> proximal <b>fragment</b> moved further distally, in the direction of the axial force, and pushed <b>the</b> distal <b>fragment</b> distally. This resulted in greater relative movements of <b>the</b> proximal <b>fragment</b> and therefore greater overall movements.|$|R
50|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a detached removable sleeve spacer inside the right engine. The detachment {{was caused by}} metal fatigue. Examination of <b>the</b> turbine <b>fragments</b> and their distribution during the explosion led {{to the conclusion that the}} ejection of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> didn't contribute to the crash, as the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> was substantially absorbed and decreased by the engine cowling. The NTSB noted that several parts of the engine could not be found; they concluded that, based on their calculation and distribution of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> on <b>the</b> ground, the unidentified parts were reduced to tiny, harmless bits.|$|R
5|$|The Tjele helmet {{fragment}} is a Viking Age {{fragment of}} iron and bronze, originally comprising the eyebrows and noseguard of a helmet.
