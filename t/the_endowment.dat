5|$|This changed {{dramatically}} in the 2000s (decade), when the University started a campaign to {{increase the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>endowment.</b> At the close of fiscal year 2004–2005, <b>the</b> <b>endowment</b> had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school. The rapid increase in the size of <b>the</b> <b>endowment</b> will help to improve outdated facilities, such as the Music Building, which the College of Music hopes to soon replace with money from its alumni fundraising program.|$|E

30|$|The Guatemalan case is {{outstanding}} to {{the extent}} that both, gender and ethnic wage gaps are important. The ethnic wage gap is primarily driven by <b>the</b> <b>endowments</b> effect from <b>the</b> median and upper quantiles, but at the lower quantile the coefficients effect represents {{more than half of the}} wage gap. Difference in education and working in the agricultural sector contribute to more than half of <b>the</b> <b>endowments</b> effect for <b>the</b> upper tail of the distribution, but being a skilled agricultural worker, the absence of social security, and living in the urban areas is what explains <b>the</b> <b>endowments</b> effect at <b>the</b> lower quintiles.|$|R

Others have said <b>the</b> salaries of <b>endowment</b> managers are justifiable, asserting that they are less than what could be earned {{in the private sector}} and pay for themselves with <b>the</b> <b>endowment's</b> high rates of return.|$|R

The Getty Trust experienced financial difficulties in 2008 and 2009 and cut 205 of 1,487 budgeted staff positions to reduce expenses. Although the Getty Trust endowment reached $6.4 billion in 2007, it dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009. <b>The</b> <b>endowment</b> rebounded to $6.2 billion by 2013.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, <b>the</b> Carnegie <b>Endowment</b> reconstituted its International Law Program {{in order}} to address several {{emerging}} international issues: the increase in significance and impact of international organizations; the technological revolution that facilitated the production of new military weaponry; the spread of Communism; the surge in newly independent states; and the challenges of new forms of economic activity, including global corporations and intergovernmental associations. The program resulted in the New York-based Study Group on the United Nations and the International Organization Study Group at the European Centre in Geneva.In 1970, Thomas L.

5|$|In a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann {{suggests}} that Shaw {{was a key}} forerunner—"godfather, if not actually finicky paterfamilias"—of the Theatre of the Absurd. Two further aspects of Shaw's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was finally ended in 1968, and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a National Theatre. Shaw's short 1910 play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for <b>the</b> <b>endowment</b> of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.|$|E
5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. <b>The</b> <b>endowment</b> effect has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect {{is just one example}} of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E
5|$|Pain gave {{lands to}} Llanthony Priory, helping to {{establish}} <b>the</b> <b>endowment</b> of that monastic house, {{although it is}} difficult to distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy, as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts of both men together in their records. In addition Pain granted lands to Gloucester Abbey, which had benefited from the generosity of his father and brother, as did his wife Sybil, together with other grants to her uncle the abbot.

50|$|Before the {{nationalization}} of the awqaf, the mosques helped in lending the poorer citizens a voice. For example, Al-Azhar mosque would aid the community through <b>the</b> <b>endowments</b> and remained economically separate via the revenue they earned from the awqaf. This enabled the mosque {{to maintain a}} state of independence from the dictates {{of the government and}} rulers. Mosques could use <b>the</b> <b>endowments</b> to help <b>the</b> community as needed. Also, because mosques were economically independent, imams could preach what they felt was important, with little to no government intervention. However, when the government effectively took over <b>the</b> <b>endowments</b> program, <b>the</b> people suffered greatly. They no longer had their only means of political representation and Al-Azhar’s religious influence was manipulated into producing propaganda by the state.|$|R
50|$|To {{cover the}} {{omission}} of the University College of Swansea from receiving portions of <b>the</b> <b>endowments,</b> <b>the</b> Welsh Church (Amendment) Act 1938 was passed specifically to amend section 19(1)(b) of the Welsh Church Act 1914 to include it {{in the list of}} universities entitled to receive <b>the</b> <b>endowments</b> as well as reducing each individual university's entitlement to three-sixteenths.
