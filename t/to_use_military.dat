Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force against Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|The bayonet {{has become}} a symbol of {{military}} power. The term [...] "at the point of a bayonet" [...] refers <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>military</b> force or action to accomplish, maintain, or defend something (cf. Bayonet Constitution). Undertaking a task [...] "with fixed bayonets" [...] has this connotation of no room for compromise and is a phrase used particularly in politics.|$|R

5|$|Davis {{faced the}} most {{important}} decision of his career: to prevent reinforcement at Fort Sumter or to let it take place. He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Major Anderson did not surrender. With Jefferson Davis's endorsement, Beauregard began the bombarding of the fort in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one {{was killed in the}} artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fortress meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up state militia to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.|$|E
5|$|Various Taliban {{supplies}} were seized by coalition forces following the battle. On 13 December, British and Afghan army units located bomb factories and weapons caches {{as they moved}} further into the outskirts of Musa Qala and searched Taliban positions. At the same time, the first civilians started {{to return to the}} area, some with reports of Taliban punishments and claims of active Pakistani and Arab jihadis. A new orientation of British strategy in Helmand is <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force to curb the influence of local drug barons, whose trade supports the insurgents. On 16 December, British troops burned an estimated £150 to £200 million worth of heroin that had been found in a drug factory and other buildings in Musa Qala.|$|E
5|$|After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in {{the region}} of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a {{daughter}} of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi. Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to stem the tide of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.|$|E

5|$|In 269, while Claudius Gothicus (Gallienus' successor) was {{defending}} {{the borders of}} Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions, Zenobia was cementing her authority; Roman officials in the East were caught between loyalty to the emperor and Zenobia's increasing demands for allegiance. The timing and rationale of the queen's decision <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force to strengthen her authority in the East is unclear; scholar Gary K. Young suggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority, and Zenobia's expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance. Another factor {{may have been the}} weakness of Roman central authority and its corresponding inability to protect the provinces, which probably convinced Zenobia {{that the only way to}} maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly. Historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobia's actions to her desire to protect Palmyra's economic interests, which were threatened by Rome's failure to protect the provinces. Also, according to Schwartz, the economic interests conflicted; Bostra and Egypt received trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra. The Tanukhids near Bostra and the merchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene domination, triggering a military response from Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|Árbenz's {{enactment}} of Decree 900 in 1952 provoked Truman to authorize Operation PBFORTUNE, a covert operation to overthrow Árbenz. The plan {{had originally been}} suggested by the US-backed dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who {{said that if he}} were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. After being elected president of the US in November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was more willing than Truman <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> tactics to remove regimes he disliked. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles had close ties to the United Fruit Company. Undersecretary of State Bedell Smith later became a director of the UFC, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These connections made the Eisenhower administration more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government.|$|E

25|$|During {{his bid for}} president, Huckabee {{released}} a comprehensive nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. His plan includes building a border fence, increased border patrol personnel, and increases in visas for skilled workers who enter the country legally. He has previously stated he is opposed <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>military</b> resources for border patrol. Huckabee's plan would also require all 11-12 million illegal immigrants to register {{with the federal government}} and return to their home countries within 120 days. Failure to do so would carry a 10-year ban from entering the US.|$|R
50|$|Sir Robert Peel came up {{with nine}} {{principles}} to modern law enforcement in 1829, known as the Peelian Principles. Peel's principles explain {{that there is an}} alternative <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>military</b> force, in that police are there to prevent crimes. Police need to gain willing cooperation from the public and will lose public cooperation proportionately to the amount of force used in situations. The police need to maintain relationships with the public and keep their respect. These principles provide a basis for community policing in the current U.S. law enforcement.|$|R

25|$|Aerolloyd was not {{the first}} airline in Poland, but it was the first to offer regular flights and survive. The company enjoyed {{subsidies}} from the government of Poland who allowed its aircraft <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> airfields in Poland free of charge for lack of purpose-built civilian airports. The government also repaid 130 Polish marks for every kilometre and allowed the company access to meteorological data from military weather stations.|$|E
25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the Crisis and in order to prevent further Soviet {{expansion}} in the region, Eisenhower asked Congress on 5 January 1957 for authorization <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force if requested by any Middle Eastern nation to check aggression and, second, to set aside $200million to help Middle Eastern countries that desired aid from the United States. Congress granted both requests and this policy became known as the Eisenhower Doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Bush's four {{reasons for}} the {{invasion}} provided sufficient justification to establish bipartisan Congressional approval {{and support for the}} invasion. However, the secrecy before initiation, the speed and success of the invasion itself, and U.S. public support for it (80% public approval) did not allow Democrats to object to Bush's decision <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force. One contemporary study suggests that Bush decided to invade for domestic political reasons, citing scarce strategic reasoning for the U.S. to invade and immediately withdraw without establishing the structure to enforce the interests that Bush used to justify the invasion.|$|E
5000|$|American Presidents {{often have}} not sought formal {{declarations}} of war, instead maintaining {{that they have}} the Constitutional authority, as commander in chief (Article Two, Section Two) <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the <b>military</b> for [...] "police actions".|$|R
5000|$|Commitment Problems: {{an actor}} has a {{difficulty}} to commit <b>to</b> not <b>use</b> <b>military</b> {{strength in the}} future. A first-strike advantage may force an actor to begin a preemptive war, or the threat of being attacked may cause an actor to start a preventive war.|$|R
5000|$|Left-wing critics {{insisted that}} the party's stubbornness about keeping the {{settlements}} was an [...] "obstacle to peace", while right-wing critics said the NRP did not pressure the Israeli government enough <b>to</b> <b>use</b> more <b>military</b> force against Palestinian terrorism.|$|R
25|$|During {{this time}} European {{settlement}} accelerated and in about 1859 {{the number of}} Pākehā came to equal the number of Māori, at around 60,000 each. By now Pākehā had largely forgotten the painful lessons of the earlier conflicts. They tried <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> might to push through a very dubious land sale that the courts later repudiated. The result was the First Taranaki War. Once again the local British forces were more than evenly matched by Māori, and after twelve months both sides were happy {{to settle for a}} draw.|$|E
25|$|In foreign policy, Johnson {{escalated}} American {{involvement in}} the Vietnam War. In 1964, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force in Southeast Asia without having to ask for an official declaration of war. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, from 16,000 advisors in non-combat roles in 1963 to 525,000 in 1967, many in combat roles. American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down. Growing unease with the war stimulated a large, angry antiwar movement based especially on university campuses.|$|E
25|$|By 1985, when Aspin became {{chairman}} of the Armed Services Committee, he was recognized as a leading defense authority. His chairmanship caused controversy among some House Democrats, particularly because he supported the Reagan administration's policies on the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Although temporarily removed from his committee chair by his Democratic colleagues in January 1987, Aspin weathered the crisis and regained the chairmanship three weeks later. He again broke with many Democrats in January 1991 when he issued a paper supporting the Bush administration's intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait. The accuracy of his prediction that the United States could win a quick military victory with light casualties added to {{his reputation as a}} military expert.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{some groups}} engaged in combat, such as {{resistance}} movements, all refer <b>to</b> themselves <b>using</b> <b>military</b> terminology, notably [...] "Army", [...] "Brigade", or [...] "Front", none {{have had the}} structure of a national military to justify the reference, and usually have had to rely on support of outside national militaries.|$|R

25|$|Some foreign {{observers}} thought traditionalism was {{no longer}} a strong force in Saudi Arabia. This idea was disproved when at least 500 dissidents invaded and seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca on 20 November 1979. When the first news of the attack in Mecca reached Riyadh, the initial reaction of King Khalid was to consult the ulama, in order to get permission <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force to eject the attackers. The ulama hesitated and refrained from a definite answer. Only after the assault had been underway for 36 hours did some ulama allow the use of force. At the time of the event, Crown Prince Fahd was in Tunisia for a meeting of the Arab Summit and then commander of National Guard Prince Abdullah was in Morocco for an official visit. Therefore, King Khalid assigned the responsibility to Prince Sultan, then minister of defense and Prince Nayef, then minister of interior, to deal with the incident.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 1832, before Calhoun had {{resigned}} the Vice Presidency {{in order to}} run for the Senate where he could more effectively defend nullification, Jackson signed into law the Tariff of 1832. This compromise tariff received the support of most northerners and half of the southerners in Congress. The reductions were too little for South Carolina, and on November 24, 1832, a state convention adopted the Ordinance of Nullification, which declared that the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and unenforceable in South Carolina after February 1, 1833. Military preparations to resist anticipated federal enforcement were initiated by the state. On March 1, 1833, Congress passed both the Force Bill—authorizing the President <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> forces against South Carolina—and a new negotiated tariff, the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which was satisfactory to South Carolina. The South Carolina convention reconvened and repealed its Nullification Ordinance on March 15, 1833, but three days later nullified the Force Bill as a symbolic gesture to maintain its principles.|$|E
25|$|The VOC traded {{throughout}} Asia. Ships {{coming into}} Batavia from the Netherlands carried supplies for VOC settlements in Asia. Silver and copper from Japan {{were used to}} trade with India and China for silk, cotton, porcelain, and textiles. These products were either traded within Asia for the coveted spices or brought back to Europe. The VOC was also instrumental in introducing European ideas and technology to Asia. The Company supported Christian missionaries and traded modern technology with China and Japan. A more peaceful VOC trade post on Dejima, an artificial {{island off the coast}} of Nagasaki, was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan. When the VOC tried <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> force to make Ming dynasty China open up to Dutch trade, the Chinese defeated the Dutch in a war over the Penghu islands from 1623–24, forcing the VOC to abandon Penghu for Taiwan. The Chinese defeated the VOC again at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay in 1633.|$|E
