40|$|DOI: 10. 1016 /j. aca. 2009. 10. 059 Wooden barrels {{are used}} in the ageing or {{maturation}} of many alcoholic beverages, namely brandies and wines. However, the high costs related to ageing in wooden barrels have led to a search for alternative technologies. In this study we examined the application of wood fragments to the beverage in order to promote an accelerated ageing. We evaluated the sensory and chemical modifications in brandy aged in presence of two types of wood fragments, from two different woods (Limousin oak wood and Portuguese chestnut wood), and compared those with a brandy aged in wooden barrels. The results of the analysis of variance revealed more significant effects of wood botanical species than the ageing system on the sensory attributes. Concerning the ageing system, significant differences in brandy colour attributes were found, namely golden, topaz and greenish; olfactory attributes such as alcoholic, toasted and coffee; and the gustatory attribute, bitter. <b>The</b> <b>brandies</b> aged in <b>the</b> presence of wood tablets presented the highest intensities of topaz and greenish colour, toasted and coffee odours, while <b>the</b> <b>brandies</b> aged in wooden barrels presented the highest intensities of golden colour, alcohol odour and bitter taste. However, the overall quality of <b>the</b> <b>brandies</b> was similar. <b>The</b> analysis of odourant compounds showed a great discrimination of <b>the</b> <b>brandies</b> based on <b>the</b> ageing system. <b>The</b> <b>brandies</b> aged in wooden barrels presented the highest levels of several ethyl esters, acids, furanic aldehydes and the lowest levels of volatile phenols. Thus, considering the overall quality of <b>the</b> <b>brandies,</b> these results suggest the use of wood fragments to be an interesting alternative technology. On the other hand, the chemical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>brandies</b> showed <b>the</b> possibility of discriminating the ageing technologies based on odourant compound levels...|$|R

25|$|Brandy is {{traditionally}} served {{at room temperature}} (neat) from a snifter, a wine glass or a tulip glass. When drunk at room temperature, it is often slightly warmed by holding the glass cupped in the palm or by gentle heating.

Brandy drinkers who like their brandy warmed may ask for the glass to be heated before <b>the</b> <b>brandy</b> is poured.|$|E
25|$|Brandy is {{made from}} {{so-called}} base wine, which significantly differs from regular table wines. It {{is made from}} early grapes {{in order to achieve}} higher acid concentration and lower sugar levels. Base wine generally contains smaller amount (up to 20mg/l) of sulphur than regular wines, as it creates undesired copper(II) sulfate in reaction with copper in the pot stills.

25|$|Initially {{wine was}} {{distilled}} as a preservation method {{and as a}} way {{to make it easier for}} merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to <b>the</b> <b>brandy</b> shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.|$|E
25|$|Metaxa {{comes in}} nine major varieties: Three Stars, Five Stars, Five Stars Honey Shot, Seven Stars, Twelve stars, Grande Fine, Private Reserve, Angels Treasure and AEN. The number of stars {{represents}} {{the number of}} years the blend is matured. The three and 5 star are not as different, but the 5 star is notably drier, making the alcohol more pronounced. The seven and twelve star are more flavoursome and complex, while the Twelve-star G.O.R. is again more dry, in this case because there is no addition of wine. In either of the two latter varieties, the smell and taste of the barrel in which <b>the</b> <b>brandy</b> matured is noticeable. The house of Metaxa has recently launched a new product, the Metaxa Twelve Star containing distillates matured for 12 years adding Muscat wine from the island of Samos, unlike the Metaxa Twelve Stars Grand Olympian Reserve.
