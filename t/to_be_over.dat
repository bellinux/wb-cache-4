Binks later disputed the alcohol reading as belonging to another driver and stated the remuneration mostly went to his lawyers. A 2007 appeal by the council, saw amount awarded further reduced to $304,750.|$|E

5|$|By 1907, Londoners {{had seen}} the network of deep tube {{underground}} railways expand from the original C line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers {{as well as with}} the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|By {{early spring}} of 1794, the {{situation}} in France was dire. With famine looming after {{the failure of the}} harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for sustenance.

According to contemporary historian William James this conglomeration of ships was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> 350 strong, although he disputes this figure, citing the number as 117 (in addition to the French warships).|$|E
5|$|Daisy re-strengthened into a Category2 {{later on}} October6, and peaked with winds of 110mph (175km/h).
