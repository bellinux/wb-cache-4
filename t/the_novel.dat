5|$|Acclaimed Southern novelist William Gilmore Simms {{declared}} the work utterly false, while others called <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> criminal and slanderous. Reactions {{ranged from a}} bookseller in Mobile, Alabama, being forced to leave town for selling <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> to threatening letters sent to Stowe (including a package containing a slave's severed ear). Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe's novel.|$|E
5|$|After it {{was told}} that <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> would be {{released}} on 21 July 2007, Warner Bros. shortly thereafter said that the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix would be released shortly before <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> would be released, on 13 July 2007, making many people proclaim that July 2007, was the month of Harry Potter.|$|E
5|$|The Historian {{has been}} {{described}} as a combination of genres, including <b>the</b> Gothic <b>novel,</b> <b>the</b> adventure <b>novel,</b> <b>the</b> detective <b>novel,</b> <b>the</b> travelogue, <b>the</b> postmodern historical <b>novel,</b> <b>the</b> epistolary epic, and the historical thriller.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{first three}} <b>novels</b> were {{originally}} published in mass-market by Del Rey. <b>The</b> <b>novels</b> were later re-published, along with several subsequent <b>novels,</b> by <b>the</b> now-defunct Meisha Merlin, who have also anthologised <b>the</b> earlier <b>novels.</b> <b>The</b> <b>novels</b> were then re-issued in mass-market by Ace Books.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>novel's</b> {{characters}} explicitly {{draw inspiration}} from the story of Tristan and Isolde and <b>the</b> <b>novel's</b> plot bears some resemblance to this medieval romance.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> was published, {{it caused}} {{considerable}} discussion. Religious thinkers, Marxist-Leninists, and anarchists decried <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> for not explaining their ideologies in more detail, but literary figures {{and many in}} the general public praised it; this positive reception may {{have been influenced by}} the nascent government's need to promote literature for nation-building. Atheis was translated into Malay before 1970 and into English in 1972; it was also adapted into a film with the same title in 1974. <b>The</b> <b>novel,</b> which received an award from the Indonesian government in 1969, is one of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.|$|E
5|$|After the {{original}} serialization of Light House, Monahan reluctantly rewrote <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> several {{times at the}} urging of his agent in New York City. In 1998 Light House was sold to Riverhead Books, an imprint of Penguin Putnam, and Warner Bros. immediately optioned the film rights while <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> was still in manuscript. Penguin Putnam wanted to delay publishing <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> in order to release it concurrent with the anticipated film release. Warner Bros. hired Monahan to write the screenplay adaptation of Light House.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> Charles {{returns from}} Europe; he and Mary {{establish}} something of a life together, but Mary is unhealthy and can barely stand {{to be in the}} same room with her husband; the last few lines of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> imply that she will die young.|$|E
5000|$|Taking {{place in}} Unistat, which is <b>the</b> <b>novel's</b> {{parallel}} to <b>the</b> United States, <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> have intertwining plots involving {{a wide array}} of characters, including: ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{scholarly}} discussion {{surrounding the}} text {{is the question of}} its ability to serve as a didactic text for 18th-century readers, with earlier critics unquestioningly discussing <b>the</b> <b>novel's</b> didactic intent; more recent scholars, however, have questioned <b>the</b> <b>novel's</b> ability to teach morality yet frankly discuss seduction and incest. <b>The</b> <b>novel’s</b> preface claims that it is: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{plots of}} the final three films bear no {{relationship}} to any of <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> and very little relationship to the Philo Vance character of <b>the</b> <b>novels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Boyd closely {{based his}} version of the Bond {{character}} on Ian Fleming's, and eschewed any of the film versions. <b>The</b> <b>novel</b> is set in 1969—six years after Fleming's last work was set—and Bond is 45 years old. Boyd was raised in Nigeria and used his experiences during the civil war to provide the location for <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> He has been a Bond fan since his youth and, in preparation for writing <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> he read all the Bond stories in chronological order. It took 18 months to write <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> with some friction between Boyd and the Fleming estate over the portrayal of Bond.|$|E
5|$|Boyd spent 30 months writing <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> The journal style, {{with its}} gaps, false starts and contradictions, {{reinforces}} {{the theme of}} the changing self in <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> Many plot points simply fade away. <b>The</b> <b>novel</b> received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation was made with the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the early}} fascination with <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> after the Second World War it fell into neglect as {{critical}} attention to Döblin was directed primarily towards his next novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), {{and a new}} edition of Berge Meere und Giganten was not published until 1977. The last few decades have however seen a resurgence of critical interest in <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|With the {{exception}} of Super Specials and Super Mysteries, <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> are written and narrated from one character's point of view. <b>The</b> <b>novels</b> generally follow this format: ...|$|R
2500|$|Pharaoh {{combines}} {{features of}} several literary genres: [...] <b>the</b> historical <b>novel,</b> <b>the</b> political <b>novel,</b> <b>the</b> Bildungsroman, <b>the</b> utopian <b>novel,</b> <b>the</b> sensation <b>novel.</b> It also comprises {{a number of}} interbraided strands — including the plot line, Egypt's cycle of seasons, the country's geography and monuments, and ancient Egyptian practices (e.g. mummification rituals and techniques) — each of which rises to prominence at appropriate moments.|$|R
50|$|Carlo Tramonti is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> <b>The</b> Godfather and The Godfather's Revenge. In {{the universe of}} <b>the</b> <b>novels,</b> he is <b>the</b> Don of the Tramonti crime family (inspired of New Orleans crime family) from 1931 to 1964.|$|R
5|$|Faulks {{developed}} <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> {{to bring}} more public awareness {{to the experience of}} war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on {{the way in which the}} experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E
5|$|Following {{closely in}} the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> uses its truthful historical backdrop to tell a fictional story of people who sculpted the past. <b>The</b> <b>novel</b> addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful trickery, and social status. While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> marks a turning point in his life and artistry.|$|E
5|$|Following popular success, <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> {{created a}} larger legacy: <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> has had {{numerous}} responses by academics and other writers, such as A. S. Byatt, and through adaptation as film and dramatic play. In 1981, <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> was adapted {{as a film}} {{of the same name}} with script by the playwright Harold Pinter, directed by Karel Reisz and starring Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons. The film received considerable critical acclaim and awards, including several BAFTAs and Golden Globes. <b>The</b> <b>novel</b> was also adapted and produced as a British play in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Finder Wyvernspur's origins are {{detailed}} as {{his story}} continues in <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> <b>The</b> Wyvern's Spur (1990), and Song of the Saurials (1991). Finder's story, and his journey to godhood, later continue in <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> Finder's Bane (1997), and Tymora's Luck (1997).|$|R
50|$|Shigofumi {{was first}} {{released}} {{as a series}} of light novels written by Ryō Amamiya, and drawn by Poko. Despite <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> being produced first, the anime series is considered by Tomorō Yuzawa as the original work. <b>The</b> <b>novels</b> are published by MediaWorks under their Dengeki Bunko imprint. <b>The</b> first <b>novel</b> was released on October 10, 2006, with the fourth, and final, volume published on March 10, 2008. The story from <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> differs somewhat from that of the anime.|$|R
50|$|One might {{characterize}} <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> {{and stories}} of Dashiell Hammett and other hardboiled and noir fiction as picaresque, with some qualifications (e.g., <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> of Hammett are very tightly plotted).|$|R
5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> {{has had its}} {{defenders}} among feminists in the academy, such as Alison Hennegan, {{pointing out}} that <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> did raise awareness of homosexuality among the British public and {{cleared the way for}} later work that tackled gay and lesbian issues.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> {{was adapted}} for BBC Radio 4's Saturday Drama strand. Toby Stephens, who played Gustav Graves in Die Another Day, portrayed Bond. Joanna Lumley {{appeared}} {{in both the}} film and radio adaptations of <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Apur Panchali (the Bengali {{translation}} of , 1994), Ray {{wrote that he}} had omitted many of the novel's characters {{and that he had}} rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir's death, which occurs early in <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train is not in <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is not the end of <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} Misquamacus is {{also the}} villain of <b>the</b> 1976 <b>novel</b> <b>The</b> Manitou (which {{was made into a}} film starring Tony Curtis, Susan Strasberg, Burgess Meredith and Michael Ansara in 1978), <b>the</b> 1979 <b>novel</b> Return of <b>the</b> Manitou, <b>the</b> 1993 <b>novel</b> Burial, <b>the</b> 2005 <b>novel</b> Manitou Blood and <b>the</b> 2010 <b>novel</b> Blind Panic, all by Graham Masterton.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on a brief analysis of <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> 1984 and A Clockwork Orange.

50|$|One of the {{peculiarities of}} <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> of Dolores Redondo is the {{appearance}} of chanchigorri cakes. <b>The</b> <b>novels</b> have made them better known outside of Navarre, where they are a popular dessert.|$|R
5|$|In the January 1977 {{issue of}} Starlog, Roddenberry {{said he was}} not sure when <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> would be complete, but {{confirmed}} that it would discuss the meaning of God. By March 1978, <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> was said to be half-completed. Publisher Bantam Books told Roddenberry it would wait until he finished production on Phase II to resume work on <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> When later in 1978 that production turned into The Motion Picture, Bantam gave Roddenberry an extension because the novelization was thought to be a full-time effort.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part {{in the tone of}} <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> The tone of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E

50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> {{published}} by Pocket Books after Nemesis, the Enterprise-E remains {{under the command}} of Picard as of 2385 in <b>the</b> 2013 <b>novel</b> miniseries Star Trek: The Fall.

25|$|The Magician's Nephew was {{originally}} published as the sixth {{book in the}} Narnia Chronicles. Most reprintings of <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> until <b>the</b> 1980s also reflected the order of original publication. In 1980 HarperCollins published the series ordered by the chronology of the events in <b>the</b> <b>novels.</b> This meant <b>The</b> Magician's Nephew was numbered as {{the first in the}} series. HarperCollins, which had previously published editions of <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> outside <b>the</b> United States, also acquired the rights to publish <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> in that country in 1994 and used this sequence in the uniform worldwide edition published in that year.|$|R
