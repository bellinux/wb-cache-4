25|$|The {{little that}} is known <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> Audelay's life comes mainly from Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Douce 302. The {{manuscript}} contains the text of all sixty-two of his surviving poems. The dialect of Middle English used in MS Douce 302 is local to Staffordshire, {{and it has been}} suggested that Audelay may therefore have come from the Staffordshire village of Audley. However, the earliest biographical record of Audelay places him in London in 1417, when he was part of the household of Richard, 7th Baron Strange of Knockin.|$|E
25|$|Early {{information}} of Charlotte Charke {{can be found}} in the autobiography called a Narrative of The Life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke by Charlotte Charke herself, she wrote this and published it as a male author. In A narrative of the life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke, they talk <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> her child hood, Charlotte speaks about how she was born when her mother was forty five years of age, and not only was she late coming into the family, but she also felt as though she had been unwanted. She was the twelfth and last child born to actor/playwright poet laureate Colley Cibber and the musician/actress Katherine Shore. Most of her many siblings died before their first birthday. According to her autobiography, her brothers and sisters resented her arrival when she was young and many of them maintained their dislike throughout their lives.Charlotte was bold from a young age., family members and close friends of the family say that Charlotte began to show her “addiction” to manly activities at a young age. She was a great shot, she enjoyed, and was good at dressing horses, and at an early age preferred digging in the Gardens dirt. With the absence of her father due to business endeavours and the lack of a mother figure due to constant illnesses, Charlotte became as independent as a young child her age could be, only to put up with nagging maids that watched over her every once and while.|$|E
500|$|Dudley {{negotiated}} a separate {{peace with the}} Abenakis at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1713. [...] He hoped to separate the western Kennebec tribe from French influence and consequently adopted a fairly hard line, threatening to withhold trade that was vital to their survival and reiterating claims of British sovereignty over the Abenaki. [...] The Treaty of Portsmouth resulted from those negotiations and repeats the claims of sovereignty. Dudley claimed that the French had ceded Abenaki lands as part of Acadia, and one sachem responded: [...] "The French never said anything <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> it, and we wonder how they would give it away without asking us". [...] Nevertheless, Dudley and succeeding governors treated the Abenaki as British subjects, and friction persisted over British colonial expansion into Maine which flared into Dummer's War in the 1720s.|$|E

500|$|An inquest into Shaw's death {{commenced}} in Exeter {{shortly after}} her death was reported to the coroner. The inquest heard evidence in late 2009, among which was eyewitness testimony that the team manager, a teacher from Edgehill College, had met with the group the morning of Shaw's death. During the meeting, the group asked to end the training hike early, but they were instructed by the teacher to carry on. However, the group's navigator gave evidence that she and Shaw had been happy to continue the expedition. The possibility was also raised by other group members that the group was under-prepared for the conditions they faced. The group member whose bag Shaw had been attempting to throw across the stream told the coroner [...] "We were not told how to cross swollen rivers. We were told how to check how deep it was but we were never told how to cross them. Nobody ever talked <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> using ropes".|$|E

[...] Blair Kelly of musicOMH compared it to the music of Circus, and more specifically to [...] "Womanizer" [...] (2008). It was also compared by Tim Sendra of Allmusic to the [...] "electro glam" [...] sound of Goldfrapp. The lyrics of [...] "Whiplash" [...] speak of a blossoming romance.

He also claimed that, other than being told to [...] "just keep people off the stage", Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: [...] "They didn't say nothing <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> any of that."

2500|$|Panopticon was an overtly {{political}} release, {{and arguably}} the clearest statement made within their music yet. It displayed fears of surveillance and of tacit governmental influence; its namesake, the panopticon, was Jeremy Bentham's concept for a prison {{system in which}} all the prisoners can be viewed by one guard in a central tower, without being able to know whether they are being observed or not. Bentham described the Panopticon as [...] "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example." [...] Quizzed on government conspiracies, Turner states: [...] "I do believe that each and every day our government and the huge corporate entities of this country lie <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> numerous subjects.

In December 2006, the BBC complaints department upheld the complaint of four Top Gear viewers that Clarkson had used the phrase [...] "ginger beer" [...] (rhyming slang for [...] "queer") in a derogatory manner, when Clarkson picked up on and agreed with an audience member's description of the Daihatsu Copen as being a bit [...] "gay".
