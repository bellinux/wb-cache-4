25|$|ICRC is {{the only}} {{institution}} explicitly named under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) as a controlling authority. The legal mandate of the ICRC stems from the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, {{as well as its}} own Statutes. The ICRC also undertakes <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not specifically mandated by law, such as visiting political prisoners outside of conflict and providing relief in natural disasters.|$|E
50|$|A {{dramatic}} change in rabbinic functions occurred with Jewish emancipation (18th-19th cents.). <b>Tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> once the primary focus for rabbis, such as settling disputes by presiding over a Jewish court, became less prominent, while other <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> secondary, like delivering sermons, increased in importance.|$|R

25|$|Barcodes became commercially {{successful}} {{when they}} were used to automate supermarket checkout systems, a task for which they have become almost universal. Their use has spread to many other <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> generically referred to as automatic identification and data capture (AIDC). The very first scanning of the now ubiquitous Universal Product Code (UPC) barcode was on a pack of Wrigley Company chewing gum in June 1974.|$|E
25|$|Job {{characteristic}} theory identifies core job {{dimensions that}} affect motivation, satisfaction, performance, etc. These dimensions include skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback. The dimensions map {{well to the}} team environment. Individual contributors who perform team <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> challenging, interesting, and engaging {{are more likely to}} be motivated to exert greater effort and perform better than team members who are working on tasks that lack those characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Robotics is the {{application}} of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory that}} is being {{examined}} to explain age related declines in working memory {{is that there is}} a limit in attentional resources seen as we age. This means that older individuals are less capable of dividing their attention between two tasks, and thus tasks with higher attentional demands are more difficult to complete due to a reduction in mental energy. <b>Tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> simple and more automatic, however, see fewer declines as we age. Working memory tasks often involve divided attention, thus they are more likely to strain the limited resources of aging individuals.|$|E
25|$|Robots {{are used}} {{extensively}} in industrial engineering. They allow businesses {{to save money}} on labor, perform <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.|$|E
25|$|What Babbage remarked is that {{skilled workers}} {{typically}} spend {{parts of their}} time performing <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> below their skill level. If the labour process can be divided among several workers, labour costs may be cut by assigning only high-skill tasks to high-cost workers, restricting other tasks to lower-paid workers. He {{also pointed out that}} training or apprenticeship can be taken as fixed costs; but that returns to scale are available by his approach of standardisation of tasks, therefore again favouring the factory system. His view of human capital was restricted to minimising the time period for recovery of training costs.|$|E

25|$|Re-engineering {{recognizes that}} an organization's {{business}} processes are usually fragmented into sub-processes and <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{carried out by}} several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one {{is responsible for the}} overall performance of the entire process. Reengineering maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re-designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing dramatic improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.|$|E
500|$|Domesticated horses {{may face}} greater mental {{challenges}} than wild horses, because {{they live in}} artificial environments that prevent instinctive behavior whilst also learning <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not natural. Horses are animals of habit that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. One trainer believes that [...] "intelligent" [...] horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal's natural inclinations.|$|E
500|$|The Minish Cap {{retains the}} general {{gameplay}} features that {{were present in}} previous Zelda installments. The main protagonist, Link, must navigate several dungeons to obtain an item or enhancement {{at the end of}} each dungeon that is pivotal towards the quest. Each of the game's [...] "bosses" [...] are defeated using the item acquired in the boss's dungeon. The game also includes multiple [...] "side quests"—optional <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not part of the main quest but rewards for completion are beneficial to the gamer. Recurring characters in the Zelda series make appearances and some form part of side quests; for example, Tingle and his brothers must all be contacted by the player to earn a reward.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} {{published}} in NTBS News Flash, [...] "30 Minutes After Noon" [...] {{is described as}} a [...] "thrilling, well-paced episode", which [...] "brings together a very sadistic bad guy scheme and some innocent, and some not-so-innocent victims in peril, all providing plenty of action for International Rescue." [...] The reviewer commends the pacing as being [...] "especially good", and also credits the [...] "inventive camera work", commenting, [...] "I don't think I've seen more use of 'real hand acting' in any other episode." [...] The concept of exploding bracelet bombs is connected to the premise of the Saw horror films, in which victims are seen to be trapped in dangerous situations and are threatened with death if they do not carry out <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> put before them.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{sometimes}} the user will wish {{to carry out}} a task while using the terminal for another purpose. A <b>task</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> running but is not receiving input from the terminal is said to be running [...] "in the background", while the single <b>task</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> receiving input from the terminal is [...] "in the foreground". Job control is a facility developed to make this possible, by allowing the user to start processes in the background, send already running processes into the background, bring background processes into the foreground, and suspend or terminate processes.|$|R

2500|$|Further {{criticism}} has been leveled by Brody (2004), {{who claimed that}} unlike tests of cognitive ability, the MSCEIT [...] "tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> related to the knowledge that is assessed". The main argument {{is that even though}} someone knows how he should behave in an emotionally laden situation, it doesn't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior.|$|E
