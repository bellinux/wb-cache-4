25|$|Meri was a kind-hearted and {{beautiful}} lady and Phra Rothasen {{lived with her}} very happily for some time, but he remembered his blind mother and aunts who still stayed in the dark cave. While showing him the palace, Meri had told Rothasen about certain magic medicines kept in a locked room including Phra Rothasen's mother and aunts's eyes. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a plan to get Meri to sleep by making her drink wine and take the eyes for his mother and aunts. Thus one night, after Meri was sleeping, Phra Rothasen stole many medicines and the eyes from the locked room. Meri woke up and looked for her husband but she saw him far away riding his flying horse. She suddenly grew into a giant and followed Phra Rothasen crying and calling him with a loud voice. To stop her, Phra Rothasen threw a magic branch that turned the space between them into a deep lake and a high mountain. Seeing her husband escape from her Meri wailed in despair, asking him to stop. Phra Rothasen was moved by her sad screams and replied that he will back after he finished his urgent mission. Then Phra Rothasen flew away and left Meri with a broken heart crying bitterly at {{the shore of the}} lake.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Final Ending", Cosmo {{is angry}} with the Lead Eliminator, who {{constantly}} attacks his family and godchild, so he transforms into a giant creature named [...] "Cos-zilla", {{a reference to the}} Japanese movie monster Godzilla. During Timmy's and his fairies' revisit the Blue Moon, they run into Turbo Thunder, who tells them how alone in the universe he was after the rock guardian threw him over the planet's horizon. Since <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a personified friend, a rock with a happy face, similar to Chuck Noland's companion Wilson the volleyball in the 2000 drama film Cast Away. In his flashback, Turbo Thunder receives an invitation flyer to the [...] "Chosen One Competition" [...] in Fairy World. On the flyer, the phrase [...] "Chosen One" [...] is printed in American Idol font. At the competition venue, the four fairy elders sit as judges behind a table in front of the auditioners like the American Idol judges do.|$|E
500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E

500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to answer the questions. The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a simple question, but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> out to remember that he had forgot all about it".|$|E
2500|$|The Assistant Hudson County Prosecutor Michael D’Andrea petitioned Judge Callahan {{to impose}} the maximum {{sentence}} of 40 years on Riordan and to discount the testimony of a [...] "rough childhood" [...] as a mitigating factor, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> this statement: ...|$|E
2500|$|We {{approached}} the fortress. [...] At {{the head of}} a group of officers we saw a captain with a long white beard, who was flourishing his cane and dancing an impromptu jig. [...] The first man he met in the relief column was a bugler. [...] He threw his arms around him. [...] Then he embraced the second bugler. [...] The band tried to keep its dignity, but to no avail. [...] He then abandoned the buglers and fell on the neck of the first drummer. [...] For a moment the drum stood between him and the object of his affections, but eventually he managed to plant two loud kisses on the drummer’s cheeks. [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> for the general-in-chief. [...] There was a sudden hush, as when an orchestra falls silent {{at the end of a}} dance. [...] He recovered himself, solemnly clicked his heels, and saluted General Brière de l’Isle. [...] We recognised Captain de Borelli.|$|E

2500|$|He {{summarized}} {{the history of}} the supreme command, trying to show that the attribution to him had been sponsored by Badoglio. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a summary of the war events in the previous months, saying that he was ready to move the government to the Po valley, exactly as after the defeat of Caporetto in World War I the government was ready to move to Sicily. He concluded by asking the participants to give their personal opinion about what he called [...] "il dilemma": war or peace? The Duce spoke calmly and confidently: he knew that, except for the three or four men against him, the [...] "swamp" [...] was undecided, and hoped that he could convince them to vote for the OdG Scorza, which gave only the military powers back to the King. After the Duce's introduction, De Bono (one of the two remaining living Quadrumvirs), then Farinacci and then De Vecchi (the other quadrumvir, who gladly accepted under the table one of Grandi's grenades) spoke in turn.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 November Blamey {{addressed}} {{the men of}} the 21st Brigade on the parade ground at Koitaki. The men of Maroubra Force expected congratulations for their efforts in holding back the Japanese. However, instead of praising them, Blamey told the brigade that they had been [...] "beaten" [...] by inferior forces, and that [...] "no soldier should be afraid to die". Captain H.D. [...] "Blue" [...] Steward, medical officer of the 2/16th recalled [...] "The troops could have withstood the Japanese field gun more easily than what they received. Blamey got them on edge almost at once by saying that they had been beaten by inferior troops in inferior numbers. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> his famous remark that 'the rabbit that ran away is the rabbit that got shot'. The whole parade was almost molten with rage and indignation." [...] Blamey's personal assistant Lieutenant Colonel Norman Carlyon, realised that damage had been done. [...] "Standing beside the small platform from which Blamey was to address the troops, I realised that he was in a most aggressive mood. He was soon expressing this in harsh words ... It amazed me that Blamey should deal so insensitively with the men of such a well-proven brigade." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary season}} began with U.S. Senator Tom Harkin winning his native Iowa as expected. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts won the New Hampshire primary on February 18, but Clinton's second-place finish, helped by his speech {{labeling}} himself [...] "The Comeback Kid," [...] energized his campaign. Jerry Brown won the Maine caucus and Bob Kerrey won South Dakota. Clinton {{won his first}} primary in Georgia. Tsongas won the Utah and Maryland primaries and a caucus in Washington. Harkin won caucuses in Idaho and Minnesota while Jerry Brown won Colorado. Bob Kerrey dropped out two days later. Clinton won the South Carolina and Wyoming primaries and Tsongas won Arizona. Harkin dropped out. Jerry Brown won the Nevada caucus. Clinton swept {{nearly all of the}} Super Tuesday primaries on March 10 making him the solid front runner. Clinton won the Michigan and Illinois primaries. Tsongas dropped out after finishing 3rd in Michigan. Jerry Brown, however, began to pick up steam, aided by using a 1–800 number to receive funding from small donors. Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut, Vermont and Alaska. As the race moved to the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, Brown had taken the lead in polls in both states. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a serious gaffe by announcing to an audience of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider Reverend Jesse Jackson as a Vice Presidential candidate. Clinton won dramatically in New York (41%–26%) and closely in Wisconsin (37%–34%). Clinton then proceeded to win a long streak of primaries leading up to Jerry Brown's home state of California. Clinton won this primary 48% to 41% and secured the delegates needed to clinch the nomination.|$|E

2500|$|To {{break up}} Xu Hai's power further, Hu Zongxian {{made use of}} {{pre-existing}} tension among Xu Hai, Chen Dong, and Ye Ma. Xu Hai and Ye Ming had previously quarrelled over a woman they took captive and over the division of their spoils, so Xu Hai had no qualms about luring Ye Ming into a government banquet. Ye Ma, thinking that the ships they were promised were finally ready for delivery, got so drunk at the banquet that he was apprehended by the officials with no trouble. Xu Hai demurred about doing the same to Chen Dong though, since, despite their differences, Chen Dong was a powerful figure in Satsuma, and Xu Hai {{could not afford to}} upset his patrons there. Hu Zongxian tried to sway Xu Hai by several means. First he bribed Xu's mistresses to urge him into action. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> Ye Ma write a letter to Chen Dong denouncing Xu Hai, then took that letter and gave it to Xu Hai, making Xu believe that there was a conspiracy against him. Finally, Hu forced Xu Hai's hand by giving him an ultimatum: send Chen Dong over or suffer the death penalty. Hearing this, Xu Hai desperately sent his booty [...] "worth more than a thousand gold" [...] to his Japanese patron the Shimazu, asking to borrow Chen Dong's services. When Chen Dong arrived, Xu Hai had him delivered to the authorities. Xu Hai then deceived Chen Dong's followers by saying the ships the government had promised were ready at Zhapu, leading them to the beach. There, seeing the ships arrayed in front of them, Chen's followers scurried onto the ships. Government troops then burst out of their walled positions and slaughtered the disarrayed mob. The few raiders who managed to steer the ships away were rounded up by a naval squadron nearby. By August 1556, Hu Zongxian had, through Xu Hai, eliminated two of the major wokou groups operating in China. All that remains is Xu Hai himself, trapped on the Chinese coast and unable to return to Japan due to his betrayal.|$|E
