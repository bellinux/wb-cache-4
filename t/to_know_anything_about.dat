People are not able <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> God except through this self-revelation. Speculation about anything which God has not revealed through his Word is not warranted. The knowledge people have of God {{is different from that}} which they have of anything else because God is infinite, and finite people are incapable of comprehending an infinite being. While the knowledge revealed by God to people is never incorrect, it is also never comprehensive.|$|E
25|$|A {{weighted}} matroid is a matroid {{together with}} a function from its elements to the nonnegative real numbers. The weight of a subset of elements is defined to be {{the sum of the}} weights of the elements in the subset. The greedy algorithm can be used to find a maximum-weight basis of the matroid, by starting from the empty set and repeatedly adding one element at a time, at each step choosing a maximum-weight element among the elements whose addition would preserve the independence of the augmented set. This algorithm does not need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the details of the matroid's definition, as long as it has access to the matroid through an independence oracle, a subroutine for testing whether a set is independent.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} the Czech {{authorities}} issued an international arrest warrant for Dahlgren, who, as was later revealed, had already passed through the passport control at Vienna International Airport before his name appeared in the international database. Subsequently, at around 1PM the Austrian authorities alerted the crew of Austrian Airlines flight OS93 of the arrest warrant. The flight, carrying Dahlgren, had left Vienna at 10:46AM and was at time flying over the United Kingdom. After contemplating an emergency landing or a return to Vienna, the pilots {{decided it would be}} safer to continue the flight. The cabin crew were instructed to pretend not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the suspect on the flight. Immediately after landing at Washington Dulles International Airport, the plane was stormed by U.S Customs and Border Protection Officers, who arrested Dahlgren and turned him over to the FBI.|$|E

25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as {{he was the only one}} on his team <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it, he had to spend a lot of time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E

Holland also asked his navigator to videotape the bombs falling from the aircraft from inside the bomb bay, also against regulations. Holland's navigator later brought the video {{to the attention of}} three Fairchild USAF officers. The first, Lieutenant Colonel Bullock, the current 325th Bomb Squadron commander, did not do anything about it and may have even tried to use the videotape as leverage to coerce the navigator into accepting a position as mission scheduler for the wing.

500|$|Co-creator J. J. Abrams' {{inspiration}} for Fringe {{came from a}} range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the Ken Russell film Altered States, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. The specific story for Fringe was developed during long conversations between series creators Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not [...] "evident but alluded to in the pilot". The team {{spent a lot of time}} thinking about the [...] "trifecta of characters" [...] that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting. The creators decided on the idea of a father-son story because it was compelling and accessible, [...] "you don't necessarily have <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> science, because everyone has a parent and everyone has issues with a parent. And I think for us it's always about coming into it through character". Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.|$|E

Johnson, Secretary of Defense, sent Jolson a telegram. 'Sorry for delay but regret no funds for entertainment – STOP; USO disbanded – STOP.' The message was as much an assault on the Jolson sense of patriotism as the actual crossing of the 38th Parallel had been. 'What are they talkin' about', he thundered. 'Funds? Who needs funds?

It's not simply about good and evil but about choices". He also felt [...] "the movie works like thrillers used to work, before {{they were required to}} contain villains the size of buildings", also calling the film [...] "a skillful thriller". Sandra Hall of the Sydney Morning Herald was more equivocal, saying, [...] "... it just about works, thanks to Carter's sense of timing and the script's allegorical enhancements." [...] Empire gave the film three stars ("good"), but expressed a desire for Chris Carter to return to the more comedic and [...] "post-modern" [...] elements of the series upon the next revisit. Stephanie Zackarek was mostly positive towards the film, saying; [...] "I Want to Believe comes off like a solid if not great episode from one of the show's early seasons, a reasonably suspenseful story made by a director with a sturdy sense of how to tell a story." [...] Mick LaSalle was also positive towards the film, saying that you didn't need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the previous settings and calling it a [...] "compelling suspense thriller with some tense moments." [...] TV Guide reviewer Maitland McDonagh gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four saying that the film was not [...] "sufficiently gripping to transform a middling thriller into something truly provocative or haunting."

60|$|About this time, too, {{the rising}} young mason {{began to feel}} that he must {{get a little more}} {{accurate}} scientific knowledge. The period for general study had now passed by, and the period for special trade reading had set in. This was well. A lad cannot do better than lay a good foundation of general knowledge and general literature during the period when he is engaged in forming his mind: a young man once fairly launched in life may safely confine himself for a time to the studies that bear directly upon his own special chosen subject. The thing that Telford began closely to investigate was--lime. Now, lime makes mortar; and without lime, accordingly, you can have no mason. But <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> really <b>about</b> lime, Telford found he must read some chemistry; and <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> really <b>about</b> chemistry he must work at it hard and unremittingly.

He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as {{he had no idea what}} he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room.

The fifth track, [...] "Last Time Lover", was originally called [...] "First Time Lover" [...] and was {{about the loss of}} virginity, but was discarded and changed to a song full of provocations, where sex is the main issue. The sixth track, [...] "Mama", was dedicated to the group's mothers, and deals with the difficulties in the relationships between mothers and teenagers that appear during adolescence. Reviewers described the ballad as [...] "glossy" [...] and [...] "corny". The seventh track, [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] is about the presumptuous superstar life and how someone can get trapped in the world of fame. The inspiration for this song came from some of the people the group met in the music industry. It was well received by critics, who thought that the song was one of the group's [...] "strongest and underrated songs" [...] and that it (still) [...] "feels relevant today". The two songs were released as a double A-side single, the fourth and last one released from the album, becoming the fourth consecutive number-one of the group in the United Kingdom, and reaching the top 10 across continental Europe. [...] "Something Kinda Funny", the eighth track of the album, is about the [...] "fun" [...] the group experienced together, and how it was fate that they came to know each other. The ninth track, [...] "Naked" [...] deals with vulnerability and the step from girls to women and how this process made the group stronger, something they were experiencing at that moment. It received mixed reviews from critics; some described it as [...] "soulful and funky as anything by TLC or Brand New Heavies", while others considered the song as a [...] "bit of a let down".
