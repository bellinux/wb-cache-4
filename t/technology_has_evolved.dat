25|$|Since its inception, NETS has {{delivered}} its signature road safety campaign, Drive Safely Work Week (DSWW), through member companies and state partners. DSWW typically has an overarching theme, with specific topics or learning points delivered each {{day during the}} course of a week in October. As <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> <b>evolved,</b> the mode of delivery for DSWW materials has shifted from printed materials to electronic materials that may be downloaded from the Internet. Over the years, prevention of distracted driving has been a common theme for DSWW. In 2010 and 2011, NETS worked in partnership with the U.S. DOT to offer DSWW campaign materials on distracted driving free of charge, an arrangement that resulted in over 6,000 organizations downloading materials during 2010. One of NETS’s member services is the “Safety in Numbers” fleet safety benchmarking program, which provides international benchmarking services, with both qualitative and quantitative data from large companies representing various industry sectors. As a group, NETS member companies participating in the benchmarking program operate nearly half a million vehicles worldwide, with more than nine billion miles driven annually (Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, unpublished data).|$|E
500|$|While {{developing}} the game, most of NST's efforts {{were focused on}} its multiplayer aspect because of its first-person shooter gameplay, and {{to take advantage of}} the Wi-Fi and voice chat capabilities of the Nintendo DS. One of the game's designers, Richard Vorodi, noted that [...] "the hardware kinda dictated [...]" [...] Wanting to introduce a new element to the Metroid series, Abe created several new bounty hunters after he realized that the game's multiplayer mode and the new bounty hunters could both be implemented seamlessly into the game: [...] "We had this idea early on and thought that would be a good way to introduce [...] and [...] to the gameplay and take advantage of that in the multiplayer." [...] Metroid Prime Hunters includes several references to previous games in the Metroid Prime series. Samus' ship is from the original Metroid Prime, and her suit is the same one that appears in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. The developers decided to add them because they wanted to show that the <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> <b>evolved,</b> and they also wanted to include something that was instantly recognizable to those who had played previous games in the series. On level design, Abe said that as the game's controls shifted from an analog stick method to touchscreen aiming, the developers wanted to avoid making the gameplay and the control scheme more difficult.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first phase}} of a £400M, ten-year resignalling scheme in South Wales by Network Rail was carried out on a [...] stretch between Port Talbot and Bridgend (termed Port Talbot East) in 2006 and 2007. The works {{provided}} a new turnback facility in both directions at Port Talbot Parkway if required. The renewals replaced an old British Railways Western Region NX panel installation, dating from 1963. Railway <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> somewhat since 1963 and the renewals will make some signalling facilities redundant. Further signalling renewals are programmed for the Newport area (which will be implemented in two phases), Cardiff and Port Talbot West.|$|E
2500|$|The puppeteer, often dubbed as the [...] "Muppet performer", {{holds the}} Muppet {{above his head}} or {{in front of his}} body, with one hand {{operating}} the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or by [...] "wearing" [...] the hands like gloves. One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left-handed as the puppeteer uses his right hand to operate the head while operating the arm rod with his left hand. There are many other common designs and means of operation. In advanced Muppets, several puppeteers may control a single character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for the character. As <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> <b>evolved,</b> the Jim Henson team and other puppeteers have developed an enormous variety of means to operate Muppets for film and television, including the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote radio control, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of a mix of technologies has allowed for scenes in which Muppets appear to be riding a bicycle, rowing a boat, and even dancing on-stage with no puppeteer in sight.|$|E
