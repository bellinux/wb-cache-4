25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E
25|$|In 1435, Elijah of Ferrara recounted meeting an Ethiopian Jew in Jerusalem in {{a letter}} to his children. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him of the ongoing {{conflict}} of his independent nation with the Christian Habesha; he relayed some of the principals of his faith, which, Ferrara concluded, balanced between Karaite and Rabbinical Judaism. His people were not familiar with the Talmud and did not observe Hanukkah, but their canon contained the book of Esther and they had an oral interpretation of the Torah. Ferrara further recorded that they had their own language, that the journey from their land lasted six months, and that the biblical Gozan river was found within their borders.|$|E
25|$|Roman is {{the leader}} of the Dark Signers. He {{possesses}} a birthmark resembling the Spider Nazca line and can use it send out spiders that can possess civilians, turning them into Dark Signers, and giving them Shadow powers and Dark Tuner and Synchro Monsters. The spiders can also be used as a means of surveillance, reporting all they have found once they return to their owner. Roman reveals himself to be Rex Goodwin's big brother and an assistant to Professor Fudo (Yusei's Father), until he met a mysterious man from Yliaster. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him to look into Ener-D's light and learn about the Earthbound Immortals' battle against the Crimson Dragon. Though revealed to be the Fifth Signer, Roman betrays Professor Fudo and causes the Zero Reverse incident after ripping his own arm off and giving it to Rex, telling him to unite the Signers. The resulting explosion transforms Roman into a Dark Signer.|$|E
60|$|Then he went on, {{and just}} as he got near the {{entrance}} one of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> him that Mrs. Treat wished to see him.|$|R
6000|$|Then, when it {{appeared}} as if fully an hour had passed, the heavy breathing of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> that they were fast asleep, and Nathan whispered cautiously: ...|$|R
50|$|Only {{after leaving}} England, were <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> of their destination. Spanish Influenza broke out {{on two of}} the three transports, and seventy-two men would {{eventually}} succumb to the disease or resultant pneumonia.|$|R
500|$|Gröning led {{a normal}} middle-class {{life after the}} war. A keen stamp collector, he was once at his local philately club's annual meeting, more than 40 years after the war, when he fell into a {{conversation}} about politics with {{the man next to}} him. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him it was [...] "terrible" [...] that Holocaust denial was illegal in Germany, and went on to tell Gröning how so many bodies could not have been burnt, and that the volume of gas that {{was supposed to have been}} used would have killed all living things in the vicinity.|$|E
500|$|Jervis {{could also}} be {{exceptionally}} kind when {{he felt that the}} situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" [...] <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell {{you are one of the}} best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, Sheldrake {{was stabbed}} {{by a man}} during a lecture in Santa Fe, New Mexico. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> a {{reporter}} that he thought Sheldrake had been using him as a [...] "guinea pig" [...] in telepathic mind control experiments for over five years. Sheldrake suffered a wound to the leg and has since recovered, while his assailant was found [...] "guilty but mentally ill".|$|E
60|$|With {{a nod to}} Percy, Ralph now walked {{steadily}} to the door. The sergeant, with <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> off for <b>the</b> duty, accompanied him. When {{they reached}} the street, it was raining heavily.|$|R
60|$|The poor {{creature}} {{was not only}} starved with hunger, and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying {{two or three days}} before, and whom she loved most tenderly.|$|R
60|$|The {{details of}} the {{expedition}} were now discussed and arranged, and <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> off to their various duties, and at eleven o'clock at night, when all in the town were fast asleep, the party quitted the bivouac and marched down again to the port.|$|R
2500|$|Gardner {{returned}} to San Francisco determined {{to succeed at}} business. A pivotal moment in his life occurred, after a sales call to a San Francisco General Hospital, when he encountered an impeccably-dressed man in a red Ferrari. Curious, Gardner asked the man about his career. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him he was a stockbroker and, from that moment on, Gardner's career path was decided. Eventually, Gardner bought a Ferrari of his own from [...] Michael Jordan. The Illinois license plate of Gardner's black Ferrari reads [...] "NOT MJ".|$|E
2500|$|In 1743, Swedenborg was {{dining in}} a private room at a tavern in London. By {{the end of the}} meal, a {{darkness}} fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling him: [...] "Do not eat too much!". Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and that he would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), when the {{brothers}} went {{to feed the}} flock in Shechem, Jacob sent Joseph to see whether all was well with them. A man found Joseph and {{asked him what he}} sought, and when he told the man that he sought his brothers, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him that they had departed for Dothan. When Joseph's brothers saw him coming, they conspired to kill him, cast him into a pit, say that a beast had devoured him, and see what would become of his dreams then. But Reuben persuaded them not to kill him but to cast him into a pit, hoping to restore him to Jacob later. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour before}} daybreak, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were aroused. Tents were struck and packed in the waggon, and <b>the</b> <b>men</b> then fell in, and {{remained}} until the king, {{with three or four}} of his officers and fifty cavalry, rode up. Fresh wood had been thrown on the fires, and some of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> off as cooks.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> {{him that}} old Guttorm was dying in his ship. He {{walked up the}} plank that lay from the shore to the gunwale, and found the old warrior lying on the poop beside the helm, wrapped in his mantle, and giving {{directions}} to his men, who were piling brushwood on the deck.|$|R
60|$|The {{crew had}} built for {{themselves}} a hut of specially large dimensions, {{in which they}} nightly assembled all together round the fires, of which there were two--one at either end. Some of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> stories, some sang songs, others played at draughts of amateur construction, and a good many played the easy but essential part of audience.|$|R
2500|$|A further $156million was endowed to a gas-station owner, Melvin Dummar, {{who told}} reporters that in 1967, he found a disheveled and dirty man lying along U.S. Route 95, just [...] north of Las Vegas. The man asked for a ride to Vegas. Dropping him off at the Sands Hotel, Dummar said <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> {{him that he was}} Hughes. Dummar later claimed that days after Hughes' death a [...] "mysterious man" [...] {{appeared}} at his gas station, leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk. Unsure if the will was genuine and unsure of what to do, Dummar left the will at the LDS Church office. In 1978, a Nevada court ruled the Mormon Will a forgery, and officially declared that Hughes had died intestate (without a valid will). In 1980, Jonathan Demme's film Melvin and Howard, was based on Dummar's story.|$|E
2500|$|Burgas {{prosecutor}} Kalina Tchapkanova quoted {{witnesses who}} said that the perpetrator [...] "spoke English with a slight accent" [...] and appeared to be Arab, while the wife of the owner of a car rental service said she was sure that the perpetrator was of Arab origin, and that he had a shaved head. The Bulgarian prosecutors said that the attacker had short hair, as opposed to the long hair seen in footage captured by a security camera at the airport, while a witness said that the perpetrator appeared to be wearing a wig. Other witnesses said that they saw the perpetrator speaking to tourists at local beaches in the days prior to the attack, and one witness said that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> a group of tourists that his mother was Dutch and his father was Iranian. According to Dr. Kosyo Yankov, {{who took part in the}} autopsy of the bomber, the body parts suggested that the bomber was a heavy man who [...] "has nothing to do with the slim man caught by the security cameras at the Bourgas airport." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob {{assembled}} a present {{of hundreds of}} goats, sheep, camels, cattle, and donkeys to appease Esau, and instructed his servants to deliver them to Esau in successive droves with the message {{that they were a}} present from his servant Jacob, who followed behind. As the presents went before him, Jacob took his wives, handmaids, children, and belongings over the Jabbok River, and then remained behind that night alone. Jacob wrestled with a [...] "man" [...] until dawn, and when the [...] "man" [...] saw that he was not prevailing, he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh and strained it. The man asked Jacob to let him go, for the day was breaking, but Jacob would not let him go without a blessing. The man asked Jacob his name, and when Jacob replied [...] "Jacob," [...] <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> him that his name would no more be Jacob, but Israel, for he had striven with God and with men and prevailed.

50|$|Jawad agreed, {{but said}} he needed to gain his mother's {{permission}} to travel. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>told</b> him to tell his family {{he had found a}} job across the border, but not to mention the details lest they worry about his safety.

2500|$|The couple {{arrived at}} the scene around 11:45p.m. After about ten minutes, a man walked up to Hollis' driver-side door and flashed a {{flashlight}} in his face, blinding him. Hollis, {{not sure if it}} was a prank or if he had been mistaken for someone else, told the man, [...] "Fellow, you've got me mixed up with someone else. You've got the wrong man." [...] The man had a pistol and told him something like, [...] "I don't want to kill you fellow, so do what I say", and ordered them {{to get out of the}} car. They both got out through the driver-side door. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>told</b> Hollis to [...] "take off your [...] britches." [...] Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they would not be hurt, but, after Hollis removed his trousers, he was struck twice in the head with a heavy, blunt object. Larey explained in an interview three months later with Texarkana Gazette reporter Lucille Holland that the noise was so loud she thought he had been shot, but she learned later it was the sound of his skull cracking.|$|E

60|$|Long before this, a {{despatch}} {{had been}} received from England bestowing the Victoria Cross upon Lisle.

60|$|The {{time passed}} more cheerfully than {{might have been}} expected.
