In the 2006 election among Jackson's opponents was Libertarian Party candidate and African-American pastor Anthony Williams, an outspoken opponent of immigration.

5|$|Poor Luftwaffe {{administration}} {{meant the}} German defence {{took time to}} get the information from their radar sites. Major Harry von Bülow-Bothkamp—commanding II./JG 77—stated that it was the naval Freya, rather than Luftwaffe early warning sites <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> alert. Owing to this, the RAF made landfall without interception. The first air-to-air shots were not traded until one hour after the Luftwaffe Freya made the initial report.|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift {{returns the}} player to Half-Lifes Black Mesa {{timeline}} once more, {{this time as}} Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> player the option to update the look of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue Shift content. Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland posted an 11–1 {{record in}} 1951, losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers {{in the season}} opener. <b>That</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Browns another spot in the {{championship}} game, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 24–17. Graham fumbled {{the ball in the}} third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14–10. Three of his throws were intercepted, but he put up 280yards of passing and a touchdown. After the season, Graham was named the league's Most Valuable Player.|$|E

5|$|Egypt gained full {{independence}} {{with the}} Egyptian Revolution of 23 July 1952 in which King Farouk was overthrown {{by a group}} of officers that included Gamal Abdel Nasser, later to emerge as the sole ruler in 1954.

On 10 January 1953 the Egyptian government ratified an agreement with the Umma representatives and other pro-independence Sudanese parties <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Sudanese the right of self-determination. During a transition period no longer than three years parliamentary elections would be held and a Sudanese government formed.

5|$|Florida State's kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Tech {{began at}} its 20-yard line.

Tech was further aided by two five-yard penalties against Florida State <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Hokies another first down, and Vick completed a short pass across midfield. On the first play in Florida State territory, Vick completed a 49-yard throw to wide receiver André Davis for Tech's first touchdown of the game. The extra point attempt was good, and with 30seconds remaining in the quarter, Tech narrowed Florida State's lead to 147.|$|E

In the meantime, however, Martin still had his sights set on an Olympic championship. The team went to the 2001 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials and finished first after the round robin with a 7–2 win-loss record. <b>That</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> team a bye to the finals, which Martin won by defeating Kerry Burtnyk with a score of 8–7.|$|E
5|$|In {{the annual}} A-Day {{game at the}} {{conclusion}} of spring practice, the White team composed of defensive starters defeated the Crimson team of offensive starters 24–15. The Crimson team opened on offense and on their first offensive play, AJ McCarron threw an interception to Robert Lester. Each team then traded punts and the first quarter ended tied at zero. On the first offensive play of the second quarter, T. J. Yeldon was tackled in the endzone for a safety to give the Crimson team a 2–0 lead. The White team responded on their next possession with a 48-yard Cade Foster field goal and took a 3–2 lead before McCarron threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Christion Jones <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Crimson team a 9–3 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{new types}} of burials and more {{imposing}} ones have been unearthed, which display {{a great variety of}} luxurious objects. Among the various burial types, the shaft grave became {{the most common form of}} elite burial, a feature <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> name to the early period of Mycenaean Greece. Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid to rest in gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments. The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles A and B signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.|$|E

Morgan's fourth goal of the tournament was a match-winner <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> U.S. a gold medal, which was subsequently voted the best goal of the tournament, and later FIFA's second-best goal of the year. Morgan's performance on the field earned her the Bronze Shoe as the tournament's third-highest scorer and the Silver Ball as the tournament's second-best player behind teammate Sydney Leroux.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 1844, Philadelphia {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> city {{a battalion of}} artillery, a regiment of infantry {{and at least one}} full troop of cavalry for the purpose of providing the preservation of peace within the city when necessary. The difficulty of quelling the riots and other crime led to the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass an 1845 act that required Philadelphia, the township of Moyamensing and the unincorporated districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Penn to maintain a police force of one man per 150 taxable inhabitants. In 1850, another act was passed that established that the Philadelphia police force would police the city and seven surrounding districts. The inability to maintain order effectively in Philadelphia's suburbs would be an important argument for the consolidation of the city in 1854.|$|E
5|$|One day at harvest time, {{according}} to William of Newburgh {{during the reign}} of King Stephen (1135–1154), the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, beside one of the wolf pits <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> village its name. Their skin was green, they spoke an unknown language, and their clothing was unfamiliar. Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw broad beans, which they consumed eagerly. The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. The boy, who appeared to be the younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised.|$|E

5|$|Spacey was Mendes' {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Lester, though DreamWorks had urged the {{director}} to consider better-known actors; similarly, the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Bening without DreamWorks' knowledge. Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, and on location in Los Angeles. Mendes' dominant style was deliberate and composed; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tension. Cinematographer Conrad Hall complemented Mendes' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events. During editing, Mendes made several changes <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> film a less cynical tone than the script.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs, led by Tinker, Evers, and Chance, won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. In 1908, the Cubs {{clinched}} the pennant after defeating the Giants {{in part due}} to Merkle's Boner. In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run off Christy Mathewson, and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's baserunning gaffe. In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple off Mathewson that started the rally <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Cubs the victory, clinching the pennant.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons {{had trouble}} moving {{the ball at}} first, but were helped by a 15-yard {{personal}} foul penalty against Virginia Tech that gave them a first down. Weiss completed a pass <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Falcons another first down and drove Air Force inside Tech territory. On the first play within Hokie territory, Weiss fumbled the ball, but fell {{on it for a}} loss, and Air Force retained possession. Weiss made up for his fumble two plays later when he scrambled for a first down that kept the drive going. Despite that effort, Tech was able to force a stop and Air Force punted with 3:10 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
