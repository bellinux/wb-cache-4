5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the word of God and noted that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can {{have the power to}} wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E

25|$|One tax protester {{argument}} is that the acquittal of a defendant in a Federal criminal tax case proves that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> imposing the Federal income tax liability, or that the acquittal relieves the defendant of liability for the Federal income tax. No court has accepted this argument.|$|E
25|$|Apostasy {{is also a}} {{crime in}} smaller Muslim-majority {{countries}} such as Maldives and Comoros. In Nigeria, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> that explicitly makes apostasy a crime; however, several Muslim-majority states of Nigeria such as Zamfara have laws invoking Sharia, which {{have been used to}} persecute Muslim apostates, particularly Muslims who have converted to Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Some tax protesters {{argue that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> {{imposing}} a Federal income tax or requiring {{the filing of}} a return, or {{that the government is}} obligated to show the tax protesters the law or tell the protesters why they are subject to tax, or that the government has refused to disclose the law.|$|E
25|$|District heating has rather little legal {{framework}} in Germany. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> {{on it as}} most elements of district heating are regulated in governmental or regional orders. There is no governmental support for district heating networks but a law to support cogeneration plants. As in the European Union the CHP Directive will come effective, this law probably needs some adjustment.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> banning {{discrimination}} against disabled individuals, although the government, under the law, {{is supposed to}} care for such persons. Nor is there any law requiring any buildings, public or otherwise, to be wheelchair-accessible. There is {{little in the way}} of institutional help for disabled people, who generally support themselves through begging. There are, however, protections in the labor law for disabled workers.|$|E

25|$|Bolt Thrower {{were formed}} in September 1986 as a thrash/punk band, {{influenced}} largely by bands such as Slayer, Crass and Discharge. The band {{was founded by}} bassist Gavin Ward and guitarist Barry Thomson in a Coventry pub toilet during a hardcore punk gig. Shortly thereafter Andrew Whale and Alan West joined on drums and vocals respectively. In April 1987 the In Battle <b>There</b> <b>Is</b> <b>No</b> <b>Law</b> demo was recorded with this line-up.|$|E
25|$|With this line-up they {{recorded}} {{their first}} Peel session on 3 January 1988, with John Peel, the alternative disk jockey of BBC Radio One. He had received their second demo and became {{enthusiastic about the}} band. They recorded four tracks for it, resulting in a deal with Vinyl Solution to release one album. Just before the recording of their first full-length album, they replaced their singer with their driver Karl Willetts. Their debut LP, In Battle <b>There</b> <b>Is</b> <b>No</b> <b>Law</b> is only a half hour in length and has a primitive and raw sound often categorized as grindcore.|$|E
25|$|Jussi Saloranta, {{the owner}} of Thailand's only MMA promotion, DARE Fight Sports, {{revealed}} that his lawyers found that the ban was actually premature, and that from a legal standpoint, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> banning mixed martial arts in the country, and that the SAT's ban {{was more of a}} scare tactic. Because of this DARE continue to showcase events while informing fans only at the last minute through texts {{on the day of the}} event, and presenting the videos on YouTube as The Most Dangerous Gameshow. Saloranta has also helped set up the MMA Association of Thailand, in the hopes of reaching a compromise with SAT and regulating mixed martial arts in Thailand.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in Austria, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> {{in effect}} in Germany {{requiring}} {{the return of}} Nazi-looted art, {{as long as the}} items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the 1998 Washington Agreement, Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. Any failure {{on the part of the}} German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might very well prove to be a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.|$|E
25|$|Per Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{one must}} be Muslim to be {{considered}} Malay. In practice, Muslims cannot convert to another religion due to the Shari'a courts denying conversion claims, and if a Malay did convert they would lose their status as bumiputera. People of non-Muslim origins are required to convert to Islam if they marry a Muslim person. Public schools are required to offer Islamic religious instruction, although alternative ethics classes are provided for non-Muslims. Many women wear the tudong, which covers the head but leaves the face exposed, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> requiring this. Islamic police monitor the Muslim population. Regulation of sexual activities among the Muslim population is strict, with laws prohibiting unmarried couples from occupying a secluded area or a confined space, to prevent suspicion of acts considered islamically immoral.|$|E
25|$|It is the government’s {{policy to}} fully recover costs for {{water supply and}} {{sanitation}} through user fees, and that water tariffs should be volumetric. The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (until 2008 the Ministry of Construction) oversees financing for urban water and sanitation infrastructure as well as policies concerning the regulation of water and sanitation utilities. Some important policy papers it has issued are “Accelerating the Marketization of Public Utilities” (No.272 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2002), the “Measure on Public Utilities Concession Management” (No.126 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2004), and the “Opinions on Strengthening Regulation of Public Utilities” (No.154 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2005). However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> concerning the regulation of public utilities or private sector participation in the sector. The Ministry of Health has attributions related to the promotion of rural {{water supply and sanitation}}.|$|E

5000|$|Schiff {{appears in}} the film for another reason as well. The filmmaker lampoons Judge Kent Dawson's {{reaction}} to Schiff's defense. The film alleges that the judge [...] "denied Irwin the ability to prove to a jury that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> requiring Americans to file an income tax return. He denied Irwin the right to attempt to prove to a jury <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> ... by stating, 'I will not allow the law in my courtroom.'" [...] At 0:48:28 of the film, Russo introduces the judge and his statement.|$|R
25|$|Prisons {{typically}} {{do not allow}} inmates to donate organs to anyone but immediate family members. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> against prisoner organ donation; however, the transplant community has discouraged use of prisoner's organs since the early 1990s due to concern over prisons' high-risk environment for infectious diseases. Physicians and ethicists also criticize the idea because a prisoner {{is not able to}} consent to the procedure in a free and non-coercive environment, especially if given inducements to participate. However, with modern testing advances to more safely rule out infectious disease and by ensuring that there are no incentives offered to participate, some have argued that prisoners can now voluntarily consent to organ donation just as they can now consent to medical procedures in general. With careful safeguards, and with over 2 million prisoners in the U.S., they reason that prisoners can provide a solution for reducing organ shortages in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Texas {{changed its}} {{execution}} laws in 1923, requiring the executions {{be carried out}} on the electric chair and that they {{take place at the}} Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville (also known as Huntsville Unit). From 1928 until 1965, this was also home to the state's male death row. The first executions on the electric chair were on February 8, 1924, when Charles Reynolds, Ewell Morris, George Washington, Mack Matthews, and Melvin Johnson had their death sentences carried out. The five executions were the most carried out on a single day in the state. The state would conduct multiple executions on a single day on several other occasions, the last being on September 5, 1951. Since then, the state has not executed more than one person on a single day, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> prohibiting it. A total of 361 people were electrocuted in Texas, with the last being Joseph Johnson on July 30, 1964.|$|E
25|$|One {{contention}} by {{some tax}} protesters {{is that a}} taxpayer {{should be allowed to}} introduce, as evidence in court, copies of statutes, cases or other materials to persuade the jury about what the law is. Courts do not allow this procedure as, under the U.S. legal system, the general rule is that neither side in a civil or criminal case is allowed to try to prove to the jury what the law is. For example, in a murder case the defendant is not allowed to persuade the jury that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>law</b> against murder, or to try to interpret the law for the jury. Likewise, the prosecution is not allowed to do this. Instead, disagreements about what the law is are argued by both sides before the judge, who then makes a ruling. Prior to jury deliberations, the judge instructs the jury on the law. Examples of applications of this rule in tax controversies are United States v. Ambort, United States v. Bonneau, and United States v. Willie.|$|E
