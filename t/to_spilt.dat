After fourteen years' confinement, he was released on bail and lived in Holborn, where his benevolence was shown by all manner of works of charity. [...] "He relieved the poor wheresoever he came, so that flies flock not thicker <b>to</b> <b>spilt</b> honey than beggars constantly crowd about him". He set up a public aqueduct in Holborn, and a hospice for the poor at Bath; he distributed every day to the sick the milk of twelve cows, took care of orphans, and encouraged sports on Sundays among the youth of London by giving prizes.|$|E
50|$|After {{dominating}} practice week John McGuinness {{riding a}} 1000cc Honda Fireblade was set as favourite for a 12th TT {{win for the}} first race of the Centenary TT with the 6 lap (226.38 miles) Superbike TT race scheduled for mid-day on Saturday 2 June 2007. Despite the 2006 Isle of Man TT being the first practice and races not interrupted by the weather since the Golden Jubilee event of 1957, after the cancellation of the Wednesday evening practice the Superbike Race was first delayed by 30 minutes due <b>to</b> <b>spilt</b> oil at the Bungalow and then by damp-patches, low-lying mist and high winds on the Mountain Section of the course. The Superbike TT Race was postponed until Monday 4 June 2007 after {{the deterioration of the}} weather and controversy over the TT Race regulations the bans the use of hand-cut slicks. As the difficult weather conditions demanded hand-cut slick racing tyres, it was alleged that Honda would withdraw if the Superbike TT race was not postponed or that John McGuinness and Ian Hutchinson would start the race on slicks and then turnoff the course at Bray Hill and return to the race paddock.|$|E
50|$|After their {{collisions}} in {{the first}} race, neither Huff nor Valente made {{the start of the}} race. Thompson dropped down the order at the start as Tom Coronel moved into the lead from second, followed by the two factory Hondas and Stefano D'Aste who followed Gabriele Tarquini in running off the track onto the grass. By the end of the back straight Ma was up to third behind Monteiro {{and at the end of}} the lap both Ma and Loeb led Coronel. The second lap saw Loeb take the lead of the race after a mistake by Ma as López picked off Monteiro and closed in on the back of Coronel. Thompson pulled into the pits at the end of the first lap while Coronel went off the circuit dropping him further down the order and collecting grass in his radiator grill. The safety car came out on lap three due <b>to</b> <b>spilt</b> oil on the exit of turn two as the stranded car of D'Aste was towed off the circuit. During the safety car period Ma pitted due to overheating and to have his radiator cleaned out, dropping him to the back of the field. The race resumed on lap six and López used his straight line speed advantage to pick off Tarquini on the back straight and leaving Tarquini to deal with Muller behind. The start of lap seven saw Chilton take Dušan Borković for eighth with Rydell following him through, Borković then dropped a wheel off the track and ripped the front bumper of his Proteam Racing Honda off on the kerbing. Lap ten saw Muller run into the right-rear end of Bennani as both pursued Tarquini; Bennani dropped from fourth to seventh as a result. Muller continued to have problems when he drifted wide and lost a place to Monteiro, Muller went into the pits on lap twelve for repairs. Loeb comfortably beat López to win the race, Monteiro took the final podium place and Bennani in fifth was the Yokohama Trophy winner.|$|E

40|$|House sparrow (Passer domesticus) {{numbers have}} {{declined}} rapidly in both {{rural and urban}} habitats across Western Europe over the last 30 years, leading to their inclusion on the UK conservation red list. The decline in farmland {{has been linked to}} a reduction in winter survival caused by reduced food supply. This reduction in food supply is associated with agricultural intensification that has led to the loss of seed-rich winter stubble and access <b>to</b> <b>spilt</b> grain. However, urban house sparrows have also declined, suggesting that reduced food supply in farmland is not the sole reason for the decline. Here, we show that changes in house sparrow mass and thus fat reserves are not regulated to minimize starvation risk, as would be expected if limited winter food were the only cause of population decline. Instead, the species appears to be responding to mass-dependent predation risk, with starvation risk and predation risk traded-off such that house sparrows may be particularly vulnerable to environmental change that reduces the predictability of the food supply...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The main {{constraint}} in message {{transmission is}} security. The key must be shared among users {{so that we}} have a secure transmission in group based message transmission. In this paper we discuss an important security problem that happens in mobile ad hoc network for key agreement in dynamic group. For a communication to be secure, a group key must be shared by {{all the members of the}} group. The key must be updated when any member of the group leaves existing group or become a new member of the existing group. In this paper, we establish a secured transmission. The main idea here is <b>to</b> <b>spilt</b> the existing network into smaller sub-network and each sub-network maintains its own keys. These keys should be updated when a existing node leave the network or when an new node joins the existing system. The nodes that have the high stability in the subnetwork will be made as the Inner gateway member and among Inner gateway member the one that has high stability will be made as Outer gateway member.

He {{described it as a}} windowless cabin twelve by fourteen feet, covered with rawhide and brush as a roof, with a chimney made of rocks and logs. He almost never shut the door as it was his only source of light. Moses Schallenberger was part of the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party that crossed the Overland Trail in 1844 - 45. When the Party reached the Sierras in November 1844, it began to snow and they decided <b>to</b> <b>spilt</b> up. Most of the Party continued on, and three men - Joseph Foster, Allen Montgomery, and Moses Schallenberger stayed with six of the wagons. They quickly built a cabin. However, as the snow increased they felt they might starve if they stayed. They set out {{to catch up with the}} rest of the Party, but Schallenberger's legs repeatedly cramped and he could not go on. He urged the others to continue without him and he returned to the cabin. He spent his time writing and reading books, which John Townsend had left in one of the wagons. He trapped whatever he could near the cabin, remarking that foxes and crows tasted quite good, whereas coyotes were ""revolting. "" He also had enough coffee to make one cup, which he saved until Christmas day to enjoy. He was not rescued until February 28 th, 1845. Moses was nineteen years old...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Risk {{management}} and societal safetyStudies {{have found that}} deterministic performance-based fire safety design leads to unnecessary high safety levels in buildings in Denmark. Other studies have described that prescribed fire safety regulations leads to safety levels that vary based {{on the type of}} occupancy and the type of fire safety concept. Additionally, it has been found that designers do not focus on the safety margin of designs, which leads to further inconsistency in the safety levels of different buildings. These issues are problematic for building developers and building users as resources are wasted on fire safety installations and systems that are not necessarily required. A risk-based design approach has been suggested as a solution to the problems. However, risk-based methods require reliable models and data to adequately describe the safety level of a building. The first goal {{of the present study was}} to assess the potential of using Bayesian networks to improve current fire risk analysis methods. The study found that Bayesian networks have significant advantages compared to the tools currently used in fire safety engineering in Denmark — for example fault and event trees. The advantages include the enhanced ability to model interconnected phenomena and the possibility to model variables more detailed than a mere binary representation. Based on these qualities, the study found that the use of Bayesian networks could improve fire risk analyses. However, it was also found that amethodology for successful application of Bayesian networks in fire safety engineering has not been developed. Therefore, the second goal of this study was to develop a framework for the application of Bayesian network models in fire safety engineering. The framework was developed based on different Bayesian network models for use in fire risk analysis found in the literature. However, these models were not deemed adequate to describe all the challenges regarding implementation of a new tool in practice. Therefore, it was investigated how a state of the art Bayesian network model called TRANSIT has been applied in assessment of road tunnel safety. TRANSIT was found to be a holistic model with focus on both incident occurrence and consequences. The model was evaluated based on a complex road tunnel called Rogfast in order to test the limitations of TRANSIT. The evaluation showed that there was some fundamental flaws in the model, for example in the way the model handles uncertainty. Despite this, several concepts used in TRANSIT were found to be applicable for fire safety engineering purposes. These concepts included how <b>to</b> <b>spilt</b> a building in segments with a uniform risk level and how to combine different parameters in a central factor in order to easier model for example occurrence of unwanted events. Based on the evaluation of TRANSIT and the Bayesian network models found in the literature, 19 recommendations to the use of Bayesian networks in fire safety engineering was formulated. These recommendations formthe basis of the framework. The recommendations was separated in four main categories: (i) Categorisation and limitation ofmodels, (ii) key variables to include, (iii) modelling methods and (iv) methods for handling uncertainty. The full list of recommendations is seen in table 5. 2 on page 56. In closing, it was found that explicit acceptance criteria are needed in order to maximise the potential of risk-based methods in fire safety engineering. In Denmark, there is currently no such criteria, thus, for the time being Bayesian Network models can only be used to compare the risk level in different buildings or to model failure of sub-systems or processes...|$|E
