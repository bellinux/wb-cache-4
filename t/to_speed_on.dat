Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought the viewers up <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then explaining what Larson had done so far, before the game resumed.

5|$|Bruce {{set about}} {{applying}} his business principles to his cabinet, putting {{his experience as}} both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical. He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members up <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> the issue. His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability. Cabinet minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce {{was the best of}} the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Gordon led {{the field}} back up <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> the restart. On lap 226, Sam Hornish, Jr. spun and Labonte {{collided}} with the wall, prompting the fourth caution.

Four laps later, Logano {{collided with the}} wall, but escaped with minor damage. On lap 247, Edwards moved into sixth.

5|$|Edwards passed Earnhardt {{to reclaim}} the lead on lap 195, while Earnhardt lost a further {{position}} after Kenseth got ahead of him on the same lap. Ten laps later, Biffle moved ahead of Harvick to take fifth place, while his teammate Kenseth had a 1.5-second lead over the second-place Edwards by the 211th lap. Three laps later, the seventh caution was issued when officials located debris in the turn-two groove. The leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments. One tire from Edwards' car went outside his pit box {{but he was not}} penalized because a cameraman blocked Edwards' crew from retrieving the tire. Kenseth led the field back up <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> the lap-219 restart; Earnhardt was in second place and Edwards third. Casey Mears hit Vickers, who spun and triggered the eighth caution on lap 224; both drivers avoided contacting the wall. Kenseth maintained the lead on the lap-227 restart. Edwards drove up the track in an attempt to take the lead on lap 229, but Kenseth kept the position. Four laps later, the ninth caution was needed when Dale Jarrett spun and hit the turn-two outside wall. Kenseth remained the leader at the restart on lap 236. Edwards passed teammate Kenseth for the lead two laps later, and began to pull away. Earnhardt caught up to Kenseth by lap 243 and ten laps later he passed Kenseth for second.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch {{stayed out}} {{and led the}} field back up <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> the lap twelve restart. Four laps later, Edwards started to {{challenge}} Kyle Busch for the lead. Jeff Gordon moved up to third on lap 18, and Martin moved from third to eighth by the same lap.

25|$|A month shy of his 55th birthday, Unser {{entered the}} 1994 race with Arizona Motorsports, hoping {{to qualify for}} what would be his 28th Indy 500. The team was very underfunded, and Unser had {{considerable}} trouble getting the car up <b>to</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>On</b> the first weekend of qualifying, he waved off after a poor qualifying lap. After some minimal practice the following day, he quit the team. He announced his retirement on May 17, 1994.|$|E

Underway, he is flawless over rank 2 at 150 meters timed at 1 minute and 22.67 seconds with a split of 28.85 where he countered Peru in the chase. However, lacuna concludes time at 1:52.91 where he ranked 5 {{of the heat}} with splitting time of 30.24. Consequentially, he is at 36th in the results wherein he did not qualify for semi-finals. In contrast, lacuna's coach, Pinky Brosas stated that he was speedy at 100 meters but race inconsistent at the rest meters, coach Brosas adds through Lacuna's excitement and adrenaline-rush was his grounds <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> the first half, although, {{he was in the}} mark of his presentation to learn the consequence.|$|E
25|$|Williams had {{not been}} {{involved}} with experiments that had been carried out by troop carriers over the previous months and was therefore not up <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> the latest pathfinder equipment and tactics, which were neglected during the planning phase of HUSKY. Moreover, the route chosen for the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing's operation was particularly difficult, involving three sharp turns over water in dim moonlight. Williams was unable to secure the necessary agreement from the naval commander, Vice Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt for a straighter route. Nor was he able to persuade the Twelfth Air Force to provide a fighter escort for his troop carriers or to fly searchlight neutralisation missions, although the RAF agreed to fly some missions against searchlights. On 21 May, Williams moved his headquarters from Casablanca to Oujda in order to observe the progress of training of the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing and the 82nd Airborne Division. At least one of his group commanders felt that Williams was over-optimistic about the proficiency of his crews.|$|E

500|$|Before a Hammond organ {{can produce}} sound, the motor {{that drives the}} tonewheels must come up <b>to</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>On</b> most models, {{starting}} a Hammond organ involves two switches. The [...] "Start" [...] switch turns a dedicated starter motor, which must run for about 12 seconds. Then, the [...] "Run" [...] switch is turned on for about four seconds. The [...] "Start" [...] switch is then released, whereupon the organ is ready to generate sound. The H-100 and E-series consoles and L-100 and T-100 spinet organs, however, had a self-starting motor that required only a single [...] "On" [...] switch. A pitch bend effect can be created on the Hammond organ by turning the [...] "Run" [...] switch off and on again. This briefly cuts power to the generators, causing them to run {{at a slower pace}} and generate a lower pitch for a short time. Hammond's New B3 contains similar switches to emulate this effect, though it is a digital instrument.|$|E
500|$|Andy surprises {{everyone}} by showing up a day early {{and proceeds to}} alienate the entire office {{through a series of}} stupid or tone-deaf actions: he arrives at work without having washed or shaved since he left, he wrecks Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) record-setting sale with the Scranton White Pages for no reason other than to reassert his authority as boss, shows no shame at accepting all of his absentee paychecks and a [...] "merit bonus" [...] because the branch exceeded their quarterly sales goal while he was gone, and holds a meeting to get up <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> recent events so he can bluff his way through a meeting with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), who has no idea that Andy was gone at all. The employees decide not to tell David about Andy's unapproved absence out of gratitude for Andy's past kindnesses, but at the meeting they cannot resist crafting made-up recent events in the hope that he will blow his own cover. However, when David meets with Andy he is almost completely oblivious to Andy's erroneous statements, and Andy quickly catches on to what the employees are up to.|$|E

60|$|They started; they ran. Many a wall checked {{but did not}} baffle them. Shirley was surefooted and agile; {{she could}} spring like a deer when she chose. Caroline, more timid and less dexterous, fell once or twice, and bruised herself; but she rose again directly, saying she was not hurt. A {{quickset}} hedge bounded the last field; they lost time in seeking a gap in it. The aperture, when found, was narrow, but they worked their way through. The long hair, the tender skin, the silks and the muslins suffered; but what was chiefly regretted was the impediment this difficulty had caused <b>to</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>On</b> the other side they met the beck, flowing deep in a rough bed.

Long, however, before the castle was reached, dizzy confusion and leaden helplessness, when no longer stimulated by his brother's presence, so grew on him that it was with much ado that Heinz could keep him in his saddle; but, when he saw his mother in the castle gateway, he again collected his forces, bade Heinz withdraw his supporting arm, and, straightening himself, waved a greeting to her, as he called cheerily; [...] "Victory, dear mother.
