50|$|It is the {{endpoint}} of the Fianarantsoa-Côte Est railway (FCE), which {{connects the}} city of Fianarantsoa with the sea. For those interested in traveling to Manakara via the railway, please be advised the train can take over 12 hours at times. It usually leaves Fianarantsoa at 7 in the morning, and is supposed to reach Manakara by 4 pm, {{but there have been}} incidences of it not reaching Manakara until much later. If one needs to return to the capital from Manankara and time is an issue, take a plane or a taxi-brousse (<b>Taxi-Bus).</b> There is also an airport and a national road along the coastline.

50|$|Public {{transportation}} is assured by CITSO (Conseil Intermunicipal de Transport du Sud-Ouest). They run two Chateauguay-Angrignon loop bus routes circulating in opposite directions. A city minibus transfers commuters {{from the western}} part of the suburb to the downtown, where the other off-peak routes pass. During rush hours, more bus routes connect the various neighbourhoods with the Angrignon bus terminal and metro station. A special express bus route connects western Chateauguay and the Chateauguay Park-and-ride with downtown Montreal, only during rush hours. A reserved lane on Highway 138 eastbound makes the connection significantly faster when the Mercier Bridge is congested. The Chateauguay public transit system also offers a <b>Taxi-Bus</b> service which allows those people who live outside of the normal bus routes to, by way of transfer, use a taxi funded by CITSO to drop them off at specific points in the city usually within walking distance of their residence.|$|E
5000|$|Rwamagana lies {{approximately}} 50 km from Kigali, on {{the newly}} renovated road leading east towards Tanzania. There was formerly {{a large amount}} of traffic running through the centre, particularly freight to and from Tanzania, but with the recent creation of a bypass, the centre of the city is now quieter. The city lies mainly along two roads, the main east-west route, and a spur leading off to the south. The main market and the Banque de Kigali are on this spur, while the city's two petrol stations, <b>taxi-bus</b> parks and post office are on the east-west road. There is a large church at the western end of the city, adjacent to the main secondary school, and a new conference centre at the eastern end of the bypass.Rwamagana district has about 14 sectors including: Kigabiro, Muyumbu, Nyakariro, Karenge, Nzige, Gahengeri, Mwurire, Rubona, Gishari, Munyiginya, Muhazi, Gishari, Mushutu and Munyaga.Five leading commercial centres with modern market and central services in commercial industries are Rwamagana centre, Karenge centre, Nyagasambu centre, Rubona centre.Four coffee washing station in this district include: RWACOF at Karenge, KOPAKABI at Karenge, Muyumbu and Rubona washing stations are the major factory to prepare the coffee in the district.Rwamagana has a big city called PLAGE in Muhazi sector and Kigabiro as the second big city ...|$|E
40|$|SIMULATION OF A NIGHT <b>TAXI-BUS</b> SERVICE FOR THE HISTORICAL CENTER OF ROME The Municipality of Rome {{plans to}} {{introduce}} a <b>taxi-bus</b> system as a night service. A micro-simulation model was developed to estimate the needed information. Two major topics regarding this model are presented. First, the iteration process for input parameters is described. The number of potential customers is determined {{by means of an}} external modal split model. Two input parameters (frequency of trips and travel times) for the external model are estimated by the micro-simulation model. An iteration process was used. The second topic is the integration of an optimization model into the micro-simulation model. Both simulation and optimization components were implemented in th...|$|E
40|$|A <b>taxi-bus</b> {{system is}} a {{logistical}} dial-a-ride system. In a typical dial-a-ride system, users call a control center by phone or via Internet {{and ask for a}} ride at a desired time from their origin to their destination. Vehicles operate in fixed areas, while routes and frequency of trips are variable and demand-dependent. The investigated <b>taxi-bus</b> system of Rome differs in some respects from this standard in that the route of taxi-buses is variable but the frequency is fixed. Most cinemas, theatres, restaurants, and discotheques in Rome are located in the historical center. This causes immense private traffic flows during the night hours. To help reduce private traffic flows and related side effects (pollution, noise, accidents), the Municipality of Rome introduced a night taxi bus service to connect the historical center of Rome (ZTL, for Zona a Traffico Limitato, limited traffic zone) with those parts of the city lying just inside the Grande Raccordo Anulare (GRA), the outer ring road, about 15 km from the center of Rome. The service runs daily from 20 : 00 to 02 : 00 hours. Each corridor was given its own fleet of taxi-buses. Each vehicle seats eight passengers plus the driver. Outbound customers board the taxi bus at defined stops inside the ZTL and alight anywhere inside their destination corridor. This <b>taxi-bus</b> system is more flexible than a traditiona...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the changes that}} might result from the large-scale uptake of a shared and self-driving fleet of vehicles in a mid-sized European city. The work explores two different self-driving vehicle concepts – a ridesharing system (Shared Taxi), which emulates a taxi-like system where customers accept small detours from their original direct path and share part of their ride with others and a dynamic bus-like service with minibuses (<b>Taxi-Bus),</b> where customers pre-book their service at least 30  min in advance (permanent bookings for regular trips should represent most requests) and walk short distances to a designated stop. Under {{the premise that the}} “upgraded” system should as much as possible deliver the same trips as today in terms of origin, destination and timing, and that it should also replace all car and bus trips, it looks at impacts on car fleet size, volume of travel and parking requirements. Mobility output and CO 2 emissions are also detailed in two different time scales (24  h. average and peak-hour only). The obtained results suggest that a full implementation scenario where the existing metro service is kept and private car, bus and taxi mobility would be replaced by shared modes would significantly reduce travelled vehicle. kilometres and CO 2 emissions...|$|E
40|$|Michael Breitenfelder weist in diesem Beitrag auf das Problem der Aufrechterhaltung der öffentlichen Daseinsvorsorge in Bezug auf deren Erreichbarkeit hin. Er zeigt die Situation in zwei Oberfränkischen Gemeinden auf, schlägt Maßnahmen vor, mit denen man diesem Problem entgegenwirken kann und stellt Forderungen an die Entwicklungspolitik ländlicher Räume in Bayern. Aufgrund von Auslastungs- und Tragfähigkeitsproblemen und dem damit verbundenen Rückzug des Handels aus der Fläche in weiten Teilen der peripheren ländlichen Teilräume Bayerns müssen längere Wegstrecken zur Aufrechterhaltung der Daseinsvorsorge zurückgelegt werden. Die dazukommende Gefährdung der Bereitstellung eines ausreichenden Angebotes im öffentlichen Personennahverkehr führt zu Erreichbarkeitsproblemen im ländlichen Raum. Dünn besiedelte Regionen sind akut bedroht, eine wohnortnahe Versorgung immobiler Bevölkerungsschichten ist gefährdet. Innovative und {{flexible}} Angebote und Bedienungsformen sind hier gefragt. Rufbusse, Anruf- Sammeltaxis oder auch eine mobile ärztliche Versorgung wären Möglichkeiten, der Unterversorgung vorzubeugen. Sicher ist, dass es einer differenzierten Herangehensweise bezüglich möglicher Lösungsansätze bedarf. In this paper, Michael Breitenfelder {{draws attention}} to the problem of maintaining public infrastructure, and in particular to problems of accessibility. The author describes the situation in two municipalities in Upper Franconia, proposes a number of measures to counter this problem, and calls for action within the scope of development policy for Bavaria’s rural areas. As a result of problems of capacity utilisation and viability, and the associated wholesale retreat of the retail sector from many peripheral and rural parts of Bavaria, the population now have to travel long distances to make use of essential infrastructure and services. In addition to this, the risk to the provision of adequate public-transport services gives rise to accessibility problems in rural areas. More sparsely populated regions are facing a serious threat; for less mobile members of society, the supply of the services they need close to where they live is now also at risk. What is called for here is innovative and flexible forms of supply and service. Call-a-bus and <b>taxi-bus</b> services would be possible ways of preventing supply-side shortages. There is certainly now a need for a more nuanced approach to finding appropriate solutions...|$|E
