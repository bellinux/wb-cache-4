A crowd of men was trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They {{said they wanted to}} keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E
25|$|Sea {{levels are}} {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> one meter higher by 2100, though this projection is disputed. A {{rise in the}} sea level would result in an agricultural land loss, in particular {{in areas such as}} South East Asia. Erosion, submergence of shorelines, salinity of the water table due to the increased sea levels, could mainly affect agriculture through inundation of low-lying lands.|$|E

25|$|Pilots, {{including}} {{the present day}} pilots of the Commemorative Air Force’s Fifi, {{one of the last}} two remaining flying B-29s, describe flight after takeoff as being an urgent struggle for airspeed (generally, flight after takeoff should consist of striving for altitude). Radial engines need airflow to keep them cool, and failure <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire. One useful technique was to check the magnetos while already on takeoff roll rather than during a conventional static engine-runup before takeoff.|$|E

During the stops, Hill messed {{up and the}} team, afraid that he would lose the lead, sent him back out too quickly without giving him enough fuel. Schumacher however was already ahead and Hill had to stop again for fuel. When he rejoined, he was over 20 seconds behind. Mansell too was slow and Barrichello was ahead of him. Mansell tried to pass him and there was contact. Both had to pit, with Mansell {{dropping}} to seventh and Barrichello going well down.|$|E
25|$|At Silverstone, {{which he}} said he {{considers}} to be his second home, he qualified 16th, outpacing Button. With heavy rain on race day, through good use of an extreme wet tyre he finished 3rd, achieving his first podium since 2005. However, in Germany, a collision with David Coulthard ended his hopes for points. In Hungary, he was lapped by the leader, repeating the same performance in Valencia. In Belgium he qualified 16th but had to retire because of a gearbox fault. At a wet Monza, he was second fastest in Friday practice and started from 16th on the grid. He managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 9th {{but as a result}} of using the wrong type of tyre in his second pit stop he ended up 17th. At the first ever night race in Singapore he was in a good position to score some points after pitting before the pit lane closed for the safety car period, but shortly afterwards the engine failed and he had to retire. In Japan he started from 17th on the grid, but managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 13th {{by the end of the}} race. In China he managed to get into Q2 for the first time in ten races, and would have started 14th. But after Mark Webber had his ten place penalty for an engine change added he was moved up to 13th. On race day he had a good start, and got up to 10th early on and held a strong mid table position all race and finished 11th, five places ahead of Button, who had struggled all weekend.|$|E

In Monaco, Räikkönen qualified third. During the race he got up to 2nd and kept pace with Alonso, however he retired during a safety car period after a failed heat shield led to a wiring loom inside the car catching fire. After the retirement he was seen on live TV walking along the Monaco sidewalks with his helmet still on to the harbour and climbing aboard a yacht.|$|E

25|$|Janet and Van Korrell {{purchased}} {{the house when}} the Cannons left in 1992. Janet had been fascinated with the Frank Lloyd Wright designed house for some time, and they quickly tore off the enclosed staircase that the Suttons had added 50 years earlier <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the balcony on the back. Determined to restore it as fully as possible, in 1999 they hired John G. Thorpe to oversee the work. Thorpe, a Wright expert, restoration architect, {{and one of the}} founders of the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust in Oak Park, Illinois, worked with the original plans and old photos on a complete restoration inside and out, including the Wright-designed cupboards, the ground-level entry, and the daring cantilevered veranda roof. As part of this work, the Korrells elected to build an addition in the previously open northwest corner, balancing the original northeast corner bedroom but moving away from Wright's cruciform design. This addition incorporates a modern laundry and a second stairway to the basement.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{replacement}} of interim CEO Jay Salmen by Stan Gadek, former CFO of AirTran Airways, Sun Country was nearly finished by the major recession of 2008 and the revelation of financial fraud on a massive scale. The airline furloughed 45 of its 156 pilots and scaled back its summer schedule due to rising fuel costs. Sun Country indicated it had hoped <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $50 million in loans or other financial help {{from the state of}} Minnesota and the airports commission. In September 2008 the carrier reduced, and in some cases eliminated, flights to San Francisco and Los Angeles. It also began charging $12 for the first checked bag, following most major U.S. carriers. At the end of September 2008, Gadek called for a 50% pay-deferral to all remaining employees. Also on the 28th, Tom Petters resigned after an FBI probe discovered that the airline had suffered financial fraud on a massive scale. Following this, the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, for the second time, on October 6, 2008, in order to separate itself from the other Petters companies that were being taken over by a court appointee. On Christmas Eve, full pay was restored to all employees. Employees were also promised back-pay with interest.|$|E
25|$|In the 2013 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, Johnson won {{his record}} fourth All-Star race after a fast pit stop {{allowed him to}} start the final 10-lap sprint in second, and later managed to pass Kasey Kahne for the victory. One week later, Johnson {{finished}} 22nd after spinning sideways late in the race. At Dover, Johnson led 143 laps, but finished 17th when he jumped Juan Pablo Montoya on the last restart causing NASCAR to issue him a penalty. He was able to redeem himself for this mistake the following week at Pocono by earning the pole position, leading the most laps, and winning his third race of the season, which increased his point lead to 51 points over Edwards. This also snapped a nine-year winless streak for Johnson at Pocono since sweeping both of the track's 2004 NASCAR Cup Series races. At the Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan, Johnson closed in on Greg Biffle for the lead with less than ten laps left, but suffered a flat tire with less than five laps to go. Johnson would finish the race in 28th, his worst finish of the season to that point. Johnson then finished ninth at Sonoma. At Kentucky, Johnson started third. He had the dominant car of the race, leading 182 of 267 laps. However, on a restart on lap 246, Johnson was slow <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speed and was subsequently touched and spun by Joey Logano, costing Johnson {{a shot at the}} win and giving the race to Matt Kenseth. Johnson was able to charge through the field after the caution and restart to salvage a ninth-place finish.|$|E

25|$|On 7 May Rhys-Davids {{took part}} in a {{disastrous}} sortie. The day was cloudy with thick layers of cumulus between 2,000 and 10,000 feet. Rhys-Davids's flight kept just below the cloud to avoid attack, and headed towards Cambrai. Eleven Royal Aircraft Factory SE5s of 56 Squadron ran into the experienced German airmen of Jasta 11 of the Flying Circus. One of the Squadron 56 flight commanders, famous ace Albert Ball (44 victories), was killed when he likely flew into the ground after becoming disorientated in low-lying cloud. Three other British pilots were shot down, including Rhys-Davids. He came under attack from an Albatros D.V which was painted red, with a green band behind the cockpit. The pilot was Kurt Wolff, a very experienced pilot and ace with 20 victories. Rhys-Davids was unaware he was under attack until he saw Wolff's tracers pass his aircraft. He evaded Wolff's initial attack and a duel for position followed. Rhys-Davids's guns jammed but he managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Wolff's height and took evasive action. But he had taken hits to the wing, undercarriage and engine. He kept cool and continued turning, denying the German an easy shot. As Rhys-Davids was deciding just how best to escape his hazardous position, Wolff abandoned the fight and headed for Douai. Rhys-Davids headed for British lines, his engine streaming water; west of Arras his engine finally seized up. He attempted to glide to Belle Vue but had insufficient height and force-landed near La Herliere. The reason for Wolff's decision to break off combat is unknown. He may have run out of ammunition or perhaps was low on fuel.|$|E
500|$|After {{stopping}} about [...] {{from the}} summit, Derrick's platoon {{continued to hold}} their position through the night. Elsewhere, the 2/24th Battalion {{reported that they were}} just below the crest of the 2,200 feature, the last Japanese defensive position to the north, and that they would capture it the following morning, before proceeding on to their secondary objective at Palanko. Believing that the key to taking Sattelberg lay in having the 2/24th in a position to support the 2/48th's final attack, Whitehead pressured for the tanks <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 2/24th as soon as possible.|$|E
500|$|During Bure's {{rehabilitation}} period, {{following his}} first major knee injury in 1995, Canucks' conditioning coach Peter Twist noticed that his skating style was distinct in comparison to typical North American players. He explained: [...] "Most players skate on their inside edge and push off at a 45-degree angle, but Bure starts on his outer edge and rolls over to his inside edge and pushes back straighter on his stride... he gets more power and force in his stride <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> top speed quicker." [...] his skating was also complemented by his ability to deke out defenders and goaltenders at top speeds, making him capable of routinely starting end-to-end rushes. However, several knee injuries, and the resulting reconstructive surgeries, compromised the speed that defined Bure's game, ultimately leading to his retirement.|$|E

500|$|In 1968–69, Orr {{skipped the}} {{pre-season}} {{to rest the}} knee but was in uniform for the season start. He required an ice pack on the knee after every game and missed nine games after he caught a skate in {{a crack in the}} ice, twisting his knee. He returned to the lineup and finished the season playing through the pain, sometimes struggling <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speed and relying on teammates instead of making the plays himself. In other games, Orr was outstanding, scoring his first career NHL hat trick on December 14 against Chicago, adding two assists for a five-point night. He scored 21 goals on the season, breaking the goal scoring record for a defenceman, and totalled 64 points to set a new point scoring record for one season for a defenceman. [...] He again won the Norris Trophy while nabbing a First-Team All-Star selection and finishing third in the Hart Trophy balloting.|$|E
500|$|English {{also makes}} {{frequent}} use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that {{are made up of}} a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> <b>to</b> ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment). In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including , do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term [...] "phrasal verb". Instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he {{woke up in the morning}} and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.|$|E
