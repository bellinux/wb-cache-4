5|$|By {{the end of}} August Posen and {{the rest}} of the High Seas Fleet had {{returned}} to their anchorages in the North Sea.

5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for <b>the</b> <b>auxiliary</b> forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{probably}} {{wanted a}} new {{war against the}} Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. Trajan continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to <b>the</b> <b>auxiliary</b> forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars. Eventually the Romans achieved a decisive victory against Decebalus in 106. Again, the Roman army sustained heavy losses, but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and, importantly, annexed the Dacian gold and silver mines.|$|E

5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of <b>the</b> <b>auxiliary</b> verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Auxiliaries</b> in Cork {{were based}} {{in the town of}} Macroom, and in November 1920 they carried out a number of raids on the villages in the {{surrounding}} area, including Dunmanway, Coppeen and Castletownkenneigh, to intimidate the local population away from supporting the IRA. They shot dead one civilian James Lehane (Séamus Ó Liatháin) at Ballymakeera on 17 October 1920. In his memoir, Guerilla Days in Ireland, Tom Barry noted that before Kilmichael the IRA hardly fired a shot at <b>the</b> <b>Auxiliaries,</b> which [...] "had a very serious effect on the morale of the whole people {{as well as on the}} IRA". Barry's assessment was that the West Cork IRA needed a successful action against <b>the</b> <b>Auxiliaries</b> in order to be effective.|$|R
