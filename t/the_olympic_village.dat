5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take {{the sting out of}} his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich was one of his {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin {{in the eyes of the}} world. They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village,</b> where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Summer Paralympics used many of {{the same}} venues as the 2012 Summer Olympics, along with two new {{locations}} such as Eton Manor for wheelchair tennis and Brands Hatch for road cycling. London's purpose-built Olympic venues and facilities, including <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> itself, were designed to be accessible as possible so they could easily accommodate the Paralympics. Some venues also contained additional accessible seating areas during the Paralympics.|$|E
5|$|From 241 {{participants}} representing 14 {{nations in}} 1896, the Games {{have grown to}} about 10,500 competitors from 204 nations at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, Sochi hosted 2,873 athletes from 88 nations competing in 98 events during the 2014 Winter Olympics. During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village.</b> This village {{is intended to be}} a self-contained home for all the Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{evaluation}} found the bid technically robust, using existing venues, good hosting {{experience and a}} large number of guaranteed hotel rooms within Harbin as principal strengths. However, a three village concept made for a rather dispersed project and the culture and education program was weak. With a budget of US$43 million, events at Mao'ershan National Nature Reserve were cancelled to reduce <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Villages</b> to two, but still the distance between Harbin and Yabuli is 150km. A planned bobsleigh/sled site raised concerns, as did a reluctance to embrace a digital platform for the culture aspect. [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Villages</b> were strong with a 2:1 bath/bed ratio.|$|R

5|$|Trinidad and Tobago's athletes {{arrived in}} Beijing's Olympic Village early in August. The {{athletic}} contingent of Trinidad and Tobago's team arrived in Beijing from Finland on August 5, 2008, but spent only one night {{before leaving for}} a training camp in nearby South Korea. The athletics team returned on August 11. Sharpshooter Roger Daniel, along with the entirety of Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee's administrative and medical staff, had arrived in <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> by August 3, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Montenegro coach Sava Kovačević, {{whose team}} {{was knocked out}} by Bolivia in the semifinals, said that Montenegro would ask {{football}} governing body FIFA {{to look into the}} matter. However, FIFA announced they would not be doing so as complaints concerning the eligibility of players should have been submitted in writing to FIFA's headquarters in Singapore at the Youth Olympic Games no later than five days before the first match, that is, by 8 August. FIFA also said that its staff had met all footballers individually at <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> and had checked their passports against their dates of birth provided by their respective National Olympic Committees.|$|E
5|$|Saint Kitts and Nevis sent seven {{athletes to}} the 2012 Summer Olympics. One athlete, the {{sprinter}} Tameka Williams, admitted prior to {{competing in the}} London Games that she took Blast Off Red, which is typically used to increase the performance of horses and greyhounds. It was announced on July 29 {{that she would not}} compete. Kim Collins, who has competed in every Olympics that Saint Kitts and Nevis has participated in, was not allowed to compete by his Olympic committee. Collins was required to stay in <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>village,</b> but instead stayed with his wife (who was also his coach), closer to the track. The committee said he had violated team rules, and did not allow him to compete.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> {{for housing}} athletes {{during the games}} {{would have been a}} $1.1-billion series of newly {{constructed}} lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after the games. The village was to be located immediately south of McCormick Place, which was expected to host 11 event venues, on a current truck parking lot between South Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the Near South Side and Douglas community areas. At the time, the parking lot was being used to stage events at McCormick Place. The village was slated to have pedways over Lake Shore Drive. This location was meant to enable 88% of the Olympic athletes to be within 15 minutes of their competition venue.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 U.S. Championships, the {{de facto}} Olympic qualifier, Lysacek was third after the short program, but pulled up to win the free skate, {{finishing}} second overall. He {{was named to the}} 2006 Winter Olympic team along with Johnny Weir and Matthew Savoie. At the Olympics, following a 10th-place finish in the short program, Lysacek became sick with the stomach flu. Unable to practice, he stayed in bed at <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>village,</b> receiving fluids from IVs. After considering withdrawing, he decided to skate the next day and went on to skate a career-best free skate. He finished his free skate with eight triple jumps and was ranked third of the night. He finished fourth overall, seven points below the bronze. He commentated on his free-skating program on Olympic Ice the next day with Scott Hamilton and Mary Carillo.|$|E
5|$|From 1932 to 1992, Birkebeinerrittet, a mass ski {{marathon}} between Rena and Lillehammer, {{has used}} Stampesletta as a start or goal area, depending on if the race ran from Lillehammer to Rena {{or in the}} opposite direction. Since 1992, the goal area was moved to Birkebeineren Ski Stadium. Birkebeinerrittet, a cycle version of the ski marathon, has its goal area at Stampesletta. The half-marathon terrain race Birkebeinerløpet uses Stampesletta as its start and goal area. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Stampesletta was used for medal ceremonies for all non-skating events. The backdrops for the podium was built using ice and snow, with the podium itself being made from ice from the glacier Jostedalsbreen. This contrasted with the surrounding pine elements. Attendance was free, and between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the medal ceremonies. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. The Stampesletta area {{will be used for}} the opening and closing ceremonies with a spectator capacity of 6,000 to 8,000; existing and new buildings nearby will be used for <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Prime Minister Ian Smith {{declared}} a unilateral independence {{that allowed the}} country's white minority to dominate the government. Great Britain pressured the Mexican state to deny Rhodesia {{an invitation to the}} 1968 Summer Olympics and supported a proposed African boycott of the Games that ultimately prevented Rhodesia from taking part. The nation was positioned to compete at the Olympics in 1972 and made it to <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> before a last-minute International Olympic Committee (IOC) decision barred its athletes from participating. The National Olympic Committee was expelled permanently in 1975 and Rhodesia never again participated under that banner. Rhodesia never took part in the Winter Olympic Games and no Rhodesian competitor ever won an Olympic medal, although it was able to continue competing at the Paralympics through 1972 and reached the podium on multiple occasions.|$|E
5|$|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines {{debuted in}} the Olympic Games at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and, as of 2008, {{has participated in}} every edition since. The Beijing Games marked the {{smallest}} Vincentian delegation in the country's history, the size having declined over the years from its largest delegation of eight participants at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. At {{the conclusion of the}} 2008 Summer Olympics, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' team has yet to medal in an event. The delegation arrived in Beijing on 28 July 2008, and stayed in <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> for the duration of their time in China. The Vincentians arrived early, three days after the Village itself opened, to make adjusting to the new environment easier. The delegation was accompanied by coach Gideon Labban; team manager Leroy Llewellyn; and chaperone Jacintha Ballantyne. Kineke Alexander was the flagbearer at the opening ceremony, leading Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as the 64th nation in line.|$|E
5|$|The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 {{estimates}} the outturn {{cost of the}} Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at USD 6.8 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 2% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee {{for the purpose of}} staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>village,</b> international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Beijing Olympics' cost of USD 6.8 billion compares with costs of USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and USD 15 billion for London 2012. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is USD 5.2 billion.|$|E

Preckwinkle expressed her reservations about the initial plan, and was involved in plan revisions. Since the planned construction was almost entirely in her ward, she expressed concern that her constituents were not offered a chance to voice their concerns with the plan. She was an early advocate of moving {{what would have been}} <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>Village</b> from the McCormick Place truck yard to the Michael Reese Hospital site. On March 14, 2007, Preckwinkle joined four other South Side aldermen in voting against a $500 million public-funded guarantee to back up Chicago's Olympics bid. On September 9, 2009, Preckwinkle voted to authorize Mayor Richard Daley to sign the International Olympic Committee's host city contract that included financial guarantees putting full responsibility for the Olympics and its proposed $4.8 billion operating budget on taxpayers.|$|E
