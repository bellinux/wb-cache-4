5|$|Ya Kun Kaya Toast {{have over}} forty Singaporean outlets, {{about half of}} which are franchised, and over thirty {{overseas}} outlets, all franchised, across seven countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines and United Arab Emirates); they plan to expand to Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Thailand in future. The stores have a retro ambience, with wooden tables and stools, Chinese calligraphy of the company name, posters about their history, traditional methods of preparing food and customer service reflecting Chinese family values. Unlike their main competitors, they have a limited menu that revolves around their core product, kaya <b>toast,</b> <b>with</b> cheese, peanut butter and ice cream as alternative spreads for their thin, brown, crispy bread. To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sell French toast and Toastwiches (their Asian alternative to sandwiches); set meals combine any type of <b>toast</b> <b>with</b> soft-boiled eggs and a beverage, usually coffee or teh tarik.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Lai Ah Koon (黎亚坤) {{emigrated from}} Hainan to Singapore, {{where he worked}} as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own {{business}} with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and toast at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run the stall alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the <b>toast</b> <b>with</b> her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin), the stall gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya toast and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage the stall.|$|E

500|$|Variations on the {{preparation}} and {{presentation of the}} angels on horseback vary considerably. In Feng Shui Food, it is prepared by rolling a shucked oyster in bacon and skewering it with a cocktail stick, fried and served with a squeeze of lime. Joanna Pruess's book Seduced by Bacon includes a recipe for [...] "Angels and Devils", with the suggestion that [...] "a little hot red pepper sauce can transform them from heavenly to hellishly hot tasting, or somewhere inbetween." [...] Myles Bader, author of The Wizard of Food's Encyclopedia of Kitchen & Cooking Secrets, suggests serving angels on horseback on <b>toast</b> <b>with</b> a lemon wedge or hollandaise sauce. An Italian variant replaces bacon with prosciutto.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a footage of Usher walking offstage during a show part of his OMG Tour (2010—11), held at the O2 Arena, Berlin in January 2011. Subsequently, {{announcer}} explains, [...] "He tried because he loves Berlin and {{he really wanted to}} give you guys a show, but he just couldn’t do it. Thanks for understanding." [...] Usher then speaks with a remorse, [...] "I felt like a failure, hopeless, paralyzed, numb." [...] As the song starts Usher is seen chanting the lyrics while several sequence shots of him with his son and a sick woman in hospital are shown. The scenes are intercuted by Usher performing in a room full with bright white lights. Several other short scenes of Usher taking care of the sick woman, his son having a meal and Usher throwing money at strippers are shown. Several natural environments are projected onto a wall the singer stands in front off. As the song progresses, he enters in a glass box and starts dancing during the chorus.

The singer is shown holding man's hand while he dies in a hospital. Then, he is seen unable to perform and cries in front of the microphone. The video ends with Usher managing to break the glass box.|$|E

2500|$|Mario Ferrandi, {{a militant}} of Prima Linea, nicknamed [...] "Coniglio" [...] (Rabbit), later {{said that when}} {{the news of the}} {{kidnapping}} and the killing of the bodyguards spread during a workers' demonstration {{there was a moment of}} amazement, followed by a moment of euphoria and anxiety because there was a feeling that something would happen so big that things would not be quite the same.

2500|$|After {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor and the {{declaration}} of war by the United States, Kennard is reputed to have proposed a <b>toast</b> <b>with</b> the words [...] "You're all in it now, Yanks!"

2500|$|At midday on 11 July, NATO planes {{arrived from}} Italy and struck a Bosnian Serb tank, before {{being forced to}} cease {{operations}} after General Mladić threatened to [...] "destroy" [...] both the Dutch soldiers and the Bosniak population of Srebrenica unless airstrikes were called off. That afternoon, Mladić, accompanied by General Živanović (then Commander of the Drina Corps), General Krstić (then Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps) and other Bosnian Serb officers, took a triumphant walk through the deserted streets {{of the town of}} Srebrenica. The moment was captured on film by Serbian journalist Zoran Petrović. Mladić posed for television cameras, before declaring that Srebrenica had been [...] "returned forever to the Serbs." [...] Later, Thom Karremans, the commander of the Dutch troops in the town, drank a <b>toast</b> <b>with</b> Mladić which was filmed for Serb television. Off-camera, however, Mladić warned Karremans that the UN compound in Potočari, where thousands of Bosniak refugees had gathered, would be shelled by the VRS if NATO planes reappeared.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{complaint}} {{is that the}} medicines must be taken {{on an empty stomach}} to facilitate absorption. [...] This can be difficult for patients to follow (for example, shift workers who take their meals at irregular times) and may mean the patient waking up an hour earlier than usual everyday just to take medication. [...] The rules are actually less stringent than many physicians and pharmacists realise: the issue is that the absorption of RMP is reduced if taken with fat, but is unaffected by carbohydrate, protein, or antacids. [...] So the patient can in fact have his or her medication with food as long as the meal does not contain fat or oils (e.g., a cup of black coffee or <b>toast</b> <b>with</b> jam and no butter). Taking the medicines with food also helps ease the nausea that many patients feel when taking the medicines on an empty stomach. [...] The effect of food on the absorption of INH is not clear: two studies have shown reduced absorption with food but one study showed no difference. There is a small effect of food on the absorption of PZA and of EMB that is probably not clinically important.|$|E

It is George II's birthday (30 October) (indicated by the flag flying on the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in the background) and {{the inhabitants of the}} scene are no doubt toasting his health. Under the sign of the Barley Mow, a blacksmith or cooper sits with a foaming tankard {{in one hand and a}} leg of beef in the other. Together with a butcher—his steel hangs at his side—they laugh with the pavior (sometimes identified as a drayman) as he courts a housemaid (the key she holds is a symbol of domesticity). Ronald Paulson suggests a parallel between the trinity of signs of ill-omen in Gin Lane, the pawnbroker, distiller, and undertaker, and the trinity of English [...] "worthies" [...] here, the blacksmith, pavior, and butcher. Close by a pair of fish-sellers rest with a pint and a porter sets down his load to refresh himself. In the background, two men carrying a sedan chair pause for drink, while the passenger remains wedged inside, her large hoop skirt pinning her in place.
