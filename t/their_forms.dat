5|$|The {{physical}} {{appearance of the}} Sirens is not described in the Odyssey, and the traditional Greek representation of them was as bird-lion or bird-human chimeras.

They are grown for the beauty of <b>their</b> <b>forms,</b> their foliage, flowers, fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to year.|$|E

5|$|Carre's is a state-run {{selective}} grammar school. It {{converted to}} an Academy and reopened on 1 August 2011; it {{is governed by}} Carre's Grammar School Academy Trust and converted without sponsorship. As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 pupils aged 11–18. The school admits boys on a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 girls on roll as of 2015. The majority of pupils come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English as an additional language. The number of pupils supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of students with learning disabilities. Pupils are allocated into houses based on <b>their</b> <b>forms.</b> The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E

25|$|A {{particular}} kind of bhoot, that of a woman that died during pregnancy or childbirth, {{is known as a}} chudail (dakini in Nepal and eastern India).

Chudails often try to lure young men at road crossings and fields or similar places. If a man is enamored of a chudail, it is believed that she will cause his death.

25|$|Inspired by {{the monumental}} stone {{sculpture}} of Egypt and Mesopotamia, during the Archaic period the Greeks began again to carve in stone.

After about 575 BC, figures, such as these, both male and female, wore the so-called archaic smile. This expression, which has no specific appropriateness to the person or situation depicted, {{may have been a}} device to give the figures a distinctive human characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Odes 1–3 {{were the}} next focus for his artistic creativity. He adapted <b>their</b> <b>forms</b> and themes from Greek lyric {{poetry of the}} seventh and sixth centuries BC. The {{fragmented}} nature of the Greek world had enabled his literary heroes to express themselves freely and his semi-retirement from the Treasury in Rome to his own estate in the Sabine hills perhaps empowered him to some extent also yet even when his lyrics touched on public affairs they reinforced the importance of private life. Nevertheless, {{his work in the}} period 30–27 BC began to show his closeness to the regime and his sensitivity to its developing ideology. In Odes 1.2, for example, he eulogized Octavian in hyperboles that echo Hellenistic court poetry. The name Augustus, which Octavian assumed in January 27 BC, is first attested in Odes 3.3 and 3.5. In the period 27–24 BC, political allusions in the Odes concentrated on foreign wars in Britain (1.35), Arabia (1.29) Spain (3.8) and Parthia (2.2). He greeted Augustus on his return to Rome in 24 BC as a beloved ruler upon whose good health he depended for his own happiness (3.14).|$|E
