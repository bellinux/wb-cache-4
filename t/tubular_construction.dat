25|$|The Whitley {{holds the}} {{distinction}} of having been the first aircraft to serve with the RAF to utilise a semi-monocoque fuselage, which was built using a slab-sided structure to ease production. This replaced the traditional <b>tubular</b> <b>construction</b> method previously employed by Armstrong Whitworth, instead constructing the airframe from light-alloy rolled sections, pressings, and corrugated sheets. According to aviation author Philip Moyes, the decision to adopt the semi-monocoque fuselage design was a significant step forwards, {{and the integrity of}} which was well-proven during subsequent RAF service, having survived multiple instances of severe damage being sustained.|$|E

Other changes included the use of roller bearings for the crankshaft, forged (rather than cast) rear suspension components, and the chassis was designed to run with hydraulic dampers from the outset.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The use of {{threaded}} connection {{is a valuable}} alternative to conventional welding in <b>tubular</b> <b>constructions,</b> e. g. pipelines, drill pipes and deep water risers. Those applications are normally exposed to environmental hazards – wave induced vibrations, temperature changes, etc. – as well as subjected to severe service conditions. A classical way to determine fatigue strength in many engineering situations is to calibrate material models by means of ad hoc designed experiments. Unfortunately, {{it is very difficult}} in this case even under laboratory conditions due to complicated stress and strain states in the contacting tapered helical thread surfaces of the connection. Therefore, a classical four-point bending fatigue test setup has been built with a real pipe specimen of 3. 75 meter long, consisting of two standard API pipes connected by a threaded coupling, under unsymmetric (non-zero average) load control cycles. A complete vibration study has been carried out based on input-output modal tests for the entire period of the fatigue experiment. Input excitation is due to hammer impact and responses are recorded by accelerometers and by reusable dynamic strain gauges. The measured modal strains from the dynamic strain gauges allow for direct calculation of the modal curvatures, rather than deriving approximately from acceleration information. By comparing the measured modal parameters with those of a numerical model of the same structure in undamaged condition, damage detection, localization in the coupling and quantification are possible.
