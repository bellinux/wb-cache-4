Drop gearing had appeared many times before on earlier tractors, but never yet for this new reason—to minimize the amount of rubber needed for the tires.|$|R

5000|$|The Nebraska <b>tractor</b> <b>testing</b> law had {{its roots}} from 1919 when Wilmot Crozier, a farmer and {{legislator}} from Osceola in Polk County, bought a Ford 8-16 tractor. Not made by Henry Ford Co., the Ford 8-16 didn't {{live up to its}} advertised claims. The advertisements claimed it could pull three plows at once. Mr. Crozier could only get it to pull one. He took it back to the dealership and demanded they take it back, but they told him, [...] "You own it, you keep it". They did eventually give him a Rumely H tractor The advertisements claimed it could pull three plows at once; Crozier got it to pull five. Wilmot Crozier and State Senator Charles Warner decided to ensure that all farmers would get a fair deal when buying any model of tractor sold in Nebraska. Under their leadership, the Nebraska Tractor Test Law was passed in 1919, House Roll 85. At the same time, the legislature established a facility for <b>tractor</b> <b>testing</b> on the east campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to ensure that tractor manufacturers met their advertised claims of the tractors performance.The Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory is known around the world as the first test lab in the world. And it is the leader in <b>tractor</b> <b>testing</b> and is still the only one {{of its kind in the}} world. The Lester F. Larsen Tractor Test and Power Museum is housed in the original Nebraska Tractor Test facility on the East Campus of the University of Nebraska Lincoln. It is located at 35th and Fair Streets. A newer section was built on in 1948. The building was declared a historical landmark by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers in 1980 and dedicated as a museum in 1998. Friends of the Museum were instrumental in early renovation efforts and continue to raise funds for the museum. The museum in now part of the University of Nebraska State Museum system. The Waterloo Boy tractor was the first to successfully complete the testing process in 1920. Only because of the harsh winter of 1919, they didn't get the testing finished in time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis for the bachelors degree {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and subsequent evaluation of the fawn mortality during haymaking in the hunting district HS Kalec, county Plzeň-sever (Pilsen-North), located {{in the western part}} of the Czech Republic. The first part of this thesis describes Roe Deer (Capreolus Capreolus), its population in this territory, biology, ethology and its management. The second part describes the project as such involving three model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> that were selected and marked out in the hunting district HS Kalec; before the haymaking time from June 15 to June 24, 2015, adequate protection measures were undertaken in these areas. Locality of the first model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 1 was attended (walked) by gamekeepers with dogs. Locality of the second model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 2 was treated with the game scent repeller and also equipped with acoustic disturber. The third model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 3 was only monitored. These model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> were re-visited after hay crop and the result is that in the vicinity of the model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 3 two fawns were cut and killed. In both other model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> no cut fawns were found. After hay crop and subsequent determining the actual number of cut fawns, these <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> were compared mutually and the results will be stated in this thesis for the bachelors degree. The essential aspect was to evaluate the fawns mortality in the specific hunting district based on the obtained facts. Relation to the mitigation measures set in place was examined. This work resulted in saving three fawns. Outcomes of this thesis have provided rather interesting findings that can be further exploited in the gamekeeping management. Particularly in relation to the roe deer management in the gamekeeping practice. Keywords/tags: roe deer, fawns, killing, hunting district (HS Kalec, Žihle...|$|R

30|$|The {{conception}} of a GMP monitoring program - selection of <b>test</b> <b>areas,</b> appropriate indicators, methods, farmers' clarification, etc. - should start far earlier than the GMP cropping. Importantly, the initial sampling design has to consider that farmers may deny work on their private properties. A total of 1, 360 involved farmers were informed about the project BINATS. Sixty-nine of these denied work on their fields. Twenty-seven of the 100 pre-selected <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> were affected by this prohibition. Twenty-one of these <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> could be retained by shifting survey circles appropriately [48]. Six <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> had to be shifted as a whole along the Austrian forest inventory raster. However, sizes of Austrian farms are small (average farm size, 18.9 ha) [59] as compared to other EU countries, and problems with denied access may be more serious with larger farm sizes.|$|R
40|$|Optimal scale {{selection}} {{is the key}} step of the slope segmentation. Taking three geomorphological units {{in different parts of}} the loess as <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> and 5 m-resolution DEMs as original test date, this paper employed the changed ROC-LV (Lucian, 2010) in judging the optimal scales in the slope segmentation process. The experiment results showed that this method is effective in determining the optimal scale in the slope segmentation. The results also showed that the slope segmentation of the different geomorphological units require different optimal scales because the landform complexity is varied. The three <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require the same scale which could distinguish the small gully because all the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> have many gullies of the same size, however, when come to distinguish the basins, since the complexity of the three areas is different, the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require different scales...|$|R
