One major issue for the Nunavut tourism industry is the territory's remote nature. This imposes high <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> on visitors to Nunavut, and drives tourism numbers down. In addition, Nunavut's position north of the Arctic Circle reduces the opportunity for spring activities, and results in a highly seasonally based tourism market. This limits opportunities for year-round employment in the territory.

40|$|Advances {{in tourism}} {{economics}} have {{enabled us to}} collect massive amounts of travel tour data. If properly analyzed, this data can {{be a source of}} rich intelligence for providing real-time decision making and for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the tourist’s choice is directly affected by the <b>travel</b> <b>cost,</b> which includes the financial cost and the time. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation. Along this line, we develop two cost-aware latent factor models to recommend travel packages by considering both the <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> and the tourist’s interests. Specifically, we first design a cPMF model, which models the tourist’s cost with a 2 -dimensional vector. Also, in this cPMF model, the tourist’s interests and the <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> are learnt by exploring travel tour data. Furthermore, in order to model the uncertainty in the <b>travel</b> <b>cost,</b> we further intro-duce a Gaussian prior into the cPMF model and develop the GcPMF model, where the Gaussian prior is used to express the uncertainty of the <b>travel</b> <b>cost.</b> Finally, experiments on real-world travel tour data show that the cost-aware recom-mendation models outperform state-of-the-art latent factor models with a significant margin. Also, the GcPMF model with the Gaussian prior can better capture the impact of the uncertainty of the <b>travel</b> <b>cost,</b> and thus performs better than the cPMF model...|$|R

Different forms of the <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> method are used to estimate separate consumer surpluses associated with two key subgroups of recreational anglers: frequent and occasional anglers. A contingent valuation study is used to estimate the marginal values associated with a potential improvement in fishing experience.

5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird is {{a species that}} is found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more {{northern mockingbird}}s living in urban habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species. Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> {{may account for the}} higher mortality rate in rural habitats. Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are more predictable than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas. The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.|$|E
