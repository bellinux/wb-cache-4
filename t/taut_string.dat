25|$|The {{concept of}} the {{telephone}} {{dates back to the}} string telephone or lover's telephone that has been known for centuries, comprising two diaphragms connected by a <b>taut</b> <b>string</b> or wire. Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items. The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the air, as in the ear, and a string or wire can transmit such collected voice sounds for reproduction at a distance. One precursor {{to the development of the}} electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the University of Göttingen, in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices. Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.|$|E

[...] Constraint forces ensure the velocity {{in the direction of the}} constraint is zero, which means the constraint forces do not perform work on the system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{descriptor}} [...] "harmonic" [...] in {{the name}} harmonic function originates from a point on a <b>taut</b> <b>string</b> which is undergoing harmonic motion. This solution to the differential equation {{for this type of}} motion can be written in terms of sines and cosines, functions which are thus referred to as harmonics. Fourier analysis involves expanding periodic functions on the unit circle in terms of a series of these harmonics. Considering higher dimensional analogues of the harmonics on the unit n-sphere, one arrives at the spherical harmonics. These functions satisfy Laplace's equation and over time [...] "harmonic" [...] was used to refer to all functions satisfying Laplace's equation.|$|E

In this paper we suggest a general {{approach}} based on the K-functional of real interpolation that provides a unifying framework of existing theories and extend the range of applications of <b>taut</b> <b>strings.</b> More exactly, we introduce the notion of invariant K-minimal sets, explain their connection to <b>taut</b> <b>strings</b> and characterize all bounded, closed and convex sets in R-n that are invariant K-minimal with respect to the couple (l(1), l(infinity)).

50|$|Resonance example: A {{good example}} of morphodynamic work is the induced {{resonance}} that can be observed by singing or playing a flute next to a string instrument like a harp or guitar. The vibrating air emitted from the flute will interact with the <b>taut</b> <b>strings.</b> If any of the strings are tuned to a resonant frequency that matches the note being played, they too will begin to vibrate and emit sound.|$|R
2500|$|Polarization (also polarisation) is a {{property}} applying to transverse waves that specifies the geometrical {{orientation of the}} oscillations. [...] In a transverse wave, {{the direction of the}} oscillation is transverse to the direction of motion of the wave, so the oscillations can have different directions perpendicular to the wave direction. [...] A simple example of a polarized transverse wave is vibrations traveling along a <b>taut</b> <b>string</b> (see image); for example, in a musical instrument like a guitar string. Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string. [...] In contrast, in longitudinal waves, such as sound waves in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization. [...] Transverse waves that exhibit polarization include electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves, gravitational waves, and transverse sound waves (shear waves) in solids. [...] In some types of transverse waves, the wave displacement is limited to a single direction, so these also do not exhibit polarization; for example, in surface waves in liquids (gravity waves), the wave displacement of the particles is always in a vertical plane.|$|E

We provide a link between (i) and (ii) that builds on the equivalence between TV-L 2 regularization and <b>taut</b> <b>strings</b> and leads to a novel and efficient denoising algorithm that is contrast preserving and operates in O(nlogn) time, where n is the size of the input...|$|R

The nonlinear post-critical behavior of single <b>taut</b> <b>strings</b> in 1 : 1 primary internal resonance is studied through the multiple scale perturbation method.

This paper is concerned with families of second-order systems which have one spectrum in common. The analysis is based on the reduction of the governing equation to the standard Sturm-Liouville form, the use of the Darboux lemma, and the research of Trubowitz, Poschel, Deift and others. In particular the paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for isospectral flow from one rod to another rod with the same end conditions, using double Darboux transformation...|$|R

The wave system can be decomposed into two modes: an in-phase mode (+) that is transparent to the coupling springs, and an out-of-phase mode (-) that engages the coupling springs and can resonate at a particular location depending on the excitation frequency. The system exhibits linear mode conversion whereby an incoming (+) wave is reflected back from the resonance location both as a propagating (+) wave and an evanescent (-) wave, while both types emerge as propagating forward through the resonance location. We match a local transition layer expansion to the WKB expansion to obtain estimates of the reflection and transmission coefficients. The reflected waves may be an analog for stimulated emissions from the ear...|$|R

In this study, two new two-way state-®ow graph models for describing {{the dynamics of the}} wave propagation in each segment of the string with free and xed ends are developed. According to the developed models, the response of the wave in the entire string is derived by a topology method.
