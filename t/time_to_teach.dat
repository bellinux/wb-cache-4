25|$|By 2015, {{there has}} been a major {{improvement}} of Lakota language proficiency levels among students of reservation schools. This was due to teacher training available through the Lakota Summer Institute and to the adoption of consistent phonemic orthography introduced in the New Lakota Dictionary (2008) and the Lakota Grammar Handbook (2016). This orthography and the effective teaching methods enabled teachers and students for the first <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> and learn correct pronunciation.

25|$|Often {{times after}} {{internment}} families {{could not be}} reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children had no one with whom to speak Japanese outside the home {{and as a result}} they rarely learned the language fluently. The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost touch with their culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> their children about traditional Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps had forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.|$|E

500|$|As AGF commander, McNair {{worked to}} solve the problem of how to {{integrate}} replacement soldiers into units that had sustained casualties. [...] Rather than adopt the model of replacing units that had sustained high casualties with new, full strength units, Marshall and McNair cited the need to allocate space on transport ships to equipment and supplies as the reason to provide individual replacement soldiers to units while the units remained in combat. [...] In practice, the individual replacement system caused difficulties for both the replacement soldiers and the units they joined, especially during later stages of the war. [...] New soldiers could have difficulty being accepted by the veterans of their units, since they were replacing buddies who had been killed or wounded, and had not shared the veterans' combat experiences. In addition, because new soldiers joined units that were already in the fight, there was often no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> them the tactics and techniques that increased their chances of surviving on the battlefield.|$|E

500|$|Jeremiah Horrocks (1618– 3January 1641) {{was born}} in Lower Lodge, Toxteth Park, now part of Liverpool; his father, James was a watchmaker, and his mother Mary (née Aspinwall) was from a notable Toxteth Park family. Several members of the Aspinwall family were also in the watchmaking trade, and {{it is said that}} a watchmaker uncle first {{interested}} Jeremiah in astronomy. Jeremiah joined Emmanuel College on 11 May 1632 and matriculated {{as a member of the}} University of Cambridge on 5 July 1632 as a sizar, which meant he did not have the means to fully support himself and was given specific duties to compensate for a reduction in fees. [...] At Cambridge, he would have studied the arts, classical languages, a little geometry, and some traditional astronomy, but not the latest work of Galileo, Tycho Brahe and Kepler. He used his spare <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> himself the more demanding mathematical astronomy and familiarise himself with the latest thinking. Horrocks read most of the astronomical treatises of his day, found the weaknesses in them, and was suggesting new lines of research by the age of 17. In 1635, he left Cambridge without formally graduating, presumably owing to the cost of graduation.|$|E
500|$|Lajoie's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Naps' play worsened. [...] "You can't win {{in the major leagues}} unless you have players who know the game. We don't have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> and train youngsters up here. Our job is to win pennants, not run schools", he said. Franklin Lewis, sports writer and author, wrote [...] "Lajoie, in spite of his {{marvelous}} fielding and tremendous batting, was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager." [...] Lajoie recommended to Somers on August 17, 1909, he find the team a new manager, although he wanted to remain on the club as a player. Somers responded to Lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when Lajoie came back days later and announced the same decision, Somers acted quickly to find a replacement. Lajoie later described the decision to take on the added duties as a player-manager as the biggest mistake of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play. The highest-paid player in the league, he also offered a $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) reduction in salary. Somers promoted Naps coach Deacon [...] "Jim" [...] McGuire to manager. The team finished 7182 while Lajoie's [...]324 average was third in the AL and 33 doubles second. The Naps finished 1910 7181 but Lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors with a [...]384 average and 227 hits, both categories bettered only in Lajoie's 1901 campaign. His 51 doubles, a career-high, and 304 total bases led the majors, the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the majors in the latter category. Lajoie missed significant parts of back-to-back seasons, the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games. Stovall, the former Naps first baseman, replaced McGuire as the club's manager and the Naps finished 8073. Lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in May during a practice session in Chicago. He played in 117 games on the season, an increase of the 90 he played in one season before, but Cleveland, who had hired Joe Birmingham as the team's fifth manager since Lajoie gave up the role in 1909, finished 7578. Lajoie and Joe Jackson tied for the team lead with 90 RBIs. He finished fourth in the AL with a [...]368 batting average. In 1913, Birmingham and Lajoie had arguments in the open, including one incident in June when Lajoie cursed Birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump. Lajoie hit [...]335 on the year, the last time he would hit over [...]300 in his career.|$|E

2500|$|Philo {{taught that}} Moses proclaimed the fast of Yom Kippur a feast and named it the {{greatest}} of feasts, [...] "a Sabbath of Sabbaths," [...] for many reasons.

Second is that everyone thereby devotes their entire time to nothing else but prayers and supplications. And third is that the fast occurs at the conclusion of harvest <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> people not to rely solely on the food that they have accumulated as the cause of health or life, but on God, Who rules in the world and Who nourished our ancestors in the desert for 40 years.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{theories}} concerning Gaitán's murder, some claiming that the assassination was planned and undertaken by other persons in addition to Juan Roa Sierra; or that the latter was not the real killer. Sierra was born into a poor family. There was a history of mental illness amongst Sierra's brothers, and he may himself have been unstable. He was seen often in Gaitán's office asking for a job, since he was unemployed, but Gaitán had never received him. Some people who knew Sierra stated that he never learned to shoot a gun, although Gaitán's assassin had fired accurate shots. It has been known that the gun used to kill Gaitán was sold two days before the crime, with not enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Roa to use a gun. [...] So, it has been theorized that the crime was planned for political reasons and to promote interests of foreign countries, but this has never been corroborated. [...] Publications have mentioned among others: the government of Mariano Ospina Pérez; sectors of the Liberal party; the Colombian Communist party; Fidel Castro; the CIA; and others that may have been involved in his murder.|$|E
