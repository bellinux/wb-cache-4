5000|$|In the EU {{the system}} is known as ISOFIX and covers both Group 0/0+ and Group 1 child safety seats. The {{mechanism}} for attaching the seat <b>to</b> the <b>Lower</b> <b>Anchors</b> {{is quite different from}} that in the United States. In the EU two [...] "alligator-like" [...] clips connect the seat <b>to</b> the <b>Lower</b> <b>Anchors</b> rather than the open clip style connectors commonly used in the United States. However, some child seat manufacturers are beginning to offer true ISOFIX type attachments in the U.S. In the European standard, there are also various installation categories: [...] "universal", [...] "vehicle-specific" [...] and [...] "semi-universal". The main difference is that [...] "Universal" [...] represents use of a top tether strap with the ISOFIX anchorage, [...] "vehicle-specific" [...] represents the usage of the ISOFIX anchorage without the top tether in specified vehicles only, while [...] "Semi-Universal" [...] represents usage of the ISOFIX anchorage together with a [...] "foot-prop".|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if vehicle features associated with LATCH ease-of-use in laboratory studies with volunteers predict LATCH use and misuse in real-world child restraint installations. Methods: Vehicle characteristics were extracted from prior surveys of more than 100 top-selling 2010 - 13 vehicles. Use and correct use of LATCH was determined from records of child restraint installations in these vehicles that were inspected by child passenger safety technicians at Safe Kids car seat checkup events during 2010 - 12. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between vehicle features and use and correct use of <b>lower</b> <b>anchors</b> and top tethers. Results: Overall, the <b>lower</b> <b>anchors</b> were used in 78 % of the 14, 360 installations using either the <b>lower</b> <b>anchors</b> or seat belt alone, and were used correctly in 49 %. Controlling for other relevant installation features, the odds of using the <b>lower</b> <b>anchors</b> and of using them correctly were higher when the clearance angle around the <b>lower</b> <b>anchors</b> was greater than 54 °, the force required to attach the child restraint <b>to</b> the <b>lower</b> <b>anchors</b> was less than 178 N, and the depth of the <b>lower</b> <b>anchors</b> within the seat bight was less than 4 cm.

In {{the bow and}} stern technique, an anchor is set off each the bow and the stern, which can {{severely}} limit a vessel's swing range and also align it to steady wind, current or wave conditions. One method of accomplishing this moor is to set a bow anchor normally, then drop back to the limit of the bow cable (or to double the desired scope, e.g. 8:1 if the eventual scope should be 4:1, 10:1 if the eventual scope should be 5:1, etc.) <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> a stern <b>anchor.</b> By taking up on the bow cable the stern anchor can be set. After both anchors are set, tension is taken up on both cables to limit the swing or to align the vessel.|$|R

40|$|We investigated, in a {{university}} student population, spontaneous (non-speeded) fast and slow number-to-line mapping responses using non-symbolic (dots) and symbolic (words) stimuli. Seeking for less conventionalized responses, we used anchors 0 – 130, rather than the standard 0 – 100. Slow responses to both types of stimuli only produced linear mappings with no evidence of non-linear compression. In contrast, fast responses revealed distinct patterns of non-linear compression for dots and words. A predicted logarithmic compression was observed in fast responses to dots in the 0 – 130 range, {{but not in the}} reduced 0 – 100 range, indicating compression in proximity of the upper anchor 130, not the standard 100. Moreover, fast responses to words revealed an unexpected significant negative compres-sion in the reduced 0 – 100 range, but not in the 0 – 130 range, indicating compression in proximity <b>to</b> the <b>lower</b> <b>anchor</b> 0. Results show that fast responses help revealing the funda-mentally distinct nature of symbolic and non-symbolic quantity representation. Whole num-ber words, being intrinsically mediated by cultural phenomena such as language and education, emphasize the invariance of magnitude between them—essential for linear map-pings, and therefore, unlike non-symbolic (psychophysical) stimuli, yield spatial mappings that don’t seem to be influenced by the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. However, high levels of education (when combined with an absence of standard upper anchors) may lead fast responses to overestimate magnitude invariance on the lower end of word numerals...|$|R

50|$|Whilst {{a channel}} had existed for the {{navigation}} of ships into the Port of Liverpool, this channel, the Rock Channel, was only {{available for use}} at high tides and therefore vessels could wait many hours at anchor before being able to enter the port.With the increasing commercial trade {{into and out of}} Liverpool coming {{with the advent of the}} steamship, various attempts were made to chart a safe navigable channel through the south eastern portion of Liverpool Bay and into the River Mersey at all states of the tide.According to a crew member of Capt. Gill's, John Bell, who began his service as a deck boy on the Queen of the Isle in 1836, the task was something which Capt. Gill went about in a meticulous way. Bell is recorded as saying that Capt. Gill would be always taking various bearings from his positions to places on the shore, such as the Leasowe Castle and the Beacon on Bidston Hill. A record of the depth of the water at various states of the tide was found by two sailors, one port and one starboard using a lead line, and this would be logged by Capt. Gill. Another part of the arduous task would require Capt. Gill <b>to</b> <b>lower</b> his <b>anchor</b> some two or three feet below the draught of his steamer and, dragging this with him, let it go when he got nearly ashore on a sand-bank. It was in this way that he was able to discover the channel which was to make the modern shipping fortunes of Liverpool.|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigated}} the usability of <b>Lower</b> <b>Anchors</b> and Tethers for CHildren (LATCH) hardware by measuring LATCH implementations in 98 2011 or 2010 model-year vehicles. ISO and SAE LATCH usability rating systems {{were used to}} assess all vehicles using data from the second row left position. Child restraint/vehicle interaction was assessed using both ISO and NHTSA proposed procedures. Volunteer testing was performed with 36 subjects on 12 different vehicles using 3 different child restraints, with each subject performing 8 child restraint installations. The results from the vehicle survey indicate that most vehicle manufacturers provide LATCH hardware at only the minimum number of locations required by FMVSS 225. Only 7 vehicles had three sets of LATCH hardware in the second row, while most of the remaining 91 vehicles were only equipped with LATCH in each outboard position and a tether anchor in the center position. In the 21 vehicles with a third row, four had no tether anchors and 11 had no <b>lower</b> <b>anchors</b> in the third row. The SAE child restraint fixture could not be installed in 27 vehicles, although head restraint interference was the cause of interference in only one vehicle. Fifty-nine vehicles met the SAE recommended lower attachment force of 75 N (16. 9 lb) or less, while 15 vehicles required forces from 2 to 8 times this value.
