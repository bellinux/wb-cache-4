40|$|Many current designs {{contain a}} large number of {{standard}} cells intermixed with larger macro blocks. The range of size in these “mixed block ” designs complicates <b>the</b> <b>placement</b> process considerably; traditional methods produce results that are far from satisfactory. In this paper we extend the traditional recursive bisection standard cell placement tool Feng Shui to directly consider mixed block designs. On a set of recent benchmarks, the new version obtains placements with wire lengths substantially lower than other current tools. Compared to Feng Shui 2. 4, <b>the</b> <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> a Capo-based approach have 29 % higher wire lengths, while <b>the</b> <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> mPG are 26 % higher. Run times of our tool are also lower, and the general approach is scalable...|$|R

30|$|To achieve truly secure deletion, Chen et al. (2016) {{proposed}} TedFlash, a truly secure deletion {{scheme for}} NAND flash-based block devices.

Note that as <b>the</b> random <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> data is independent and does not affect <b>the</b> <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> any other data, TedFlash can eliminate the structural artifacts brought by each write. Most importantly, <b>the</b> random <b>placement</b> technique is exclusively feasible for NAND flash, because: 1) Random seeks on flash memory are as efficient as sequential seeks. 2) <b>The</b> random <b>placements</b> can distribute data evenly among flash, naturally achieving a good wear leveling.|$|R
