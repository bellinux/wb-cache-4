40|$|Characterization of {{the smoke}} from {{pyrolysis}} of common spacecraft materials provides insight {{for the design of}} future smoke detectors and post-fire clean-up equipment on the International Space Station. A <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> was designed to collect smoke aerosol particles for microscopic analysis in fire characterization research. Information on particle morphology, size and agglomerate structure obtained from these tests supplements additional aerosol data collected. Initial modeling for the <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> design was performed with the finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics, and includes the flow field and heat transfer in the device. The COMSOL Particle Tracing Module was used to determine particle deposition on SEM stubs which include TEM grids. Modeling provided optimized design parameters such as geometry, flow rate and temperatures.

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{describes}} trials {{carried out}} at three collieries to compare the per-formance of the Hexhlet sampler (both in its standard form with a nominal sampling rate of 100 I/min and in modified forms, with the same theoretical elutriator charac-teristics, with nominal sampling rates of 73 and 49 l/min), the Conicycle (both in its standard form with a sampling rate of 10 l/min and in a modified form with a sampling rate of 8 l/min), the Standard <b>Thermal</b> <b>Precipitator</b> and the Long Running <b>Thermal</b> <b>Precipitator.</b> In all, replicate samples were obtained with {{some or all of}} the various instruments on 102 shifts. The main conclusions of the experiments are as follows: (a) The 1001 /min Hexhlet tended to "oversample " the "respirable " dust in compari-son with the 73 ljmin Hexhlet and the latter tended to oversample in comparison with the 49 I/min Hexhlet in the coarse dust clouds prevailing at one of the three collieries. This apparent excess of respirable (thimble) dust was balanced almost exactly by a corresponding deficiency of the heavier dust retained in the elutriator. In the less coarse dusts at the other collieries, however, there was no consistent difference between the three versions of the Hexhlet...|$|E
40|$|The main {{efforts of}} the past year have been {{directed}} towards investigation of the behavior of the radioactive aerosols in actual in mining operations. Activities can be categorized as follows: Preparation of equipment for taking data in uranium mines; development of background of personnel to carry out intended experiments; research data from United Nuclear Homestake Partners Section 25 mine in the Ambrosia Lake area near Grants, New Mexico; updating of computer programs for data analysis in order to extract more information; {{and the development of a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> for partical size analysis in the submicron range...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Simultaneous {{airborne}} dust samples were taken with five types of instrument, namely, konimeter, <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator,</b> membrane filter, tyndallometer and VC 25 gravimetric sampler, {{on the surface}} and underground at two types of asbestos mine, producing amosite and Cape crocidolite respectively. The results were analysed and compared in terms of five different concentration parameters, namely, particles plus short fibres (p + sf), long fibres (If), particles plus short fibres plus long fibres (p + sf+ 10, the volume (tyndallometer readings) and the mass of dust (VC 25). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic was used to test for normality and the Bartlett statistic for equality of variance of the transformed concentration data recorded by each type of instrument. Fourteen linear relationships were investigated. In those cases where replicates were given these were used to obtain estimates of the error variances for the predictor and the response variables. With these estimates an additional regression equation to the least squares equation was determined. This new equation is recommended in preference to the corresponding least squares equation, as it is based on information which is discarded when only the position means are used. All but one of the fourteen relationships reached statistical significance. The konimeter and the <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> can be linked with the membrane filter, the tyndallometer can reveal short time variations in the fibre level and the VC 25 can disclose the asbestos content of the fine dust...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{safety in}} the indoor {{spacecraft}} environment is concerned with {{a unique set of}} fuels which are designed to not combust. Unlike terrestrial flaming fires, which often can consume an abundance of wood, paper and cloth, spacecraft fires are expected to be generated from overheating electronics consisting of flame resistant materials. Therefore, NASA prioritizes fire characterization research for these fuels undergoing oxidative pyrolysis in order to improve spacecraft fire detector design. A <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> designed and built for spacecraft fire safety test campaigns at the NASA White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) successfully collected an abundance of smoke particles from oxidative pyrolysis. A thorough microscopic characterization has been performed for ten types of smoke from common spacecraft materials or mixed materials heated at multiple temperatures using the following techniques: SEM, TEM, high resolution TEM, high resolution STEM and EDS. Resulting smoke particle morphologies and elemental compositions have been observed which are consistent with known thermal decomposition mechanisms in the literature and chemical make-up of the spacecraft fuels. Some conclusions about particle formation mechanisms are explored based on images of the microstructure of Teflon smoke particles and tar ball-like particles from Nomex fabric smoke...|$|E
40|$|Thermophoresis is the {{phenomenon}} by which sub-micron particles suspended in a gas {{move in the}} direction of decreasing temperature. It occurs naturally in automotive catalysts and is responsible for improved particle deposition during transient operation when a hot, particle-laden exhaust gas flows through a cool monolith. Although the time-averaged effects of thermophoresis are expected to be relatively small, {{it is possible that the}} effect can be enhanced by a properly designed aftertreatment system. In the current work, thermophoretic effects on particle deposition in automotive catalysts are studied by means of numerical simulations. The potential gain in deposition efficiency obtainable by employing thermophoresis is investigated for both laminar and turbulent flow in a standard monolith channel. The monolith is also compared to a plate-to-plate <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator.</b> We show here that a substantial enhancement of especially the intermediate-sized particulate matter may be obtained by taking advantage of thermophoresis. In addition, we investigate a number of design ideas for thermophoretic particle trapping devices. We also discuss the difficulties involved in using thermophoresis for particle capture, for example that the collecting surface must be cooler than the exhaust gas whereas catalytic activity for the oxidation of soot is still a challenge at low temperatures. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nanomaterials are {{a growing}} source for innovation. However, the very {{properties}} {{that make them}} so effective for their desired purpose might also render them more hazardous towards humans and the environment. Adequate risk assessment tools are often missing, partly due to instrumental gaps in exposure assessment and toxicity testing. In this thesis, two of these instrumental gaps served as the motivation to develop two new instruments, both with the purpose to reduce these gaps. The nano-PMC is a Particle Mass Classifier that is able to directly measure the mass of single particles down to a few zeptograms. Information about nanoparticle mass is vital for converting nanoparticle number concentrations to mass concentrations, a metric which is very useful for exposure assessment. In combination with mobility classification, the so-called apparent density of non-spherical particles like agglomerates can be measured, a property that might determine the health effect of non-toxic but biopersistent dust particles. The Cyto-TP is a <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> that deposits airborne nanoparticles onto living cells. Both the exposure mode and the cell configuration are designed to mimic the contamination of the pulmonary alveoli to inhaled nanoparticles. This instrument, {{as part of an}} in vitro inhalation toxicity test, might contribute to the reduction of the need for animal testing. Both instruments find application within a proposed test procedure to assess the risk potential of nanomaterials still in development - to promote safety-by-design. This precautionary approach might help to increase public confidence in nanomaterials. ChemE/Materials for Energy Conversion & Storag...|$|E
40|$|The Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment (SAME) {{has been}} {{conducted}} twice by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and provided real-time aerosol data in a spacecraft micro-gravity environment. Flight experiment results have been recently analyzed with respect to comparable groundbased experiments. The ground tests included an electrical mobility analyzer as a reference instrument for measuring particle size distributions of the smoke produced from overheating five common spacecraft materials. Repeatable sample surface temperatures were obtained with the SAME ground-based hardware, and measurements were taken with the aerosol instruments returned from the International Space Station comprising two commercial smoke detectors, three aerosol instruments, which measure moments of the particle size distribution, and a <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> for collecting smoke particles for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moment averages from the particle number concentration (zeroth moment), the diameter concentration (first moment), and the mass concentration (third moment) allowed calculation of the count mean diameter and the diameter of average mass of smoke particles. Additional size distribution information, including geometric mean diameter and geometric standard deviations, can be calculated if the particle size distribution {{is assumed to be}} lognormal. Both unaged and aged smoke particle size distributions from ground experiments were analyzed to determine the validity of the lognormal assumption. Comparisons are made between flight experiment particle size distribution statistics generated by moment calculations and microscopy particle size distributions (using projected area equivalent diameter) from TEM grids, which have been returned to the Earth...|$|E
40|$|Carbonaceous (soot) {{particulate}} matter (PM) was collected by both a <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> (TP) {{and a high}} volume air sampler with fiber filters from specific source streams and examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Soot PM from burning tires (TPM), a heavy duty diesel truck (DPM), wood burning (WPM), candle burning (CPM), and various natural gas burner combustion regimes along with black carbon (BC) exhibited similarities in PM microstructure, and average primary spherule diameters, which ranged {{from an average of}} 30 nm for DPM to 45 nm for BC. The spherule structures consisted of curved graphene fragments and intercalated PAHs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations were measured (by GC/MS) and compared for these soot PMs, including PAH diagnostic ratios; and these data were compared with outdoor filter collection PM data for El Paso, TX, and a dozen other cities and regions world wide. TPM was observed to contain a wide range of PAHs with high concentrations (from naphthalene to dibenz[a,h]anthracene (MW 128 - 278)) while DPM and WPM contained lesser concentrations and a smaller PAH range. Candle and natural gas PM as well as commercial BC and carbon nanotube aggregates contained only small concentrations of low MW PAHs. An analysis of PAH carcinogenicity either as a carcinogenicity index or a potency equivalency factor from literature data indicated that only the TPM PAH content would pose any significant long term, carcinogenicity threat. The prospects for utilizing carbonaceous PM source (PAH) markers for discriminating soot PM PAH concentrations in the indoor and outdoor air and the soil is discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{published}} {{results and}} analytical methods {{used in a}} 1938 survey of the spinning area in a UK crocidolite asbestos factory have been described and re-interpreted, by comparing the method used with the current membrane filter-phase contrast microscopy (MF-PCM) method for asbestos. By good fortune, most of the original microscope, and <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> sampling heads {{similar to those used}} for sampling were available, as well as guidance from the factory inspector who collected and analysed the original samples. A textile grade crocidolite asbestos was used to generate a fibrous dust cloud whose size distribution was characterised by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and found to give a close approximation to the fibre size distributions monitored in 1938. Samples taken over the same sampling time, but at lower concentrations than originally sampled, showed that the thermal precipitator-oil immersion microscopy (TP-OI) method used at x 2000 magnification, gave higher> 5 ftm long fibre counts by a factor of between 3 and 4, than the current MF-PCM method. The differences in performance could be explained by the superior resolving power of the TP-OI method for fine crocidolite fibres. Exposures of airborne asbestos fibres in the spinning area were found to be equivalent to about 20 fml~ ' for personal samples and lOfml" ' for area samples, but due to the high levels of ventilation on the day the samples were collected, the average levels throughout the year may have been somewhat higher.

40|$|NASA Centers {{continue}} to collaborate {{to characterize the}} chemical species and smoke particles generated by the combustion of current space-rated non-metallic materials including fluoropolymers. This paper describes the results of tests conducted February through September 2012 to identify optimal chemical markers both for augmenting particle-based fire detection methods and for monitoring the post-fire cleanup phase in human spacecraft. These studies follow up on testing conducted in August 2010 and reported at ICES 2011. The tests were conducted at the NASA White Sands Test Facility in a custom glove box designed for burning fractional gram quantities of materials under varying heating profiles. The 623 L chamber was heavily instrumented to quantify organics (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), inorganics by water extraction followed by ion chromatography, and select species by various individual commercially-available sensors. Evaluating new technologies for measuring carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride and other species of interest was a key objective of the test. Some of these sensors were located inside the glovebox near the fire source to avoid losses through the sampling lines; the rest were located just outside the glovebox. Instruments for smoke particle characterization included a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance Personal Dust Monitor (TEOM PDM) and a TSI Dust Trak DRX to measure particle mass concentration, a TSI PTrak for number concentration and a <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> for collection of particles for microscopic analysis. Materials studied included Nomex(R), M 22759 wire insulation, granulated circuit board, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Kapton(R), and mixtures of PTFE and Kapton(R). Furnace temperatures ranged from 340 to 640 C, focusing on the smoldering regime. Of particular interest in these tests was confirming burn repeatability and production of acid gases with different fuel mixture compositions, {{as well as the}} dependence of aerosol concentrations on temperature...|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} on the International Space Station to evaluate the smoke particulate size from materials and conditions that are typical of those expected in spacecraft fires. Five different materials representative of those found in spacecraft (Teflon, Kapton, cotton, silicone rubber and Pyrell) were heated to temperatures below the ignition point with conditions controlled to provide repeatable sample surface temperatures and air flow. The air flow past the sample during the heating period ranged from quiescent to 8 cm/s. The effective transport time to the measurement instruments was varied from 11 to 800 seconds to simulate different smoke transport conditions in spacecraft. The resultant aerosol was evaluated by three instruments which measured different moments of the particle size distribution. These moment diagnostics {{were used to determine}} the particle number concentration (zeroth moment), the diameter concentration (first moment), and the mass concentration (third moment). These statistics were combined to determine the diameter of average mass and the count mean diameter and by assuming a log-normal distribution, the geometric mean diameter and the geometric standard deviations were also calculated. Smoke particle samples were collected on TEM grids using a <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> for post flight analysis. The TEM grids were analyzed to determine the particle morphology and shape parameters. The different materials produced particles with significantly different morphologies. Overall the majority of the average smoke particle sizes were found to be in the 200 to 400 nanometer range with the quiescent cases and the cases with increased transport time typically producing with substantially larger particles. The results varied between materials but the smoke particles produced in low gravity were typically twice the size of particles produced in normal gravity. These results can be used to establish design requirements for future spacecraft smoke detectors...|$|E
40|$|Appropriate {{design of}} fire {{detection}} systems requires knowledge of both the expected fire signature and the background aerosol levels. Terrestrial {{fire detection systems}} have been developed based on extensive study of terrestrial fires. Unfortunately there is no corresponding data set for spacecraft fires and consequently the fire detectors in current spacecraft were developed based upon terrestrial designs. In low gravity, buoyant flow is negligible which causes particles to concentrate at the smoke source, increasing their residence time, and increasing the transport time to smoke detectors. Microgravity fires have significantly different structure than those in 1 -g which can change the formation history of the smoke particles. Finally the materials used in spacecraft are different from typical terrestrial environments where smoke properties have been evaluated. It is critically important to detect a fire in its early phase before a flame is established, given the fixed volume of air on any spacecraft. Consequently, the primary target for spacecraft fire detection is pyrolysis products rather than soot. Experimental investigations have been performed at three different NASA facilities which characterize smoke aerosols from overheating common spacecraft materials. The earliest effort consists of aerosol measurements in low gravity, called the Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment (SAME), and subsequent ground-based testing of SAME smoke in 55 -gallon drums with an aerosol reference instrument. Another set of experiments were performed at NASAs Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility (WSTF), with additional fuels and an alternate smoke production method. Measurements of these smoke products include mass and number concentration, and a <b>thermal</b> <b>precipitator</b> was designed for this investigation to capture particles for microscopic analysis. The final experiments presented are from NASAs Gases and Aerosols from Smoldering Polymers (GASP) Laboratory, with selected results focusing on realistic fuel preparations and heating profiles with regards to early detection of smoke. SAFFIRE is the upcoming large-scale fire experiment which will be executed in a Cygnus vehicle after it undocks from the ISS...|$|E
40|$|Some Nanoparticles {{have been}} shown to cause adverse health effects. Assessment of {{personal}} exposure to these nanoparticles is a major step towards evaluating this potential risk. Assessment measurements of fine and coarse particles have been carried out mainly with samplers consisting of a miniaturized impactor with a defined cut off size followed by a filter for off-line weighing. This approach is unsuitable for nanoparticles due to their low mass. One applicable way of sampling nanoparticles is by employing the principle of thermophoresis. In this thesis, a personal sampler (<b>Thermal</b> <b>Precipitator,</b> TP) which thermophoretically samples particles, was developed based on CFD-modelling. The objective was to uniformly deposit a representative sample of nanoparticles on a substrate to simplify the subsequent off-line Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis by minimising the analysis time. Numerical simulations provided information about the deposition characteristics and this was used as the basis to develop the sampler. Laboratory tests were carried out with the TP using monodisperse PSL particles of 95, 6 nm and 305 nm in diameters as well as polydisperse soot particles in the size range of about 14 â€“ 98 nm. The particles were sampled with the TP on substrates and later analysed by SEM. Different locations along {{the entire length of the}} substrate were investigated. A more detailed analysis was made of the evaluation region on the substrate, where a uniform deposition of particles is expected according to the prior modelling. Experimental results show a homogeneous deposition of particles up to a size range of 300 nm in the evaluation region independent of particle material type as well as the orientation of the device during sampling. Independence of deposition is important since the worker is mobile in all directions Unlike with an older version of the TP where up to 32 SEM images of its non-uniform particle deposition had to be evaluated to obtain an average particle size distribution, an evaluation of the uniform deposition with the new TP is much more simplified, remarkably reducing the time and cost of the evaluation, while improving the statistics of the results...|$|E
