2500|$|In February 2015, Oni Press {{announced}} that a comic book series based on the show, in collaboration with Jhonen Vasquez and Nickelodeon, was being released as {{the continuation of the}} series. Vasquez said about the show: [...] "I'm always confused when people say how much they miss Invader Zim because the show never stopped running in my head, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> everyone else isn't in my head". A pre-issue 0 was released on May 23, 2015 as a zine and foreshadow to the comic book series. The first issue was released on July 8, 2015, and since then most issues are released on a monthly basis.|$|E
2500|$|Lacking {{an offer}} for a {{competitive}} drive in 1980, Regazzoni re-joined Ensign. His season {{came to an}} abrupt end only four races into the year. He crashed during the 1980 United States Grand Prix West, held at Long Beach, when the brake pedal of his Ensign failed {{at the end of a}} long, high-speed straight travelling at approximately 280km/h. Ricardo Zunino's retired Brabham was parked in the escape road. Regazzoni later recalled, [...] "I hit Zunino's car, then bounced into the barrier. For about 10 minutes I lost consciousness. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> terrible pain in my hips...". The crash left Regazzoni paralyzed from the waist down, ending his competitive career. On recovery, Regazzoni sued the race organisers, claiming their safety procedures were sub-standard. [...] The race organisers won the case.|$|E
2500|$|Present party designations {{have become}} empty of all contents... Vastly {{extended}} State expenditure, vastly increased demands from the taxpayer {{who has to}} provide the money, social reform regardless of expense, cash exacted from the taxpayer already at his wits' end—when were the problems of plus and minus more desperate? How are we to measure the use and abuse of industrial organization? Powerful orators find [...] "Liberty" [...] the true keyword, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> hearing from a learned student that of [...] "liberty" [...] he knew well over two hundred definitions. Can we {{be sure that the}} [...] "haves" [...] and the [...] "have-nots" [...] will agree in their selection of the right one? We can only trust to the growth of responsibility; we may look to circumstances and events to teach their lesson.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> thought perplexed. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> {{her cousins}} at Leatherhead.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> {{and laughed}} and that laugh did me a world of good.|$|R
60|$|I {{had it on}} my lips to say, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> Mr. Wharton's injunction.|$|R
2500|$|They {{took the}} three {{children}} {{to the home of}} William Starck, a neighbor, for immediate care. Starck's daughter, Anna Starck Benjamin, who was 4½ years old at the time, remembered [...] "the sound of Hazel's outstretched arms as they brushed against the furniture as they brought her into the house, and took her into my parents' bedroom. The crackling sound as that of frozen laundry brought in off the clothes line in winter. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the crying, so much crying." [...] They worked over Hazel for hours, trying to revive her, but without success. Hazel's mother, Blanche, was brought to the Starck house after the searchers found the children and sat in a chair, rocking back and forth, while they tended to {{the three children}}. Throughout the night when the children were missing, she had been kept company by neighbors. At one point, she drifted off to sleep, and said later that her daughter had come to her in a dream. In the dream, Hazel said, [...] "I was cold, Mama, but I'm not anymore." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, I {{had hardly}} taken it when I felt an odd sort of psychic feeling--a sort of drowsiness. I remember, in a dim way, going to bed, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> nothing till I woke up next morning.|$|E
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth I can recall {{very little of the}} events of that evening. A kind of dizzy weariness overmastered me. I {{remember}} sitting at a table next to Stella, and eating heartily, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> nothing more.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>I</b> had {{a friend}} on board, and stepped to the companion.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> all the {{problems}} that had been troubling me, although in truth I {{had never thought of}} propounding them to Zikali.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> at once {{where it}} was that I had seen him--at the broker's in the city, before we sailed for America.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Thorns firing doubts at me obliquely {{across the}} table. [...] "You can't run a country through its spoilt children," [...] he said. [...] "What you call aristocrats are really spoilt children. They've {{had too much}} of everything, except bracing experience." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, sir, that I {{remember}} your face; {{but of course}} you have changed a good deal, since <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> you well, for you often came down our lines; and you could speak the language fluently, and were fond of talking to us.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{all seemed}} too amazing. For a time I couldn't speak coherently. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{thinking}} that whatever happened, whatever price I had to pay, I must stand upon {{the stage of}} that theatre and win. My lips were quite dry. His great voice seemed to have faded into a whisper.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I missed it, and I couldn't {{think where}} I {{could have left}} it. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>I</b> had been sitting here. Thank you so much.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> and {{reminded}} Bickley {{of the crash}} which we had heard while Yva and Bastin were absent on some secret business in the chamber.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that enigmatical {{conversation}} between Poirot and Evelyn Howard. Was this {{what they had}} meant? Was this the monstrous possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe? ...|$|R
6000|$|ISABEL. Please, {{there as}} {{something}} I {{heard you talking}} about, last time, with Miss Mary. I was at my lessons, but I heard something about nests; and I thought it was birds' nests; and I couldn't help listening; and <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> it was about [...] "nests of quartz in granite." [...] I remember, because I was so disappointed! ...|$|E
60|$|Sheer down, screaming, seventy feet he fell, smashing to {{the earth}} with an audible thud and crunch, his body {{rebounding}} slightly and settling down again. Still he lived, for he moved and squirmed, clawing {{with his hands and}} feet. I remember the Fire-Man running forward with a stone and hammering him on the head...and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "But she won't be lovely a bit the more. She'll {{grow old}} all the same, and take to drink very like. When she's got a red {{nose and a}} pimply face, and a sharp tongue, you'd be glad enough to see her at the wash-tub <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> an old song as {{my father used to}} sing, but my mother couldn't endure to hear it.|$|E
60|$|I rose heavily, and {{suddenly}} bethought {{me of my}} utter lack of money. It dismayed me for a moment. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> the mule, and determined that I must go afoot.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was with}} an effort I refrained from putting my lips to kiss her at that moment {{as she looked at}} me with womanly dignity and tenderness. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered,</b> and said: ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not catch}} his drift for the moment; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered.</b> The {{carpenter}} was the Finn, the Jonah, the warlock who played tricks with the winds and despitefully used poor sailormen.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{that some}} of my men essayed to {{restrain}} me, which to my passion was as the wind to a blaze. I cracked my whip about their heads, commanding them to keep their distance lest they were minded to share his castigation. And so fearful an air must I have worn, that, daunted, they hung back and watched their leader's punishment in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "On and on I galloped {{up a steep}} road. I {{remember}} hearing lions roaring round me in the darkness. I remember one of them springing upon my horse and the poor beast's scream. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> no more till I found myself--I {{believe it was a}} week or so later--lying on the verandah of a nice house, and being attended by some good-looking women of an Abyssinian cast of countenance." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{drew out}} my tinder-box and lighted the wick. She had turned, and was facing me {{even as she}} had faced me the night before. The night before! The {{greatest}} {{part of my life}} seemed to have passed since <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> wondering that she did not look tired. Her face was sad, her voice was sad, and it had an ineffable, sweet quality at such times that was all its own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Buell {{fired the}} slash. Penetier is burning. Dick and Hiram sent {{me back to}} the pool below, and then didn't come. They got caught--oh!... I'm afraid--lost!... <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> you fellows. The fire's coming--it's awful--we must fly!" ...|$|R
60|$|Captain Collinson and Mr. Furness, of the Thunderer, {{offered to}} serve his Lordship, which made me bethink that I, too, would have need of some one. 'Twas <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> Singleton, who had passed from my mind.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered,</b> {{and looked}} {{hard at the}} speaker. The last {{sentence}} was justified, but he differed greatly from one's idea of the typical lawyer. He was not even neatly dressed, and his manner singularly lacked the preciseness of the legal practitioner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Carrie, [...] "of course, I might die, and <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> {{it would}} go back again. Still, that only makes what I {{want to do more}} necessary. I suppose I could make over to my husband all the money there is in the English bank and {{anything}} else that really belongs to me? That is, I could put it into his account here? You see, I don't want him to know--anything about it for a little while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are all alive now, {{trying to}} work up your parochial schools to [...] "efficiency" [...] mark--rather you were doing so, for I think there was only time allowed up to December 31, 1870. I hope that the efforts were successful. At such times one wishes to see great noble gifts, men of great riches giving their £10,000 to a common fund. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that the claims and calls are so {{numerous}} in England, that very wealthy men can hardly give in that way.|$|E
60|$|But I had {{forgotten}} the exact position of the door, and I struck myself heavily against {{the corner of the}} bed. I staggered back, turned, and was either struck or struck myself against some other bulky furnishing. I have a vague memory of battering myself thus to and fro in the darkness, of a heavy blow at last upon my forehead, of a horrible sensation of falling that lasted an age, of my last frantic effort to keep my footing, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> no more.|$|E
6000|$|Until one day I {{received}} a letter addressed {{to the care of}} my publishers. It bore the Swiss postmark, and opening it and turning to the signature I sat wondering for the moment where I had met [...] "Horatio Jones." [...] And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have been}} with him, I see,' says the reverend gent, with a shrug: <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> what you had told me of the broken seal of your letter, and have not the {{slightest}} doubt that Brough opened and read every word of it.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>I</b> had {{forgotten}} to take my dose of magic seed, and I hastened to do it, although I was beginning to lose faith in it. I had not grown a single bit, by the merciless testimony of the hall door.|$|R
