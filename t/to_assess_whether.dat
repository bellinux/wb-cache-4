5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>whether</b> a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of Dermotherium were about {{as large as the}} Philippine colugo and larger than the Sunda colugo and {{differed}} from both in a number of characteristics of the dentition. Not enough is known of the skeleton of Dermotherium <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>whether</b> the animal already possessed the gliding adaptations of living colugos. The two species are similar in size, but again differ in details of the dentition. In two specimens of D.chimaera, the length and width of the m2 are 5 and 4.3mm and 5.4 and 4.8mm respectively; this tooth is 5.4mm long and 4.9mm wide in the only known specimen of Dermotherium major. The Pakistani M2 of Dermotherium is 4.3mm long and 6mm wide, compared to 4.7 and 6.6mm in the only known M2 of D.chimaera from Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>whether</b> huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E

5|$|Hinkley Point C {{nuclear power}} station is a project to {{construct}} a 3,200 MW two reactor {{nuclear power station}}. On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Hinkley Point– already {{the site of the}} disused Hinkley Point A and the still operational Hinkley Point B power stations– was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. NNB Generation Company, a subsidiary of EDF, submitted an application for development consent to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 31 October 2011. A protest group, Stop Hinkley, was formed to campaign for the closure of Hinkley Point B and oppose any expansion at the Hinkley Point site. In December 2013, the European Commission opened an investigation <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>whether</b> the project breaks state-aid rules. On 8 October 2014 it was announced that the European Commission has approved the project, with an overwhelming majority and only four commissioners voting against the decision.|$|E
5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>whether</b> it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, {{after his}} release by Grays, Hooper went on two trials. Firstly to League Two club Barnet, then to Championship club Southend United, where {{he was given a}} one-year {{contract}} by manager Steve Tilson the following month. On 24 October, Hooper scored twice in a 3–1 League Cup win over Leeds United. He went on to make 18 appearances for Southend in the Championship, although only two were starts. On 15 March, Hooper joined League One club Leyton Orient on loan {{for the rest of the}} season. Tilson said that this loan would allow him <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>whether</b> Hooper merited a new contract and would give the young striker experience. Hooper was recalled from loan on 1 May before, already relegated, Southend's last match of the season. A number of players were out injured for the match and, five days after his recall, Hooper started in the 4–1 defeat to Southampton.|$|E
