5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's {{frequent use of}} religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or {{might have been a}} device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E
5|$|The cantata was {{commissioned}} by the minister {{of one of the}} churches in Mühlhausen, the city where Bach worked at the time. It was possibly written for a special occasion. The text is based on Luther's German version of Psalm 130 and also incorporates <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chorale. Bach's music integrates melodies from the chorale into larger structures. Bach also shows his interest in counterpoint, something which was characteristic of him throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Through his freemason {{contacts}} with Pierre Maurice Glayre, Piattoli won {{the confidence of}} Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski, becoming his agent in Paris and, {{by the end of}} 1789, his private secretary and librarian, although without any official title. Acting as a sort of cultural aide, Piattoli, who had strong ties to the reformist and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers—Ignacy Potocki in particular—and the king. In <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was “like a tireless spring”, constantly mediating between the two factions.|$|E

5|$|After Andromeda there {{followed}} {{a period of}} several years in which Mantua made little use of Monteverdi's services. Duke Ferdinando died on 26 October 1626 and was succeeded by Don Vincenzo, who became Duke Vincenzo II. Early in 1627 Striggio approached Monteverdi with a request for theatrical music, possibly for the festivities that would celebrate Vincenzo's accession. Monteverdi replied offering three options: first, Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda ("The Battle of Tancred and Clorinda"), a setting from Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata ("Jerusalem Delivered"), which had been performed at the 1624 Venice Carnival; secondly, a setting from another part of Tasso's poem, covering the story of the sorceress Armida and her abandonment by the Christian hero Rinaldo; finally, he offered to set <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new play by Giulio Strozzi, Licori finta pazza inamorata d'Aminta, about a woman who feigns madness for the sake of love. Monteverdi sent Striggio a copy of Strozzi's play on 7 May 1627; Striggio liked it and instructed Monteverdi to begin the music.|$|E
25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} for a law to be authentically interpreted, recourse must be had to what is called magisterial, or doctrinal, interpretation, for which rules of law have been formulated. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law must be understood according to their usual signification, unless it is certain that the legislator intended them to be taken in another sense, or the rules of law dictate another interpretation. In all interpretations, however, the meaning of the words is to be preferred which favours equity rather than strict justice. The provisions of a previous statute are not presumed to be changed beyond the express meaning of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new law. No words of a law are ever presumed to be superfluous. In interpreting a law the words must be considered in their context. When <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law are doubtful the presumption is in favour of the subjects, not of the lawgiver.|$|E

That in later times he was not termed a heretic, although disparaging criticism was not lacking, was due to his position as gaon (see Weiss, l.c. iv. 198; Menahem Me'iri, Bet ha-Beḥirah, in Adolf Neubauer, M.

25|$|Soon Kvachkov and {{two other}} former Spetznaz troopers, Alexander Naydenov and Robert Yashin were {{detained}} under suspicion of involvement into the assassination. The Meshchansky District Court of Moscow approved ten-days-arrest for Kvachkov. Investigators {{did not have any}} direct evidence or indicating his guilt, but indirect evidence allowed the court to issue the warrant. Igor Yartykh, a lawyer who won a case involving former paratroopers accused of the murder of Dmitry Kholodov, took Kvachkov's defense. According to the version of the investigators, Vladimir Kvachkov, Naydenov and Yashin as well as Vladimir Kvachkov's son, Alexander Kvachkov and Ivan Mironov, son of former Minister for Media and Information, Boris Mironov conspired to assassinate Chubais. The version was mostly based on <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single witness, Igor Karvatko.|$|E
25|$|Casaubon has {{a romance}} with a Brazilian woman named Amparo. He leaves Italy {{to follow her}} and spends a few years in Brazil. While living there, he learns about South American and Caribbean spiritualism, and meets Agliè, an elderly man who implies {{that he is the}} mystical Comte de Saint-Germain. Agliè has a {{seemingly}} infinite supply of knowledge about things concerning the Occult. While in Brazil, Casaubon receives a letter from Belbo about attending a meeting of occultists. At the meeting Belbo was reminded of the Colonel's conspiracy theory by <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young woman who was apparently in a trance. Casaubon and Amparo also attend an occult event in Brazil, an Umbanda rite. During the ritual Amparo falls into a trance herself, an experience she finds deeply disturbing and embarrassing, as she is Marxist by ideology and as such disbelieves and shuns spiritual and religious experiences. Her relationship with Casaubon falls apart, and he returns to Italy.|$|E
