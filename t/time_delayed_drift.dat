40|$|We {{investigate}} laser induced nonsequential {{multiple ionization}} using a simple statistical {{model in which}} an electron recollides inelastically with its parent ion. In this collision, it thermalizes with the remaining N- 1 bound electrons within a time interval Δ t. Subsequently, all the N electrons leave. We {{address the question of}} how the above <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> influence the individual contributions from the orbits in which the first electron, upon return, is accelerated or decelerated by the field, respectively, to the ion momentum distributions. In both cases, the <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> modify the <b>drift</b> momenta obtained by the N electrons when they reach the continuum at t+Δ t, by moving such times towards or away from a crossing of the electric field. The contributions from both types of collisions are influenced in distinct ways, and the interplay between such trends determines the widths and the peak momenta of the distributions. Specifically in the few-cycle pulse case, we also show that such <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> do not affect the shapes of the momentum distributions in a radical fashion. Hence, even with a thermalization time Δ t, nonsequential multiple ionization could in principle be used for absolute-phase diagnosis. Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures (eps files...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{possible}} repetitive nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), their cosmological origin, and their high occurrence, detection of strongly lensed sources due to intervening galaxy lenses is possible with forthcoming radio surveys. We show that if multiple {{images of a}} repeating source are resolved with VLBI, using a method independent of lens modeling, accurate timing could reveal non-uniform motion, either physical or apparent, of the emission spot. This can probe the physical nature of FRBs and their surrounding environments, constraining scenarios including orbital motion around a stellar companion if FRBs require a compact star in a special system, and jet-medium interactions for which {{the location of the}} emission spot may randomly vary. The high timing precision possible for FRBs (∼ ms) compared to the typical <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> between images in galaxy lensing (≳ 10 days) enables the measurement of tiny fractional changes in the delays (∼ 10 ^- 9), and hence the detection of time-delay variations induced by relative motions between the source, the lens, and the Earth. We show that uniform cosmic peculiar velocities only cause the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> to <b>drift</b> linearly, and that the effect from the Earth's orbital motion can be accurately subtracted, thus enabling a search for non-trivial source motion. For a timing accuracy of ∼ 1 ms and a repetition rate (of detected bursts) ∼ 0. 05 per day of a single FRB source, non-uniform displacement ≳ 0. 1 - 1 AU of the emission spot perpendicular to the line of sight is detectable if repetitions are seen over a period of hundreds of days.

Subsequently, the <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> that best fits the expression profiles is inferred by minimizing the error between the predicted and experimental expression values. Computational experiments are conducted for both in numero and real expression data sets.
