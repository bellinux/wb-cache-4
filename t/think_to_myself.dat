500|$|... "Cop Killer" [...] was {{replaced}} by a new version of [...] "Freedom of Speech," [...] a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound, using a looped sample from the Jimi Hendrix song [...] "Foxy Lady." [...] Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a single. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album Home Invasion, taking Body Count with him. The studio version of [...] "Cop Killer" [...] has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release Live in L.A. According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song [...] "still lingers for us, even now. I'll try to book clubs and the guy I'm talking to will mention it and I'll <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> 'Man, that was 17 years ago.' But I meet a lot of bands who ask me about it, too, and I'm real respected by other artists for it. But it's a love/hate thing. Ice gets it too, even though he plays a cop on TV now on Law & Order SVU." ...|$|E
500|$|Bandslam {{was bought}} by a studio back in 2004, but in late January 2007, Walden Media and Summit Entertainment {{announced}} that they would co-finance Bandslam, co-written by Todd Graff and Josh A. Cagan and directed by Graff. Graff was hired to direct in early March 2007 and rewrote the screenplay. Before filming, they had two weeks of music rehearsals. The actors and actresses were designated to play their instruments. Donowho and Michalka had extensive experience with the drums and guitar, respectively, so {{they were used to}} their instruments, but Lisa Chung, Scott Porter and Vanessa Hudgens were not. Hudgens told MTV News she didn't expect there to be as much music, and [...] "they are like, 'We are going to have two weeks of music rehearsals,' and I was like, 'What?' But it was really cool. It's definitely not the kind of music I do normally." [...] Principal photography began on February 9, 2008 in Austin, Texas. Although the film is set in New Jersey, Graff felt strongly {{that it was important to}} shoot in a place with a wide array of great live music to choose from. [...] "I'm a big believer in local scenes," [...] he says. [...] "I think it's the lifeblood of music. Austin is renowned as a music town, and rightly so. They have a ton of really great bands just trying to get their music out there. So, it's great we had an opportunity to use several unsigned local Texas bands." [...] In an interview with Los Angeles Times, director Todd Graff admitted there were cultural incongruities underlying the film. [...] "I know, it's demented. Every once in a while on set I would <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'I can't believe we got away with this'. I always thought if it only sent one kid to listen to a Velvet Underground record, it would be worth it to me." [...] All of the vocals were filmed live by each of the singing cast members, as mentioned by director Graff. One of the requirements for the film was that all actors had to be able to provide their own vocals. Because Aly Michalka was on tour with her sister AJ Michalka and Miley Cyrus, she did not arrive in Austin until midway through rehearsals. Conveniently, the tour's last stop was in Austin, where rehearsal and filming for the movie took place. All of the instruments and singing in the movie were recorded by the actors, with the exception of the guitar parts of Vanessa Hudgens and Scott Porter, as well as Lisa Chung's piano parts. Although Hudgens and Porter learned how to play their songs, they were dubbed by guitarists Jason Mozersky and JW Wright.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with King, published in the USA Weekend in March 2009, the author stated, [...] "People look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource. I do. Elmore Leonard, every day I wake up and—not to be morbid or anything, although morbid is my life to a degree—don't see his obituary in the paper, I <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Great! He's probably working somewhere. He's gonna produce another book, and I'll have another book to read. Because when he's gone, there's nobody else." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Gee!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I {{never talk}} a streak {{like this to}} anybody. I just hold my hush an' keep my <b>thinks</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> But, somehow, I guess it's funny, I kind of have a feelin' I want to make good with you. An' that's why I'm tellin' you my thinks. Anybody can dance." ...|$|R

2500|$|Given Schiller's {{view that}} {{the meaning of a}} thought amounts to the {{consequences}} one means to bring about by the thought, Schiller further concluded that the truth of a thought depends on whether it actually brings about the consequences one intended. For example, if while following a cooking recipe that called for salt I were to <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Cerebos is salt", my thought will be true if it consequently leads me to add Cerebos and produce a dish with the intended taste. However, if while working in a chemistry lab to produce a certain mixture I were to <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Cerebos is salt", my thought would both have a different meaning than before (since my intent now differs) and be false (since Cerebos is only equivalent to salt for culinary purposes). According to Schiller, the question of what a thought like [...] "Cerebos is salt" [...] means or whether it is true can only be answered if the specific circumstances with which the thought arose are taken into consideration. While there is some similarity here between Schiller's view of meaning and the later ordinary language philosophers, Schiller's account ties meaning and truth more closely to individuals and their intent with a specific use rather than whole linguistic communities.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{influence}} on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke highly praise to Richard Pryor, [...] "What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude. The fact that someone was able to open themselves wide-open like that. It's so hard to talk {{in front of people}} or to open yourself up to your closest friends. But to open yourself up for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot my car. And nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand. And when I was going through this thing this year, that is the example I would <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> that gave me the courage to just go back on the stage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, by the Lord Harry!' cried Dennis with a noisy laugh, 'you {{went down}} very quiet, Muster Gashford--and very flat besides. I <b>thinks</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> {{at the time}} [...] "it's all up with Muster Gashford!" [...] I never see a man lay flatter nor more still--with the life in him--than you did to-day. He's a rough 'un to play with, is that 'ere Papist, and that's the fact.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{thought they}} mout be, acause I {{have a sister}} myself. Not that I would make bold for to dror comparisons, even in my own mind, for she's only a common woman--as common a one as ever you see. But few women rise above the common. Last Sunday, in yon village church, I heard the {{minister}} read out that one man in a thousand had he found, 'but one woman in all these,' he says, 'have I not found,' and I <b>thinks</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Right you are!' But I warrant he never met your ladyship." ...|$|R
6000|$|But I draw in {{the horns}} of my mind and <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Forbear, John Hostler, forbear!"--Her maiden name?

6000|$|... 'It {{is strange}} after what, in {{comparison}} with such extraordinary changes, must be esteemed so brief an interval,' observed Masham, with a smile, 'to witness such a revolution in his position.

6000|$|He {{uncovered}} his haggard {{face and}} showed me the flush of a consciousness sharper, I <b>think,</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> than to him. [...] "A memory of the past!

6000|$|The {{merit of}} this bird's strain {{is in its}} freedom from all plaintiveness. The singer can easily move us to tears or to laughter, but where is he who can excite in us a pure morning joy?

It sets one thinking o' that--gardening does. But I must go back now, else mother 'ull be in trouble as I aren't there." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{some time}} {{neither of us}} offered any suggestion, for we knew very little indeed about the suburbs of London. At last I said, [...] "I think Harry I should like to be somewhere near the river, if that would suit you {{as well as any}} other side of London. When we were at Grendon House, we used to go up the river to Kew in a steamer, once or twice every summer, on the Miss Pilgrims' birthdays, and grand {{occasions}} of that sort, and I remember I used to <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> that if I were to live in London, I should like it to be near the river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Day {{was just}} breakin' as we struck her, and there wasn't a soul {{to be seen}} on board. The water was very still, and the nigger-man gave me a lift from the boat, and I climbed onto the steamer where her side was sliced to the deck for loadin' fruit. The hatches was open, and I {{looked down and saw}} the cargo of bananas that filled the hold to within six feet of the top. I <b>thinks</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Clancy, you better go as a stowaway. It's safer. The steamer men might hand you back to the {{employment}} bureau. The tropic'll get you, Clancy, if you don't watch out.' ...|$|R
60|$|I perambulated {{down the}} cliff again, and escorted up a man six foot three, with a sandy beard {{and no other}} {{dimension}} that you could notice. <b>Thinks</b> I <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> if he's got ten thousand dollars on his person it's in one bill and folded lengthwise.|$|R
6000|$|We resumed business; {{and while}} plying our spoons in the bowl, <b>thinks</b> I <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> I wonder now if this here has {{any effect on}} the head?

"Let it go, it {{has done}} its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets," [...] said Mr. Bhaer with a smile {{as he watched the}} {{fragments}} fly away on the wind. [...] "Yes," [...] he added earnestly, [...] "I read that, and I <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love.

6000|$|Pardoning other things, I {{could not}} quite pardon his concealing from {{me that he had}} been married to a first wife. Why I should have felt this so bitterly as I did, at certain times and seasons, I am not able to explain. Jealousy was at the bottom of it, I suppose. And yet I was not {{conscious}} of being jealous--especially when I thought of the poor creature's miserable death. Still, Eustace ought not to have kept that secret from me, I used to <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> at odd times when I was discouraged and out of temper.

When I was at school, I used to get larrupped every day; and used to <b>think,</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> what a grand thing it would be to have a master just like what Dr. Burke, M.D., Dublin, is now; and I expect it is just about the same, with him.

60|$|My dearest Mrs. Martin,--Do {{believe that}} I have not been, as I have seemed, perhaps, forgetful of you through this silence.

Your verses, in their grace of kindness, and the ivy from Wordsworth's cottage, just made me <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> that I would write to you before I left England, but when you talk really of coming to see me, why, I must speak! You overcome me with the sense of your goodness to me.|$|E
6000|$|These {{two were}} as one {{far more than}} most married people, and, just as Gavin in his {{childhood}} reflected his mother, she now reflected him. The people for whom she sewed thought it was contact with them that had rubbed the broad Scotch from her tongue, but she Was only keeping pace with Gavin. When she was excited the Harvie words came back to her, as they come back to me. I have taught the English language all my life, and I try to write it, but everything I say in this book I first <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> in the Doric.
