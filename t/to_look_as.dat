5|$|Before the {{shooting}} of the film began, Vidya started to use a prosthetic belly <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> close to authentically pregnant as possible. According to news reports, she met doctors and pregnant women {{to learn about the}} typical lifestyle and nuances of a pregnant woman, and also made lists of rules and superstitions followed by pregnant women. Vidya said that during her college days she often used to imitate pregnant ladies during stand-up acting among friends, an experience that helped her during {{the shooting}}.|$|E
5|$|Kenny is a third, later fourth-grade {{student who}} {{commonly}} has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town {{life in his}} hometown of South Park, Colorado, where he lives with his poverty-stricken family. Kenny is animated by computer <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> he did in the show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film , in which his true appearance and voice was first revealed, and various South Park merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Laura {{takes an}} {{overdose}} of sleeping pills. Dying, she begs to be with Simón again and the children's spirits appear, with Simón among them. Simón tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay {{and take care of}} the orphans, she then happily tells them a story. Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Simón and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura. He turns <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> the door opens, and he smiles.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began at}} P. C. Sreeram's house in Alwarpet. Although {{the film was}} {{primarily}} set indoors in Delhi, Ratnam and Sreeram wanted the indoor scenes <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> lively as those shot outdoors. Since the cast was relatively small, Ratnam did not want it to resemble a play and used backlighting for the interior scenes. Thotta Tharani found {{a house in the}} residential area of Kilpauk in Madras (now Chennai) which admitted a great deal of sunlight, making it similar to houses in Delhi. Mouna Ragam was Ratnam's first film to make extensive use of staccato dialogue; this became his trademark style in later films. To reduce production costs, food for the film's crew was cooked at Venkateswaran's home.|$|E
5|$|M-86 {{currently}} uses two bridges {{eligible for}} listing on the NRHP. The span over the St. Joseph River in Three Rivers {{was built in}} 1903. It is a five-span concrete arch bridge constructed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> though created from stacked masonry blocks. The current railings were added in 1952 by the MSHD during a repair project. The second historic structure is the bridge over the Prairie River in Centreville. This camelback pony truss span was moved to its current location in 1938–39, although it was originally built on an unknown location in 1923. In the move, two sidewalks, one {{on either side of}} the trusses, were eliminated from the structure. This project was part of Public Works Administration relief work in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> {{if it had been}} destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E

2500|$|Division {{is neither}} {{commutative}} nor associative. As {{it is helpful}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at subtraction <b>as</b> addition, it is helpful <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at division <b>as</b> multiplication of the dividend times the reciprocal of the divisor, that is [...] When written as a product, it obeys all the properties of multiplication.|$|R
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

25|$|After {{the terrible}} {{results for the}} Edwards Campaign during the Nevada caucuses, in which Edwards {{finished}} in third with 4% of the state delegation and received no national delegates, South Carolina began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> a state where he needed a strong finish, after finishing in third {{in the last three}} primaries which took place, and trailing in the number of total national delegates.|$|E
25|$|Artists such as Roland Penrose (author of the Home Guard Manual of Camouflage), Stanley William Hayter, Julian Trevelyan {{and many}} others were {{employed}} to conceal defences. In built-up areas pillboxes were disguised {{to look like a}} part of an adjacent building, carefully matched and provided with a roof <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if they had always been there. In extreme cases, they were built inside existing buildings.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 1986, Sellers {{killed his}} mother, Vonda Bellofatto, and his stepfather, Lee Bellofatto, {{while they were}} asleep in the bedroom of their Oklahoma City home. Wearing only {{underwear}} to limit blood spatter on himself, he first shot his step-father. The shot awoke his mother, who he shot in the face. Sellers tried to disguise his guilt by arranging the crime scene <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if an intruder had committed the killings.|$|E

25|$|The {{lighthouse}} was due for replacement in 2007, and {{a budget}} was set, but on 12 December 2006 it collapsed, as {{one or two}} of the supporting piles broke. The Sydney Ports Corporation employed Waterways Constructions to reconstruct the lighthouse. The new tower was designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> similar as possible to its predecessor, using the salvaged and renovated lantern house, and a new lower section. Reconstruction completed and the light returned to operation on 18 December 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Tainted – Where {{the other}} Nazgûl were slowly {{swallowed}} by the taint of their rings, the Tainted gave himself wholly and willingly to Sauron. Now all natural things rebel in his presence, vegetation withers, animals sicken and bold warriors cower. He is an abomination whose merest presence is poison to life, honour and hope. The Tainted {{is one of the}} Nazgûl, representing their withering, abhorrent nature. His mounted model is built <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> though his horse were sickened and dying by merely being near him.|$|E
25|$|Chidambaram and Tung {{found that}} group size mattered immensely in a group’s performance. The smaller the group, {{the more likely}} each member was to participate, {{regardless}} of range (dispersed or collocated). The main difference stated between distributed and collocated groups was the social pressure at least to appear busy that is present in collocated groups. When others are present, people feel the need <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> if they are working hard, while {{those who are not}} in the presence of others do not.|$|E

25|$|The outward {{appearance}} of the Montgomery building was typical of those built in Western towns during the railroad boom of the late 19th century. Developers wanted railroad towns <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> much like eastern towns as possible so stone and lumber quickly replaced adobe and log as the primary building materials. Timber was scarce in El Paso but the railroad brought milled lumber, much {{of it from the}} Cloudcroft area. Railroads also brought pressed tin, cast iron, glass and hardware that were used to simulate styles popular in the eastern United States.|$|E
25|$|There {{is usually}} a hum of {{expectancy}} when Holmes and Sutcliffe appear, their faces wreathed in smiles, and chatting happily together. They seem to be sharing some all-absorbing joke. Holmes, proudly wearing his Yorkshire cap, walks with quick, short steps, shoulders erect and head in the air, doing his best <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> tall as (John) Tunnicliffe. Sutcliffe has dark, glossy hair and usually disdains the valued White Rose cap when batting. He strolls casually along {{by the side of}} Percy, keeping his weather eye open for the wicket-keeper's end and the honour of taking the first ball.|$|E
25|$|The roofed {{colonnade}} {{led from}} the enclosure wall {{to the south of}} the complex. A passageway with a limestone ceiling constructed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> though it was made from whole tree trunks led to a massive stone imitation of two open doors. Beyond this portal was a hall with twenty pairs of limestone columns composed of drum shaped segments built to look like bundles of plant stems and reaching a height of 6.6 m. The columns were not free-standing, but were attached to the wall by masonry projections. Between the columns {{on both sides of the}} hall were small chambers, which some Egyptologists propose may have been for each of the provinces of Upper and Lower Egypt. At the end of the colonnade was the transverse hypostyle room with eight columns connected in pairs by blocks of limestone. This led to the South Court.|$|E
