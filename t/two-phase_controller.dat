40|$|Abstract — A digital PWM voltage mode {{controller}} {{integrated circuit}} (IC) for high-frequency dc-dc switching converters achieving virtually minimum possible, i. e. optimum, output voltage deviation to load transients is introduced. The IC is implemented with simple hardware, requiring small silicon area, and {{can operate as}} a single-phase or a <b>two-phase</b> <b>controller.</b> To minimize the area and eliminate known mode transition problems of the optimal response controllers, two novel blocks are combined. Namely, an asynchronous track-and-hold analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a “large-small ” signal compensator are implemented. The ADC utilizes a pre-amplifier and only four comparators having approximately eight times smaller silicon area and power consumption than an equivalent windowed flash architecture. The “large-small ” signal compensator consists of two parts, a digital PID minimizing small variations and a zero-current detection-based compensator suppressing large load transients. The large-signal compensator requires no extra calculations and has a low sensitivity to parameter variations. It utilizes a synchronization algorithm and the PID calculation results to obtain a bumpless mode transition and stable response to successive load transients. The IC occupying only 0. 26 mm 2 silicon area is implemented in a CMOS 0. 18 µm process and its minimum deviation response is verified with a single and dual-phase 12 V-to- 1. 8 V, 500 kHz 60 / 120 W buck converter.

40|$|Abstract—The {{greatest}} {{characteristic of}} soft-fingered ma-nipulation is its softness and flexibility during manipulating operations. In previous works, this intrinsic property had been quantitatively explained {{from the viewpoint}} of physical and mechanical perspective that the deformation energy induced by large elastic distortion automatically has a minimum equi-librium point. Hence this report first derive equations of motion of two-fingered soft finger robotic hand on the basis of energy-based analysis, and explain that an equilibrium point on a combined energy function exists even in the case of manipulat-ing motions by the hand. In this paper, the equilibrium point is called LMEEwC that is unfolded as Local Minimum of Elastic Energy with Constraints. Next, we show that the posture control of a rigid object grasped by the minimal degrees-of-freedom hand can easily be achieved by applying a <b>two-phased</b> <b>controller</b> associated with each joint angle of the hand, which is newly proposed in this report. This control scheme is constructed by two parts: a PD controller with respect to the finger angle and an integral controller with respect to the orientation of the grasped object. The characteristics of the control method of the latter part is that the desired joint angle of the hand is produced dynamically by the integral controller with respect to the object orientation. Finally, we clarify the effectiveness of the proposed control method {{in the case of the}} soft-fingered manipulation. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} a <b>two-phase</b> MPC <b>controller</b> is {{described}} {{that uses a}} non-quadratic terminal cost. The terminal cost is computed {{with respect to a}} predefined control strategy, and it can therefore be treated as {{the second phase of the}} method. Because the problem of optimizing the MPC objective is not a quadratic programming problem, medium-scale, gradient-based optimization methods are used for the MPC implementation. The method is efficient for problems which have a lot of soft constraints, because it avoids the introduction of slack variables. The stability of the MPC is established in the paper, and the method is compared with an unconstrained MPC in the grinding plant optimization problem. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In this paper, we introduce a method that synergistically combines an analytical pattern generator and a feedback controller frame, which are developed for the purpose of synthesizing dynamic quadrupedal trot-walking locomotion on flat and uneven surfaces. To begin with, the pattern generator analytically produces feasible and dynamically balanced joint motions in accordance with the desired trot-walking characteristics, with no empirical parameter tuning requirements. In concurrence with the pattern generation, a <b>two-phased</b> <b>controller</b> frame is constructed for closed-loop sensory feedback: (i) virtual admittance controller via force sensing, (ii) upper torso angular momentum regulation via gyro sensing. The former controller evaluates joint force errors and generates the corresponding joint displacement for a given set of virtual spring-damper couples. Together with the position constraints, these displacements are additionally fed-back to local servos for achieving compliant quadrupedal locomotion with which the position/force trade-off is addressed. The second controller, that is simultaneously used, evaluates the upper torso angular momentum rate change error using measured and reference orientation information. It then regulates the torso orientation in a dynamically consistent way as the rotational inertia is characterized. In order to validate the proposed methodology several experiments are conducted on both flat and uneven surfaces, using two robots with distinct properties; a ∼ 7 kg cat-sized electrically actuated quadruped (RoboCat- 1), and a ∼ 80 kg Alpine Ibex-sized hydraulically actuated quadruped (HyQ). As a result we demonstrate continuous, repetitive, compliant and dynamically balanced trot-walking cycles in real-robot experiments, adequately confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
