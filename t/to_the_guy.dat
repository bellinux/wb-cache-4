25|$|Serving as a watchtower for pirate raids, an {{administrative}} centre {{and a place}} of incarceration the castle saw next to no fighting. In 1191, it was taken by Richard the Lionheart during his campaign against the island's ruler Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus. Richard subsequently sold the island to the Knights Templar whose rule abruptly ended after a major revolt in Nicosia. Cyprus was thus resold <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guy</b> of Lusignan of the House of Lusignan. A period of peace ended {{with the death of}} Hugh I of Cyprus in 1218. A struggle over who should act as the kingdom's regent ensued, pitting the House of Ibelin with the local supporters of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick's arrival in Limassol in 1228 escalated the conflict into an open war. In 1229, the castle came under siege by the Ibelins, who bombarded it with trebuchets, reportedly destroying several buildings. The castle's garrison surrendered a year later when its commander Gauvain de Cheneche was killed by a crossbow bolt. Afterwards, the Lusignans continued their reign interrupted only by occasional palace coups. In 1373, Cyprus was invaded by the Republic of Genoa imprisoning the local nobility. According to Philip of Novara's chronicle prince John of Antioch managed to escape from Famagusta after disguising himself as the valet of his cook. John subsequently fled to Kantara, from which he organised a successful counter offensive that expelled the Genoese after the latter failed to capture Kantara.|$|E

Suddenly there's a voice from one of the stalls: 'I've got just the guys for you!'

Handler, who wrote eight drafts of the script for Sonnenfeld, was replaced by Robert Gordon in May 2003. Handler approved of the changes that were made to his original screenplay.

[...] Los Angeles Times critic Maragret Wappler deemed it an [...] "ode to breakups" [...] and noted that the protagonist asks her willful boyfriend to remember [...] "the good times" [...] of their relationship. In the chorus, she sings [...] "Don't surrender, surrender, surrender", before asking him to remember their [...] "promise of forever".

500|$|... "Boy Oh Boy" [...] is a 90s–influenced electropop {{song with}} dancehall and reggae elements. Regarding its style, Stan confessed, [...] "I want to release what I like {{and not to}} follow the trend and speed up the {{creation}} process just because {{something needs to be}} released. [...] is a mixture of [...] styles. I would say it is a more '90s track but with a contemporary feel". On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance." [...] According to her, the lyrical message is [...] " [...] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] and sometimes you just need to tell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy,</b> 'tell me that you love me'". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her.

500|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of F minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of B3 to the high-note of A5. Aside from Dupri's verses, Carey's longtime background singer Trey Lorenz makes a notable impression on the song, and earned credits for providing background vocals. Lyrically, the song is written in a female perspective, where they ask the man for their number at a club. In an interview with MTV News, Carey jokingly addressed the lyrics, claiming Dupri [...] "really {{wanted it to be}} coming from the girl, like 'can I get your number' <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy.</b> But in all honesty that would never be me!" [...] Aside from her signature vocals, Carey adopts a breathy rap for parts of the song, which read [...] "I got a pimp penthouse / With a sick hot tub / We can watch a flat screen / While the bubbles filling up." [...] According to Jozen Cummings from PopMatters, the lyrics and Carey's vocal switch make the song [...] "fun and comedic".|$|E

500|$|Bell and Zbyszewski worked {{together}} on Morse and Hunter's storyline for the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., preparing them to move over to the spin-off, with Bell explaining that it would set up Most Wanted by defining exactly who the characters are, such as Hunter and his lack of loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and to ideologies—"nothing specific about the show, it’s just who Hunter is." [...] Blood noted that Hunter is [...] "willing to ignore {{the rules and regulations}} to get the right thing done. Sometimes, Bobbi needs that kick up the backside to send her in that direction. By the same token, Hunter needs Bobbi's rationale sometimes to make sure he doesn't get in trouble again." [...] Bell added that for Hunter, [...] "laws are kind of suggestions, and if he’s with them he’ll follow them, and he’s always been much more a loyalist <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> in the trenches than to any ideology". Palicki remarked that the differences in the character's views and beliefs would be [...] "a big through line throughout the entire show", and that having Morse and Hunter work for Fortune would test both of their morals, with Hunter having [...] "a bit more experience with that, where the line to cross is a bit fluid. It might take Bobbi a bit more to adapt to that." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in early 1998. In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, {{he turned around and}} said he wanted to do his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back <b>to?</b> <b>The</b> <b>guy</b> who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
