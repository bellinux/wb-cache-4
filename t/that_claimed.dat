In the 1595 eruption, three distinct Plinian eruptions produced lahars <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> the lives of 636people. During the 1845 event, 1,000people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the Magdalena River.|$|E
5|$|Midge Hadley is {{a fictional}} doll {{character}} in the Barbie line of toys by Mattel that was first released in 1963. Midge was created, along with Skipper, to counteract criticism <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> Barbie was a sex symbol. She was marketed as Barbie's best friend.

40|$|There are {{at least}} two views on what relativism is. One is a view that relativism is a {{position}} <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> any positions are equally wrong or equally false as well as equally right or equally true. Another is a view that relativism is not the position <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> any positions are equally wrong or equally false but a position <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> any positions are equally right or equally true. This paper critically examines the two views and concludes the latter is a more proper concept of relativism according to critical rationalism, and the position <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> any positions are equally wrong or equally false is not relativism but relativizationism, which is compatible with criticism in Popper’s sense...|$|R

Although Np2O5 was initially subject to several studies <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> to produce it with mutually contradictory methods, it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to 300-350°C for 2–3 hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an ampoule at 180°C.|$|E

5|$|After Indian Independence, Mysore city {{remained}} {{as part of}} the Mysore State, now known as Karnataka. Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, then king of Mysore, was allowed to retain his titles and was nominated as the Rajapramukh (appointed governor) of the state. He died in September 1974 and was cremated in Mysore city. Over the years, Mysore became well known as a centre for tourism; the city remained largely peaceful, except for occasional riots related to the Kaveri river water dispute. Among the events that took place in Mysore and made national headlines were a fire at a television studio <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> 62 lives in 1989, and the sudden deaths of many animals at the Mysore Zoo.|$|E
5|$|Also around 1995, Kontsevich {{analyzed}} {{the results of}} Candelas, which gave a general formula for the problem of counting rational curves on a quintic threefold, and he reformulated these results as a precise mathematical conjecture. In 1996, Alexander Givental posted a paper <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> to prove this conjecture of Kontsevich. Initially, many mathematicians found this paper hard to understand, so there were doubts about its correctness. Subsequently, Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Shing-Tung Yau published an independent proof {{in a series of}} papers. Despite controversy over who had published the first proof, these papers are now collectively seen as providing a mathematical proof of the results originally obtained by physicists using mirror symmetry. In 2000, Kentaro Hori and Cumrun Vafa gave another physical proof of mirror symmetry based on T-duality.|$|E

40|$|Argentina's {{economic}} and institutional decline has long posed a conundrum to economists and social scientists. In particular, it challenges theories {{that seek to}} explain cross-country growth differences over time. Those theories <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> institutions have a first-order effect on growth cannot explain the persistent economic decadence {{of a country that}} in 1930 was among the most institutionally advanced in Latin America. Theories <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> that education and growth precede inclusive institutions face a similar problem, since Argentina {{was one of the most}} educationally advanced countries in Latin America. The same can be said of theories <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> social capital is the determinant factor that explains long-term growth. This paper emphasizes the key role played by recurrent cycles of populism in pushing the country into secular decadence and posits that, in Argentina, rising commodity prices have driven the cycles of populism...|$|R

5|$|Cannibal Holocaust {{achieved}} notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a {{great deal}} of controversy. After its premiere in Italy, it was ordered to be seized by a local magistrate, and Deodato was arrested on obscenity charges. He was later charged with making a snuff film due to rumors <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> some actors were killed on camera. Although Deodato was later cleared, the film was banned in Italy, Australia, and several other countries due to its portrayal of graphic brutality, sexual assault, and real depictions of violence toward animals. Some nations have since revoked the ban, though it is still upheld in several countries. Critics have suggested that the film is a commentary about civilized versus uncivilized society.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|Fluor {{has been}} working on the cleanup and {{shutdown}} of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s. In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste. By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project. After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries. In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} Test at The Oval, Bradman {{walked out to}} bat in Australia's first innings. He {{received}} a standing ovation from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition. His Test batting average stood at 101.39. Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies, Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced, was deceived by a googly, and bowled between bat and pad for a duck. An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99.94; if he had scored just four runs in his last innings, {{it would have been}} 100. A story developed over the years <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> Bradman missed the ball because of tears in his eyes, a claim Bradman denied {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E

5|$|The German {{destroyer}} Z4 Richard Beitzen {{was one of}} four Type 1934-class destroyers {{built for}} the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) during the mid-1930s. Completed in 1937, two years before the start of World War II, the ship spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939. At the beginning of World War II in September 1939, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was soon transferred to the Kattegat where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods. In late 1939 and early 1940, the ship laid two offensive minefields off the English coast <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> 17 merchant ships. Richard Beitzen was in reserve during the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year where she made several attacks on British shipping.|$|E

Accounts differ over subsequent events. The original report stated that Creswick was accidentally punched by Waterfall. This was contested in a letter from the Hallam players <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> that it was in retaliation for a blow thrown by Nathaniel Creswick. Whatever the cause the result was a general riot, which also involved a number of spectators, after which Waterfall was sent to guard the goal as punishment.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree <b>that</b> <b>claimed</b> the lives of 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended {{with the introduction of}} older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E
