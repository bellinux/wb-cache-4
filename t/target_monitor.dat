40|$|Abstract—Model Driven Development (MDD) {{has been}} slowly {{superseding}} traditional ways of developing embedded software {{in the recent}} decade. In line with the MDD, debugging Real-Time Embedded Software Systems (RTESS) and visualizing their behavior using models such as UML diagrams is becoming a reality. However, the existing MDD based debugging tools for RTESS are not applicable (require significant source code instrumentation, sophisticated debug interfaces, etc) for memorysize constrained RTESS. To address this, we discuss a modelbased debugging methodology for RTESS which aims at overcoming the aforementioned limitations. Using our approach, the target behavior can be visualized in real-time using UML sequence and timing diagrams. We illustrate our approach with a prototype and examples. Performance metrics such as the <b>target</b> <b>monitor</b> size and the instrumentation overhead are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{contributors}} to deaths caused by infectious disease. More than 30 countries have planned or started programmes to target malaria elimination, often with explicit support from international donors. The spatial distribution of malaria, at all levels of endemicity, is heterogeneous. Moreover, populations living in low-endemic settings where elimination efforts might be targeted are often spatially heterogeneous. Geospatial methods, therefore, can help design, <b>target,</b> <b>monitor,</b> and assess malaria elimination programmes. Rapid advances in technology and analytical methods have allowed the spatial prediction of malaria risk and the development of spatial decision support systems, which can enhance elimination programmes by enabling accurate and timely resource allocation. However, no framework exists for assessment of geospatial instruments. Research is needed to identify measurable indicators of elimination progress and to quantify the effect of geospatial methods in achievement of elimination outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Malaria is an {{important}} health burden in Zambia with proper diagnosis remaining {{as one of the}} biggest challenges. The need for reliable diagnostics is being addressed through the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). However, without sufficient laboratory amenities {{in many parts of the}} country, diagnosis often still relies on non-specific, clinical symptoms. In this study, geographical information systems were used to both visualize and analyze the spatial distribution and the risk factors related to the diagnosis of malaria. The monthly reported, district-level number of malaria cases from January 2009 to December 2014 were collected from the National Malaria Control Center (NMCC). Spatial statistics were used to reveal cluster tendencies that were subsequently linked to possible risk factors, using a non-spatial regression model. Significant, spatio-temporal clusters of malaria were spotted while the introduction of RDTs made the number of clinically diagnosed malaria cases decrease by 33 % from 2009 to 2014. The limited access to road network(s) was found to be associated with higher levels of malaria, which can be traced by the expansion of health promotion interventions by the NMCC, indicating enhanced diagnostic capability. The capacity of health facilities has been strengthened with the increased availability of proper diagnostic tools and through retraining of community health workers. To further enhance spatial decision support systems, a multifaceted approach is required to ensure mobilization and availability of human, infrastructural and technological resources. Surveillance based on standardized geospatial or other analytical methods should be used by program managers to design, <b>target,</b> <b>monitor</b> and assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of malaria diagnostic resources country-wide...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{transmission}} {{intensity is}} a crucial determinant of malarial disease burden and its measurement can help to define health priorities. Rapid, local estimates of transmission are required to focus resources better but current entomological and parasitological methods for estimating transmission intensity are limited in this respect. An alternative is determination of antimalarial antibody age-specific sero-prevalence to estimate sero-conversion rates (SCR), which {{have been shown to}} correlate with transmission intensity. This study evaluated SCR generated from samples collected from health facility attendees as a tool for a rapid assessment of malaria transmission intensity. The study was conducted in north east Tanzania. Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens MSP- 1 (19) and AMA- 1 were measured by indirect ELISA. Age-specific antibody prevalence was analysed using a catalytic conversion model based on maximum likelihood to generate SCR. A pilot study, conducted near Moshi, found SCRs for AMA- 1 were highly comparable between samples collected from individuals in a conventional cross-sectional survey and those collected from attendees at a local health facility. For the main study, 3885 individuals attending village health facilities in Korogwe and Same districts were recruited. Both malaria parasite prevalence and sero-positivity were higher in Korogwe than in Same. MSP- 1 (19) and AMA- 1 SCR rates for Korogwe villages ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 06 and 0. 07 to 0. 21 respectively. In Same district there was evidence of a recent reduction in transmission, with SCR among those born since 1998 [MSP- 1 (19) 0. 002 to 0. 008 and AMA- 1 0. 005 to 0. 014] being 5 to 10 fold lower than among individuals born prior to 1998 [MSP- 1 (19) 0. 02 to 0. 04 and AMA- 1 0. 04 to 0. 13]. Current health facility specific estimates of SCR showed good correlations with malaria incidence rates in infants in a contemporaneous clinical trial (MSP- 1 (19) r(2) = 0. 78, p< 0. 01 & AMA- 1 r(2) = 0. 91, p< 0. 001). SCRs generated from age-specific anti-malarial antibody prevalence data collected via health facility surveys were robust and credible. Analysis of SCR allowed detection of a recent drop in malaria transmission in line with recent data from other areas in the region. This health facility-based approach represents a potential tool for rapid assessment of recent trends in malaria transmission intensity, generating valuable data for local and national malaria control programs to <b>target,</b> <b>monitor</b> and evaluate their control strategies...|$|E

40|$|Violence {{and alcohol}} place huge burdens on public health, {{affecting}} individuals, widersociety and public services. Many of the harms associated with violence and alcohol occur in nightlife settings and preventing these harms {{is a priority}} for the UK government. Increasingly, a public health approach to prevention is evident in both national and localpolicies and strategies. The use of data and evidence {{to understand the nature}} of the problem and to inform, <b>target,</b> <b>monitor</b> and evaluate preventive activities is fundamental to this approach. This thesis and supporting publications illustrate how my research has supported the public health approach to the prevention of violence and alcohol-related harms in nightlife and other settings. Health data, such as emergency department (ED) attendance data, has a key role to play in the public health approach to prevention. The submitted articles illustrate how I have developed the use of ED data through establishing an injury surveillance system to inform prevention policies, strategies and practice at local and national levels. My analyses have been used to: identify the extent of alcohol-related harms; inform a nightlife management strategy; target prevention activity in nightlife areas where harms were more prevalent; and monitor trends in violence and alcohol-related harms over time. Further, my work has informed national policy; the collection of enhanced ED data on the circumstances of an assault is now being promoted by the UK Government. Whilst routine data sources such as ED data can provide a vast array of intelligence onnightlife violence and alcohol-related harms they do not provide the level of detail necessary to illustrate patterns of alcohol consumption during a night out, individuals’ experience of harms that do not come to the attention of authorities, or the wide range of risk and protective factors associated with these harms. Primary research is crucial to developing this knowledge. Thus, through studies conducted in England and cross-nationally, my research has identified that nightlife settings are the scenes of excessive alcohol consumption with preloading a common feature. Subsequently, many nightlife patrons enter nightlife areas already drunk. Over-serving of alcohol to drunks is common. A range of harms are experienced by nightlife patrons including verbal and physical aggression, sexual molestation and excessive drunkenness. Both individual and environmental (i. e. venue) factors can increase the risks of nightlife patron involvement in alcohol-related harms. In the UK, the prevention of harms in nightlife settings has primarily focused on developing safe nightlife environments. Few interventions have been developed that aim to tackle the culture of drunkenness, risky drinking behaviours (e. g. preloading) and the over service of alcohol to drunks that have been evidenced in my studies. With the links between alcohol and harms, such as violence, being well established, addressing the culture of drunkenness within nightlife settings has to be a key public health priority. Both primary research and analyses of routine data sources can support this approach by identifying at-risk communities where primary prevention interventions should best be targeted...|$|E

Identifying good sequences of decisions is particularly challenging when good control performance requires planning multiple steps into the future in domains with many states.

PBD leverages a novel method for calculating the posterior distribution over beliefs that result after a sequence of actions is taken, given the set of observation sequences that could be received during this process.
