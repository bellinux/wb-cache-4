Wills portrayed Graham and Macdonnell on one of the cigarette cards printed to commemorate the centenary of Waterloo. Since then, many authors of fiction concerning Waterloo have recreated the events at the gate, and even if they include their own fictional heroes they attribute the closing of the gate to Macdonnell and Graham.|$|E

However, she was not pleased with the make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The make-up team also needed to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E

5|$|Although Henry {{has never}} been officially canonized, he has been {{referred}} to as a saint since as early as 1296 according to a papal document of the time, and continues to be called as such today as well. On the basis of the traditional accounts of Henry's death, his recognition as saint took place prior to the founding of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints and the official canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church. Henry is currently commemorated on January 19 on the calendar of commemorations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. January 19 is also Henry's name day in Sweden and Finland. He continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> a local observance in the Catholic Church of Finland, where the cathedral church is dedicated to Henry's memory. The cathedral was consecrated in 1860 and is headed by fr. Marco Pasinato.|$|E
5|$|Sharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She {{tells them}} both {{she will not}} kill herself, and after {{settling}} old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). She decides she wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, and takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy {{was the one who}} sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle of Melrose reports Clement's death {{under the}} year 1258. Clement's legacy was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> the restorer {{of the diocese}} of Dunblane and the builder of its cathedral. Thus for future generations, Clement became the father-figure of the see. Clement was later commemorated as a saint, {{though there is no}} record of formal canonisation. He was commemorated on 19 March, meaning that was almost {{certainly}} believed to have been the date of his death. Clement's death was also noted by Walter Bower, a Lowland Scottish historian writing in the 1440s, who included the following obituary: Clement bishop of Dunblane died, that outstanding member of the Order of Preachers, a man most eloquent in translating various tongues, powerful in speech and action in the sight of God and of men. He found the cathedral church of his diocese reduced by the neglect of his predecessors to such a state of decay that the divine offices were celebrated in it scarcely three times a week, as if it were some rural chapel. He built it up to be a hallowed sanctuary, enriched it with lands and possessions, and increased its prestige by adding prebends and canonries. Such flattering sentiments had even been expressed during Clement's lifetime. In 1250, the General Chapter of the Dominican Order met in London, and decreed that: we grant to Friar Clement of our Order, a bishop of Scotland, after his death, one mass throughout the Order by every friar whomsoever is a priest. Although there survives a sermon almost certainly written by him, Clement was also credited with being a prolific translator and writing four books (including a hagiography of St Dominic), all of which are now lost.|$|E

25|$|It ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> <b>as</b> {{a comment}} on the {{unfavourable}} description by Jean de La Bruyère, that La Fontaine was a special friend and ally of Benserade, La Bruyere's chief literary enemy. But after all deductions much will remain, especially when it is remembered {{that one of the}} chief authorities for these anecdotes is Louis Racine, a man who possessed intelligence and moral worth, and who received them from his father, La Fontaine's attached friend for more than thirty years. Perhaps the best worth recording of all these stories is one of the Vieux Colombier quartet, which tells how Molière, while Racine and Boileau were exercising their wits upon le bonhomme or le bon (by both which titles La Fontaine was familiarly known), remarked to a bystander, Nos beaux esprits ont beau faire, ils n'effaceront pas le bonhomme. They have not.|$|E
