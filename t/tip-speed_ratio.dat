The instantaneous flow patterns observed upon the visualization pictures correspond well to the measured velocity distributions, vorticity contours and velocity magnitude maps. It is found that two pairs of mushroom-type vortices are shed from the blade during a rotation of the rotor, {{which is due to}} the dynamic stall phenomenon. These stall vortices are produced by the flow separation over the suction side of the blade and the formation of roll-up vortices from the pressure side. The stall vortices at small incidence angles advance to the returning blade side, while those at large incidence angles grow along the moving blade and interact with flow near the blade.

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics {{is thought}} to provide {{in the near future}} an {{essential}} contribution to the development of Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines. The unsteady flow past rotating blades is, however, a challenging application for a numerical simulation and some critical issues have not been settled yet. In particular, if some studies in the literature report detailed analyses on the assessment of the computational model, there is still no adequate convergence on the requirements in terms of spatial and temporal discretizations. In the present study, a multivariate sensitivity analysis was first carried out on a specific case study at different <b>tip-speed</b> <b>ratios</b> in order to define the optimal mesh and timestep sizes needed for an accurate simulation. Once full insensitivity had been reached, the spatial and temporal requirements needed to properly describe the flow phenomena were related to two dimensionless numbers, one for each domain, which can be used to assess the suitability of the selected settings for each specific simulation. The simulations revealed that the spatial requirements must be selected in order to ensure an accurate description of velocity gradients in the near-blade region. To this purpose, a Grid-Reduced form of vorticity is proposed as the best indicator for the quality of the mesh refinement. It is also shown that the temporal requirements are made stricter at low <b>tip-speed</b> <b>ratios</b> by the need of correctly describing the vortices detaching from the blades in the upwind region. To do so, proper thresholds for the Courant Number are highlighted in the study...|$|R

The influence of foil asymmetry on the aerodynamic coefficients is analysed by subjecting a NACA 4412 airfoil to the same flow and pitching motion conditions.

Most traditional studies have analyzed the turbine’s self-starting capability using the experimental and numerical data of the forced rotation. A 2 D numerical model based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS-Fluent was developed to simulate the self-starting process of the rotor at constant incident water-flow velocities. The vertical-axis turbine (VAT) rotor is driven directly by the resultant torque generated by the water flow and system loads, including the friction and reverse loads of the generator. It is found that the incident flow velocity and the moment of inertia of the rotor have little effect on the averaged values of <b>tip-speed</b> <b>ratios</b> in the equilibrium stage under no-load conditions. In the system load calculations, four modes of the self-starting were found: stable equilibrium mode, unstable equilibrium mode, switch mode and halt mode.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study was}} made of the effects of blade cutout on the power required by a sample helicopter rotor traveling at tip-speed ratios of 0. 3, 0. 4, and 0. 5. The amount of cutout varied from 0 to 0. 5 of the rotor radius and the calculations were carried out for a thrust coefficient-solidity ratio of 0. 04. In these calculations the blade within the cutout radius was assumed to have zero chord. The effect of such cutout on profile-drag power ranged from almost no effect at a <b>tip-speed</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 3 to as much as a 60 percent reduction at a <b>tip-speed</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 5. Optimum cutout was about 0. 3 of the rotor radius. Part of the large power reduction at a <b>tip-speed</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 5 resulted from a reduction in tip-region stall, brought about by cutout. For tip-speed ratios greater than 0. 3, cutout also effected {{a significant increase in the}} ability of the rotor to overcome helicopter parasite drag. It is thus seen that the adverse trends (at high tip-speed ratios) indicated by the uniform-chord theoretical charts are caused in large measure by the center portion of the rotor. The extent to which a modified-design rotor can actually be made more efficient at high speeds than a uniform-chord rotor will depend in practice on the degree of success in minimizing the blade plan form near the center and on special modifications in center-section profiles.

We address high-performance diffusers, and investigate the design requirements for a DAWT rotor to efficiently convert the available energy to shaft energy. Several factors can induce wake stall scenarios causing significant energy loss. The causality between these stall mechanisms and earlier DAWT failures is discussed. First, a swirled actuator disk CFD code is validated through comparison with results from a far wake swirl corrected blade-element momentum (BEM) model, and horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) reference results.
