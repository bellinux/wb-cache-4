5|$|Cranmer {{was born}} in 1489 in Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England. His parents, Thomas and Agnes (née Hatfield) Cranmer, were of modest wealth and were not members of the aristocracy. Their oldest son, John, {{inherited}} the family estate, whereas Thomas {{and his younger brother}} Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career. Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer's early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At the age of fourteen, two years {{after the death of his}} father, he was sent to the newly created Jesus College, Cambridge. It <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> surprisingly long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following a curriculum of logic, classical literature and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval scholastic books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master's degree he took a different course of study, concentrating on the humanists, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples and Erasmus. This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing the course in three years. Shortly after receiving his Master of Arts degree in 1515, he was elected to a Fellowship of Jesus College.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{called the}} late 1830s a “period of…disappointment.” Citing “home; children; & a good {{professional}} sphere,” {{he wrote in}} his journal that “All fail me, & all equally.” Increasing controversies in his career culminated in a break with orthodoxy in the early 1840s. The fallout from these events affected him deeply, and it <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> few years to land on his feet and move forward.|$|E
25|$|Shocked by this {{demonstration}} of communist unity, Daoud ordered {{the arrest of}} the PDPA leaders, but he reacted too slowly. It <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> week to arrest Taraki, Karmal managed to escape to the USSR, and Amin was merely placed under house arrest. According to PDPA documents, Amin sent complete orders for the coup from his home while it was under armed guard using his family as messengers.|$|E

25|$|Nolan {{accepted}} the pass as real but his writings show his frustration that Parker was competing {{for his own}} mission. Cooper wrote that Nolan swore and let loose {{a long series of}} invective frustration at everyone who seemed to be against 'his' mission. It <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> while to calm down. He then asked Parker questions where the Comanche raiders were and where they were headed. Parker glanced toward one direction and pointed off in a different direction while Tafoya translated. Parker never used English with Nolan even though he spoke it well.|$|E
25|$|Tony's second {{marriage}} {{was not a}} happy one and Hannah soon lost all tolerance for her fun-loving husband. She began to look down upon his less than lucrative job as a carpenter and his inability to provide {{for her and her}} children. They separated in 1985, after which Tony bought a house in disuse at Number 3 Albert Square and set about making it habitable, leaving Hannah to move in with another man. Kelvin soon joined Tony on the square, although it <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> lot to persuade his wife to allow him custody of their son.|$|E
25|$|After five {{successful}} {{seasons in}} Mexico, Sánchez {{drew the attention}} of several European sides, including that of English club Arsenal, though eventually signing with Spanish side Atlético Madrid in 1981. It <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> while to find his feet in La Liga, only managing twenty league appearances and scoring eight goals in his first season, but by the 1984–85 season he was scoring regularly with a team that won the Copa del Rey, {{finished second in the}} league and won the Spanish Super Copa. That year, Sánchez won his first Pichichi trophy for being the most prolific scorer in the league, scoring 19 goals.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Timberry won't be long,' said Mr Crummles. 'He {{played the}} {{audience}} out tonight. He does a faithful {{black in the}} last piece, and it <b>takes</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> little longer to wash himself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. But he's very obstinate {{about some}} things. You see, {{he thinks the}} whole thing has made him look ridiculous, and it will <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> long time to forgive you for that." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Simpsons writer Mike Reiss, Stern was a [...] "pleasure" [...] to {{work with}} and it only <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> few minutes to record his lines. Stern's younger brother David M. Stern worked as a writer on both The Simpsons and The Wonder Years, so he helped the writers get the idioms and the wording of the parody right.|$|E
500|$|Writer Edgar Lee Masters, who {{witnessed}} Bryan's speech, remembered, [...] "Suddenly I {{saw a man}} spring up from his seat among the delegates and with the agility and swiftness of an eager boxer hurry to the speaker's rostrum. [...] He was slim, tall, pale, raven-haired, beaked of nose." [...] The Nebraska delegation waved red handkerchiefs as Bryan progressed to the podium; he wore an alpaca sack suit more typical of Lincoln and the West than of Chicago. [...] There was loud cheering as Bryan stood at the lectern; it <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> full minute to gain silence. [...] He began: ...|$|E
500|$|After the Communist Party of China won the Civil War and {{established}} the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wu returned to Beijing. Like many intellectuals at the time, he held {{high hopes for}} the new People's Republic which finally restored peace in a united China after decades of war and division. He wanted to return to writing plays, but was assigned {{by the government to}} direct Song of the Red Flag, a film about women textile workers. As he had no experience with factory life, it <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> year to finish the film, which he considered a [...] "worthless failure." [...] He and Lü En divorced amicably in 1950, due to differences in personality and interests.|$|E

500|$|The {{popular music}} video for [...] "The Scientist" [...] was notable for its {{distinctive}} reverse narrative, which employed reverse video. The same concept {{had been previously}} used for Spike Jonze's 1995 music video for The Pharcyde's [...] "Drop." [...] The reverse video style had first been seen in 1989 for the video for the song [...] "The Second Summer of Love" [...] by Scottish band Danny Wilson. In order for Martin {{to appear to be}} singing the lyrics in the reversed footage, he had to learn to sing the song backwards, which <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> month. The video was filmed at various locations, including London and at Bourne Woods in Surrey, before the first leg of the A Rush of Blood to the Head tour. It was directed by Jamie Thraves. The video was shot between 30 September – 3 October 2002, premiering on 14 October.|$|E
500|$|Balthier and his companion, Fran, {{prefer to}} remain outside {{the war between}} the kingdoms of Ivalice. However, their attempt to steal the Goddess's Magicite—later {{revealed}} to be the Dusk Shard—from the Dalmascan Royal Palace goes bad; Vaan steals it first, and, caught in the fray of a rebel assault against the Imperial Palace, Balthier and Fran find themselves embroiled in the conflict against Archadia. Born as , he {{is the son of}} Dr. Cid (Cidolfus Demen Bunansa), though he grew weary of his father's madness and obsession with nethicite. Although Cid had made him an Imperial Judge, Ffamran eventually decided to cut his ties with his father and his role as a judge, becoming a sky pirate under a new name. With this new career change, Balthier amounted a sizable bounty on his head, attracting the attention of bounty hunters such as Ba'Gamnan. Unfortunately for Balthier, it <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> while to realize he'd been following his father in pursuing nethicite while he served in the resistance. Though he makes peace with his father prior to his death, Balthier goes with the group to destroy the Sky Fortress Bahamut as penance for his father's deeds. Balthier claims to be the [...] "leading man" [...] of the story many times throughout the game, and insists that this status makes him invincible. Though never blatantly said a romantic relationship between Fran and Balthier is heavily suggested. During the final fight on the Sky Fortress Bahamut, Fran is badly injured and Balthier refuses to abandon her. While cradling her in his arms the ship crashes with them inside. They remain out of contact until they retrieve the Strahl back from Vaan and Penelo a year later, leaving a note for the new Queen Ashe which held her wedding ring that she used to purchase his services.|$|E
2500|$|The trio {{recorded}} {{their first}} single [...] "Old Maid in the Garrett"/"The Derby Ram" [...] for Pye Records at Eamonn Andrews Studios {{in the spring}} of 1967. The week the single was in the Irish charts, Dolan departed for Israel and the Six-Day War [...] "but it <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> year to get down there", and was replaced by Terry Woods [...] later of Steeleye Span and The Pogues.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps he did," [...] Francis said; [...] "but {{he would}} have been a hundred miles further north by daybreak, and it would have <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> couple of days to get back to where we were lying." ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>takes</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} to say this, and few but an {{experienced}} and attentive listener could hear, or, hearing, understand <b>him.</b> After <b>a</b> short relapse into sleep or stupor, he makes, of a sudden, a strong effort {{to get out of}} bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> day's {{ride from}} my country," [...] said the sheik, firmly, [...] "and {{some of my}} {{children}} shall follow you {{to see that you}} do not disobey me--otherwise there may be two dead Frenchmen in the desert." ...|$|R
2500|$|It <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> year {{to design}} the door handles and another {{to design the}} radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150kg, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein, said there is barely {{anything}} comparable {{in the history of}} interior design: [...] "It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{discovering}} a mutual interest in racing, McQueen and Great Escape co-star James Garner became good friends. Garner lived downhill from McQueen, who recalled: [...] "I {{could see that}} Jim was neat around his place. Flowers trimmed, no papers in the yard... grass always cut. So to piss him off, I'd start lobbing empty beer cans down the hill into his driveway. He'd have his drive all spic 'n' span {{when he left the}} house, then get home to find all these empty cans. <b>Took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> long time to figure out it was me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robbie McEwen was {{not happy}} again with Óscar Freire among this group, but {{when he tried to}} start up the chase again, almost the whole peloton was mad at him as they had been now riding at a huge pace for over 100 kilometres, just one day after a heavy {{mountain}} stage. It <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> few kilometres to settle down and give in and so the group did get away. [...] was now maintaining a moderate pace just to keep the riders within a reasonable distance but without wasting too much energy. Most riders were happy to catch a break and at that time it was almost sure one of the 4 leaders was going to win the stage.|$|E
60|$|But he {{knew that}} his mind was clear. It did not <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> moment to realize from the feel of his body {{and the fact that}} he could not lift his hand that he had been {{prostrate}} a long time.|$|R

2500|$|Wiggins entered drug rehab in 1985 and {{was traded}} {{later in the}} season to the Baltimore Orioles, {{resulting}} in Gwynn seeing fewer fastballs and more breaking balls. Gwynn said it <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> month to realize the change in opponents' strategy, and a while to adjust. His average was under [...]300 into June, when he got hot but then sprained his wrist on June 27 in a collision with Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia. Still, Gwynn was named with seven other Padres to the 1985 All-Star Game. San Diego was leading the NL West at the time, but finished the season in third place. After Gwynn's wrist healed, he hit [...]339 after the start of August and finished the season with the fourth-highest average in the NL (.317). Without an adequate replacement for Wiggins batting leadoff, his RBIs fell to 46.|$|E
2500|$|The eighteenth track [...] "Where I Come From" [...] is a posse {{cut that}} {{features}} {{the members of}} his crew, which includes three of his family members. The song is an opportunity for them to showcase themselves on Papoose's debut album as they have been previously featured on his mixtapes. The next song [...] "R.I.P." [...] is Papoose's dedication to all the people he knew who have died. On February 1, 2013 Papoose premiered a preview of a sequel to his break out hit [...] "Alphabetical Slaughter" [...] on Tim Westwood TV. At the end of the original Papoose started rhyming the alphabet backwards before DJ Kay Slay [...] "stops the track", which led to the anticipation for a sequel to the song. However Papoose wanted to save it for his debut album. He raps words beginning with Z to A while rhyming it all together through the record. He said the record <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> couple months for him to write.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former driver Mario Andretti, Hamilton {{said he was}} [...] "grateful" [...] {{to be at the}} front of the field and that it was [...] "such a privilege" [...] for his country to be represented and praised his car. Rosberg revealed it <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> while to find a rhythm he liked but had only found it when he was passed by Hamilton but had [...] "a great time". Ricciardo thanked his team for providing him with a car package which allowed him to contend for a podium position and was [...] "really happy" [...] to secure third place. He stated that [...] "we all had a great weekend" [...] and that his race was not [...] "too boring". In the later press conference, Hamilton said upon passing Rosberg, he controlled the pace by managing tyre wear, and that while locking his brakes persisted, it did not hinder him. Rosberg stated there were no lasting problems after driving over the track's kerbing but was fully committed to pressuring his teammate in an attempt to draw closer to him but that it was not possible to overtake him. Ricciardo felt his team used an ideal strategy to get ahead of the Williams cars and believed he was at fault for his slow start off the line although he would rectify that problem before the season's next race.|$|E
