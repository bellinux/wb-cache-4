[...] IBetween 550 and 350 BCE, Greek stallholders clustered together according to the type of goods carried - fish-sellers were in one place, clothing in another and sellers of more expensive goods such as perfumes, bottles and jars were located in a separate building. [...] The Greeks organised trade into separate zones, all located near the city centre and known as stoa. A freestanding colonnade with a covered walkway, the stoa was both a place of commerce and a public promenade, situated within or adjacent to the agora. [...] At the market-place (agorai) in Athens, officials were employed by the government to oversee weights, measures, and coinage to ensure that the people were not cheated in market place transactions. The difficult, rocky and mountainous terrain in Greece made it difficult for producers to transport goods or surpluses to local markets, giving rise to a specialised <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailer</b> (kapeloi) who operated as an intermediary purchasing produce from farmers and transporting it over short distances to the city markets.|$|E

The article describes the activities that shoppers perform in the fitting rooms in detail, as well as the contextual and intervening conditions of such activities. According to the authors, in the fitting rooms in SPA stores, shoppers engage in activities beyond just checking out the fit of the selected garments. The fitting rooms liberate shoppers to experiment with the abundant products, enjoying different images the garments allow them to create, and also obtain fashion information from observing other shoppers in line.|$|E
40|$|Planned {{shopping}} malls usually {{have one or}} more department stores (anchor stores) and multiple specialized retail stores in each commodity category. This paper presents a model of {{shopping malls}} in which {{these two types of}} stores sell noncomplementary commodities. If anchor stores sell standard (riskless yet low-value) commodities and retail stores sell specialized (high variance yet high expected value) commodities, then each type of store may benefit from collocating with the other, even though the stores sell substitutable products. The underlying intuition is that the presence of each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailer</b> enhances consumer traffic at the shopping mall, which benefits the retailer or retailers of the other type. Under some parametric restrictions, the value of this increased traffic more than offsets the loss in markups due to competition from additional sellers at the mall. In this case, it is in a land developer's interest to rent retail space in the mall to both types of retailers. A Tiebout-like argument explains the striking similarity in the composition of stores in planned shopping malls...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess whether the image of a {{retailer}} - beyond the distinct contributions of the website and the stores - is improved by the perceived congruence of its channels, and for what types of customers. An online survey was conducted on 1, 478 customers taken from the behavioural databases of a major French multichannel retailer. Structural modelling and one-way ANOVA were used to test the working hypotheses. Congruent channels improve retailer image even when these channels have a less good image. However, channel congruence cannot be elevated to a universal guiding principle as it only affects multichannel and online buyers, with no detrimental impact on retailer image. The study is mainly limited by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailer</b> studied, and the choice of an online questionnaire, limiting the representativeness of the offline purchasers. In order to improve its image, a multichannel retailer must seek maximum congruence of its website and stores. Congruent channels lead to benefits for the retailer even when they are poorly valued by consumers. Despite a broad theoretical consensus, this is the first study to demonstrate empirically that website and store congruence improves retailer image, and not only online purchase intentions. It is also one of the first published researches that uses congruence as a mediating variable...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{the context}} of the {{nutrition}} transition and associated changes in the food retail sector, to examine the socio-economic characteristics and motivations of shoppers using different retail formats (large supermarkets (LSM), medium-sized supermarkets (MSM) or traditional outlets) in Tunisia. Design: Cross-sectional survey (2006). Socio-economic status, type of food retailer and motivations data were collected during house visits. Associations between socio-economic factors and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailer</b> were assessed by multinomial regression; correspondence analysis was used to analyse declared motivations. Setting: Peri-urban area around Tunis, Tunisia, North Africa. Subjects: Clustered random sample of 724 households. Results: One-third of the households used LSM, two-thirds used either type of supermarket, but less than 5 % used supermarkets only. Those who shopped for food at supermarkets were of higher socio-economic status; those who used LSM were much wealthier, more often had a steady income or owned a credit card, while MSM users were more urban and had a higher level of education. Most households still frequently used traditional outlets, mostly their neighbourhood grocer. Reasons given for shopping at the different retailers were most markedly leisure for LSM, while for the neighbourhood grocer the reasons were fidelity, proximity and availability of credit (the latter even more for lower-income customers). Conclusions: The results pertain to the transition in food shopping practices in a south Mediterranean country; they should be considered in {{the context of}} growing inequalities in health linked to the nutritional transition, as they differentiate use and motivations for the choice of supermarkets v. traditional food retailers according to socio-economic status.

40|$|The Spanish {{fruit and}} {{vegetables}} sector is both diverse and fragmented, comprising many different players whose produce varies according to its geographical origin. However, these players tend to converge in the latter stages of the distribution process of their products. Therefore, {{for the purpose of}} analysis it is advisable to group homogeneous products and similar characteristics, which usually belong to particular areas, since the type of supply chain depends on the destination of the goods. In Spain, supply chains are highly adapted to the type of market to which they belong and consequently to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailer</b> {{at the end of the}} supply chain. All too often producers commercialize their products in total ignorance of the channel that they will follow to consumers. This hinders the necessary vertical coordination and collaboration within the channel to optimize its function, particularly as regards quality management and sanitary monitoring of the products. The principal scenarios in which Spanish distribution channels play a major role are the EU, domestic and local markets. The typical outlets corresponding to these areas of the retail market would be the Spanish and European mass distribution self-service stores, the small specialized warehouse, and street markets or street vending. Exports via the supply chain to Europe have constituted by far the largest change this sector has undergone. Both the European channels and those which continue to supply domestic markets, which have also undergone significant customization, form the basic structure of the current {{fruit and vegetables}} distribution sector in Spain. In essence, this distribution network system is strongly oriented to exports, innovation and the implementation of new technologies. The simplest descriptions of the fruit and vegetables distribution system in Spain describe it as: i) a "long channel” involving numerous intermediaries; and ii) a "short channel" arising from changes in both productive and commercialization stages. In both cases, the effects on quality management can vary greatly, influencing the food safety of the product reaching consumers.

40|$|Since 2000, Transport Department {{has been}} {{implementing}} pedestrian schemes in Hong Kong {{to provide a}} comfortable environment for pedestrians. Many {{studies have indicated that}} the retail environment in pedestrian streets would be enhanced. This study was conducted to understand the theoretical concepts about the effects of pedestrian streets to retailing. The distribution <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> in pedestrian streets and the nearby streets was investigated and the reasons and possible effects of the above findings were also examined. Field survey on business inventory in Mong Kok, Causweay Bay and Sheung Shui was conducted. Descriptive statistics was then used to explain the results and chi-square test was devoted to examining whether <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> depend on street types. This study showed that <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> depend on street types and provided evidence to support pervious researches that specific retailers including chain stores, merchandise retailing or clothing, jewellery and watches shops tended to located in pedestrian streets while some businesses including independent shops or shops selling low-end products were not. The impacts of implementing pedestrian schemes on the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> were discussed. Since more visitors are willing to shop in pedestrian streets due to pleasant environment, retail turnover would usually increase and some investors may want to open shops in the streets to make profits. As a result, property owners would feel more confident to increase the rent of shop to gain more money as the demand of the limited rental street space increases. Those privileged businesses, which can afford higher rent, can open shops in pedestrian streets so the portion of underprivileged businesses in these streets is lower due to unaffordable rent. The study also indicated few more reasons to explain the distribution <b>of</b> retailers’ <b>types.</b> Accessibility is one the factors that affect the attractiveness of pedestrian streets, which also impact the retailers’ types. National economic trend and local factors would increase the portion of specific shops while market economy policy from the Government encourage distributing <b>of</b> retailers’ <b>types</b> using market principle. For the economic implications, privileged businesses would dominate pedestrian streets and affect economic diversity and businesses in pedestrian streets would be affected by economic trend. Moreover, property owners can make more money as rents go up. For social implications, products available in pedestrian streets become tourists-oriented and may not meet the local needs and local identity would gradually disappear. Finally, the study suggested the Government could provide space for independent retailers to continue their businesses and encourage underprivileged businesses to enhance their competiveness. Besides, in the policy point of view, the Government should assess the impacts on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> before implementing pedestrian schemes. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis in Greece has affected almost all sectors of economy and {{the great majority of}} households. Its effects in trade and commerce activities are visible by the obvious transformation of down-town Athens city centre. This transformation includes a great number of closing business and/or relocation of others. The work presented in this paper is part of a wider project aiming to shed some light on the underlying mechanisms which affect business location, business closure and opening in the main commercial centre of Athens, at a time that it is under huge economic strain. As a starting point in this project, this paper makes use of a unique geographically coded database, collated through primary research by the authors and containing information on the specific location and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailer</b> closures in crisis-stricken downtown Athens between 2011 - 2013, to provide an exploratory analysis of the emerging spatial and temporal patterns of business closure across the city centre. This, predominantly descriptive, analysis allows us to identify and discuss a number of patterns and hypotheses concerning the dynamics and determinants of retail closures during the {{economic crisis}}, revisiting relevant theories drawn from the wider literature on urban and location economics. In particular, we seek to analyse questions such as: what can we learn from the observed geography/patterns of closures about the underlying market functioning (or non-functioning?) What kind of shops survive in the crisis? Does agglomeration (still) matter? What are the locational (and co-location) characteristics that affect business survival and death? What kind of shops survive (in terms of types of activity, types of ownership, size of business, consumer catchment areas etc) ? To what extent do closures of particular types of shops (e. g. a clothes retail shop) and businesses (e. g. a bank branch) increase the chances of closures of other types of shops (e. g. cafes, restaurants) ? Does geographical location and type (e. g., corner shop versus middle-of-the-road shop, high-street shop versus neighbourhood shop etc.) matter and how? These kinds of questions are explored in this paper using appropriate data geovisualisation and statistical methods and in this way forming a background for the subsequent confirmatory analysis and hypothesis testing to be conducted in future work on the project...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: to {{identify}} levels of uptake of performance measurement by small and medium-sized retail companies selling goods online, and to determine key factors, which could explain any variation in use of performance indicators. The study is designed to explore these issues by this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailer</b> as currently understanding is fairly limited. Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative mail questionnaire was used to survey UK retailers selling goods online. The questionnaire examined the uptake of performance measurement in conjunction with the business profile of each of the 252 responding companies. Findings – The results show great variation in levels and extent of uptake of performance measurement by online retailers in the UK. Company profile variables: size and operating format help to account for the variation in the number of indicators measured. Research limitations/implications – The sample frame has some limitations insofar as the study only focused on small and medium-sized retailers in the UK selling tangible goods. Future research could be extended to include larger and pan-European retailers selling both tangible and intangible goods. Furthermore, the data collection was cross-sectional and, whilst this approach was important at this stage in order to provide a picture of how performance measurement is being applied at a given point in time, a longitudinal study would enable greater analysis of strategic impact of performance measurement. Practical implications – Currently, retailers' performance measurement activities mainly focus on gathering data using financial and Website functionality indicators. From a strategic planning perspective, this could suggest that retailers are adopting a short-term pragmatic approach towards retailing online. The implications are that performance measurement is being used as a means to ensure that Internet retailing is not having a detrimental effect on business performance rather than driving longer-term strategy development. Originality/value – The principal contributions of this paper are that it has provided insight into the current status of performance measurement amongst UK Internet retailers and has identified a useful checklist of performance indicators which retailers can apply to gain a comprehensive view of business performance online. performance measurement in conjunction with the business profile of each of the 252 responding companies.

40|$|ABSTRACT Second-hand {{clothing}} {{has been}} traded since the Renaissance era, and widely consumed {{by a majority}} of the populace. However, very few studies concerning second-hand retailing and consumer preferences have been conducted, especially in the United States. The present study was conducted to understand second-hand retailers 2 ̆ 7 current marketing practices, sourcing strategies, and resources that lead to their business success. Moreover, unique features and definitions <b>of</b> three specialized <b>types</b> <b>of</b> second-hand <b>retailers</b> (e. g., vintage stores, consignment stores, and thrift stores) were discussed through a typology. Resource-based theory (RBT) (Barney, 1991) and the Four Experiential Realms (4 Es) (Pine 2 ̆ 6 Gilmore, 1999) were used to frame the qualitative study. Owner-managers (N= 13) <b>of</b> three specialized <b>types</b> <b>of</b> second-hand retail stores (vintage, consignment, and charity/thrift) in the Midwestern U. S. were recruited for the study. To obtain candid responses from participants, an open-ended, semi-structured questionnaire was used. A grounded theory approach using open coding and axial coding was employed for data analysis and interpretation. Four major themes were identified from the results of this study: business background and motivations, resources generated for second-hand retail business, marketing and management plans, and definition of second-hand retailing. Concerning the theme, definition <b>of</b> second-hand <b>retailers,</b> each specialized <b>type</b> <b>of</b> second-hand <b>retailer</b> (e. g., vintage, consignment, and thrift stores) was defined and classified by contrasting similarities and differences among formats. Unique features <b>of</b> each specialized <b>type</b> <b>of</b> second-hand <b>retailer</b> were also discussed. Although all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> second-hand <b>retailers</b> are similar in the sense of dealing with used items, this study revealed that each possesses distinctive characteristics. Second-hand retailers 2 ̆ 7 business resources that lead to their business success were discussed within the theme, resources generated for second-hand retail business. A majority of second-hand businesses are operated by owning one or two physical stores. Critical resources possessed by thrift stores are balers, used for baling unsold clothes and sending them to trading companies. Owner-managers were very supportive to assist their neighboring communities, and made efforts to maintain network relationships with counselors and business partners. Some vintage stores often sold exclusive items through alternative retail channels, such as websites, movie productions, and social connections. Finally, diverse <b>types</b> <b>of</b> sourcing methods and suppliers for each specialized <b>type</b> <b>of</b> second-hand <b>retailer</b> were discussed. Second-hand retailers 2 ̆ 7 marketing and management plans that enhance business growth were discussed within the theme, marketing and management plans. First, a product strategy uniquely performed by second-hand retailers was agile inventory turnover and quick circulation from racks to stock. Some price strategies were practiced by second-hand retailers by providing affordable prices to approach various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> customers. Second-hand <b>retailers</b> specifically focused on maintaining relationships with customers and customer services, such as welcoming and greeting, finding a proper outfit for customers, and searching for items customers requested. Experiential, entertainment, esthetic, and escapist experiences were offered to customers so customers not only consume products and services, but also enjoy second-hand stores 2 ̆ 7 unique atmosphere.

Less {{is known about the}} relationship between overweight/obesity and other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers.</b> This study aims to investigate the potential associations between nearby 1) fast food restaurants, 2) convenience stores, and 3) supermarkets, and rates of overweight students in California schools. Methods We examined the rate of overweight ninth grade students in public schools in 2007 using linear regression. The percentage of overweight students per school was determined by a state required physical fitness test, with three different options for measuring individual body composition. Our key independent variables were the presence <b>of</b> three different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> within 800 m network buffers of the schools. Additional independent variables included school ethnic, gender and socioeconomic composition, as well as urban/non-urban location. We obtained the data from the California Department of Education and ESRI, Inc. Results The presence of a convenience store within a 10 -minute walking distance of a school was associated with a higher rate of overweight students than schools without nearby convenience stores, after controlling for all school-level variables in the regression (1. 2 %, 95 % confidence interval 0. 03, 2. 36). Nearby fast food restaurants and supermarkets, however, were not associated with school rates of overweight students. Conclusions Public health researchers and policy-makers interested in the food environments outside schools should expand their recent focus on nearby fast food restaurants to include convenience stores, which may also be important sources of low-nutrient, energy-dense foods for students. </p...|$|R
30|$|Only one-tenth <b>of</b> the OC <b>retailers</b> {{surveyed}} regularly use {{outlets for}} distributing direct-to-customer shipments. The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> OC <b>retailers</b> using this strategy already delivers items {{bought at the}} store to the customers. Examples <b>of</b> this <b>type</b> are the distribution of bulky goods in the DIY sector or white goods in consumer electronics. The product characteristics determine the distribution path, regardless of any OC activity. The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> OC <b>retailers</b> operating customer shipments from the outlets is in sectors with large outlets, where every store represents a kind of warehouse. DIY, electronics, and department stores are typical examples. These <b>retailers</b> take advantage <b>of</b> the opportunity to offer a broader assortment via distance retailing if items are stored only at outlets. Fashion retailers, however, do not at present use the store as a dispatching location, although this might be an option for very large fashion outlets.|$|R
40|$|We {{study and}} {{contrast}} pricing and price evolution of online only (Dotcom) and online branch <b>of</b> multi-channel <b>retailers</b> (OBMCRs) {{based on two}} panel data sets collected from online toy markets. Panel data regression analyses reveal several interesting empirical results: over time, OBMCRs and Dotcoms charge similar prices on average but Dotcoms significantly increase their shipping costs that eventually drive the overall average price of Dotcoms {{higher than that of}} OBMCRs. Price dispersions <b>of</b> both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> are persistent. The price dispersion of OBMCRs is higher than that of Dotcoms at the beginning and does not change much over time, but the price dispersion of Dotcoms increases significantly over time, indicating that the latter will eventually be higher than the former. Moreover, the OBMCRs charge significantly different prices, but the Dotcoms charge similar prices. [...] E-commerce,online pricing strategies,online toy market,price dispersion,pricing trends...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} two {{theoretical models}} {{to explain why}} multi-channel retailers (MCRs) usually price higher than pure Internet retailers (DotComs), a regular pattern observed in many empiri-cal studies. In the first game-theoretical model, {{we assume that the}} number of non-MCRs in the conventional market is exoge-nously determined, while consumers are classified into three dis-crete groups: (a) aggressive consumers, (b) discreet online con-sumers, and (c) offline consumers. We relax the first constraint in the second model so that all retailers in the Brick & Mortar sector are potential MCRs. Before setting prices, these retailers have to make their entry choices. Then, the pricing distribution becomes related to the factors such as the number <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> in two markets, the search costs, and the pricing strategies of the re-tailers in the online market. We explore how the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> compete in the dual channels. We find that MCRs bene-fit from the existence of their conventional stores, since they ca...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} topics in online pricing is understanding the drivers of online price levels for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers,</b> in order to better understand competition across retail channels. We developed a conceptual framework and conducted an empirical analysis on price levels in the books category among different e-tailers (pure play and multichannel) in Italy and obtained a dataset comprising 5, 400 price quotes during 2002. We ran a correlation analysis that showed that e-tailer graphics, branding and trust, and shipping services are highly correlated to price levels. Moreover, we developed a regression analysis that showed that first impact attributes like graphics and navigability are the most important drivers of online price levels. We identify some areas of future research and offer some managerial insights. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|R

From its early roots as a village it is now a market with all sorts of retails shops, stores, and showrooms. Plenty of illegal constructions took place in the village with support from local politicians and bureaucrats, that flouted many safety norms and hampered the traffic flow severely. However, the market is very popular among the people of West Delhi. Paschim Vihar, in particular, is well known for its high street-feel and a vast variety of products available. There are all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retailers</b> from small hawkers selling small clothes and namkeens to large showrooms of textiles, restaurants and garments. Much of the major apparel brands' showrooms are present with Adidas, Reebok, Woodland, Lee Solly, Allen Cooper, Richlook, Cantabil and others.|$|R
