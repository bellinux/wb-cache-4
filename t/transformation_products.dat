25|$|Soils {{with high}} clay {{contents}} or small particle sizes and high {{total organic carbon}} content {{have been shown to}} promote TNT transformation. Possible TNT transformations include reduction of one, two, or three nitro-moieties to amines and coupling of amino <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> to form dimers. Formation of the two monoamino <b>transformation</b> <b>products,</b> 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT are energetically favored, and therefore are observed in contaminated soils and ground water. The diamino products are energetically less favorable, and even less likely are the triamino products.|$|E

25|$|The native {{habitat of}} Aspergillus is in soil, {{decaying}} vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration, but it invades {{all types of}} organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions include high moisture content (at least 7%) and high temperature. Aflatoxins have been isolated from all major cereal crops, and from sources as diverse as peanut butter and cannabis. The staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava, chillies, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, {{and a variety of}} spices intended for human or animal consumption. Aflatoxin <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> are sometimes found in eggs, milk products, and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains.|$|E

The precise nature of this {{isothermal transformation}} is still unclear. The present contribution is a comprehensive comparison using EBSD, internal friction (IF) and TEM analysis of the isothermal <b>transformation</b> <b>product,</b> the athermal martensite and the lower bainite. The observations revealed that the isothermal <b>transformation</b> <b>product</b> in the MS-Mf temperature range had its own microstructural characteristics with wavy lath boundaries and orientation relationship...|$|R

Crookes observed the gradual decay of the separated <b>transformation</b> <b>product,</b> and the simultaneous reproduction of a fresh supply in the original uranium. At about the same time as this important discovery, he observed that when [...] "p-particles", ejected from radio-active substances, impinge upon zinc sulfide, each impact is accompanied by a minute scintillation, an observation which forms the basis of one of the most useful methods in the technique of radioactivity.|$|R

25|$|Aflatoxins are {{poisonous}} carcinogens {{that are}} produced by certain molds (Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus) which grow in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains. They are regularly found in improperly stored staple commodities such as cassava, chili peppers, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sesame seeds, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, {{and a variety of}} spices. When contaminated food is processed, aflatoxins enter the general food supply where they have been found in both pet and human foods, as well as in feedstocks for agricultural animals. Animals fed contaminated food can pass aflatoxin <b>transformation</b> <b>products</b> into eggs, milk products, and meat. For example, contaminated poultry feed is suspected in the findings of high percentages of samples of aflatoxin contaminated chicken meat and eggs in Pakistan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hypostoichiometric Fe-Pd binary alloys (35 - 45 at % Pd) were {{severely}} deformed (> 90 %) {{and subsequently}} aged to induce concomitant recrystallization, precipitation, and ordering. This thermomechanical processing strategy was articulated by Hornbogen [1] {{over thirty years}} ago. The resulting exchange-coupled ferromagnets contain ferrite precipitates and a complex metastable two-phase lamellar <b>transformation</b> <b>product</b> comprised of ordered L 10 and a metastable FCC phase. The later duplex microconstituent is suggested to form {{in conjunction with a}} so-called pseudospinodal reaction [2] involving emerging cubic and tetragonal phases, whereby phase separation and ordering result from continuous changes in composition and a reduction in symmetry, cubic to tetragonal. The deformation texture of the parent austenite is substantially retained in the <b>transformation</b> <b>product,</b> resulting in anisotropy of the magnetic properties as determined by magnetometry (VSM). This paper presents electron microscopy results elucidating the crystallography and morphology of the phase mixtures including HREM. Magnetic field annealing is also included as a branch of our thermomechanical processing strategy, and we discuss the influence of the external fields on recrystallization, precipitation, and ordering...|$|R
