5|$|Mary's death {{complicated}} Tucker's facile life, as her considerable {{estate was}} fraught with legal problems. It included a sugar plantation, {{thousands of acres}} of land, and a share in <b>the</b> <b>Dismal</b> Swamp Company. After a prolonged trip to the sugar plantation in Antigua, and on to Martinique and Bermuda, he returned to Williamsburg and then determined his future was in the nearby state capital of Richmond, Virginia as a practicing attorney. Tucker ultimately succeeded in salvaging only part of his late wife's fortune.|$|E

The {{following}} two films in the series were Thunder Over the Prairie (July 1941) and Prairie Stranger (September 1941). However, they were not based on Rubel's works. More sequels to The Medico of Painted Springs were planned for production, but were never greenlit after <b>the</b> <b>dismal</b> box office performance of the two released sequels. All three films had Charles Starrett {{playing the role of}} Dr. Steven Monroe.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{engagement}} at New Bern, the 21st {{was among the}} regiments selected for an expedition to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Dismal</b> Swamp Canal which would cripple the Confederacy's shipbuilding activities at Norfolk, Virginia. A portion of Reno's brigade was transported by steamers to Camden County and engaged in the relatively minor Battle of Camden on April 19, 1862. The 21st, at this stage, numbered 500 men, having lost numerous soldiers to disease while in an unsanitary camp at New Bern. After the Battle of Camden, Reno eventually abandoned the expedition against the canal and the brigade returned to New Bern on April 22. In {{the course of the}} mission, the 21st Massachusetts had light casualties of three percent (four killed, 11 wounded, and one missing).|$|E

Harriett Beecher Stowe told the maroon people's story in her 1856 novel Dred: A Tale of <b>the</b> Great <b>Dismal</b> Swamp. <b>The</b> most significant research on the settlements began in 2002 with a project by Dan Sayers of American University.|$|R
5|$|Ghosh, who co-wrote {{the story}} and the screenplay, began to plan the film while {{awaiting}} the release of his previous film Aladin (2009), but <b>the</b> <b>dismal</b> response to Aladin was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for Kahaani, but was refused and discouraged from making the film owing to three factors: a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop. Yashraj Films were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined {{because he did not}} want that much commitment.|$|E
5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; <b>the</b> <b>dismal</b> spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E

In 1826, the federal government purchased 600 stocks in the canal and, in 1829, additional funds for improvements were raised by the Norfolk lottery. With these funds, <b>the</b> <b>Dismal</b> Swamp Canal was widened and deepened, allowing for larger boats to ship their goods.|$|E
