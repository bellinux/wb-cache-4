5|$|Some of {{the main}} reasons <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> are less likely to reach optimal levels of {{education}} include the fact <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> are needed to assist their mothers at home, have been raised to believe that a life of domestic work is their destined occupation, have illiterate mothers who cannot educate their children, have an economic dependency on men, and are sometimes subject to child-marriage. Many poor families marry their daughters off early to get the dowry money so she is unable to complete her education.|$|E
5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E
5|$|En Liten Hushålls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that she should be accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E

Musically and technically superior to her previous initiative, the Who's <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> Tour incorporated multimedia components to make the show more appealing.|$|R

5|$|Some {{critics have}} {{compared}} 30 Rock to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, with parallels drawn between {{the relationship of}} Liz and Jack and that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant. It has also been compared to <b>That</b> <b>Girl.</b> Like <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> and Mary Tyler Moore, 30 Rock is a sitcom centering on an unmarried, brunette career woman living {{in a big city}} where she works in the television industry. <b>That</b> <b>Girl</b> was parodied in the opening segment of 30 Rocks pilot.|$|R
5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman writes <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> {{appear to}} be commemorated about as {{frequently}} as boys on surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E
5|$|Raised by Mormon {{parents and}} devout to the faith, Dalton was a feminist; as a child, she felt jealous of boys {{for the freedom}} and {{privileges}} they enjoyed and felt <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> were neglected by the education system. She became a women's rights activist, believing that women {{should have the right}} to suffrage, education, property, control over their money, and custody of their children. As a teacher, she advocated for equal educational and recreational opportunities for girls.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the BSA's Learning for Life, {{membership}} in the traditional BSA programs has been more restricted and controversial. Until recently, girls {{were not allowed to}} join Cub Scouting or Boy Scouting, but could join Venturing and Sea Scouting; women can be adult volunteers in all programs. On October 11, 2017, the BSA announced <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> would be allowed to become Cub Scouts, starting in 2018, and that in 2019, a separate program for older girls will be available, enabling girls to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.|$|E

5|$|The Faraway Trees Dame Slap, {{who made}} regular use of {{corporal}} punishment, {{was changed to}} Dame Snap who no longer did so, {{and the names of}} Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie. Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare's series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to Five on a Hike Together, reflecting the idea <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal. Anne of The Famous Five stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls was removed.|$|E
5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did not necessarily mean {{that there would be a}} large gap in ages between husband and wife, it was often the case. Among the ruling Yelü clan, the average age that boys married was sixteen, while the average age <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E

25|$|While male audiences prefer fast-paced {{explosive}} {{action and}} combat, {{women tend to}} prefer in-game communication and interpersonal relationships (character development and plot dynamics).

25|$|Beauty {{contests}} {{have been}} criticised for reinforcing the idea <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> and {{women should be}} valued primarily for their physical appearance. This is an especially sensitive issue for naturists as being contrary to the naturist philosophy of body-acceptance of all body types, and that women are not there to be looked at. Beauty contests are no longer as common {{as they were in}} the 1950s and 1960s in mainstream naturist venues.|$|E

Due to a fear of having a drop in academic achievement, fifteen hundred male students protested the admission but the decision was not changed.|$|E

25|$|I do {{not think}} that this is {{impossible}} or even difficult. There are genius women just as there are genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml.

25|$|This is {{one reason}} for girls leaving {{secondary}} school or missing classes. No privacy and lack of water supply means <b>that</b> <b>girls</b> prefer {{to stay at home}} during menstruation. Girls may lack knowledge of menstrual hygiene since the subject is taboo. An intervention in four districts of Southern Ethiopia, identified and tested local material for making sanitary pads, trained local tailors to make and mass-produce them, established local supply outlets and lobbied stakeholders to up-scale. Successful testing and raising awareness of the problem resulted in improved facilities for girls in five primary schools and one secondary school.|$|E
