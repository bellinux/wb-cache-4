5|$|Ballistas or springalds were siege {{engines that}} {{worked on the}} same {{principles}} as crossbows. With their origins in Ancient Greece, tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed {{to the point where}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.|$|E
5|$|Once {{killed by}} harpoons, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to float, and thus could be retrieved. However, some did sink when killed (10–30% in the North Pacific) and were lost unless they later {{stranded}} or surfaced.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and caused them to seek food in areas where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to hunting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> much <b>more</b> {{likely to}} survive {{atmospheric}} entry, and <b>are</b> <b>more</b> resistant to the resulting ablation. Hence, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> found as large pieces.|$|R
5000|$|Poor {{children}} face limited educational opportunities. According to an AWO-Study only 9% of {{the pupils}} visiting the Gymnasium are poor. Poor children {{are likely to}} experience adversities beyond money. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> raised by a teenage-parent. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to have multiple young siblings, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> raised in crime-ridden neighbourhoods {{and more likely to}} live in substandard apartments which are often overcrowded. Their parents are likely to be less educated and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to have emotional problems.|$|R
50|$|Pigment inks <b>are</b> used <b>more</b> {{frequently}} than dyes because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> color-fast, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> also <b>more</b> expensive, less consistent in color, and {{have less of}} a color range than dyes.|$|R
5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First World countries {{drew attention to}} environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E
5|$|British and European audiences {{typically}} followed {{concert hall}} behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> reserved in their behaviour than were audiences of {{other forms of}} rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found that American audiences were less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in full scale, {{the school}} {{explosion}} used drywall around {{the interior of}} the set to protect it from the fire. Physical effects supervisor Gary Monak oversaw the explosion. The destruction surprised the cast as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> used to optical effects in the series. Costume designer Robert Blackman created the Vedek costumes. Crew-members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E

50|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{expensive}} than traditional manicures.|$|R
50|$|Maxillae in most insects {{function}} partly like mandibles in feeding, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{mobile and}} less heavily sclerotised than mandibles, so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> important in manipulating soft, liquid, or particulate food rather than cutting or crushing food such as material {{that requires the}} mandibles to cut or crush.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E
5|$|In the Giro di Lombardia, Astana's final {{race of the}} season, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> {{successful}} {{than they had been}} most of the season, attaining a fourth podium finish in a one-day race on the year. While Damiano Cunego had broken away from the field with 15 kilometers left to race to win the event, Brajkovič won a sprint over 's Rigoberto Urán for second, and reacted as though he won the race. Chris Horner was also highly placed in the event, finishing seventh.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, more towers were {{built around the}} islands. The first group, the Wignacourt towers, were built between 1610 and 1620. Six of these were built, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints intended to protect vulnerable sections of the coast from attack. Of the six towers, one collapsed in around 1715 and another was demolished in 1888. The other four towers survive to this day.|$|E

5|$|Often {{classified}} {{with the}} galagos by early students, the cheirogaleids (dwarf and mouse lemurs) were placed {{with the other}} lemurs from Gregory's 1915 classification until the early 1970s, when several anthropologists proposed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> closely related to lorisoids, based on morphological data. However, relevant genetic studies unanimously place cheirogaleids within the lemuroid clade and Groves himself, who had promoted the cheirogaleid-lorisoid relationship in a 1974 paper, by 2001 regarded the idea as refuted.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil parrot {{remains were}} later {{excavated}} from grottos on Réunion and reported in 1996. X-rays {{of the two}} existing stuffed Mascarene parrots {{made it possible to}} compare the remaining bones with the subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to the modern specimens. The lesser vasa parrot was introduced to Réunion as early as 1780 but, though the subfossil parrot bones were similar to that species in some aspects, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> {{similar to those of the}} Mascarene parrot and considered to belong to it.|$|E
5|$|The Wailers were {{scheduled}} to open 17 shows in the US for Sly and the Family Stone. After four shows, the band was fired because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> popular than the acts they were opening for. The Wailers disbanded in 1974, {{with each of the}} three main members pursuing a solo career. The reason for the breakup is shrouded in conjecture; some believe that there were disagreements amongst Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, and Marley concerning performances, while others claim that Wailer and Tosh simply preferred solo work.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Greeks {{had some}} {{varieties}} of cabbage, as mentioned by Theophrastus, although whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> {{closely related to}} today's cabbage or {{to one of the}} other Brassica crops is unknown. The headed cabbage variety was known to the Greeks as krambe and to the Romans as brassica or olus; the open, leafy variety (kale) was known in Greek as raphanos and in Latin as caulis.|$|E
5|$|The first {{confirmed}} {{discovery of}} an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced {{the detection of}} an exoplanet around 51 Pegasi. From then until the Kepler mission most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to Jupiter or larger as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> easily detected. The catalog of Kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of Neptune and smaller, down to smaller than Mercury.|$|E
5|$|The peasants {{from the}} mountainous regions of Palestine and Bedouin (nomadic) warriors {{constituted}} {{the bulk of}} the rebels' forces. Most adult males among the peasantry owned a rifle (typically of the matchlock variety, ownership of which normally transferred from generation to generation) or less frequently, a pistol. The latter were often used in urban environments where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> effective. A wide array of melee weapons were also utilized, including scimitars (generally used by Bedouin fighters), daggers, javelins, or different types of clubs (generally used by peasant fighters).|$|E
30|$|There was {{a highly}} {{statistical}} significant relation between gender and outcome. The highest percentage of skin scars occurred among males (72.7 %) as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> liable to physical assaults, while all cases of leaving home and 81.8 % of cases with speech and psychic disorders <b>were</b> females as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> sensitive than males.|$|R

5|$|Tragedy did strike Marblehead {{though in}} November 1942. As her {{whaleboat}} was being hoisted back aboard, a sailor from her landing party fell overboard {{and failed to}} ever resurface. The sailor had a newly issued style of life vest on that required being inflated by mouth. This incident brought Captain Chandler to order that Omahas boarding party's return to wearing the older style life jackets that had proven themselves effective even though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> cumbersome and bulky.|$|E
5|$|When compared, Black signers {{were more}} likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs are most likely to use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E
