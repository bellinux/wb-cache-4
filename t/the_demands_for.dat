5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> {{charcoal}} {{used in the}} blast and cupola furnaces of the iron industry led to large amounts of deforestation of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from bituminous coal as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived from wood.|$|E

In 1881, four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} {{autonomy}} was not accomplished at this time, but the Seimas {{was an important}} development in the Lithuanian bid for independence. It consolidated efforts, spearheaded the organization of political parties, strengthened national conscience, and energized the rural populace. The assembly resolutely rejected ideas to restore the old Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{and for the first}} time voiced <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> autonomy. Many of the political and religious rights that were granted by the October Manifesto were retained. A number of agricultural, educational, scientific, literary and artistic societies emerged.|$|E
50|$|Increases in <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> labour {{will move}} the economy along <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> curve, {{increasing}} wages and employment. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> labour {{in an economy}} is derived from <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods and services. As such, if <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> goods and services in the economy increases, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> labour will increase, increasing employment and wages.|$|R

5|$|Clement XIII died {{suddenly}} on 2 February 1769, {{a day before}} {{the date of the}} consistory that he had convoked to examine <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> the general suppression of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and the Kingdom of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) had exerted strong pressure on the Holy See to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate. In 1759 Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, in 1762 from the Kingdom of France, in 1767 from Spain and in 1768 from the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Clement XIII strongly defended the Society (e.g. in the bull Apostolicum pascendi in 1765), but without success. In January 1769 France and Naples seized the papal territories around Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order. The sudden death of 75-year-old Clement XIII left this difficult decision to his successor.|$|E
5|$|Câmpineanu, who had {{proposed}} a reformist constitution {{to replace the}} Regulament entirely, was forced into exile, but remained an influence on a younger generation of activists, both Wallachian and Moldavian. The latter group, comprising many young boyars who had studied in France, also took direct inspiration from reformist or revolutionary-minded societies such as the Carbonari (and even, through Teodor Diamant, from Utopian socialism). It was this faction who would first explicitly publicize <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> national independence and Moldo-Wallachian unification, which it included in a wider agenda of political reforms and European solidarity. Societatea Studenților Români (the Society of Romanian Students) was founded in 1846, having the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine for its honorary president.|$|E
5|$|Longchamp governed England while Richard {{was on the}} Third Crusade, but his {{authority}} was challenged by Richard's brother, John, who eventually succeeded in driving Longchamp from power and from England. Longchamp's relations with the other leading English nobles were also strained, which contributed to <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> his exile. Soon after Longchamp's departure from England, Richard was captured on his journey back to England from the crusade and held for ransom by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Longchamp travelled to Germany to help negotiate Richard's release. Although Longchamp regained the office of Chancellor after Richard's return to England, he lost much of his former power. He aroused {{a great deal of}} hostility among his contemporaries during his career, but he retained Richard's trust and was employed by the king until the bishop's death in 1197. Longchamp wrote a treatise on the law, which remained well known throughout the later Middle Ages.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{healthcare}} is a derived <b>demand</b> from <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> health. Healthcare is demanded as a {{means for}} consumers to achieve a larger stock of [...] "health capital." [...] <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> health is unlike most other goods because individuals allocate resources in order to both consume and produce health.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> inputs is a derived <b>demand.</b> That is, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> is {{determined}} by or originates from <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> product the inputs are used to produce.|$|R
50|$|In {{economics}} derived <b>demand</b> is <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{a factor}} of production or intermediate good that {{occurs as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> another intermediate or Economics help - Derived In essence, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> one is dependent on that whose demand its demand is derived from. <b>For</b> example, if <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> a good such as wheat increases, then this leads to an increase in <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> labour. <b>For</b> another example, <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> steel leads to derived <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> steel workers, as steel workers are necessary for the production of steel. As <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> steel increases, so does its price. The increase in price means manufacturers of steel can gain more in revenue if they produce more steel, thus leading to a higher <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> resources involved in producing steel.|$|R
5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{announced}} in February1993 {{that they were}} considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). In December, Widerøe articulated that Båtsfjord Airport did not meet <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> future operation as it lacked proper navigational aids and an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that {{with the introduction of}} the Dash8, which would be phased in between 1993 and 1995, they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. The CAA stated, instead, that the new airport should be built, estimated to cost between 70 and 80million Norwegian krone (NOK). The main reason was that the former airport was poorly located in relation to the terrain, being located in a valley. In April1994 the ministry stated that they were considering closing many of the smallest regional airports, including Båtsfjord.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{the plans}} for an indoor arena, {{primarily}} for handball, was launched again, {{but the cost of}} NOK6 million was not able to be financed. Following the work with the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, the plans resurfaced, this time with an ice hockey rink to be the centerpiece. In 1985, Lillehammer Municipal Council accepted an agreement with the Norwegian Confederation of Sports (NIF), which offered to finance 50% of a new multi-use arena in Lillehammer. The venue opened in December 1988 and cost NOK65 million. After Lillehammer was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, it became necessary to build a larger venue to hold the Olympic ice hockey matches. In June 1989, the municipal council voted to locate most of the Lillehammer venues to the Stampesletta area, and to put Håkons Hall adjacent to Kristins Hall. This was controversial among the politicians, and many councilors voted in support of the originally-planned decentralized plan, with the venues spread out through the municipality. Håkons Hall cost NOK238 million and it opened on 1 February 1993. Prior to the Olympics, the power lines across the fields were dug down to give better television images. The bid for the Olympics had also included using Stampesletta for the speed skating events, but with <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> an indoor venue, it was instead decided to build Vikingskipet in Hamar.|$|E
5|$|Norving {{operated}} at {{the airport}} until 1990, when the route {{was taken over by}} Widerøe, who initially used the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. The Ministry of Transport and Communications announced in February 1993 that they were considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). Along with Båtsfjord Airport and Vardø Airport, Svartnes, Hasvik Airport was one of three regional airports in Finnmark with government-subsidized routes which did not receive state operating grants. In December Widerøe articulated that Hasvik Airport did not meet <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> future operation as it lacked proper instruments and did not have an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash 8 they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. Additional navigation aids were installed in 1993 and the runway was asphalted in 1995, subsequently resulting in Dash 8 services being introduced. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997. The runway lights were upgraded in 2008 and 2009, followed by the installation of the Global Positioning System-based landing system SCAT-I.|$|E

40|$|Financial {{innovation}} refers both to {{technological advances}} which facilitate access to information, trading {{and means of}} payment. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> money is very crucial in the conduct and determination {{of the effectiveness of}} monetary policy. This study attempts to analyse whether financial innovations that occurred in Nigeria after the Structural Adjustment Programme of 1986 has affected <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> money in Nigeria using the Engle and Granger Two-Step Cointegration technique. Though the study revealed that <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> money conforms to the theory that income is positively related to <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> cash balances and interest rate has an inverse relationship with <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> real cash balances, it was also di scovered that the financial innovations introduced into the financial system have not significantly affected <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> money in Nigeria. Based on the results obtained, a policy of attracting more patticipants (non-government) and private sector funds to the money market is necessary as this will deepen the market and make the market more dynamic and amenable to monetary policy. Therefore, the study concludes that financial innovation has had no significant impact on <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> money in Nigeria and the SAP era financial liberalization policies have had no indirect impact on <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> money as well...|$|R
