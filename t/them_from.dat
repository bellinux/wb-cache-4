5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates <b>them</b> <b>from</b> bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates <b>them</b> <b>from</b> plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E

5|$|A common {{concern among}} reviewers is the {{overhead}} perspective, which critics have bemoaned for preventing <b>them</b> <b>from</b> judging pathway routes and an object's location {{in relation to}} its background. Besides this, the actual visuals were generally well received, {{as well as the}} setting and animations. The audio was commended for combining both originality and nostalgia, even though it looped frequently.|$|E
5|$|According to Schumacher, {{during the}} scene in which the costumes of the Riddler and Two-Face are seen, he {{originally}} planned to put Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze escaping from Arkham Asylum while many other villains saw <b>them</b> <b>from</b> their cells. The scene, however, didn't {{make it in the}} final film.|$|E

5|$|After the 2011 season, the Red Sox {{assigned}} Middlebrooks to the Arizona Fall League, {{where he}} hit four {{home runs in}} 13 games and {{was named to the}} Rising Stars Game. In November 2011, Middlebrooks, Che-Hsuan Lin and Drake Britton were added to the Red Sox 40-man roster to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> being selected in the Rule 5 draft.|$|E
5|$|At age 16, Alexander's {{education}} under Aristotle ended. Philip waged {{war against}} Byzantion, leaving Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent. During Philip's absence, the Thracian Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly, driving <b>them</b> <b>from</b> their territory. He colonized it with Greeks, and founded a city named Alexandropolis.|$|E

5|$|Bands {{to emerge}} from other major British cities {{included}} The Animals from Newcastle, <b>Them</b> <b>from</b> Belfast and the Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues from Birmingham. None of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues, often relying on sources that included Brill Building and girl group songs for their hit singles, but it remained {{at the core of}} their early albums.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{control is}} also being {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} hunting as a means of controlling overpopulation in wild animals. Contraceptive vaccines {{have been found to be}} effective in a number of different animal populations. Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an olor, to male goats to prevent <b>them</b> <b>from</b> impregnating female goats.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes <b>them</b> <b>from</b> other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E

5|$|China's late-20th-century {{economic}} reforms produced {{a middle class}} that increased demand for traditional luxury items like shark fins. Chinese traditional medicine ascribes various restorative and healing effects to the fins, and the soup is considered a delicacy, costing as much as US$100 per bowl. The Chinese demand for fins led fishing crews to both take <b>them</b> <b>from</b> sharks in their bycatch and start fishing for sharks directly.|$|E
5|$|Coonhounds existed as a {{distinct}} type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the time. Up to World War I raccoons were very common despite being hunted often, and were sometimes poisoned to keep <b>them</b> <b>from</b> destroying crops.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 10-second time {{bonus for}} winning the stage, Kristoff took over the overall lead of the race, one second ahead of Boonen, who moved into {{the lead of the}} points competition.

5|$|During {{the first}} week of its {{theatrical}} run, an analysis by Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu showed the film to have grossed 13.1 million in Chennai alone. Despite this, the film underperformed at the box office and incurred heavy losses for Lakshmi Movie Makers, effectively stopping <b>them</b> <b>from</b> investing in other ventures for the year 2003.|$|E
5|$|Following their appointment, the President {{appoints}} {{a number}} of Vice-Presidents (the High Representative is mandated {{to be one of}} <b>them)</b> <b>from</b> among the commissioners. For the most part, the position grants little extra power to Vice-Presidents, except the first Vice-President who stands in for the President when he is away.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry {{and women}} have a complex relationship, which can be readily divided into many phases with no {{demonstrable}} relationship to each other until the 20th century. A few women were involved in Freemasonry before the 18th century; however the first printed constitutions of the Premier Grand Lodge of England appeared to bar <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the Craft forever.|$|E
