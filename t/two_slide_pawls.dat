It has helical screw threads with a very large pitch along the central shaft. When the handle is pushed down, the shaft <b>slides</b> into <b>pawls</b> in the tubular stem, turning the bit. Most screws are [...] "self locking" [...] and axial force on the shaft will not turn the screw.|$|R
5000|$|Mammoth Falls {{opened in}} 2000 and are two six person raft slides built by Australian Waterslides and Leisure. The tower {{featured}} <b>two</b> different <b>slides</b> - one featured {{a series of}} inline drops to the finish (known as Mammoth Plunge) while the other featured several corners (known as Mammoth River). In 2005 the 263 ft Mammoth Plunge slide was moved to Sea World and {{changed its name to}} The Plunge. After the Mammoth Plunge slide was moved, the Mammoth River attraction was mirrored. Mammoth Falls now features <b>two</b> <b>slides</b> with identical 658 ft layouts. The original <b>two</b> <b>slides</b> cost AU$2.25 million to build.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this research, {{we propose}} a fast pattern {{matching}} algorithm: The <b>Two</b> <b>Sliding</b> Windows (TSW) algorithm. The algorithm {{makes use of}} <b>two</b> <b>sliding</b> windows, each window has a size that {{is equal to the}} pattern length. Both windows slide in parallel over the text until the first occurrence of the pattern is found or until both windows reach the middle of the text. The experimental results show that TSW algorithm is superior to other algorithms especially when the pattern occurs {{at the end of the}} text...|$|R
40|$|Friction in MEMS-scale devices is {{troublesome}} {{because it}} can result in lateral stiction of <b>two</b> <b>sliding</b> surfaces. We have investigated the effect of modulation of the normal force on the friction between <b>two</b> <b>sliding</b> MEMS surfaces, using a fully MEMS-based tribometer. We {{have found that the}} friction is reduced significantly when the modulation is large enough. A simple model is presented that describes the friction reduction as a function of modulation frequency as well. Using this technique, lateral stiction-related seizure of microscopic sliding components can be mitigated...|$|R

40|$|A {{well-known}} Luenburger {{observer and}} <b>two</b> <b>sliding</b> mode observers (SMO) for battery {{state of charge}} (SOC) estimation based on an improved battery equivalent circuit are presented. The comparison of their SOC estimation results is discussed. The testing data under different discharge current profiles generated by DUALFOIL battery simulation program are used to extract the circuit model parameters and verify the effectiveness of the observers for the SOC estimation. It shows that <b>two</b> <b>sliding</b> mode based SOC observers have robust tracking performance and provide more accurate SOC estimation in electric vehicle driving conditions...|$|R
50|$|The year 1999 was {{the third}} {{expansion}} of Splash Works. It saw the creation of <b>two</b> new <b>slides,</b> Super Soaker and the Plunge. While two separate rides, they share a common loading platform tower. The 1999 expansion also saw another bridge to {{the south side of}} Splash Works (behind these <b>two</b> <b>slides).</b> In addition, these <b>two</b> new <b>slides</b> and new bridge cross over Minebuster. The Plunge is a multi-person raft straight down a slide, and the Super Soaker is twisting water slide. They both use the same tube.|$|R

Readings of 7 ft or less, and up to 13 ft can be measured. It has a rear section that slides on the front section.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a disturbance decoupled fault reconstruction (DDFR) scheme using <b>two</b> <b>sliding</b> mode observers in cascade. Measurable {{signals from the}} first observer {{are found to be}} the output of a fictitious system that is driven by the fault and disturbances. Then the signals are fed into a second observer which will reconstruct the fault. Sufficient conditions which guarantee DDFR are investigated and presented in terms of the original system matrices, and they are found to be less conservative than if only one single observer is used; therefore DDFR can be achieved for a wider class of systems using <b>two</b> <b>sliding</b> mode observers. A simulation example validates the claims made in this paper...|$|R
