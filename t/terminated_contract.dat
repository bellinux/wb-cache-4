40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The nation's long-term fiscal imbalances will likely make DOD's $ 1. 6 trillion planned investment in new weapon systems unsustainable. Thus, {{it is critical that}} DOD retains the flexibility to end programs and contracts when necessary and appropriate. Although the federal government generally has the legal right to <b>terminate</b> <b>contracts</b> for convenience, defense stakeholders have sometimes expressed concerns that it will cost more to <b>terminate</b> a <b>contract</b> than to complete it. To address this perception, GAO examined (1) how expected contract termination costs and other factors affect DOD decisions on whether to end programs and contracts; (2) the circumstances under which it would cost more to <b>terminate</b> a <b>contract</b> for convenience than to complete it; and (3) the options DOD has for retaining value or reducing costs, when DOD ends programs or contracts. To do this, GAO examined DOD data on <b>terminated</b> <b>contracts</b> over $ 100 million; reviewed laws, regulations, and guidance; and met with key DOD officials. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{entitled}} “The Realization of Speech Act Types in Terminating Contracts” aims {{to investigate}} the speech act types in <b>terminating</b> <b>contracts</b> based on Searle’s theory and to discover the influences of three sociological variables such as power, social distance, and rank of imposition toward the speech act types. The study uses descriptive-qualitative method to analyze the data. The main data are collected through the DCT questionnaires from 15 male and 15 female participants in English Literature Program in English Education Department of Indonesia University of Education. The study revealed that in <b>terminating</b> <b>contracts,</b> there are only four types of speech act realized such as Representatives, Directives, Commissives, and Expressives. In the present study, female participants use Directives mostly in <b>terminating</b> <b>contract,</b> while Representatives is the most frequent used by male participants. The influences of sociological variables show that the participants use Representatives, Directives, and Commissives {{in order to be}} polite and to avoid threatening the face of the hearer. Meanwhile, the use of Expressives in order to respect the hearer is not influenced by the sociological variables. Keywords: Pragmatics, Speech Act Types, Face-threatening Acts, Politenes...|$|R

50|$|In July 2008 Palić {{went on to}} join NK Croatia Sesvete signing {{his first}} {{professional}} contract. In a season and half long stay at Croatia Sesvete he made 31 league appearances, adding two more in Croatian Cup competition. He scored only three league goals of which one was particularly valuable, achieved against major Croatian team Hajduk Split on 5 October 2008 at Kranjčevićeva. An early opening goal in the end {{proved to be the}} only and crucial one in 1-0 win, resulting in first-ever club victory over Hajduk. In December 2009 club management made a strange move at the time, placing him on transfer list for opening winter transfer window. Especially surprising was timing of decision from the club as Palić was in process of recovery from an injury and was a regular member of Croatia national under-21 football team. Reason was proved later on to be due to the major financial trouble club was going on, finally leading to dissolving the club in 2012 due to financial irregularities. Croatia Sesvete continued to write off players. At the end Palić <b>terminated</b> <b>contract</b> with Croatia on mutual agreement together with his teammates Marijo Jurin and Matija Katanec.|$|E
