5|$|Although the Attorney General, William de Grey, {{advised that}} the {{publishers}} should again be prosecuted, Mansfield disagreed, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{failed to respond}} to Junius, he would become bored and stop writing. Mansfield was evidently correct, because other than a letter printed on 5 October 1771, Junius ceased to write at the beginning of 1772.|$|E

Bludworth explains to them Death's design and that they're still in danger. Realizing this, they attempt to rescue the remaining survivors. Following Terry's and Ms. Lewton's deaths, they are successful in saving Carter's life.

5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} that the race was close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E

Harper approves Bird's plan to send a team to the storage container but sends Michael to a cell, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> do not find any evidence of his accusations, he'll go to jail for killing Hawkins.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did not name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E

On 26 January 2007 the new Red Bull RB3 challenger was unveiled in Spain, and Webber drove the car in a shakedown in Barcelona on the same day.

5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|After filming was completed, {{their public}} {{comments}} {{against each other}} propelled their animosity into a lifelong feud. The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within 11 days of its nationwide release, and temporarily revived Crawford's career. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford secretly contacted {{each of the other}} Oscar nominees in the category (Katharine Hepburn, Lee Remick, Geraldine Page and Anne Bancroft, all East Coast-based actresses), to let them know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed. Both Davis and Crawford were backstage when the absent Anne Bancroft was announced as the winner, and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf. Davis claimed {{for the rest of her}} life that Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied.|$|E

5|$|As an anointed queen, Mary {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the power of any court to try her and refused to attend the inquiry at York personally (she sent representatives), but Elizabeth forbade her attendance anyway. As evidence against Mary, Moray presented the so-called casket letters‚Äîeight unsigned letters purportedly from Mary to Bothwell, two marriage contracts, and a love sonnet or sonnets {{said to have been}} found in a silver-gilt casket just less than one foot (30cm) long, decorated with the monogram of King Francis II. Mary denied writing them, arguing that her handwriting was not difficult to imitate, and insisted they were forgeries. They are widely believed to be crucial as to whether Mary shares the guilt for Darnley's murder. The chair of the commission of inquiry, the Duke of Norfolk, described them as horrible letters and diverse fond ballads, and sent copies to Elizabeth, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were genuine they might prove Mary's guilt.|$|E
5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
