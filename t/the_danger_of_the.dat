5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> streets {{and puts it in}} a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> streets.|$|E

5|$|The Weather Bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} warning for Trinidad, Tobago, and the Grenadines south of Saint Vincent in the cyclone's first advisory on Hurricane Flora. Gale warnings were later issued for islands off northern Venezuela and from Saint Vincent northward to Martinique. Advisories on Flora emphasized <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane and advised preparations to be rushed to completion. The advisories also recommended small craft throughout the Windward Islands {{to remain at}} harbor and for shipping {{in the path of}} the hurricane to advise extreme caution. People in low-lying areas and near beaches were advised to evacuate to higher grounds, as well. Lead time was short, especially in Tobago which received news of the approaching hurricane just two hours before it struck.|$|E
5|$|The {{negotiations}} between the city authorities and the peasants were not continued. While the authorities debated at the Tagsatzung {{how to deal with}} the insurrection, the peasants worked to gain support for their cause amongst the rural population of other regions and lobbied for a formal alliance. A peasant delegation sent to Zürich was turned back promptly: the city authorities, who had put down local unrests in their territory already in 1645 and again in 1646, had already recognized <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agitation. On April 23, 1653, representatives of the people of the countryside of Lucerne, Bern, Basel, and Solothurn met at Sumiswald and concluded an alliance to help each other to achieve their goals. A week later, they met again at Huttwil, where they renewed that alliance and elected Niklaus Leuenberger from Rüderswil in the Emmental as their leader.|$|E

5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his lifelong}} fame and upper-class origins, Churchill always {{struggled}} to keep his income at a level which would fund his extravagant lifestyle. MPs before 1946 received only a nominal salary (and in fact did not receive anything at all until the Parliament Act 1911) so many had secondary professions from which to earn a living. From his first book in 1898 until his second stint as Prime Minister, Churchill's income while out of office was almost entirely made from writing books and opinion pieces for newspapers and magazines, among them the forthnightly columns {{that appeared in the}} Evening Standard from 1936 warning of the rise of Hitler and <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> policy of appeasement.|$|E
25|$|Griffith became Premier in November 1883 {{displacing}} McIlwraith. Griffith's {{election as}} Premier was assisted by auditor-general William Leworthy Goode Drew's {{report on the}} colony's loans having reached over £13 million. Griffith won the next election largely on his policy of preventing the importation of Kanaka labour from the islands. He passed an act for this purpose, but {{it was found that}} <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destruction of the sugar industry was so great that the measure was never made operative. Recruiting was, however, placed under regulations and some of the worst abuses were swept away.

25|$|Artillery {{was rarely}} placed inside a village because of <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{buildings}} catching fire and detonating the ammunition. Instead the guns were placed alongside a village or {{on a hill}} behind it. On the battlefield, the light artillery was stationed in the front line or covering the flanks. Typically, howitzers were assigned to a battery to use their long-range shell fire. In order to achieve mutual support, batteries were placed 600–900 paces apart. If action was imminent, the cannons would be loaded in advance and two matches kept lit. If forced to unlimber under fire, {{it was best to}} approach the desired position from a flank to present the thinnest target. When an eight-gun battery was unlimbered, the cannons fired in turn, one every four seconds, {{in order to keep the}} target under continuous fire.|$|E
