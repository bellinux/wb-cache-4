50|$|Haïti Chérie is a {{traditional}} patriotic and most recognizable song of Haiti that was written and composed by Dr. Othello Bayard de Cayes and was initially called Souvenir d'Haïti. It represents <b>the</b> pride <b>Haitian</b> <b>people</b> feel for their country and culture. Within <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> community, at home and abroad, it is widely considered as a second national anthem to La Dessalinienne and the song has recorded several different versions.|$|R
25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{appearance}} of slavery, however, Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery, the whip. Likewise, the working day was shortened by a third. Dessalines' chief motivator nonetheless was production and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations' overseers. Barred from using the whip, many instead turned to lianes, which were thick vines abundant throughout the island, to persuade the laborers to keep working. Dessalines effectively sent <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>people</b> back into slavery. Nevertheless, he succeeded in rebuilding much of the countryside and in raising production levels.|$|E
25|$|Under {{president}} Aristide's leadership, {{his party}} implemented many major reforms.

25|$|Racist {{attitudes towards}} <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>people</b> by the American {{occupation}} forces were blatant and widespread. Initially, there was intermingling of {{officers and the}} elites at social gatherings and clubs but when families of American forces began arriving, such gatherings were minimized. Relations degraded rapidly, however, upon departure of officers for World War I in Europe; this {{changed the nature of}} the relationship between the races the most. The Haitian elite found the American junior and non-commissioned officers to be ignorant and uneducated. There were numerous reports of remaining Marines drinking to excess, fighting and sexually assaulting women. The situation was so bad that the Marine General John A. Lejeune based in Washington, D.C., banned the sale of alcohol to any military personnel.|$|E

From this research, I detail the decision making processes in food aid distribution, and gain insight into the US government’s own evaluations into the work it has done to alleviate global food insecurity. The discussion of Haiti 2 ̆ 7 s future also talks about common global issues, possible solutions to the problems of addressing food insecurity, and how the lessons learned from Haiti can be applied worldwide...|$|R
25|$|The Revolution in Haiti did {{not wait}} on the Revolution in France. The {{individuals}} in Haiti relied on no other resolution but their own. The call for modification of society {{was influenced by the}} revolution in France, but once the hope for change found a place in the hearts of <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>people,</b> there was no stopping the radical reformation that was occurring. The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion. Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On April 4, 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Haiti and the revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent nation solely of freed peoples. The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France's transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti's influence spanned across every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential Revolution in history.|$|E

40|$|The United States marines {{occupied}} Haiti from 1915 - 1934. During the occupation, US marines helped introduce and popularize jazz {{music to}} <b>Haitian</b> youth. By <b>the</b> 1930 s, several Haitian jazz groups took root, often intermixing the imported American form with folkloric garb, songs deriving from the vodou cultures, and {{gestures to the}} anti-occupation indigénisme movement. In Caribbean countries (not unlike the United States), music often assumes what Gérard Béhauge has called “counterhegemonic strategies toward the elimination {{of political and economic}} subordination. ” Despite the music’s arrival from United States armed forces, young <b>Haitians</b> identified <b>the</b> music as their own, and simultaneously as an expression of an African diasporic consciousness. Some even contrasted jazz to things foreign: One popular group, Jazz de Jeunes, asserted that “Jazz des Jeunes is <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>people’s</b> treasured child. Their pride, their dignity, is to eat their own food. Living from their Garden, they love being ancient. By extolling the foreign, you betray only yourself. ” This paper illuminates how these meanings of jazz took root for young <b>Haitians</b> in <b>the</b> interwar period, and the political valences of negritude and indigénisme that it became associated with. In doing so, it illustrates larger intra-national trends regarding the communicative and organizing powers of Black Atlantic music...|$|R

5000|$|John Singler {{suggests}} that Creole was probably formed {{between the time}} the French colony of Saint‑Domingue was founded in 1659 and 1740.

At the time of tobacco and cotton production, <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> population {{was made up of}} colonists, the [...] (employed whites), gens de couleur and slaves in relatively balanced proportions, with roughly equal numbers of people of color and [...] Singler estimates the economy shifted into sugar production in 1690, and radically reconfigured <b>the</b> early <b>Haitian</b> <b>people</b> as [...] "the big landowners drove out the small ones, while the number of slaves exploded".

40|$|Haiti is {{a unique}} environment, {{not just as a}} third world nation but also in culture and heritage. Economic and {{political}} instability has left this country without some of the basic needs and opportunities that we in the western world take for granted. Solutions to Haiti’s problems will only be realized through the understanding of Haiti’s problems. My research’s first goal was to understand the problem of education in Haiti, and then attempt to understand how media and technology can play a role in reform. This study uses qualitative methods to examine a two fold thesis; 1. The cultural differences of Haiti is a context that needs understanding, and 2. How can media and technology benefit the education and cultural society of Haiti? Through my research I seek to demonstrate alternate methods of education through media technologies. Education is an answer to <b>the</b> <b>Haitian</b> <b>people’s</b> problem, it is not, however, a solution for the county’s problems. These two contrasting theories are what I will examine and explore. This study will examine the impact of media on the society and culture of Haiti. Through qualitative research methods used while conducting field research in Haiti, I will address a series of research questions pertaining to the potential effectiveness of media technology education techniques. Using qualitative methods, open-ended questions and participant observation I was able to gather important insights and data on these topics in Haiti with Haitians. While there are many proposed solutions to Haiti’s problems I would rather present an option to better the situation for a small population of Haitian youth. Give a child food and water for life and they will eventually die. Give a child education and that child has the potential to better their economical situation and rise out of poverty.

40|$|This article reviews human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection in Haiti. The evolution of the epidemic in Haiti, its spread from urban to rural areas, its varied clinical manifestations, and <b>the</b> attitudes of <b>Haitian</b> <b>people</b> toward HIV infection provide important lessons on understanding and managing this infection in a developing country. The heterosexual spread of HIV, particularly among the poor, is well-documented as {{is the role of}} other sexually transmitted diseases along with tuberculosis. Coinfection of HIV and tuberculosis have led researchers to study the effects of six-month supervised intermittent tuberculosis therapy both in controlling tuberculosis and slowing the progression of HIV. Various surveys and discussion groups about acquired immunodeficiency virus knowledge and beliefs demonstrate a large deficit in HIV education despite campaigns to educate the population. The great impact of HIV disease on morbidity and mortality in Haiti indicates that a great deal of work still needs to be accomplished and demonstrates the frustration in fighting the infection in countries with inadequate resources and infrastructure. Advances in HIV vaccine research seem to be the most promising option for developing countries such as Haiti...|$|R

The Taino were nearly wiped out due to diseases the Europeans brought with them and because of cruel practices including slavery. The Tainos fled to the mountains just before the Africans arrived on the island. Mixing between the remaining Tainos and some of the Africans occurred and it is believed a lot of Haitians in present-day have some ancestral links to the indigenous Tainos.|$|R
