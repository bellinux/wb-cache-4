5|$|Aram Avakian was {{initially}} selected {{to be the}} film's director, but when he continually refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> sentimental-type dog story, he was replaced by Leslie H.

The film was released on June 6, 1962. The studio {{hoped it would be}} successful enough to be followed by a second film and a television series. Though praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget, B-movie.
