40|$|AbstractBacteriorhodopsin {{is one of}} {{very few}} transmembrane {{proteins}} for which high resolution structures have been solved. The structure shows a bundle of seven helices connected by six <b>turns.</b> Some <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> proteins are stabilized by short range interactions and can behave as small domains. These observations suggest that peptides containing the sequence of the <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> a membrane protein such as bacteriorhodopsin may form stable <b>turn</b> structures <b>in</b> solution. To test this hypothesis, we determined the solution structure of three peptides each containing the sequence {{of one of the}} <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> bacteriorhodopsin. The solution structures of the peptides closely resemble the structures of the corresponding <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the high resolution structures of the intact protein...|$|R

5|$|At the 2009 National Championships, Tarwater {{qualified}} {{to represent the}} United States team in the World Championships {{for the third time}} in his career by placing sixth in the 200-meter freestyle. He also placed fourth in the 100-meter butterfly, and fifth in the 200-meter butterfly. In the preliminary round of the 4×200-meter freestyle, he helped the United States <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> the top qualifying time. The United States later won the event, earning Tarwater a gold medal. After the 2009 season, Tarwater decided to retire from competitive swimming and concentrate on his academic work at Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh was banished by Sultan Abdülâziz a {{final time}} in 1868 to the Ottoman penal colony of `Akká, in present-day Israel. Towards {{the end of}} his life, the strict and harsh {{confinement}} was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akká, while still officially a prisoner of that city. He died there in 1892. Bahá'ís regard his resting place at Bahjí as the Qiblih to which they <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> prayer each day.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same <b>turn.</b> <b>In</b> later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E
50|$|Spotting {{technique}} is employed for {{many types of}} turns, including pirouettes and chaînés. It is deliberately avoided in some types of turns, however. For example, adagio <b>turns</b> — <b>in</b> which the aesthetics are intended to convey serenity and calm — would be disturbed by the abrupt head movements of spotting. <b>Turns</b> <b>in</b> adagio style include <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> arabesque or attitude positions.|$|R
40|$|Theabilities of four {{species of}} diurnal jumping spiders (Helpis minitabunda,Portia fimbriata, Trite auricoma, and Trite planiceps) and one species of nocturnal clubionid spider (Clubiona cambridgei) to {{maintain}} approximately straight paths by alternating <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> {{the absence of}} visual cues was investigated. Under infra-red light (observed using infra-red video), individual spiders were run rough a maze comprising a single forced turn and then a choice of <b>turning</b> <b>in</b> the same or opposite direction to the forced turn. At the second (free) <b>turn,</b> each species <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> the direction opposite to the forced turn (i. e., alternated turns) more frequently than it <b>turned</b> <b>in</b> the same direction. There was no evidence that species differed in tendency to alternate <b>turns.</b> <b>In</b> nature, jumping spiders may use this ability to navigate {{in the absence of}} visual cues when foraging or escaping predators in darkness. It is suggested that alternation of turns by jumping spiders depends on proprioceptive information gathered during previous turns...|$|R

The negative supercoiling implies that the DNA is underwound.|$|R
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna to <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid {{a swirl of}} strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E
5|$|Ikoma {{became a}} gunnery {{training}} ship in her <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> 1918 and her armament was augmented {{by a pair}} of 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft (AA) guns the following year. She was re-rated back to first-class cruiser in 1921 and disarmed in 1922 to fulfill the requirements of the Washington Naval Treaty. The ship was broken up in November 1924.|$|E

Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is pursued by a black helicopter before soldiers retrieve her printed copies of Albert's translations of the digital tape. Scully denies having the original tape, saying it is in Mulder's possession. Upon returning to Washington, the FBI puts Scully on mandatory leave and forces her to <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> her badge and gun. Upon entering Mulder's office, she finds the tape missing.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, {{with the}} ransom money still missing, The Oregon Journal republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 {{to the first}} person to <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> a ransom bill to the {{newspaper}} or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E

5|$|The town of Herne Bay {{took its}} name from the {{neighbouring}} village of Herne, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word herne, meaning a place on a corner of land, evolved from the Old English hyrne, meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The corner may relate to the sharp <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> the minor Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver at Herne.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Brezhnev {{years and}} the lengthy interregnum that followed, the {{generation}} which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced {{by men and women}} for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.|$|E

Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} we present the {{modelling}} of the induction machine, {{taking into consideration}} the stator defects of the induction machine. It {{is based on the}} theory of electromagnetic coupling of electrical circuits. In fact, for the modelling of stationary defects such as short circuit between <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the same phase, we introduce only in the matrix the coefficients of resistance and inductance of stator and in the mutual inductance stator-rotor. These coefficients take account the number of <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> short-circuit deducted from the total number of <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the same phase; in this way we obtain the number of useful <b>turns.</b> <b>In</b> addition, all these faults involved, will be used for the creation of the database that will be used to develop an automated system failures of the induction machine...|$|R

5|$|Across {{the town}} line, NY11A intersects Otisco Road (CR246) and passes several farms {{on its way}} to the hamlet of Cardiff. Here, the route runs past a line of homes prior to passing under US20 at the {{northern}} edge of the community. Outside of Cardiff, the highway becomes known as Syracuse–Tully Valley Road as it slowly curves to the northwest, matching a similar <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> the course of the creek and its valley. As the road traverses another stretch of cultivated fields, it meets Field Lane, a short connector providing access between NY11A and US20. Past this point, NY11A serves little more than farms before it enters the Onondaga Reservation. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the Onondaga Nation.|$|E
5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E
