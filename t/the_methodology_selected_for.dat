40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is about natural {{language}} processing and understanding, within the context of artificial intelligence research. What was attempted to achieve here was to investigate how meaning is contained in language, particularly with respect to how that information is encoded and how it can be decoded, or extracted. The aspects deemed most relevant for this quest was automated processing of the syntactic structure of sentences, and their semantic components. Artificial neural networks was chosen as the tool to perform the research with, and as such part of the goal became research on connectionist methods. A side-goal of interest was to look into the possibility of using insight into neural networks to gain deeper understanding of how the human brain processes information, particularly language.

In this context, organizations seek to develop their strategic project management capabilities in order to stay competitive and ensure strategic goals are successfully delivered. However, there are plenty of methodologies to choose from and also a noted deal of confusion surrounding the concepts of strategically managing projects, as identified by several sources.

This thesis deals with the potential role of equine herpes virus types 1, 2, 4 and 5 in upper respiratory disease and poor performance in horses in Western Australia. <b>The</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> the identification of equine herpes viruses in tissues of horses was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and therefore individual PCR assays were developed {{for the detection of}} each herpes virus, and then a nested multiplex PCR was developed to detect all four viruses. There was good correlation between the multiplex PCR for the detection of EHV and the detection of virus by isolation in cell culture, although a combination of the 2 techniques provided greater sensitivity than either technique alone. The multiplex PCR described appeared equally sensitive as specific PCR assays using a single set of primers for each individual virus but reduced labour and reagent costs. As latency is a well recognised phenomenon in the equine herpes viruses and the horse is subjected to a number of stresses which might induce reactivation of latent infections, it was hypothesised {{that there would be a}} background level of replication of the equine herpes viruses in clinically normal horses. Nasal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were obtained from 282 clinical normal horses and examined for EHV. The results clearly demonstrated the widespread occurrence of EHV in the clinically healthy horses.

While adjusting to their autonomous role, nurse practitioners need to create and define a distinct role for themselves within practice contexts that may be unfamiliar, sometimes unwelcoming and inhospitable. During this time of transition, nurses need well developed negotiation skills and personal attributes including resilience, tenacity, fortitude and determination. Purpose of the researchThe purpose of the research reported in this paper was to explore the transition experiences of 10 newly endorsed nurse practitioners in Australia during {{their first year of}} practice. This paper focuses on power, control and political manoeuvring that negatively impacted the ׳nurse practitioners׳ transition. A qualitative approach using a modified version of Carspecken׳s five stage critical ethnography, informed by focused ethnography, was <b>the</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> this study. Methods included observations of practice, journaling, face to face and phone interviews which were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results“The enemy within” emerged as a dominant theme highlighting issues of power, powerlessness and politics dominating the participant׳s experiences. Power struggles amongst nurses, both overt and covert, and the deliberate misuse of power were frequently encountered. Many of the participants felt powerless and ill-prepared to negotiate the challenging situations in which they found themselves. Many lacked the skills needed to address the negative behaviours they experienced. ConclusionsThis paper reports on the experiences of 10 newly endorsed nurse practitioners during their transition to the nurse practitioner role. The impact of the political climate {{at the time of this}} study had an undeniable influence on many of the participants׳ transition experiences.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} some aspects of the listening process in early childhood education. The investigation was based on the premise that listening was a cognitive activity displaying cognitive-structural features similar to the development of knowledge. The review of the literature revealed that the listening process as a cognitive activity in early childhood had not been sufficiently considered. In order to investigate the listening process a Piagetian theoretical perspective was developed. Inherent in this perspective was the relation of listening to the structuralist position as elucidated by Piaget. Inherent in Piaget's principles was the clinical interview as the method of inquiry. As <b>the</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> the study, it was determined to be more penetrating in the discovery of underlying cognitive-structural features of listening. The clinical interviews involved 20 subjects, ten three-year olds and ten four-year olds, each encountering four different stimulus situations developed specifically for the investigation. The four interviews with each child were recorded for later transcription. The analysis of the interview protocols, preceded by formal coding, investigated the listening process across the four stimulus situations by the central process of equilibration. The exemplification of the constructs of equilibrium which included the cognitive structures of listening facilitated the explanation of the listening process in three-and four-year old children. The conclusions of the study relate to the corroboration of the postulates for each Piagetian theoretical construct. First, a model of the listening process was suggested involving the equilibration of cognitive structures. Second, the study indicated that the clinical interview is a useful method for the inquiry of listening in early childhood. Also, since the methodology has been utilized successfully in the investigation of listening it is suggested this procedure constitutes a useful method for the inquiry of other phenomena in early childhood education. Finally, the study indicated educational implications for the curriculum ana suggested areas for further research...|$|E

Like all elders, those from Asia need health services; however, {{little is known about}} their health care needs or how they maintain health and navigate the health care system in a new land. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a substantive theory of health and wellness maintenance processes among elderly Thai immigrants based on a synthesis of their verbalized perceptions of (1) health; (2) the impact of the immigration experience on their health and wellness; and (3) strategies they used to manage the migration experience relative to health. Grounded theory, <b>the</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> this study, is a naturalistic and systematic approach to knowledge generation guided by the symbolic interaction perspective. As such, it focuses on the social context and interactional matrix of symbolic meaning and behavior from which basic social processes can be inferred. The results included the core category of "Discovering a Balance", a basic social psychological process that consisted of three phases: Learning the System, Becoming Self-Empowered, and Combining the Two Worlds. "Balance" does not mean only "being stable". Rather, "Balance" is a dynamic and intellectual process, always moving the individual toward the ultimate goal in life. "Discovering a Balance" represents a cyclical and dynamic process that aging immigrants use to gain a balance in their lives by using selective knowledge, skills, and resources from both Eastern and Western perspectives toward health and wellness maintenance. The process can reoccur time after time depending on experiences confronted by aging immigrants. Based on the data in this study, "Balance" can occur if elderly immigrants are surrounded by strong nurturing environments. Understanding Asian elder's complex experiences of immigration and the maintenance of health and wellness as affected by migration, a major life change, is imperative for health care providers to assist them appropriately. Professional caregivers can offer more culturally sensitive clinical interventions to the elderly during and following the transitional migration process. More culturally appropriate health services can be expected to lead to an improved quality of life and decreased cost of health care...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{official}} report. ITS Applications have {{in recent years}} assisted in {{reducing the number of}} fatalities in Europe. However, Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) have not benefited as much as vehicle users. The EU-sponsored VRUITS project assesses the safety and mobility impacts of ITS applications for VRUs, assesses the impacts of current and upcoming ITS applications on the safety and mobility of VRUs, identifies how the usability and efficiency of ITS applications can be improved, and recommends which actions have to be taken at a policy level to accelerate deployment of such ITS. This deliverable reports on the needed modification and development of methodologies to assess the impacts of ITS applications for VRUs in the domains of safety, mobility and comfort and cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Safety assessment estimates the potential reduction in fatalities and injuries to VRU as a result of ITS applications for VRUs. Mobility and comfort are relatively new impact areas for study. The definition of mobility used in VRUITS is: Mobility is considered any form of outside (out of house) movement based on the identified soft transport modes: walking, cycling or motorcycling. These forms of movement are defined by trips from a starting point to a destination in order to conduct an out of house activity. Thus, the mobility impact assessment investigates the changes in the movement out of house (trips, length of trips, etc.) that are the result of the use of an ITS applications for VRUs. VRUITS uses the definition of comfort from Slater: “( [...] .) a pleasant state of physiological, psychological, and physical harmony between a human being and the environment” (Slater, 1985 : p. 4). Thus, the challenge in VRUITS is to assess comfort impacts {{as a result of the}} use of ITS applications by VRUs. Finally, the CBA monetises the quantified impacts (safety, mobility and comfort) to calculate the Benefit-Cost ratios. An analysis of the sub-groups of VRUs, presented in this report, forms the basis for determining which criteria the impact assessment methodologies must meet. This analysis also illuminates the data necessary as inputs to the impact assessment methodologies. For each impact assessment area, the state-of-the-art is presented. Each impact assessment area describes the required modifications to <b>the</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> use in the VRUITS project, to meet the demands of the VRU sub-groups as well as the ITS applications selected for analysis in the VRUITS project...|$|E
40|$|As young people’s {{opportunities}} in the digital and globalised world of work generally dwindle, the situation for rurally based young people in Zimbabwe gets increasingly complex. The Ministry of Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment reports that young people in Zimbabwe are the hardest hit by unemployment (Murinda, 2014). The 2012 Zimbabwe population census data indicates that young people aged 15 - 34 years constitute 84 per cent of the unemployed (Murinda, 2014). Governments in both industrialised and developing countries are calling for vocational education reform {{in the search for}} remedies for economic crises and youth unemployment. This thesis seeks to establish the place of VET in rural Zimbabwe and, from the perspective of students, teachers and education inspectors, the contemporary factors that influence attitudes to VET. <b>The</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> this study is the explanatory case study approach. Six schools in Murewa district were selected for the study. The research methods included semi-structured questionnaires, focus groups and in-depth interviews with primary and secondary school students, teachers and education inspectors. This study makes methodological contributions to the effective use of multiple data collection methods. My original contribution to knowledge is the exploration of the contemporary views of rurally based students and teachers whose voices are rarely heard in educational policy formulation. A disconnection was discernible between policy-makers, education inspectors, teachers and students. There is evidence that poor teacher motivation, the low status ascribed to VET and the way VET is delivered influence young people’s attitudes. Some young people questioned the relevance of VET, whilst others viewed it as an alternative if the academic route failed. It emerged that many students are discouraged by the way VET is taught and its lack of relevance to their desired careers. Primary school students had more positive perceptions of VET than secondary school students. Lack of professional careers guidance was found to contribute to VET apathy. This study makes theoretical contributions to the VET agenda by proposing a framework of the key factors influencing the vocational student’s learning journey and providing a foundation for perception and attitudinal transformation. This study contributes to an ongoing review of the Zimbabwean education system, which is focusing on young people’s needs and aspirations. This research will inform policy-makers, educationalists and industrialists about how VET can be tailored to meet young people’s aspirations. The study will inform future research on effective careers iv guidance and curriculum development and will apprise policy-makers of the institutional and cultural status quo of VET in Zimbabwean rural schools...|$|E

Two data-gathering techniques were used to organize and synthesize the information on the influence of television programs on young African American males. The techniques were (1) a review of the related literature and (2) interviewing and analysis of the interviews. Twelve African American males between the ages of 18 - 30 participated in this study. Results of the study indicate that television was an influence in the lives of the African American males. Although the respondents considered television programs to be unrealistic, these shows still had an impact on the aspirations, values and attitudes of the young men. The results also indicate that these men think television executives need to produce programs featuring African Americans in more positive roles...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{differences}} between the results of an in person or face-to-face direct spending survey and a post-event online direct spending survey. Participants in a large annual marathon held in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States were used as subjects for the study. <b>The</b> research <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> this study included an in person survey instrument administered to out-of-town marathon participants prior to the start of the event during the race number and race timing chip pick-up period. The same survey instrument was administered online four days after the conclusion of the marathon to the same group of out-of-town marathon participants who did not previously respond to the in person survey. Analysis of data and results revealed that average direct spending for the online respondents was consistently and significantly higher than spending for the in person respondents on direct spending questions. Spending on lodging for both groups showed no significant differences. It was recommended that the use of online survey methods be considered when conducting direct spending studies for participant oriented sporting events when adequate e-mail addresses are available and the potential respondents have a certain level of computer literacy...|$|R
40|$|English {{is taught}} {{as a second}} {{language}} in the Pakistani context where traditional methods such as Grammar-Translation Method (GTM) are dominant in most of the English language teachers 2 ̆ 7 classroom practices. Generally, teachers are found to be neither equipped nor familiar with the communicative ways of teaching English in general and English speaking skills in particular. Therefore, they face challenges and difficulties in their classroom teaching practices, which limit students 2 ̆ 7 learning and drive the teaching-learning processes towards rote- and examination-oriented learning. Many research studies have been conducted in all aspects and skills of second language learning. I have conducted my study with a similar aim that is, to improve the teaching and learning of English language speaking skills. The study was conducted in a lower secondary community school in Karachi, Pakistan, having a low socio-economic status. <b>The</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> the study was Action Research. This study was conducted to explore how teachers can be facilitated in improving their teaching of English speaking skills to grade six students. This entailed introducing new teaching strategies, such as role play, story-telling, and discussion, along with songs as encouraging activities. The findings of the study can facilitate the present researcher in his context, and therefore, improve his own practice as a teacher educator. Data were collected by using different methods and tools, such as observation, audiorecording of interviews of the participant teacher and classroom lessons, video-recording of the first and last teaching lessons, researcher 2 ̆ 7 s and teacher 2 ̆ 7 s reflective diaries, and document analysis. The study findings, during the reconnaissance stage, reveal that the existing teaching practices are teacher-centered, GTM- oriented, and replete with use of Urdu language. They also reveal the participating teacher 2 ̆ 7 s lack of pedagogical content knowledge and skills in addition to her inadequate English speaking skills. They further show students as passive listeners with minimum class participation, overloaded with tasks requiring heavy writing at the same time. Overall, reading and writing skills were focused with less emphasis given to speaking skill. In contrast, the findings after facilitating the teacher-participant with new teaching strategies demonstrate the following, the strategies improved: her practices of teaching English speaking skills; her awareness concerning pedagogical skills and content knowledge; her understanding of the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s role in the class; she also developed various teaching materials and lesson plans, and kept a reflective diary. In addition, the findings revealed some challenges that emerged in the process of facilitating the teacher-participant. For the researcher, the study proved to be beneficial as a teacher, teacher educator, and as a researcher...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to asses the skill of a short range regional ensemble forecast system over Southeastern South America. The proposed regional ensemble forecast system consists of 9 members: 4 pairs of perturbed forecasts plus a control forecast. The initial and boundary conditions are perturbed using scaled lagged forecasts from the GFS operational runs (up to 96 -hr lenght) at 00 and 12 UTC. This technique was applied for the first time to regional forecasting during the SAMEX' 98 (Storm and Mesoscale Ensemble Experiment) as described in Hou et. al. (2001). <b>The</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> the initial perturbations generation is of particular interest because it provides consistent perturbed boundary conditions and only requires a set of global operational forecasts. The amplitude of the perturbations is rescaled using the geopotential heights at 200 hPa. so that they have near the same amplitude among them. This has been done to avoid spurious amplitude growth due to the inclusion of older forecasts. These perturbed initial and boundary conditions are used to run a 9 -regional forecast ensemble, using WRF V 2. 0 mesoscale model. The regional domain encompasses South Eastern South America with a horizontal resolution of 50 km, 31 vertical levels and the forecast length is 48 hours. This experiment is performed over a month of the 2005 Southern Hemisphere spring season, so as to analize the importance of the ensemble forecast system over a critical period, characterized by heavy precipitation generally organized in huge mesoscale convective systems. The skill of the ensemble mean is compared against the skill of the control forecast. Also, in order to investigate if the ensemble dispersion could be used to forecast the magnitude and distribution of the control forecast errors, the relationship between these variables is measured over the region. The relationship is explored trough the computation of the spatial correlation between both fields and the temporal correlation of dispersion and error averaged over the entire domain. The root mean-square error (RMSE) between the forecasted fields and the analysis is computed as a function of the forecast time in order to asses the skill of both the ensemble and the control forecast. When available, upper air observations are also used in a similar way. Preliminary results suggest the benefit of adopting an ensemble technique to improve regional forecasts. Still, it remains a critical issue the lack of enough observational data to quantitatively assess the impact in precipitation forecasts. Pages: 1977 - 198...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} {{the historical development of}} instrumental music programs in Victorian government secondary schools from 1965 to the year 2000. There was a focus on educational developments, political influences and policy changes during that time and how these affected instrumental music programs. Issues of resource allocation, the place of instrumental music in the curriculum and the value of instrumental music in schools were also explored. From these, the factors that have influenced the development, management and further continuation of these programs were identified and discussed. The survey of the literature found that there was limited information on the study, therefore it was necessary to bring together information indirectly associated with the topic. The literature review discussed definitions and functions of instrumental music and provided an overview of instrumental music in Western civilisation. The teaching and learning of instrumental music was discussed in relation to education, schools, curriculum, State education, Commonwealth education and similar programs found interstate and overseas. The literature drew out issues relevant {{to the study of the}} development of instrumental music programs in Victorian government secondary schools. <b>The</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> the study was historical and was based on qualitative research. Information was gathered from primary and secondary sources including monographs, theses, government reports and journal articles. Interviews were also conducted in the study where twenty key individuals who have contributed to the development of these programs were selected to further enrich the study. A chronology of the development of instrumental music programs in Victorian government secondary schools was provided. The major social, cultural and political influences were discussed which occurred during that time were discussed. Supporting organisations and instrumental music programs offered in government schools interstate and overseas were also investigated in the study. They were researched to determine their influence on such programs in Victoria and also to provide a comparison. There were many supporting organisations that provided useful information and professional development opportunities for instrumental music teachers and students which were not made available by the Education Department. These organisations kept instrumental music teachers up-to-date with pedagogical developments and trends in instrumental music education. Interstate government schools that offered instrumental music programs were discussed and compared to programs in Victoria. Instrumental music programs offered in secondary schools in the United Kingdom and the United States of America were also discussed and compared. Thirty-five factors were identified in the study that influenced the development of instrumental music programs in Victorian government secondary schools. Much of the information was from the interviews conducted during the study. A model was developed for the future successful continuation of instrumental music programs based on the concept of Community Music Centres. Here the resource would be available for both secondary and primary government students as well as members of the community. The study concluded by drawing together the findings of the study, raising pertinent issues and discussing recommendations and ideas for further research...|$|E

Several criteria, which have not been considered in the multi-objective mathematical formulation, are incorporated in the selection method to differentiate the non-dominated solutions. Not only does the method assist the decision makers in dealing with this unmanageable set of solutions, it is also capable of {{taking into account the}} practicality issues of solution, which cannot easily be addressed in the mathematical model. The proposed method is applied to select the most preferred configuration of an AVI system for the simplified Irvine network in Orange County, California as a case study...|$|R
