5|$|According to Morgan, <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>hall</b> was {{designed}} for multiple uses and this {{is evident from the}} plans and the exterior of the building. The largest section, the center section, serves as the government function and has municipal offices on the first floor. A stairwell to the right leads to the second floor, which functions as a town meeting room. A secondary entrance on the western facade accesses the northern section of the building, previously a library. The southern section of the building was previously a high school with separate entrances for boys and girls. The second floor of the southern section was used by the Antiquarian Society for meetings and its collections. In 1917, the original library was moved to the southern section following the completion of the Leander R. Peck School. Two additions to <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>hall</b> were made to expand the library. The two additions consisted of two parallel gable units that matched the original material and form of <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>hall,</b> the first addition was made in 1938 by Howe & Church and the second in 1963 by Michael Traficante.|$|E
