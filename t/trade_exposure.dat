40|$|Studies of {{economic}} globalization and government spending often view the United States as an outlier case. Surprisingly, ours {{is the first}} empirical study {{to take advantage of}} the variation in U. S. states’ exposure to global markets, ideological orientations of the governments, and the relative size of the public sector, to assess the role of <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> on government spending in the American states. Using state-level data from the past three decades, we use error correction models (ECMs) to test three competing globalization theories. We find that the effect of <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> on government spending varies across states. Our results suggest that when conservatives control state governments, high levels of <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> negatively relate to changes in public expenditures such as welfare and infrastructure. With liberal governments in power, <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> does not accelerate state spending growth in welfare and infrastructure, which diverges from the pattern found in European social democracies...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the lack}} of direct {{evidence}} regarding industrial adjustment in response to trade liberalization, this paper tackles some very basic questions. Specifically, in LDCs, how is trade orientation correlated with the size distribution of plants and with plant-level labor productivity? It begins with a simple model that summarizes some effects of <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> on producer size and productive efficiency that have been stressed in the recent analytical and simulation literature. It then examines annual plant-level data from Chile and Colombia to determine whether these effects can be confirmed. The empirical results indicate that, over the long run, higher <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> is correlated with smaller plant sizes, controlling for industry and country effects. However, the mix of high versus low productivity plants is not strongly associated with <b>trade</b> <b>exposure.</b> Both of these findings {{cast doubt on the}} mechanisms linking trade, plant size, and productivity in a number of recent analytical and simulation studies.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the link between}} <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> and wage volatility. First, it shows, in a simple model, that <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> magnifies the impact of domestic productivity shocks on industry-specific labor demand, particularly for the less export-intensive industries, and that, if labor is not perfectly mobile, this implies a rise in wage volatility. Then, it tests these predictions, using industry data. The empirical results confirm that wage volatility increases with an industry's degree of openness, and that it declines {{with an increase in}} the industry's export intensity. © 2005 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{provide some}} of the first {{empirical}} evidence on labour market adjustments to exchange rate movements in Canadian manufacturing industries. Generalized method of moments estimates that control for endogeneity show that there are significant changes in labour input when a change in the exchange rate occurs. During the 1981 – 97 period, the cumulative effect of a 10 per cent depreciation (appreciation) of the Canadian dollar was a 10 to 12. 5 per cent increase (decline) in labour input. The majority of this effect was due to the increase (decrease) in the demand for domestically produced goods {{both at home and abroad}} when a depreciation (appreciation) occurs. The authors find evidence that the responsiveness of labour input to exchange rate movements was greater in the 1990 s than in the 1980 s. They also find that industries with high and medium net <b>trade</b> <b>exposures</b> adjust their labour inputs more than industries with low <b>trade</b> <b>exposures.</b> The exchange rate effect on real wages is estimated to be virtually zero for all manufacturing industries.

We find that the relative cost shock that hit the Norwegian economy led to a significant decline in the more exposed firms' employment.

Default funds {{play a crucial}} role as a risk mitigant in this framework. Furthermore, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (together abbreviated as CPSS-IOSCO) produced a set of 26 principles for financial market infrastructures.

Clearing member banks with <b>trade</b> <b>exposures</b> to a qualified CCP will get preferential capital treatment under the BCBS framework. None of the principles or the policy framework requires, or forces a CCP to have a default fund. However, regulators prefer CCPs to have default funds in place to enhance their credit risk management practices, as required by principles 4 and 6 of the CPSS-IOSCO, before they will be qualified. We consider the merits of the BCBS's requirements for a clearing house, in a developing country such as South Africa, to become a qualified clearing house and conclude that a CCP with prudent risk management processes and controls, should not be disqualified if a default fund is not established...|$|R

While factor reallocation is essential if net benefits are {{to be derived from}} trade liberalization, the process generates costs both for transitioning workers and for employers undergoing personnel turnover. Net welfare gains depend on adjustment costs. Understanding of these issues has been hampered by data limitations. In this paper, we overcome some of these limitations by using new, harmonized measures on job creation and destruction for a number of countries in Latin America. We use these new series to investigate the impact of the removal of protectionism on net employment and gross job reallocation in Latin America. We find a robust pattern showing that reductions in tariffs and exchange rate appreciations increase the pace of job reallocation within sectors. We also find, however, some evidence of declining net employment growth as <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> increases. For example, we find some evidence that in the wake of tariff reductions, there is lower net employment growth.

40|$|Globalization {{is often}} {{credited}} with {{the expansion of the}} welfare state and increased spending on social insurance programs. However, empirical evidence on the relationship between globalization and social welfare spending is mixed. One possible explanation for these mixed results might be country-specific factors that mediate the effect of globalization on social spending, such as key characteristics of a country’s labor market. Countries with fluid, flexible labor markets likely respond to globalization differently than countries with rigid, inflexible markets. At the micro level, workers who find it costly to adjust to market volatility will likely demand compensatory and insurance programs to offset the high costs of adjustment. Given this, the relationship between globalization and social insurance is likely to be more sharply positive among countries with relatively immobile labor. I test this argument using data on social expenditures in both developed and developing countries. The findings indicate that <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> increases social spending in countries where workers face high adjustment costs. When workers face low adjustment costs, <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> has a strong reductive effect on social spending. This reductive effect declines as adjustment costs increase...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Cross-border {{mergers and}} {{acquisitions}} are a major and often politicised component of foreign direct investment. Using data on individual transactions between 1970 and 2006, we examine the restrictions countries place on {{mergers and acquisitions}}, whether they use these controls to discriminate against foreigners seeking to acquire domestic firms, and what factors may predict the propensity to block foreign entry by this method of direct investment. Drawing partly on the existing literature, we test hypotheses that state intervention {{can be explained by}} characteristics of the countries whose firms are targeted by acquirers, including per capita income, democracy, <b>trade</b> <b>exposure,</b> market size, government share of national income and industrial structure. Although democracy, <b>trade</b> <b>exposure</b> and high government expenditure are associated with more stringent merger control laws, none of these attributes cause states to discriminate against cross-border mergers. Countries with high per capita incomes, large markets and strict merger control laws, do use those regulations to discourage foreign acquirers. A second set of tests, based on observations of individual deals, rather than national aggregates, reveal that governments are particularly averse to foreigners acquiring firms that are bankrupt or in the defence sector. Overall, governments do treat cross-border mergers and acquisitions differently, and use their merger control laws to discriminate against foreign investors, particularly with respect to certain types of transactions.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to fill a gap in the foreign-exchange trading risk-management {{literature}} and particularly from the perspective of emerging and illiquid markets, such as in the context of the Moroccan foreign-exchange market. Design/methodology/approach – This paper, demonstrates a constructive approach, for the management of <b>trading</b> risk <b>exposure</b> of foreign-exchange securities, which takes into account proper adjustments for the illiquidity of both long and short trading positions. The approach is based on the renowned concept of value at risk (VaR) along with the innovation of a software tool utilizing matrix-algebra and other optimization techniques. Findings – Several case studies, on the Moroccan Dirham, were achieved with the objective of setting-up a practical framework of trading risk measurement, management and control reports, in addition to the inception of a practical procedure for the calculation of optimum VaR limits structure. Practical implications – In this work, the risk-management procedures that are discussed will aid financial markets' participants, regulators and policymakers, operating within emerging economies, in founding sound and proactive policies to handle foreign-exchange <b>trading</b> risk <b>exposures.</b> The document includes comprehensive theory, analyses sections, conclusions and recommendations, and full real-world foreign-exchange trading risk-management reports. Originality/value – Although a substantial literature has examined the statistical and economic meaning of VaR models, this article provides real-world techniques and optimum asset allocation strategies that are useful for trading portfolios in emerging and illiquid financial markets.
