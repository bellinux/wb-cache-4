He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome.|$|E
5|$|Although Shaw's works since The Apple Cart {{had been}} {{received}} without great enthusiasm, his earlier plays were revived in the West End throughout the Second World War, starring such actors as Edith Evans, John Gielgud, Deborah Kerr and Robert Donat. In 1944 nine Shaw plays were staged in London, including Arms and the Man with Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier, Sybil Thorndike and Margaret Leighton in the leading roles. Two touring companies took his plays all round Britain. The revival in his popularity did not tempt Shaw {{to write a}} new play, and he concentrated on prolific journalism. A second Shaw film produced by Pascal, Major Barbara (1941), was less successful both artistically and commercially than Pygmalion, partly because of Pascal's insistence on directing, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> was unsuited.|$|E

5|$|Bache's major {{accomplishment}} was {{the establishment}} of Liszt's music in England, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> selflessly devoted himself between 1865 and his death in 1888.

Bache featured several of the orchestral and choral works through an annual series of concerts, which he single-handedly funded, organised and promoted. Likewise, he played an annual series of solo recitals that incorporated Liszt's piano music.|$|E
