Francique participated in the fifth heat during the 17 August qualification round, ranking sixth of eight athletes. Francique earned a time of 46.15seconds, which was 1.19seconds slower <b>than</b> <b>American</b> runner Lashawn Merritt, the first-place runner in the heat, who would later earn gold in the event. Overall, Francique ranked 35th of 55 athletes. He did not progress to quarterfinals.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold <b>than</b> <b>American</b> crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E

5|$|Between 1941 and 1945, {{approximately}} three million Ukrainian and other gentiles were killed {{as part of}} Nazi extermination policies in present-day Ukraine. More Ukrainians were killed fighting the Wehrmacht in the Red Army <b>than</b> <b>American,</b> British and French soldiers combined. Original Nazi plans called for the extermination of 65 percent of the nation's 23.2million Ukrainians, with the survivors treated as slaves. Over two million Ukrainians were deported to Germany as slave labor. The ten-year plan would have exterminated, expelled, Germanized or enslaved most (or all) Ukrainians.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive sleep apnea, {{researchers have found that}} 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black {{people are more likely to}} be obese <b>than</b> <b>American</b> whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend toward}} {{artificial}} ice was hastened by the regular ice famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in the new technologies. Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice. Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and safer <b>than</b> <b>American</b> sourced ice, but reports in 1904 noted the risk of contamination in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice. In 1907, New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry, but public opinion was turning against natural ice on safety grounds. These fears of contamination was often played on by artificial ice manufacturers in their advertising. Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American Ice Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine ice industry.|$|E

25|$|Development {{of speed}} {{cushions}} has {{focused primarily on}} the European context. Consumer vehicles in Europe are typically smaller <b>than</b> <b>American</b> vehicles. This is to accommodate smaller demand for passengers and to better suit narrower road widths.

40|$|An {{examination}} of eleven intercultural textbooks, {{used in the}} field of communication in America, reveals little research comparing Russian and American proprieties in communication (Chen & Starosta, 1998; Dodd, 1998; Jandt, 2004 a; Jandt, 2004 b; Kelly, Laffoon & McKerrow, 1994; Lustig & Koester, 1996; Martin & Nakayama, 2004; Martin & Nakayama, 2005; Martin, Nakayama & Flores, 2002; Samovar & Porter, 2003; Samovar & Porter, 2001). In order to investigate the similarities and differences (S/D) of the two countries, an instrument was developed containing questions dealing with proprieties and customs appropriate in both cultural settings. In order to maintain language integrity, the 29 -item instrument was administered to English speaking students with: 1) no direct exposure to the Russian culture, or 2) direct exposure to the Russian culture. The results suggest proprieties in American and Russian society are more similar than difference in the majority of areas investigated in this research. However, there was a substantial difference between the two cultures in the following four areas: a) Russians are less likely <b>than</b> <b>Americans</b> to discuss their ethnicity in public situations; b) Russians are more polite <b>than</b> <b>Americans</b> in social situations; c) Russians feel more comfortable <b>than</b> <b>Americans</b> about speaking their minds in public situations; d) Russians are more honest when expressing opinions <b>than</b> their <b>American</b> counterparts...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{established}} that Indians {{tend to be}} greater in collectivism and gender role traditionalism <b>than</b> <b>Americans.</b> The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine whether these differences explained further cultural differences in romantic beliefs, traditional mate preferences, and anticipation of future difficulties in marital life. Results revealed that Indians reported greater collectivism <b>than</b> <b>Americans</b> and, in turn, held stronger romantic beliefs. Additionally, Indians' greater collectivism and endorsement of more traditional gender roles in part predicted their preferences for a marital partner possessing traditional characteristics, and fully accounted for their heightened concerns about encountering future difficulties in marital life. These results shed light on the processes underlying cultural differences in relationship attitudes and preferences, and point to culture-specific therapies to enhance marital functioning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{compared}} {{the relationship between}} gender role beliefs and antigay prejudice in Chile and the United States. Participants were Chilean and American university students. In Study 1, Chileans were more prejudiced <b>than</b> <b>Americans,</b> and men were more prejudiced than women. In Study 2, gender role beliefs mediated cultural and sex differences in prejudice. Chileans held more traditional gender role beliefs and were more antigay <b>than</b> <b>Americans.</b> Men were more prejudiced than women, particularly in their attitudes toward gay men. Further, sex differences in attitudes toward {{lesbians and gay men}} were completely mediated by gender role beliefs. Nationality differences in attitudes toward lesbians were completely mediated, and nationality differences in attitudes toward gay men were partially mediated, by gender role beliefs...|$|R

In Study 1, Chinese participants made stronger stereotypic trait inferences <b>than</b> <b>Americans</b> did on the basis of a target’s membership in a fictitious group. Studies 2 and 3 showed that Chinese participants perceived diverse groups as more entitative and attributed more internally consistent dispositions to groups and their members. Guided by culturally based lay theories about the entitative nature of groups, Chinese participants may stereotype more readily <b>than</b> do <b>Americans</b> when group membership is available as a source of dispositional inference...|$|R
