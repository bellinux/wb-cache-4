Providing safe drinking water supply to the ever growing urban and sub-urban population {{is going to be}} a challenge to the civil authorities, city planners, policy makers and environmentalists. Groundwater is a major source of drinking water in both urban and rural areas of Mandya. Mandya city is rapidly raising population, changing lifestyle and intense competition among users- agriculture, industry and domestic sectors is driving the groundwater table lower. Besides, discharge of untreated wastewater <b>through</b> <b>bores</b> and leachate from unscientific disposal of solid wastes also contaminate groundwater, thereby reducing quality of fresh water resources. The present work is aimed at assessing the water quality index for the ground water samples of Sugar town, Mandya city. The groundwater samples of about 40 samples were collected and subjected for a comprehensive physicochemical analysis. The purposes of this investigation are to provide an overview of present ground water quality for the following 12 parameters such as pH, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, chloride, nitrate, sulphate, total dissolved solids, iron, fluoride, alkalinity are to be considered for calculating the WQI. The results are analyzed by WQI method for predicting water quality. Water Quality Index (WQI) is a very useful and effective way for assessing the quality of water. WQI is a very useful tool for communicating the information on overall quality of water...|$|E

40|$|A {{latching}} {{device is}} disclosed which is lever operated sequentially to actuate {{a set of}} collet fingers to provide a radial expansion and to actuate a force mechanism to provide a compressive gripping force for attaching first and second devices to one another. The latching device includes a body member having elongated collet fingers which, in a deactuated condition, is insertable <b>through</b> <b>bores</b> on {{the first and second}} devices so that gripping terminal portions on the collet fingers are proximate {{to the end of the}} bore of the first device while a spring assembly on the body member is located proximate to the outer surface of a second device. A lever is rotatable through 90 deg to move a latching rod to sequentially actuate and expand collet fingers and to actuate the spring assembly by compressing it. During the first 30 deg of movement of the lever, the collet fingers are actuated by the latching rod to provide a radial expansion and during the last 60 deg of movement of the lever, the spring assembly acts as a force mechanism and is actuated to develop a compressive latching force on the devices. The latching rod and lever are connected by a camming mechanism. The amount of spring force in the spring assembly can be adjusted; the body member can be permanently attached by a telescoping assembly to one of the devices; and the structure can be used as a pulling device for removing annular bearings or the like from blind bores...|$|E
40|$|The Great Artesian Basin is an aquifer {{system that}} {{underlies}} {{a large area}} of north-eastern Australia. The spring wetlands in the Great Artesian Basin are of conservation significance because they provide habitat for endemic species including fish, invertebrates and plants. Since European settlement massive quantities of water have been artificially extracted <b>through</b> <b>bores,</b> reducing spring-flows. Records of the springs of the Queensland section of the Great Artesian Basin (excluding Cape York Peninsula) were compiled {{from a range of}} historical sources. Most remaining active springs were visited and surveyed, the physical attributes of the springs described and their current status determined. Recharge springs occur in areas where the evidence suggests the basin is recharged by rainfall and 93 % of the original 245 spring-groups in these areas are still active. Discharge springs occur in sections of the Basin down-gradient of the recharge areas and only 36 % of the original 300 spring-groups in these areas have at least some springs that are still active. The capping of bores could provide a partial restoration of artesian pressure and enhance spring flows. Of the active spring-groups surveyed 26 % have suffered major or total damage as a result of excavation of the wetlands. An emerging threat is the use of exotic grasses as ponded pastures, which have the ability to dominate the habitat of spring wetlands. The potential impacts of other threats including those associated with stock, exotic animals and fire are also discussed. Mitigating these threats requires a conservation strategy that seeks to protect remaining springs with high conservation values...|$|E

When moisture enters the refuse in a landfill, it extracts the pollutants into liquid phase, which initiates a liquid flow called as leachate.
