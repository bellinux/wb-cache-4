5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Tottenham 1–0 on 25 April 2005, {{which meant}} Chelsea needed <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> Saturday {{in order to}} mathematically win the title. Second position was the best Arsenal could aim for {{by the time they}} faced West Bromwich Albion on 2 May 2005. Goals from Van Persie and Edu earned a 2–0 win for the team and Arsenal beat Champions League finalists Liverpool at Highbury to all-but secure second spot. Arsenal recorded the biggest win of the league season, against Everton at Highbury. An inspired performance by Bergkamp helped the team win 7–0; he created the opening two goals and scored in the second half. Arsenal lost their final game of the campaign, away to Birmingham City. It was a lacklustre performance by the visitors, who equalised through Bergkamp after going a goal behind, but conceded in the 90th minute.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust {{from the engine}} of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS {{at the time of}} the camp's construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank engine exhaust pipe ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E

5|$|Beckwith mustered 6,700 {{men from}} a variety of garrisons and sources, his men {{belonging}} to the 3rd, 4th, 6th and 8th West India Regiments, the 1st Foot, 15th Foot, 19th Foot, 25th Foot, 63rd Foot, 90th Foot and the Royal York Rangers, as well as 300 garrison artillerymen and various militia forces. These troops were split into two divisions: the largest, 3,700 men under Beckwith with subordinate command given to Major General Thomas Hislop, was to be deployed at Le Gosier on the island's southern shore. The second division, 2,450 men under Brigadier General George Harcourt, was initially ordered <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> the Îles des Saintes before being deployed after the main attack {{to the rear of the}} French garrison. A small reserve under Brigadier General Charles Wale would follow the main assault to provide support if required. As the French had no significant naval resources on the island, the Royal Navy's contribution was much smaller than that required for the Martinique invasion the year before. Cochrane attached ships of the line to both divisions, Beckwith sailing in Cochrane's flagship HMS Pompee, accompanied by HMS Abercrombie with Commodore William Charles Fahie, while Harcourt sailed with Commodore Samuel James Ballard in HMS Sceptre. Ballard and Fahie were in command of the transports and smaller vessels that carried the invasion forces and bore responsibility for ensuring that the amphibious landings were successful as well as for any naval units that participated in the land campaign.|$|E

25|$|After the {{accident}} there was {{criticism that the}} layout of the track at Harrow and Wealdstone was arranged with the junction between slow and fast lines {{to the north of the}} station so the Tring train had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> the fast line. This was to keep the length of the rods between the points and the signal-box to a minimum. The junction was changed in 1962.|$|E

50|$|Long-term {{scheduling}} is {{also important}} in large-scale systems such as batch processing systems, computer clusters, supercomputers, and render farms. For example, in concurrent systems, coscheduling of interacting processes is often required {{to prevent them from}} blocking due <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>on</b> each other. In these cases, special-purpose job scheduler software is typically used to assist these functions, in addition to any underlying admission scheduling support in the operating system.|$|R
25|$|Baldwin's {{locomotive}} traversed {{one mile}} in 58 seconds. Still, Baldwin's problems arose from defective exhaust pipes, valve gear and steam joints, all required reconstruction.

As a design, Baldwin never repeated it as the locomotive amply demonstrated the problems with using rigid British locomotives on American railroads.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Millennium Partners and Ritz-Carlton {{who built}} the Ritz-Carlton Hotel & Towers {{just around the corner}} from Saint Francis House, funded the {{construction}} of a large atrium in Saint Francis House so that the homeless would not have to stand in lines in the street waiting to get in. Saint Francis House had originally approached the developers to build the atrium out of an unused outdoor parking lot, so that homeless guests would not have <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> the street in long lines.|$|E
25|$|Alfonso VI {{seems to}} have lost {{patience}} {{with the state of}} diocesan affairs in Coimbra and had secured the election of a new bishop at Eastertime of 1091. The new bishop, Cresconius, was the former abbot of Saint Bartholomew of Tui and was essentially a royal choice. He was consecrated by the archbishop of Toledo {{with the assistance of the}} bishops of Tui and Ourense. The participation of these latter, as well as later events, suggests that Cresconius would have been acceptable to Raymond of Burgundy also. But the consecration and installation of the royal candidate at Coimbra may have had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> the death of Sisnando.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} incident, on August 13, 1992, the same vessel {{pulled out of}} its berth at the Departure Bay {{terminal}} while vehicle loading ramps were still lowered and resting on the ship. Three people were killed, including two children, one was seriously injured, and two others received minor injuries when a van from Alberta containing 6 people fell 15 m (about 50ft) from the upper deck onto the lower car deck and finally into the sea below. The van had been stopped and instructed <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> the loading ramp by terminal crew members. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that the accident {{was caused by the}} vessel not properly following departing procedures and secondarily due to poor communication between terminal and ship crew members.|$|E
25|$|The Fallschirmjägers' {{greatest}} {{victory and}} greatest losses {{occurred during the}} Battle of Crete. Signals intelligence, {{in the form of}} Ultra, enabled the British <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> each German drop zone, yet despite compromised secrecy, surviving German paratroops and airlanded mountain troops pushed the Commonwealth forces off the island in part by unexpected fire support from their light 75 mm guns, though seaborne reinforcements were destroyed by the Royal Navy. However, the losses were so great that Adolf Hitler forbade their use in such operations in the future. He felt that the main strength of the paratroopers was novelty, and now that the British had clearly figured out how to defend against them, there was no real point to using them any more.|$|E
25|$|On the German right flank, {{against the}} French Tenth Army, the 4th Army of Army Group B was to attack with the 5th Panzer Division, 7th Panzer Division, the 57th Infantry Division, 31st Infantry Division, 12th Infantry Division, 32nd Infantry Division, 27th Infantry Division, 46th Infantry Division and the 6th Infantry Division and the 2nd Motorised Division, the 11th Motorised Brigade and the 1st Cavalry Division. Advancing {{on a line}} from Abbeville to Amiens, with a flank guard on the left facing Paris, the main force was to make for the lower Seine, quickly to capture Le Havre and bridgeheads at Rouen, Les Andelys and Vernon. An advance beyond the Seine to the south or {{south-west}} was <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> events.|$|E

Among his officers, whoever went <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> Siraj ud Dowla despaired of life and honour, and whoever returned without being disgraced and ill-treated offered thanks to God. Siraj ud Dowla treated all the noblemen and capable generals of Alivardi Khan with ridicule and drollery, and bestowed on each some contemptuous nickname that ill-suited any of them. And whatever harsh expressions and abusive epithet came to his lips, Siraj ud Dowla uttered them unhesitatingly in the face of everyone, and no one had the boldness to breathe freely in his presence.|$|E

Although it is unclear why he chose Pembroke College, Addison was named in Peter Smart's trust deed (1729). As a sizar, he occasionally had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> the [...] "Fellows' table" [...] and perform other menial tasks. On 12 July 1740, {{he was awarded the}} [...] "Dr. Watt's Foundation scholarship", which granted him six pounds a year until he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree. In addition to this income, he was also granted four pounds a year for scholarship. Although he was successful academically, he began to run up debt in order to pay for his extravagant lifestyle while at the college.|$|E
500|$|She {{was paid}} off into reserve at Portsmouth Dockyard on 24 December and {{received}} permanent repairs of her {{damage from the}} grounding, {{at a cost of}} £200,000.

The Admiralty had considered converting her to that configuration, with an island, in July 1918 while still building, but had decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> the results of tests conducted with Argus evaluating different designs for the island. Vindictive was thought to be too small to be an effective carrier and the financial restrictions in place after the war vitiated against such a major reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{slated for}} a March 2, 2012 release, {{the film was}} pushed by Paramount Pictures to a ten-month delay for January 11, 2013. Co-producer Kevin Messick later said: [...] "We’d {{finished}} it but we were still discussing adding a coda scene, which {{we were able to}} shoot. And there was always the consideration that Jeremy [...] had Avengers and Bourne coming out. So the studio made a wise strategic move in finding a good release date for us." [...] Wirkola said that [...] "the main reason is because they wanted <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> Jeremy. He was cast before , Bourne and The Avengers. They wanted to wait until after those. I was, of course, disappointed then, but actually it helped because we came in under budget" [...] and so the delay enabled him to re-add and shoot an additional scene that is set in the desert and which was cut from his original screenplay. The first trailer for the film was released on September 5, 2012.|$|E
