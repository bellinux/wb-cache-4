5|$|Although {{he was not}} {{prominently}} {{involved in}} the May Revolution that deposed Cisneros, he was appointed as secretary of war of the new government, the Primera Junta. Along with Juan José Castelli, he promoted harsh policies against the supporters of the former government and the strengthening of the new one. These policies were detailed at a secret document, the Operations plan; some historians dispute its authorship. Moreno organized military campaigns to Paraguay and Upper Peru, and ensured the execution of Santiago de Liniers after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He established the first Argentine newspaper, La Gazeta de Buenos Ayres, and translated Jean-Jacques Rousseau's <b>The</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Contract</b> into Spanish.|$|E
5|$|The riots {{caused a}} major change in the government's {{approach}} to racial issues, and led to the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP). The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>contract.</b>|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{was born}} in Buenos Aires in 1764. He {{was the first of}} eight {{children}} born to a Venetian doctor, Ángel Castelli Salomón, and Josefa Villarino, who was a relative of Manuel Belgrano. He was trained by the Jesuits shortly before their expulsion, and attended the Real Colegio de San Carlos in Buenos Aires. As was customary, one of the children of the Castelli family was ordained into the priesthood, and Juan José was chosen for this. He was sent to study at the Colegio Monserrat, part of the University of Córdoba. He was influenced by the works of Voltaire and Diderot, and especially by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's <b>The</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Contract.</b> He was a fellow student of men who would later have influence in the public life of South America, including Saturnino Rodríguez Peña, Juan José Paso, Manuel Alberti, Pedro Medrano, and Juan Martínez de Rozas, among others. He focused on studying philosophy and theology, but when his father died in 1785, he abandoned his career in the priesthood, for which he felt no strong vocation.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{tendency}} in contemporary STS studies to oppose deficit models and democratic models of science popularization. This opposition usually relies on a so-called new <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> for science and technology and can be formulated as follows: whereas <b>the</b> old <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> implied a deficit model of science popularization, <b>the</b> new <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> implies a democratic and not a deficit model. In this article, I defend the thesis that such an opposition is ill founded for two reasons. In the first place, <b>the</b> new <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> is compatible with different democratic models of science popularization, and these models are not necessarily compatible among themselves. In the second place, some of these democratic models can also be described as deficit models. In this sense, the question about how to understand science popularization {{in the framework of}} <b>the</b> new <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> for science and technology remains unanswered...|$|R

5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The {{first is the}} Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned with feeling than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, <b>The</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Contract,</b> influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E
5|$|Mariano Moreno {{was the son}} of poor parents, Manuel Moreno y Argumosa and Ana Maria Valle, he had {{fourteen}} siblings. He {{studied at}} Colegio Grande de San Carlos, but without living in it, as his family could not afford the price. He graduated with an honor diploma. He met influential people within the literary field, who helped him to continue his studies at the University of Chuquisaca, even when his father could not afford the cost. This was the only big university in South America at the time. He studied the books of Montesquieu, Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and other European philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment. He studied English and French languages as well, to understand authors from Britain and France. This allowed him to work as a translator, and he spent several years working with Rousseau's <b>The</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Contract.</b> Moreno was convinced that society could be changed by the power of intelligence and reason.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> {{theory of}} {{political}} philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>contracts</b> theory claims that, {{in social}} {{exchange}} circumstances, human reasoning {{is not necessarily}} led by logic, but by certain evolved mental mechanisms that are useful for catching offenders. An emblematic experiment carried out with the intention to prove this thesis is the first experiment described by Fiddick, Cosmides, and Tooby in their paper of 2000. Lopez Astorga has questioned that experiment claiming that its results depend on an underlying conditional logical form not taken into account by Fiddick, Cosmides, and Tooby. In this paper, I propose an explanation alternative to that of Lopez Astorga, which {{does not depend on}} logical forms and is based on the mental models theory. Thus, I conclude that this other alternative explanation is one more proof that the experiment in question does not demonstrate the fundamental thesis of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>contracts</b> theory...|$|R
30|$|To further refine our assertions, we {{applied a}} context-specific view based on RDT and SCT {{focussing}} on {{autonomy of the}} involved LSPs and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>contracts</b> embedded in <b>the</b> alliance.

25|$|In 2005, {{the issue}} of the Constitution and its {{provisions}} was also brought up by several politicians within the government itself. Lim Keng Yaik of the Gerakan party, which by now had joined Barisan Nasional, the ruling coalition, asked for a re-examination of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> so that a Bangsa Malaysia (literally 'Malaysian race' or 'Malaysian nation' in the Malay language) could be achieved. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> is the Constitution's provisions with regard to the different races' privileges—those who defend it and Article 153 often define <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> as providing the Indians and Chinese with citizenship in exchange for the Malays' special rights or ketuanan Melayu.|$|E

30|$|Also from a SCT {{perspective}} symmetrical {{power relations}} and asymmetrical power relations differ substantially. SCT provides a legitimacy perspective where legitimization of activities within {{a relationship is}} provided or denied via <b>social</b> <b>contracts</b> [26, 46]. These contracts are “norms, assumptions, and beliefs that [alliance members] conceive as fair and appropriate [i.e., legitimate] for parties involved in [alliance] relationships” [47, p. 67] and are embedded in any inter-firm relationship. Whenever any activities in the alliance run counter to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>contracts,</b> this will create tension and evoke reactance by alliance members [26].|$|R

25|$|Jean-Jacques Rousseau {{was hired}} in July 1743 as Secretary by comte de Montaigu, who had been named Ambassador of the French in Venice.

25|$|In 1974 Labour {{returned}} {{to power and}} introduced <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Contract</b> which implemented a voluntary incomes policy, {{with the backing of}} many left wing union leaders such as Hugh Scanlon and Jack Jones. This period also saw {{an increase in the number}} of full-time union convenors, and these factors along with an increase in unemployment have been blamed by Tony Cliff and the SWP for a drastic fall in union militancy. In 1974 the IS was ambitious and optimistic expecting to double the number of its factory branches over the next year. In practice they declined swiftly from 38 in 1974 to only three or four by 1976. When the firefighters went on strike in 1977 against <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Contract</b> the IS was unable to deliver any significant solidarity. The national rank and file movement fell apart.

25|$|Although the Supreme Court {{permitted}} strikebreakers to {{be hired}} under the Mackay doctrine, replacement workers remained largely unused by employers from the mid-1930s to the early 1970s. Scholars attribute this to a gentlemen's agreement or social contract under which American employers and unions both agreed to seek labor peace. The increased use of strikebreakers {{began in the late}} 1960s, and trended significantly upward in the early 1970. President Ronald Reagan's replacement of striking air traffic controllers in 1981 reinforced the trend, perhaps sundering <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> permanently.|$|E

25|$|French {{philosophers}} {{produced some}} of the most important political works of the Age of Enlightenment. In The Spirit of the Laws, Baron de Montesquieu theorised the principle of separation of powers, which has been implemented in all liberal democracies since it was first applied in the United States. In <b>The</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Contract,</b> Jean-Jacques Rousseau openly criticised the European divine right monarchies and strongly affirmed the principle of the sovereignty of the people. Voltaire came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion.|$|E
25|$|Liberalism {{first became}} a {{distinct}} political movement during the Age of Enlightenment, {{when it became}} popular among philosophers and economists in the Western world. Liberalism rejected the prevailing social and political norms of hereditary privilege, state religion, absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings. The 17th-century philosopher John Locke is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct philosophical tradition. Locke argued that each man has a natural right to life, liberty and property, while adding that governments must not violate these rights based on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>contract.</b> Liberals opposed traditional conservatism and sought to replace absolutism in government with representative democracy {{and the rule of}} law.|$|E
25|$|The Restoration {{was also}} the time when John Locke wrote many of his {{philosophical}} works. Locke's empiricism was an attempt at understanding the basis of human understanding itself and thereby devising a proper manner for making sound decisions. These same scientific methods led Locke to his Two Treatises of Government, which later inspired the thinkers in the American Revolution. As with his work on understanding, Locke moves from the most basic units of society toward the more elaborate, and, like Thomas Hobbes, he emphasises the plastic nature of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>contract.</b> For an age that had seen absolute monarchy overthrown, democracy attempted, democracy corrupted, and limited monarchy restored; only a flexible basis for government could be satisfying.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{multiple}} (economic, ecological, social and political) crisis has arisen from recent tumultuous economic events. This paper uses a feminist perspective {{to present the}} concept as a crisis of regeneration of both nature and social reproduction. We intend to go beyond multiple crisis using {{the notion of a}} new <b>social</b> <b>contract,</b> to overcome this crisis in a transformative way towards sustainability. A feminist analysis of <b>the</b> concept of <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> is founded on the critique of domination and is based on Carole Pateman's, 1988 thesis that <b>the</b> modern <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> is characterized by a "separating inclusion" of women. It also refers to Val Plumwood's critique of the separated and autonomous self, which is part of all classical conceptions of <b>social</b> <b>contract.</b> We argue that overcoming the multiple crisis requires overcoming structures of separation and re-envisioning concepts of the individual, by discussing the German example of a "Social Contract for Sustainability" (2011). If <b>the</b> notion of <b>social</b> <b>contract</b> is to become a catalyst for transformation processes leading to sustainability, it cannot be overarching but has to be developed as a multitude of small new <b>social</b> and local <b>contracts...</b>|$|R
