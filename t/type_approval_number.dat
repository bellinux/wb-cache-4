50|$|A CoC is a producer’s {{declaration}} car or motorcycles {{comply with}} the given approved type. This document contains information about the vehicle and its producer’s identification, <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>number,</b> other technical specifications. The content of a CoC {{is defined by the}} European regulation (Amendment IX, Regulation 92/53). Vehicles which do not {{comply with the}} EU specification (as vehicle manufactured for the U.S. or Japanese market) and older vehicles that have not been given the type approval of the EC yet, cannot have an existing CoC. Similarly, {{it is not possible to}} issue a CoC for converted vehicles; in this case another technical document might help register your car. Only car and motorcycles are eligible.|$|E
5000|$|All tires {{sold for}} road use in Europe after July 1997 must carry an E-mark. The mark itself is either an upper case [...] "E" [...] or lower case [...] "e" [...] - {{followed}} by a number in a circle or rectangle, {{followed by a}} further number. An (upper case) [...] "E" [...] indicates that the tire is certified {{to comply with the}} dimensional, performance and marking requirements of ECE regulation 30. A (lower case) [...] "e" [...] indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance and marking requirements of Directive 92/23/EEC. The number in the circle or rectangle denotes the country code of the government that granted the <b>type</b> <b>approval.</b> The last <b>number</b> outside the circle or rectangle is the <b>number</b> of the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> certificate issued for that particular tire size and type.|$|R
50|$|Although all countries' <b>type</b> <b>approvals</b> {{are legally}} equivalent, {{there are real}} and {{perceived}} differences in the rigour with which the regulations and protocols are applied by different national <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> authorities. Some countries have their own national standards for granting <b>type</b> <b>approvals,</b> which may be more stringent than called for by the UN regulations themselves. Within the auto parts industry, a German (E1) <b>type</b> <b>approval,</b> for example, {{is regarded as a}} measure of insurance against suspicion of poor quality or an undeserved <b>type</b> <b>approval.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> {{is not a}} term {{confined}} to a particular industry. <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> requirements exist for products as diverse as marine equipment, mobile phones, automotive industry, or medical equipment. <b>Type</b> <b>approval</b> simply means that the product is certified to meet certain requirements for its type, whatever that may be.|$|R
50|$|The 1958 Agreement {{operates}} {{on the principles}} of type approval and reciprocal recognition. Any country that accedes to the 1958 Agreement has authority to test and approve any manufacturer's design of a regulated product, regardless of the country in which that component was produced. Each individual design from each individual manufacturer is counted as one individual type. Once any acceding country grants a type approval, every other acceding country is obliged to honor that type approval and regard that vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment as legal for import, sale and use.Items type-approved according to a UN Regulation are marked with an E and a number, within a circle. The number indicates which country approved the item, and other surrounding letters and digits indicate the precise version of the regulation met and the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>number,</b> respectively.|$|E
50|$|It {{simplifies}} the documentation, designates the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>number</b> {{of a separate}} technical unit by a certificate of conformity, and defines the vehicles, individual technical unit(s), and component(s). Certificates of Conformity, as specified in Annex IX of EU Directive 92/53, will be required for an automobile to enter into service. For component approvals, an endorsement that is issued under the relevant regulations by the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) is recognised as equivalent to an approval granted under comparable EU legislation. In March 1992, the EU Council formally adopted the few remaining pieces of component-related legislation {{that are necessary to}} make the whole-vehicle type approval a reality for passenger cars. In June 1992, EU member state officials approved the adoption of EU legislation creating a single system for the certification of passenger cars, in turn defining the safety, and other technical, requirements. Legislation established an EU type approval system to replace the national schemes of the twelve member states. In 1996, the EU type approval system became mandatory.|$|E

50|$|Hong Kong has {{independent}} traffic laws from mainland China. Electric {{bikes are}} considered motorcycles in Hong Kong, and therefore need <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> from the Transport Department, just as automobiles. All electric bikes available in Hong Kong {{fail to meet}} the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> requirement, and the Transport Department has never granted any <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> for an electric bike, making all electric bikes effectively illegal in Hong Kong. Even if they got <b>type</b> <b>approval,</b> the driver would need a motorcycle driving license to ride. As a side note, Hong Kong doesn't have a moped vehicle class (and therefore no moped driving license), and mopeds are considered motorcycles too.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles with an EU <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> can {{be marketed}} {{anywhere}} in the European Community. Therefore, a vehicle only needs to receive the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> certification in one EU country {{in order to be}} accepted in all of the other member countries. To receive a <b>type</b> <b>approval,</b> products may either be brought to a testing facility or manufacturers may opt to maintain their own testing equipment. Nevertheless, US and EU automobiles still must be certified to this single set of rules by an authorised member state agency. A similar system was adopted for the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> of two- and three-wheeled vehicles, which became effective on 1 January 1994.|$|R
50|$|<b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> or Certificate of Conformity {{is granted}} to {{a product that}} meets a minimum set of regulatory, {{technical}} and safety requirements. Generally, <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> is required before a product is allowed to be sold in a particular country, so the requirements for a given product will vary around the world. Processes and certifications known as <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> in English are generally called Homologation, or some cognate expression, in other European languages.|$|R

5000|$|Only {{when both}} {{parts of the}} testing are {{completed}} and the equipment fully meets the specifications in the relevant HOSDB Speedmeter Handbook will the equipment be recommended to the Secretary of State to be awarded UK <b>Type</b> <b>Approval.</b> Once recommended an administrative process takes place between the Home Office and the UK manufacturer or distributing agent in which a contract (<b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> Agreement) is exchanged and agreed between both parties. When that contract is signed then a <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> Certificate is signed by a minister at the Home Office; the equipment can then be used to produce certifiable evidence, evidence of speeding that is admissible in UK courts {{without the support of}} a witness. There is no requirement to place the <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> Agreement or Certificate of <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> before Parliament because the Statutory Instrument defining the [...] "type" [...] of equipment has already been fully ratified by both Houses of Parliament.|$|R

50|$|Certificates of Conformity {{have been}} defined in EU’s Single Internal Market and <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> Directive (EC-92).

The greatest impact of this effort {{has been in the}} area of standards in the automotive sector. The EU Commission is seeking to harmonise the automotive, technical and environmental standards between all the member states. EU legislation defines the standards in the areas of noise, particle emissions and safety. In addition, the EU’s directive on <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> (EU Council Directive 92/53) eliminates the need for national <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> requirements by establishing one set of rules for automobiles and their components throughout the EU. This directive aims at the clarification of the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> procedure for motor vehicles, separate technical units (i.e., trailers), and components.|$|R

40|$|Real-world CO 2 {{emissions}} of passenger cars very often deviate from the <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> value. The <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> value for CO 2 {{emissions of}} passenger cars {{is based on}} a chassis dynamometer test in a laboratory. The total vehicle resistance of a vehicle, or 'road load', is simulated on the chassis dynamometer to obtain representative emissions. The road load of a vehicle is determined by means of a coast down test. As a large number of parameters and external conditions influence the coast down test, the <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> procedures for performing the coast down test allow for certain margins within which certain test parameters should lie. These margins can partly explain the difference between the real-world and <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> CO 2 emissions. TNO investigated the effect of variations in test parameters during the execution of a coast down test on the vehicle’s road load by performing a series of coast down measurements.
