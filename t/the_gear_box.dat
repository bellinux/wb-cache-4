Gearbox and engine mounts are often replaced with urethane or aluminum mounts, and dampers added to control the violent motion of the engine and gearbox under these conditions.

5000|$|A {{non-synchronous}} {{transmission is}} a form of transmission based on gears that do not use synchronizing mechanisms.

40|$|Landing gear {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{prominent}} airframe noise sources. Techniques that diminish gear noise and suppress its radiation to the ground are highly desirable. Using a hybrid computational approach, this paper investigates the noise reduction potential of devices added to a simplified main landing gear model without small scale geometric details. The Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation is used to predict the noise at far-field observer locations from surface pressure data provided by unsteady CFD calculations. Because of the simplified nature of the model, most of the flow unsteadiness is restricted to low frequencies. <b>The</b> wheels, <b>gear</b> <b>boxes,</b> and oleo appear to be the primary sources of unsteadiness at these frequencies. The addition of fairings around <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> and wheels, and the attachment of a splitter plate on the downstream side of the oleo significantly reduces the noise over a wide range of frequencies, but a dramatic increase in noise is observed at one frequency. The increased flow velocities, a consequence of the more streamlined bodies, appear to generate extra unsteadiness around other parts giving rise to the additional noise. Nonetheless, the calculations demonstrate the capability of the devices to improve overall landing gear noise...|$|R
