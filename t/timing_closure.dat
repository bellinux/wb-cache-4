50|$|For ICs, SI {{analysis}} became {{necessary as}} {{an effect of}} reduced design rules. In {{the early days of}} the modern VLSI era, digital chip circuit design and layout were manual processes. The use of abstraction and the application of automatic synthesis techniques have since allowed designers to express their designs using high-level languages and apply an automated design process to create very complex designs, ignoring the electrical characteristics of the underlying circuits to a large degree. However, scaling trends (see Moore's law) brought electrical effects back to the forefront in recent technology nodes. With scaling of technology below 0.25 µm, the wire delays have become comparable or even greater than the gate delays. As a result, the wire delays needed to be considered to achieve <b>timing</b> <b>closure.</b> In nanometer technologies at 0.13 µm and below, unintended interactions between signals (e.g. crosstalk) became an important consideration for digital design. At these technology nodes, the performance and correctness of a design cannot be assured without considering noise effects.|$|E

Wound <b>closure</b> <b>timing</b> was compared between IFI and non-IFI control wounds (with/without bacterial infections). IFI wound closure was also as-sessed according to mold species isolation. Eighty-two IFI wounds and 136 non-IFI wounds (63 with skin and soft tissue infections [SSTIs] and 73 without) were examined.

40|$|Abstract — Net {{weighting}} {{is a key}} {{technique in}} timing driven placement (TDP), which {{plays a crucial role}} for deep submiron VLSI physical synthesis and <b>timing</b> <b>closure.</b> A popular way to assign net weight is based on its slack, such that the worst negative slack (WNS) of the entire circuit may be minimized. While WNS is an important optimization metric, another figure of merit (FOM), defined as the total slack difference compared to a certain slack threshold for all timing end points, is of equivalent importance to measure the overall <b>timing</b> <b>closure</b> result for highly complex modern ASIC and microprocessor designs. Moreover, to optimally assign net weight for <b>timing</b> <b>closure,</b> the effect of net weighting on timing should be carefully studied. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the wire length, slack and FOM sensitivities to the net weight, and propose a new net weighting scheme based on those sensitivities. Such sensitivity analysis implicitly takes potential physical synthesis effect into consideration. The experiments on a set of industrial circuits show promising results for both stand-alone timing driven placement and physical synthesis afterwards...|$|E
