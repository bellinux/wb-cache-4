Sources for these renditions include books by folklorists and commercial recordings by shanty revival performers. The forms these performers produce tend to be quite standardized and relate to their source material {{similar to the way}} a cover song does. This can be contrasted with the method of performers focusing on maritime music, who <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> themselves as operating within that genre or a tradition, and who develop their repertoire from multiple sources and through various experiences.|$|E

The most famous runestones and those that people <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> are those that tell of foreign voyages, but they comprise only c. 10% of all runestones, and they were raised in usually memory of those not having returned from Viking expeditions and not as tributes to those having returned. These runestones contain roughly the same message as the majority of the runestones, which is that people wanted to commemorate one or several dead kinsmen.|$|E

In polls taken across Europe 2006, British Muslims hold the most negative view of westerners out of all Muslims in Europe, whilst overall in Britain 63% of British hold the most favourable view of Muslims out of all the European countries (down from 67% the year before).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the educational proposals and reforms that {{were carried out}} during the interregnum of José I in Spain.

In that respect, the educational policy of «Intruder king» <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> modernize education so as {{to turn it into a}} social control device. However, traditional Spanish tendencies, very present even in the nineteenth century, turned this into a difficult task, since educational proposals moved between ancient and modern tendencies without being able to consolidate a state education system...|$|R
5000|$|One {{feature of}} the boomers was that they have <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{themselves}} as a special generation, very different from those that had come before. In the 1960s, as the relatively large numbers of young people became teenagers and young adults, they, and those around them, created a very specific rhetoric around their cohort, and the changes they were bringing about. This rhetoric had an important impact in the self perceptions of the boomers, {{as well as their}} tendency to define {{the world in terms of}} generations, which was a relatively new phenomenon. The baby boom has been described variously as a [...] "shockwave" [...] and as [...] "the pig in the python." ...|$|R

50|$|Mean world {{syndrome}} {{is a term}} coined by George Gerbner to describe a phenomenon whereby violence-related content of mass media makes viewers believe {{that the world is}} more dangerous than it actually is.

Gerbner, a pioneer researcher on the effects of television on society, argued that people who watch television <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the world as an intimidating and unforgiving place. A direct correlation between the amount of television one watches and the amount of fear one harbors about the world has been proven, although the direction of causality remains debatable in that persons fearful of the world may be more likely to retreat from it and in turn spend more time in indoor, solitary activity such as television watching.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea that}} one {{organism}} reproduces by {{giving birth to}} a similar organism, or producing seeds that grow to a similar organism, {{goes back to the}} earliest days of farming. While people <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> this as a relatively stable process, many thought that change was possible. The term species was just used as a term for a sort or kind of organism, until in 1686 John Ray introduced the biological concept that species were distinguished by always producing the same species, and this was fixed and permanent, though considerable variation was possible within a species. Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778) formalized the taxonomic rank of species, and devised the two part naming system of binomial nomenclature that we use today. However, this did not prevent disagreements on the best way to identify species.|$|R
