Methods　HPMCs were induced by 50 mmol/L glucose for 72 hours, the expressions of epithelium-cadherin (E-cadherin), KLF- 4, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and miRNA- 143 were detected by Real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. <b>The</b> treated <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> <b>transfected</b> with LV-KLF- 4 and inhibitor, <b>the</b> untreated <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> <b>transfected</b> with shRNA-KLF- 4 and mimic. The mRNA and protein expressions of KLF- 4, E-cadherin, α-SMA, CTGF and miRNA- 143 were detected by Real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Results　Real-time PCR showed that the expression of E-cadherin decreased and of α-SMA, CTGF and miRNA- 143 increased, but of KLF- 4 not changed in high glucose treated cells. Western blotting showed that the expression of KLF- 4 and E-cadherin decreased. Up-regulating KLF- 4 increased the expression of E-cadherin, but decreased the expression of α-SMA and CTGF. Down-regulating KLF- 4 decreased the expression of E-cadherin, but augment the expression of α-SMA and CTGF.

KCNQ channels (Kv 7) require mem-brane phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) and are turned off when muscarinic receptors stimulate cleavage of PIP 2 by PLC. We test whether diacylglycerols are also important in the regulation of KCNQ 2 /KCNQ 3 channels using electrophysiology and fluorescent translocation probes as indicators for PIP 2 and diacylglycerol in tsA <b>cells.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> <b>transfected</b> with M 1 muscarinic receptors, channel subunits, and translocation probes. Although they cause translocation of a fluorescent probe with a diacylglycerol-binding C 1 domain, exogenously applied diacylglycerol (oleoyl-acetyl-glycerol and diocta-noyl glycerol) and phorbol ester do not mimic or occlude the suppression of KCNQ current by muscarinic agonist. Blocking the metabolism of endogenous diacylglycerol by inhibiting diacylglycerol kinase with R 59022 or R 59949 slows the decay of diacylglycerol twofold but does not mimic or occlude muscarinic regulation and recovery of current. Blocking diacylglycerol lipase with RHC- 80267 also does not occlude muscarinic modulation of current.

40|$|Two G protein-coupled receptors (Edg- 2) and (Edg- 4) for the lysolipid {{phosphoric acid}} {{mediator}} lysophosphatidic acid {{have been described}} by molecular cloning. However, the calcium-mobilizing receptor Edg- 4 is not expressed in some cell lines that exhibit robust calcium responses to this ligand, thus pre-dicting the existence of additional receptor subtypes. We report here on the characterization of a third human lysophosphatidic acid receptor subtype, Edg- 7, which mediates lysophospha-tidic acid-evoked calcium mobilization. In a rat hepatoma Rh 7777 cell line that lacks endogenous responses to lysophos-phatidic acid, this lipid mediator, but not others, evokes cal-cium transients when <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> have <b>been</b> <b>transfected</b> with Edg- 7 or Edg- 4 DNAs. Furthermore, frog oocytes exhibit a calcium-mediated chloride conductance in response to mam...|$|R
40|$|Articular chondrocytes <b>are</b> <b>the</b> main <b>cell</b> {{population}} in cartilage, and damage {{to them is}} a key step in osteoarthritis. There are chondrocyte-based strategies to treat osteoarthritis, among which includes nonviral gene therapy. However, so far there is no ideal way to achieve this because chondrocyte <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> very difficult to transfect. Also, an effective tracking system to evaluate exogenous DNA delivery in chondrocytes is {{a necessary part of}} this strategy. Here, we show our development of a novel tracking system by labelling cell membranes, nuclei, and plasmids, without disturbing their expression, to view the intracellular behaviour of plasmids before, after, and during the entire transfection process. We applied this system to compare the intracellular behaviour of exogenous DNA in chondrocytes and cancer cells. We also used this system to compare the intracellular behaviour of exogenous DNA which <b>is</b> <b>transfected</b> by liposomes or polymers. Finally, we discovered that when transfected by liposomes, exogenous DNA has a quicker cell entry and nucleus entry in cancer cells than in chondrocytes, and the transfection efficiency is higher in cancer cells than in chondrocytes. When <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> <b>transfected</b> by polymers, exogenous DNA has <b>the</b> same quick <b>cell</b> entry and nucleus entry in both types of <b>cells.</b> However, <b>the</b> transfection efficiency was higher in cancer cells than in chondrocytes. Applying this system has proved to be simple, easy to operate, repeatable, and stable and it enables tracking of the behaviour of plasmid DNA before and after expression. Meanwhile, the rate-limiting zones of exogenous plasmid DNA in living cells and a comprehensive overview of the expression and transfection efficiency of DNA can also be obtained through this system, making it ideal for the research and development of nonviral DNA delivery systems...|$|R
