5|$|After {{the death}} of the Member {{intestate}} in 1820, <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was inherited by his younger brother George Ferguson (1748–1820), who died shortly after inheriting <b>the</b> <b>estate.</b> He was succeeded by his illegitimate son George Ferguson who, despite incurring severe debts, continued to develop <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> by adding a stable block, race course, an observation tower and other follies. He had huge gambling debts, and although <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> had been valued at £300,000 when he inherited it, he sold off many of the farms and other parts of <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> to raise funds. Despite these injections of funds, when he died <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was mortgaged to the extent of £250,000. It was further decimated by his son, George Arthur Ferguson (1835–1924). George Arthur was sequestrated, and what remained of <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was marketed in 1909. It was eventually sold in mid-1926, and the mansion house was knocked down.|$|E
5|$|Ashton Court is {{a mansion}} house and estate {{to the west}} of Bristol in England. Although <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> lies mainly in North Somerset, it is owned by the City of Bristol. The mansion and stables are a Grade I listed building. Other {{structures}} on <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> are also listed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1894 Ordnance Survey, roughly 50% of <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was complete. The entire {{southern}} half of <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> between Gladstone Avenue and Westbury Avenue at this point remained open fields.|$|E
50|$|Only <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> of <b>the</b> {{realm of}} Sweden proper were {{represented}} in the Riksdag of <b>the</b> <b>Estates.</b> In Sweden this included <b>the</b> fourth <b>estate,</b> <b>the</b> Peasants.|$|R
50|$|It {{was created}} in the model of <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> General that already existed in the Court of Pamplona, <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> General of France, and in Béarn and other provinces. The last meeting of <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> of Lower Navarre was on 15 June 1789.|$|R
5000|$|The deputies {{representing}} <b>the</b> Second <b>Estate</b> (<b>the</b> nobility) at <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> General of 1484 {{wanted all}} foreigners to be prohibited from command {{positions in the}} military. [...] The deputies of <b>the</b> Third <b>Estate</b> (<b>the</b> merchants and traders) wanted taxes to be drastically reduced and that the revenue needs of the crown be met by reducing royal pensions and the number offices. [...] All three of <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> were in agreement on the demand {{for an end to}} the sale of government offices. [...] By 7 March 1484, the King announced that he was leaving Tours because of poor health. Five days later the deputies were told that there was no more money to pay their salaries, and <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> General meekly concluded its business and went home. <b>The</b> <b>Estates</b> General of 1484 is called, by historians, <b>the</b> most important <b>Estates</b> General until <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> General of 1789. [...] Important as they were, many of the reforms suggested at the meeting of <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> General were not immediately adopted. Rather the reforms would only be acted on when Louis XII came to the throne.|$|R
5|$|During the 19thcentury <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> {{was again}} {{affected}} by transport projects. In 1804 the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was opened, replacing the Mersey and Irwell Navigation; this {{cut off the}} northern part of <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> making it only accessible by a bridge. The Grand Junction Railway was built across <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> in 1837, followed by the Warrington and Chester Railway, which opened in 1850; both of these lines affected the southeast part of <b>the</b> <b>estate.</b> In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was replaced by the Manchester Ship Canal, and {{the northern part of}} <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> could only be accessed by a swing bridge. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was almost completely demolished in 1928. Rubble from the house was used in the foundations of a new chemical works. During the demolition, the undercroft was retained and roofed with a cap of concrete. In 1966 the current SirRichard Brooke gave Norton Priory in trust {{for the benefit of the}} public.|$|E
5|$|Gilpin Gorst bought <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> in 1815 {{at public}} auction, {{and his son}} sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824. When London Bridge was {{replaced}} in 1826, Usborne bought pieces of the stone balustrades, which date to 1209, and erected them behind the White House around the Buffalo Lawn. <b>The</b> <b>estate</b> changed ownership more times, but these families did not maintain the property and it fell into disrepair by 1900. Reverend Cranshaw, a local resident, bought <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> in 1911 and was the last owner prior to the Boy Scout Association, {{as it was then}} known.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>estate</b> had a role, {{together}} with the Acland family's other Exmoor estate of Pixton, as a home of West Country staghunting in the 18th century. There was some controversy locally and nationally when the National Trust banned staghunting on <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> in the early 21st century.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Estates</b> of Lower Navarre was {{composed}} of deputies from the three Estates: <b>the</b> First <b>Estate</b> (clergy), <b>the</b> Second <b>Estate</b> (nobility) and <b>the</b> Third <b>Estate</b> (commoners), each deputy having one vote.|$|R
50|$|From 1738 <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> could remove councillors {{to create}} a {{majority}} corresponding to that of <b>the</b> <b>Estates,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> also appointing <b>the</b> President of the Chancellery (the prime minister), along party lines.The Freedom of the Press Act (1766) was also passed during this period.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>estate</b> of Craigie is {{recorded}} {{as belonging to}} one John de Craigie in the reign of David I (1124–1153). In 1387 <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> passed by marriage to John Stewart, son of Sir Robert Stewart of Durisdeer. The Stewarts sold <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> which by this time had a tower house, in 1643 to John Fairholm, treasurer to the City of Edinburgh. In 1682 John Fairholm's granddaughter Sophia, aged only 14, married William Johnstone, 2nd Earl of Annandale, and Craigiehall changed ownership again. Only two built features on <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> date from before this time; the 17th century east sundial, and the ruined doocot, or pigeon house, dated 1672. The east sundial {{is one of only}} 25 obelisk-type sundials in Scotland, and was re-erected to the east of the house in 1965, after being found in a field to the south of the house.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>estate</b> was requisitioned by the War Ministry from 1940–1945 {{as a local}} command, training, and {{ordnance}} centre. Little {{remains at}} <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> from World War II, except the hole created by a bomb dropped by the Luftwaffe. It was enlarged and is now used for swimming and canoeing.|$|E
5|$|The first John Savage succeeded Margaret, {{and nine}} more {{followed}} him. The tenth died young, so <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> passed to his brother, Thomas Savage. In 1626 CharlesI created {{the title of}} Viscount Savage for him. On his death <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> passed to his daughter Joan, who later married John Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester. Joan died during childbirth {{at the age of}} 23, and <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> passed to the Marquess. The Marquess practised Catholicism, and in 1643 <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was confiscated due to persecution of Catholics in the English Civil War.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} by <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> of <b>the</b> Dauphiné (along with Jean Joseph Mounier and Antoine Barnave) to <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> General of 1789, {{as one of their}} representatives to <b>the</b> Second <b>Estate.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{protect the}} monarchy, Haugwitz {{recommended}} a standing army of 108,000 supported by contributions by <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> of 14 million gulden. To avoid the previous issues in estates' withholding of contributions, or the tedious process of frequent appeals to <b>the</b> <b>estates,</b> Haugwitz instituted <b>the</b> Ten Years’ Recess. Under this program, despite {{the resistance of}} <b>the</b> <b>estates,</b> <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> would guarantee payment for ten years. This period abolished the previous fluctuations in finances. Previously, when taxes were levied from <b>the</b> <b>estates,</b> <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> disagreed amongst themselves over the amount levied, divided the sum among <b>the</b> various <b>estates,</b> collected taxes from the peasantry, deducted from these taxes and then distributed the remainder to the monarchy. In this reform, Representationen und Cammern collected the taxes in order that the greatest portion of the levy would be distributed to the monarchy.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Estates</b> Theatre has {{undergone}} several {{changes in its}} history. It first acquired the name Royal Theatre of <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> in 1798 when it was purchased by <b>the</b> Czech <b>Estates.</b> With <b>the</b> opening of the Provisional Theatre in 1862, the Theatre of <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> was dedicated to a German ensemble and renamed the Royal Provincial German Theatre. During the period between 1920 and 1948 the theatre regained the name Theatre of <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> and became affiliated with the National Theatre. In 1948 the theatre was renamed the Tyl Theatre (after dramatist J.K. Tyl) and would be known as such until 1990 when, {{at the end of}} an eight-year reconstruction project, it became known again as <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> Theatre.|$|R
5|$|The {{first three}} lairds {{transformed}} <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> into a valuable asset. Lord Pitfour, the second laird, purchased additional lands including Deer Abbey and Inverugie Castle. Pitfour's son, James Ferguson, {{who became the}} third laird, continued to improve and expand <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> by adding the lake and bridges, and establishing planned villages. The third laird died a bachelor with no children, so <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> passed to the elderly George Ferguson, who was only in possession of the property for a few months. George was already a wealthy man, owning lands in Trinidad and Tobago, but despite not directly improving the Pitfour estate he added considerable value to the inheritance passed to his illegitimate son. The extravagant lifestyles of the fifth and sixth lairds led to the sequestration of <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> which was sold off piecemeal to pay their debts.|$|E
5|$|The {{land was}} {{granted to the}} Bishop of Worcester {{as part of the}} Kingdom of Mercia before the Norman conquest. During this time, when it was the {{property}} of the church, <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> had a chapel dedicated to Saint Blaise, which has given <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> its name. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was granted to Ralph Sadler who let it to tenants until 1675. A large part of <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> was bought by Sir Samuel Astry of Henbury.|$|E
5|$|Though Favre {{lived in}} Hancock County in West Florida, {{and died in}} Mobile, Mississippi Territory, {{documents}} concerning his estate were also filed in New Orleans, Louisiana, probably by his Hancock County attorney, Rutillius Pray of Pearlington. By 1826 <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> had been partially settled, and during the October court term Pray submitted a final settlement showing total sales from <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> of just under $27,000 (including nearly $22,000 for slaves), while total debts amounted to nearly $33,000. However, taking into account unsold assets, <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> {{appears to have been}} solvent.|$|E
50|$|The Scottish Parliament (also {{known as}} <b>the</b> Three <b>Estates)</b> and <b>the</b> Convention of <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> were unicameral legislatures, so Commissioners sat {{alongside}} prelates (<b>the</b> first <b>estate)</b> {{and members of}} the nobility (<b>the</b> second <b>estate).</b>|$|R

5|$|According to Sorkin, {{the episode}} benefited greatly from input by two former White House employees. The scene where Donna stays {{up all night}} sorting through {{documents}} in cartons {{was the idea of}} Eli Attie, Al Gore's chief speechwriter. Meanwhile Gene Sperling, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, came up with the sub-plot involving <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> tax. Sorkin, however, had certain misgivings about <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> tax story's appeal, considering the prevalent bipartisan spirit of the time, {{in the aftermath of the}} 9/11 attacks.|$|E
50|$|Croes became {{politically}} active for the Aruban People's Party {{and in the}} 2009 general election he obtained a seat in <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> of Aruba with 1578 votes. He officially became a member on 30 October and shortly afterwards became Vice President of <b>the</b> <b>Estates.</b> He served as President of <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> between 21 June 2010 and October 2013. Croes became the youngest President of <b>the</b> <b>Estates</b> in <b>the</b> parliament's history. Croes maintained his seat in the 2013 general election.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Estates</b> or <b>the</b> States (États, Landstände, Staten) was the {{assembly}} of the representatives of <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> of <b>the</b> realm, the divisions of society in feudal times, called together for purposes of deliberation, legislation or taxation. A meeting of <b>the</b> <b>estates</b> that covered an entire kingdom was called an estates general.|$|R

5|$|After {{the death}} of George Pilkington (1516–97), <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> passed to his son, Robert, but it was by then in decline. Robert died in 1605. In 1611, the Pilkingtons sold Rivington Hall estate to Robert Lever and Thomas Breres.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Boy Scout Association bought {{adjoining}} land to increase <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> and {{protect it from}} rapidly approaching new developments. These areas are called The Quick, New Field, and Hilly Field. An additional purchase and a donation from South Africa in the early 1950s brought <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> to its present size. This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until the early 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added through the early 1970s. The Boy Scout Association was renamed The Scout Association in 1967.|$|E
5|$|At Geneviève's apartment, Robert says he {{must end}} their {{relationship}} but invites {{her to join}} them for a weekend retreat to Robert and Christine's country estate, La Colinière, in Sologne.
