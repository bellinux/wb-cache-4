NY41 crosses through the northeastern corner of the town of Freetown and the southern portion of the town of Solon {{on its way to the}} town of Cortlandville, where it intersects I-81 and US11 west of the village of McGraw. US11 and NY41 come <b>together</b> <b>here</b> and parallel I-81 westward toward the city of Cortland. Just east of the city line, I-81 veers north to avoid downtown Cortland while US11 and NY41 continue west across the Tioughnioga River and into the city.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{variety of}} {{surnames}} {{is found in}} the states of Maharashtra and Goa, which numbers more than the rest of India <b>together.</b> <b>Here</b> surnames are placed last, the order being: the given name, followed by the father's name, followed by the family name. The majority of surnames are derived from the place where the family lived, with the 'ker' (Marathi) or 'Kar'(Konkani) suffix, for example, Mumbaiker, Puneker, Aurangabadker or Tendulkar, Parrikar, Mangeshkar, Mahendrakar. Another common variety found in Maharashtra and Goa are the ones ending in 'e'. These are usually more archaic than the 'Kar's and usually denote medieval clans or professions like Rane, Salunkhe, Gupte, Bhonsle, Ranadive, Rahane, Hazare, Apte, Satpute, Shinde, Sathe, Londhe, Salve, Kale, Gore, Godbole, etc.|$|E

500|$|One shot {{created by}} Shade VFX {{is when the}} {{audience}} sees Matt Murdock's [...] "vision" [...] – {{the way that he}} [...] "sees" [...] using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones We Leave Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect {{was going to be in}} [...] "Daredevil" [...] when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work <b>together.</b> <b>Here,</b> the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variation}} on the [...] "show me the law" [...] argument, the [...] "there is no law requiring an income tax" [...] argument, and the [...] "IRS refuses to say what law makes U.S. citizens liable for income tax" [...] argument is the contention that the IRS has an affirmative duty to respond to taxpayer demands for an answer as to why taxpayers must pay income taxes. This argument is based on tax protester theories about both constitutional law and statutory law, but the constitutional and statutory arguments will be described <b>together</b> <b>here</b> for purposes of presentation.|$|E
2500|$|The Southern Oregon Coastal Mountains {{ecoregion}} is a geologically and botanically diverse ecoregion that is {{a transition}} zone between the Coast Range and the Siskiyou Mountains, which form part of the Klamath Mountains ecoregion to the east. Rising to an elevation of approximately , this region has the climate of the Coast Range but the varied lithology of the higher, more dissected Siskiyou Mountains, underlain by Jurassic sandstone, metamorphosed sediments, granite, and serpentinite. Distributions of northern and southern vegetation blend <b>together</b> <b>here</b> and species diversity is high. Douglas-fir, western hemlock, tanoak, Port Orford cedar, and western redcedar are present, along with salal, sword fern, vine maple, Oregon grape, rhododendron, California bay-laurel, bigleaf maple, grand fir, red alder, salmonberry, and oxalis. The region covers [...] in a remote area of Curry County in southwestern Oregon containing the Sixes and Elk River drainages.

2500|$|In 1935 Vollenhoven {{founded the}} “Association for Calvinistic Philosophy,” with Philosophia Reformata as its {{academic}} journal, Mededelingen to report its internal affairs, and Correspondentiebladen for exploratory discussions. Vollenhoven, {{who was the}} chairperson, opened the first meeting with the words: “ brings us <b>together</b> <b>here</b> is something glorious. It is not philosophy, for {{that is not what}} comes first in our lives. Rather it is the bond to God’s Word, for by grace we have learned to desire to live solely through Christ, [...] religion, as concern of the heart, has become the center of our whole existence.” Of philosophy, as then current, Vollenhoven said: “ knows nothing of a God as understood in the Scriptures; nothing of a heart that can only find rest in Him; nothing of world history, which lies anchored in the first and second Adam; also very little of the difference between life terrains, the distinction of which appears so necessary in daily life.” ...|$|E
2500|$|With the city's {{position}} at the junction of the [...] "Dreiländereck" [...] (Three-Countries Corner) and the compact municipal boundaries within the Basel region, most of Basel’s museums {{are located in the}} city of Basel and thus in the canton of Basel-City but quite a few of museums lie in the canton of Basel-Country. The Basel museum landscape can also be said to extend to the museums of the greater metropolitan area, such as those in the neighboring towns of Lörrach, Saint-Louis and Weil am Rhein, with the latter included in the annual Basel Museum Night through the participation of Vitra Design Museum in Weil. In view of the numerous municipal, regional and national administrative units that come <b>together</b> <b>here</b> as well as the broader agglomeration, it is difficult to produce a conclusive figure for the number of Basel museums. Yet even when taking a narrowly drawn perimeter, the total comes to at least three dozen institutions that house collections and make them accessible to the public. The Basel museums are also part of the German-French-Swiss [...] "Upper Rhine Museum Pass" [...] that was introduced in 1999. This covers a much wider area than the Basel region, however, extending via Strasbourg up to Mannheim.|$|E
