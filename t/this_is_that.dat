5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} is {{dated to}} {{the first half of}} the 4th century and is likely slightly older than Codex Sinaiticus, which was also transcribed in the 4th century. One argument to support <b>this,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Sinaiticus already has the, at that time, very new Eusebian Canon tables, but Vaticanus does not. Another is the slightly more archaic style of Vaticanus, and the complete absence of ornamentation.|$|E

25|$|The {{result of}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> trade and {{agriculture}} languished, and food became scarce. People went about {{crying in the}} markets and the highways, the numbers of sufferers being untold.|$|R
5|$|The modern view on <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> photons are, {{by virtue}} of their integer spin, bosons (as opposed to fermions with half-integer spin). By the spin-{{statistics}} theorem, all bosons obey Bose–Einstein statistics (whereas all fermions obey Fermi–Dirac statistics).|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface {{is proportional to}} the mean curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E
5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions {{it has to be}} extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E
50|$|The Brussels Pact had {{cultural}} and social clauses, concepts for the setting up of a 'Consultative Council'. The basis for <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a cooperation between Western nations would help {{stop the spread of}} Communism.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} to <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> you get multiple ND filters in one package, the disadvantage {{is a loss}} of image quality caused by both using two elements together and by combining two polarizing filters.|$|R
2500|$|... 1889 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the central government-sponsored policy of Russification. The impact of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> many of the Baltic German legal institutions were either abolished or had to do their work in Russian – a good example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the University of Tartu.|$|R
5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> its gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate}} as his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 {{during an}} excavation, a stone keep of about 12.5 metres {{diameter}} was uncovered. Experts estimate that it {{dates to the}} 11th century. A consequence of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the history of the}} castle had to <b>be</b> reassessed to <b>that</b> time.|$|R

5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} lands of Robert d'Oilly, who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which does not necessarily mean that he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of {{the lands of}} William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed explanation for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> prisons are often violent places, and prisoners {{who wish to}} avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|During his exile at Cephellania, Hybrida {{pretended to}} act as {{governor}} of the island which the people secretly allowed. In 49 BC, his nephew, Mark Antony, {{was elected to the}} role of tribune of the people and a legate of Caesar's in Italy. Despite this, Hybrida remained in exile until 47 BC when he returned to Rome at the request of Caesar himself. One possible explanation for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mark Antony was indebted to Hybrida; as Hybrida was in exile and had no civil rights, he could not enforce a payment and this suited Mark Antony. Hybrida was a candidate for censorship around 45 BC; his character and support from Mark Antony, however, made his attempt at the position a failure. The final mention of Hybrida during his life comes from Cicero who commented upon Mark Antony's divorce from Antonia Hybrida Major and the insult this conferred upon Hybrida himself.|$|E
50|$|At {{another such}} session, Mr Rucastle told {{a series of}} funny stories that made Miss Hunter laugh until she was quite weary. The one {{astonishing}} thing about <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Rucastle not only did not laugh, but did not even smile.|$|R
50|$|Care {{was taken}} to {{excavate}} the entire lake floor {{to a depth of}} at least two metres to provide sufficient clearance for boat keels. Another reason given for <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> mosquitoes would not breed nor would weeds grow at such a depth.|$|R
50|$|From the mid-17th {{century or}} so, France overtook Spain as the {{destination}} for Catholic Irishmen seeking a military career. The principal reason for <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> France <b>was</b> an ascendant power, rapidly expanding its armed forces, whereas Spain was a power in decline.|$|R
5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E
5|$|His {{relationship}} with King Edgar is unclear, particularly given {{the uncertainty of}} Thored's paternity, Oslac being banished from England in 975, the year of Edgar's death. Richard Fletcher, who thought Thored {{was the son of}} Gunnar, argued that Thored's raid on Westmorland was caused by resentment derived from losing out on the ealdormanry to Oslac, and that Edgar thereafter confiscated various territories as punishment. The evidence for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Newbald, granted by Edgar to Gunnar circa 963, was bought by Archbishop Osketel from the king sometime before 971, implying that the king had seized the land.|$|E
5000|$|... "What spurred him to <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in the assertoric syllogistic Aristotle {{and others}} {{sometimes}} used contradictories of absolute propositions {{on the assumption}} <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> absolute; and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> why so many decided that absolutes did contradict absolutes.

5|$|In early Fall 2014 VDOT {{will start}} work at Route 37's {{southern}} terminus' exit at I-81. They will extend Route 37 north {{to a new}} diamond interchange with Front Royal Pike (US 522). Then Route 37 will continue northward to Millwood Pike (US 50/ US 17) and have another diamond interchange. The next exit will be at Senseny Road (State Route 657) with another diamond interchange. The next and final exit will be a half cloverleaf interchange with VA 7, {{but it is not}} final {{that it will be a}} half cloverleaf because of Valley Mill Road (State Route 659). The problem with <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the intersection with Valley Mill Road is where the southbound exit for Route 37 is to come into Route 7.|$|E
5|$|Light Yagami, {{the true}} {{identity}} of Kira, discovers {{the location of}} Mello's hideout. An indirect result of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mello meets the Shinigami Sidoh, the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him—in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate—that there are two extra fake rules (in addition {{to a number of}} real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent. However, Light launches a SWAT team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a scar on his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.|$|E
5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E
50|$|In the Supreme Court case Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, {{the native}} peoples were legally {{made to be}} wards of the state. One {{consequence}} of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> not permitted to sue the US government because of their status as a dependent nation.|$|R
50|$|For a long time, feminist authors {{advocated}} {{that these}} peaceful, matriarchal agrarian societies were exterminated or subjugated by nomadic, patriarchal warrior tribes. An {{important contribution to}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. Her work in <b>this</b> field <b>is</b> now however largely rejected.

25|$|These {{difficulties}} {{were eliminated}} in 570 BCE when pure silver coins were introduced. However, electrum currency remained common until approximately 350 BCE.
