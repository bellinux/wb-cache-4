5|$|Zavaleta et al. (2011) {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} an MFGM-enriched complementary food on health outcomes in term infants 6 to 11 months of age in Peru.

40|$|When {{estimating}} causal {{effects from}} observational data, {{it is desirable}} to approximate a randomized experiment as closely as possible. This goal can often be achieved by choosing a subsample from <b>the</b> original <b>control</b> <b>group</b> that matches <b>the</b> treatment group {{on the distribution of}} the observed covariates. However, sometimes <b>the</b> original <b>control</b> <b>group</b> cannot provide adequate matches for the treatment group. This article presents a method to obtain matches from multiple <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> In addition to adjusting for differences in observed covariates between the groups, the method adjusts for a group effect that distinguishes between <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> This group effect captures the additional otherwise unobserved differences between <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups,</b> beyond that accounted for by the observed covariates. The method is illustrated and evaluated using data from an evaluation of a school drop-out prevention pro-gram that uses matches from both local and nonlocal <b>control</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effect of lit-moxa {{stimulating}} acupoint Guanyuan (CV 4) on lactic acid and super-oxide dismutase (SOD) in skeletal muscle after exercise exhaustion. MethodsTwenty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> exhausted <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> exercise group and moxibustion group using exercise training and mild heating with lit-moxa stick as treatment methods. <b>The</b> exhausted <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> moxibustion group and exercise group received an exhaustive swimming after 20 days of intervention. Swimming exhausted times were recorded. Lactic acid and SOD concentration in soleus muscle were detected and compared between every two groups.

The lactic acid of <b>the</b> exhausted <b>control</b> <b>group</b> was significantly increased comparing with <b>the</b> normal <b>control</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 05), and the lactic acid of the moxibustion group and the exercise group were significantly {{lower than that of}} <b>the</b> exhausted <b>control</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 05).
