40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} phonological attrition in 10 native Albanian speakers who acquired Standard Southern British English (SSBE) as a second language (L 2) in London, United Kingdom. A contrast was examined which is phonemic in Albanian but allophonic in SSBE, namely the production of light and dark lateral approximants. Impressionistic and acoustic analyses revealed that one late bilingual completely neutralized the phonemic contrast in her native Albanian speech. Furthermore, two other bilinguals neutralized the phonemic contrast between light /l/ and dark /ɫ/ in coda position, and overall there appeared to be a stronger trend for light /l/ to become dark in coda position than for dark /ɫ/ <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>light</b> in onset position. The findings are discussed in relation to the Speech Learning Model (Flege, 1995) and indicate that phonological attrition in native speech production is possible in late L 2 acquisition, although not inevitable...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{deformation}} of N= 2 supersymmetric QCD with U(N) gauge group and N_f quark flavors {{induced by the}} mass term μ for the adjoint matter which breaks supersymmetry down to N= 1 QCD. Recently this deformation was shown {{to lead to a}} weakly coupled dual theory only in two particular sets of vacua: the r=N vacuum and the so-called zero vacua which can be found at r< N_f-N, where r is the number of condensed quarks. For small quark masses and intermediate values of μ the gauge group of the dual theory is U(N_f-N) × U(1) ^ 2 N-N_f where the Abelian sector is heavy and can be integrated out. However, at larger values of μ the Abelian sector enters the strong coupling regime.

40|$|Structures have {{advanced}} from their heavy, static and often not environmentally respectful origins, <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>light,</b> smart and structurally efficient. Lightweight structures represent {{one of the}} most advanced achievements of the research oriented towards a sustainable design. The pavilion described in this paper employs two lightweight structural elements, namely a pneumatic beam and a pre-tensioned membrane, in order to obtain a covered space for visitors. The idea behind the pavilion design originated by the study of harmonic knots, in particular the trefoil knot. The concept to realize an aesthetically pleasant and structurally challenging form led us to develop further the trefoil knot curve in order to rotate this regular 3 d-curve in a rotate strip. The choice of such shape has been guided by the fascinating topological properties of the Möbius strip, which possess the peculiar characteristic of continuity along the two boundaries. In this case, to maintain the symmetries of the trefoil knot itself, the strip is twisting three times before closing. All these features resulted in a self-equilibrated internal forces flow and solved the stability problem in an elegant and simple way. Based on this concept, the main visual element of the pavilion is the inflatable tube that is shaped along the unique boundary of the Möbius-trefoil knot. A membrane, that follows the rotating strip, has been studied to create a shelter for visitors. The pavilion has been designed to be automatically tensioned by the pneumatic tube during installation: the increasing pressure provided to the internal fluid gives shape to the tube and simultaneously tightens the membrane...|$|E

40|$|The Barred Plymouth Rock fowl {{has long}} {{been one of the}} most popular breeds in America. There have been two rather dis-tinct groups of breeders {{interested}} in this breed, namely the fanciers and the production-breeders. The former have stressed feather color and type in the selection of breeding stock, paying little or no attention to productive qualities. As a result many fancy strains which have won in the show room consistently, have not enjoyed a reputation as being good in egg production qualities. On the other hand those breeders who stressed high egg production in selecting their breeding stock have not given much attention to feather color and show type. The present day demand is more for a bird with good laying qualities that is also a good representative of the breed in color and type. The standards by which all poultry is judged in the show rooms of this country is the American Standard of Perfection (1923). This standard decrees that the male and female of the Barred Plymouth Rock should be of equal shade.

40|$|Proteins {{that are}} used for {{photosynthetic}} light harvesting and biological signaling are critical to life. These types of proteins act as scaffolds that hold small, sometimes metal-containing organic molecules in precise locations for light absorption and successive use. For signaling proteins, this energy {{can be used to}} induce a photoisomerization of the small molecule that can turn on or off a signaling cascade that controls the physiology of an organism. Alternatively, photosynthetic light-harvesting proteins funnel this energy in a directional manner towards a charge separating catalytic component that can change this light energy into chemical energy. The protein environment also serves to tune the photophysical properties of the small molecules. This is seen extensively with the linear tetrapyrroles {{that are used}} in both photosynthetic and signaling proteins. ^ Many efforts have been made to harness these natural proteins for societal use, including improving photophysical properties and interfacing capabilities with manmade catalytic components. Several methods of achieving improvement have entailed structurally guided mutation and directed evolution. However, these methods all have their limitations due to the inherent complexity and fragility of the natural proteins. This work presents an alternative more robust method to natural proteins. ^ My thesis states: that man-made proteins, known as maquettes, employing basic rules of protein folding, can be designed <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>light</b> harvesting and signaling proteins that can be assembled fully in vivo providing an alternative, robust, and versatile platform for meeting the diverse array of societal “green chemistry” and biomedical needs. This in vivo assembly is carried out by interacting with cyanobacterial protein and pigment machinery, both as stand-alone units and as protein fusions with natural antenna complexes. Additionally, this work offers insight for fast and tight binding of circular and linear tetrapyrroles to the maquettes both in vitro and in vivo. Design principles are also established for increasing the amount of linear tetrapyrrole attachment to the maquette as well as modulating their photophysical properties. Fast and tight binding of cofactors, high cofactor attachment yields, and control of cofactor photophysical properties are all prerequisites for the maquettes to be successful in vivo photosynthetic light harvesting and signaling proteins. ...|$|E
