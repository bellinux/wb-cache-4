She considered the changing conception of the world since the 1960s and emphasised {{the need for}} us to consider the consequences of today's environmental concerns for the generations of the future. Short also introduced the subject of Transition Towns, speaking about the first of such towns in Totnes, Devon, UK. These towns aim to create a [...] "community" [...] for the future which [...] "addresses the twin challenges of diminishing oil and gas supplies and climate change, and creates the kind of community that we would all want to be part of."

[...] They considered the layout for the street to be exemplary for its time (it {{was put in place}} following the construction of a bypass in the early 1990s), creating a [...] "pleasant" [...] and [...] "successful" [...] shopping environment and allowing people {{to take advantage of a}} good [...] "range of specialist shops and numerous cafes, restaurants and pubs", together with the [...] "strong supermarket" [...] offering set in [...] "well-crafted re-configured streetscape". The long high street featured one hundred percent retail occupancy, independent traders and a [...] "cafe culture". [...] The Academy considered a particularly strong aspect of the street to be the good working collaboration between individual businesses and the Chamber of Trade. In the 2017 Vitality Index of 1000 retail locations in the UK carried out by Harper Dennis Hobbs, Berkhamsted was ranked as the 16th best shopping location in the country. (The index measured the quality of retail locations including factors such as how well the retail mix met the needs of the local community, the number of vacant shops, and the proportion of ‘undesirable’ shops such as pawnbrokers and bookmakers.)

40|$|As a {{reaction}} against global problems such as climate change and peak oil, localisation movements gathered renewed momentum during the last decade. Prominent amongst these is <b>Transition</b> <b>Towns,</b> a movement which advocates the development of resilient local communities {{to deal with these}} challenges in an adequate way. On the basis of extensive qualitative research of the movement’s rise in Flanders (Belgium), this article studies the way <b>Transition</b> <b>Towns</b> represents the local. It shows that the movement is vulnerable for what has been called the ‘local trap’, and argues that the latter should actually be conceived as a post-political trap. The representation of the local is depoliticised when it conceals {{the fact that it is}} always a hegemonic construction which inevitably entails exclusions and the exercise of power. Drawing on post-foundational political theory, this article not only provides a novel interpretation of <b>Transition</b> <b>Towns,</b> but also aims to recast the ongoing localisation debate by showing that post-politics represents a fundamental problem for it. At the same time, however, the political can never be completely abolished, but always comes back with a vengeance. This ambiguity and complexity are central to this article’s analysis of how <b>Transition</b> <b>Towns</b> deals with the local and the political. status: publishe...|$|R
