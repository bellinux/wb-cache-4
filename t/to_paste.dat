5|$|Day and Foxe {{completed}} a second {{edition of the}} Book of Martyrs in 1570. It was even larger than the first—a total of 2,300 pages in two enormous folio volumes—and at one point, Day ran out of paper (which he imported) and had <b>to</b> <b>paste</b> smaller sheets together to make do. This edition received official recognition: William Cecil and the Privy Council directed the church to ensure that copies were available to parishioners, and in 1571, the Convocation ordered that every cathedral church and the household of every {{senior member of the}} clergy should own a copy. The edition has been recorded as costing sixteen shillings, roughly equivalent to two months' wages for a skilled London clothworker at the time.|$|E

This is useful for stripping embedded font type and style codes from formatted text, such as when copying text from a web page and pasting into an email message or other WYSIWYG text editor. Formatted text can be temporarily pasted into Notepad, and then immediately copied again in stripped format <b>to</b> <b>paste</b> into the other program.|$|E
25|$|England, however, {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>paste</b> the bowlers, although skipper Michael Vaughan {{was lucky}} {{on more than}} one occasion – the most notable when he was dropped by Mohammad Rafique off Rafique's own bowling. By stumps, however, the pair had added 40, and they continued on a sunny second day – less rusty, however, than they had been on the first day. It was all too embarrassing for Bangladesh, as Vaughan raced to 120 before being caught behind off Mashrafe. Four overs later, the patient Rafique finally got his reward, Khaled Mashud coming up with a magnificent catch to get Trescothick out six short of a double century. That was as good as it got for Bangladesh, though, as Ian Bell, Warwickshire's prodigy, made 65 not out, and Graham Thorpe ran runs everywhere to score 42 not out with only two boundaries, before Vaughan decided that enough was enough and declared with seven wickets in hand and a lead of 420 runs.|$|E

25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was <b>to</b> <b>paste</b> on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

These incidents were reported mostly in Chennai and Cuddalore. In one incident caught on video and widely broadcast on Tamil television, an AIADMK functionary mouthing expletives and accompanied by henchmen was seen intimidating volunteers from Bengaluru who were preparing food in Anna Nagar for distribution to flood-affected people; the cadre demanded 2,000 relief packets {{so he could be}} seen distributing them. [...] The party also released a poem on social media praising Jayalalithaa despite near-universal condemnation of government relief efforts.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Turning Tables" [...] {{is a song}} of {{domestic}} dispute, where its narrator assumes a defensive stance against a manipulative ex-lover. Reconciling herself with the termination of a contentious relationship, she vows emotional distance to shield herself from future heartbreak. Bryan Boyd of The Irish Times likened the singer to 1980s Welsh rocker Bonnie Tyler in delivering the vocals {{with a mixture of}} anger, pain and pathos. According <b>to</b> <b>Paste</b> magazine, cinematic strings [...] "serve as fitting counterpoint to [...] heartbroken, hollowed-out lyrics." [...] "Turning Tables" [...] opens with a piano sequence after which Adele sings the first lines: [...] "Close enough to start a war/All that I have is on the floor". The chorus consists of the lyrics: [...] "So I won't let you / Close enough to hurt me / No, I won't rescue / You to just desert me / I can't give you / The heart you think you gave me / It's time to say goodbye / To turning tables." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harrison {{returned}} to New York City. Having learned from Quigley {{what he could}} get away with legally, Harrison struck out on his own with a series of non-pornographic [...] "cheesecake" [...] magazines. His first was Beauty Parade (1941–1956), started in October 1941. It contained, as its subtitle suggests ("The World's Loveliest Girls"), pictures of attractive models who had the [...] "girl-next-door" [...] look. Beauty Parade also began the photo-story format that would be repeated by other Harrison publications. Using the facilities of Quigley Publishing surreptitiously at night, Harrison used the photos from his Hollywood visit <b>to</b> <b>paste</b> together his galleries. When he was caught and fired on Christmas Eve, 1941, his sisters Edith and Helen rallied around him and raised several thousand dollars in capital, $400 of it from his favorite niece, Marjorie, who would later become a central figure in his most famous enterprise.|$|E

2500|$|As a child, Wales was a keen {{reader with}} an acute {{intellectual}} curiosity. When he was three, his mother bought a World Book Encyclopedia from a door-to-door salesman.

It put at his fingertips an abundant supply of knowledge complete with maps, illustrations, and a few cellophane layers of transparencies one could lift to explore {{such things as the}} muscles, arteries, and digestive system of a dissected frog. But Wales soon discovered that the World Book had shortcomings: no matter how much was in it, there were many more things that were not. World Book sent out stickers for owners <b>to</b> <b>paste</b> on the pages in order to update the encyclopedia, and Wales was careful to put the stickers to work, stating, [...] "I joke that I started as a kid revising the encyclopedia by stickering the one my mother bought." ...|$|E

[...] However, if a shot only involves an open wormhole without anyone stepping through it, the crew may choose to use a [...] "practical puddle," [...] which is simply a back lit screen placed in the gate displaying a video of the wormhole effect. [...] This only works, however, on a darker set, as otherwise the projection will get washed out. [...] On occasion, the Stargate itself is also completely swapped out for a computer generated model, usually in cases where it is being moved, or is depicted in space. Series producer Robert C. Cooper explained that it often costs a lot to erect a Stargate on location, and so in some cases offworld gates are also entirely a visual effect.|$|E
