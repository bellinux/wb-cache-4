5|$|For some time, {{there had}} been concern {{about the power of}} the railroads and the way they charged {{different}} rates for different customers. In 1885, a bill to regulate the practice, authored by John Henninger Reagan, of Texas passed the House. The Reagan bill forbade discrimination in railroad or pipeline freight rates, required that rates be reasonable, and fixed maximum charges allowed. Sherman agreed with the general idea of the law, but objected to certain portions, especially a provision that gave state courts jurisdiction over enforcement disputes. Sherman believed <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>should</b> allow for more nuance as well, insisting that competition against other forms of transit be considered. These changes were adopted in the conference committee and the result, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, owed much to Sherman's influence. Cleveland signed it into law on February 4, 1887, and appointed members to the new Interstate Commerce Commission. The act displeased the railroad industry, but was a boon to farmers and the oil industry.|$|E
5|$|Real {{property}} {{law in the}} English and Welsh legal system had evolved from feudalism, and was an immensely complex system understood by {{only a small number}} of lawyers. In particular peculiarities meant that land owned by beneficiaries could be sold without the agreement of all the beneficiaries involved, something partially rectified by the Settled Land Act 1882 and the Land Transfer Act 1897. Despite these statutes reform in this area was still needed, and Lord Haldane presented reform bills to parliament in 1913, 1914 and 1915 with no real progress thanks to the opposition of the Law Society. In March 1917 a Reconstruction Subcommittee under Sir Leslie Scott was created to consider land policy after the First World War, and Schuster (who had devilled for Scott when working as a barrister in Liverpool) was appointed as a member. The subcommittee decided that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>should</b> be changed to merge real and personal {{property law}}, and that outdated aspects of land law such as copyholds and gavelkind should be eliminated. When Birkenhead became Lord Chancellor in 1919 he inherited the problem of English property law, and immediately instructed Schuster to prepare the department for forcing a bill through Parliament on the matter.|$|E

40|$|By the ‘Rule of Law’ I mean a set {{of formal}} and {{institutional}} features <b>the</b> <b>law</b> may possess in varying degrees. These features define an ideal, which laws have traditionally been expected to live up to. One of these features is publicity. Part of what constitutes <b>the</b> Rule of <b>Law</b> is <b>the</b> requirement that <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>should</b> be public. This {{is the subject of}} this paper. When it is claimed that <b>the</b> Rule of <b>Law</b> requires that <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>should</b> be public, what is to be understood by this claim? My main claim is that <b>the</b> Rule of <b>Law</b> requirement of publicity is best understood in terms of the notion of common, or mutual, knowledge. When it is required that <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>should</b> be public, what should be meant by this is not only that each one of <b>the</b> <b>law’s</b> addressees <b>should</b> know what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is, but also that everybody should know that everybody knows what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is, that everybody should know that everybody knows that everybody knows what <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is, and so on. This may look unnecessarily complicated. I’ll try to show that this is a false impression, and that understanding the publicity requirement along these lines illuminates various aspects of the normative ideal the publicity requirement may be taken to embody...|$|R

25|$|Somalis {{for centuries}} have practiced {{a form of}} {{customary}} law, which they call xeer.

25|$|A {{corollary}} of {{the rule}} of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a barrister in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.

In response, the Government has said that the other MPs of the GRC continue to represent the electors and should be able to handle constituency matters without any problems.

500|$|The Analysis {{was based}} on lectures he gave to students, and was most likely not {{intended}} to be published; it is considered the first history of English law ever written. Divided into 13 chapters, the book dealt with the history of English law and some suggestions for reform.

Hale proposed the creation of county courts, and also drew a strong distinction between written laws, such as statutes, and customary, unwritten laws. He also argued that the common law was subject to Parliament, far before the confirmation of Parliamentary supremacy, and that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>should</b> protect the rights and civil liberties of the King's subjects. He also argued for the confirmation of trial by jury, which he described as [...] "the best mode of trial in the world", while the 13th chapter divided the law into the laws of persons and of property, and dealt with the rights, wrongs and remedies recognised by the law at the time. William Holdsworth, himself considered one of the greatest common law historians, described it as [...] "the ablest introductory sketch of a history of English law that appeared till the publication of Pollock and Maitland's volumes in 1895".|$|E
