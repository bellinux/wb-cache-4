40|$|Currently, {{industrial}} robotic manipulators {{are applied}} in many manufacturing applications. In most cases, an industrial environment is a cluttered and complex one where moving obstacles may exist and hinder {{the movement of}} robotic manipulators. Therefore, a robotic manipulator not only has to avoid moving obstacles, but also needs to fulfill the manufacturing requirements of smooth movement in fixed <b>tact</b> <b>time.</b> Thus, this paper proposes a virtual velocity vector-based algorithm of offline collision-free path planning for manipulator arms in a controlled industrial environment. The minimum distance between a manipulator and a moving obstacle can be maintained at an expected value by utilizing our proposed algorithm with established offline collision-free path-planning and trajectory-generating systems. Furthermore, both joint space velocity and Cartesian space velocity of generated time-efficient trajectory are continuous and smooth. In addition, the vector of detour velocity in a 3 D environment is determined and depicted. Simulation results indicate that detour velocity can shorten the total task {{time as well as}} escaping the local minimal effectively. In summary, our approach can fulfill both safety requirements of collision avoidance of moving obstacles and manufacturing requirements of smooth movement within fixed <b>tact</b> <b>time</b> in an industrial environment...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the assembly of}} residential kitchens by a Swedish development company based in Stockholm using value stream mapping.. The study covers the process of receiving and transporting building material and components from the delivery location at the construction site to the apartment and the subsequent assembly of the kitchen, on four different projects. The supply of materials for three kitchens is delivered to the site every four days, hence this dictates a production <b>tact</b> <b>time</b> of a completed kitchen every 1. 33 days. Furthermore, the company has set aside a total resource time of 17 hours per completed kitchen including the transportation of building material and components. Potential improvements to the kitchen building process have been identified based on the theory of lean management using observations and interviews. Three out of the four studied projects met the company targets regarding cycle time of 1. 33 days/kitchen and resource time of 17 hours/kitchen. Despite meeting the companies mandate construction time frame, there remains great potential to improve the current state. Process inefficiencies associated with the current practices are {{largely due to the}} logistics the on-site logistics concerning access to material and equipment {{in the right place at}} the right time and disturbances from other activities and material transports on-site. It is important to have the kitchen material in the right place at the right time and that the process isn’t disturbed by other building activities and material on the site. However, work practices of the fitters can also affect the amount of non-productive labor. It's not only the question of how fast the fitters can assemble the kitchens, but also how they spend the rest of the working hours during the day. Difference in experience between the fitters also plays a role in process efficiency. An inexperienced and/or sloppy installer leaves several tools lying around and does not work in any clear order, hampering the work flow of the installation. With the improvements suggested in the study, the <b>tact</b> <b>time</b> and the resource time necessary to produce a kitchen can be greatly reduced. The timely production of kitchens in the future state results in time available for the fitters to complete other tasks while still maintaining the same <b>tact</b> <b>time</b> on kitchens. The future state of the company’s assembly process of kitchens only differs by way of waste reduction. The value adding activities is not considered to be the decisive factor in this study, since the waste time is so extensive. The study shows that the total resource time required in the future will be half as much as the average of the studies considered in this report, reducing resource time from 2010 to 1084 minutes. Since the value time is unchanged, 926 minutes of waste time have been identified in the present average. The project that performed most poorly had a total resource time of 3965 minutes, in which case, resource time in future production would be approximately one quarter of the time utilized on this project.

The easy-going Sir Charles Easy is chronically unfaithful to his wife, seducing both ladies of quality and his own female servants with insouciant charm. The turning point of the action, known as [...] "the Steinkirk scene", comes when his wife finds him and a maidservant asleep together in a chair, [...] "as close an approximation to actual adultery as could be presented on the 18th-century stage". His periwig has fallen off, an obvious suggestion of intimacy and abandon, and an opening for Lady Easy's tact. Soliloquizing to herself about how sad it would be if he caught cold, she [...] "takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and lays it gently on his Head" [...] (V.i.21). (A [...] "steinkirk" [...] was a loosely tied lace collar or scarf, named after the way the officers wore their cravats at the Battle of Steenkirk in 1692.) She steals away, Sir Charles wakes, notices the steinkirk on his head, marvels that his wife did not wake him and make a scene, and realises how wonderful she is. The Easys go on to have a reconciliation scene which is much more low-keyed and tasteful than that in Love's Last Shift, without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy shrinking with feminine delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had broached without blinking. Paul Parnell has analysed the manipulative nature of Lady Easy's lines in this exchange, showing how they are directed towards the sentimentalist's goal of [...] "ecstatic self-approval".|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{sought to}} {{validate}} total atrial conduction <b>time</b> (<b>TACT)</b> measurement via tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) {{by comparing the}} electrophysiological study (EPS) measurements of healthy subjects, according to age and sex. Methods: Eighty patients with normal EPS results were included. TACT was measured by EPS and TDI. For validation, the results of TDI were {{compared with those of}} EPS. TACT was assessed by measuring the time interval between the beginning of the P-wave on the surface ECG, and the peak A-wave on TDI from the left atrial lateral wall, just over the mitral annulus. Electrophysiological TACT was defined as the time from the high right atrial electrogram to the distal coronary sinus atrial electrogram around the left lateral portion of the mitral ring. Results: EPS and TDI measurements of the TACT were significantly and positively correlated among men and women in 20 – 30 years (p= 0. 008, r= 0. 412; p> 0. 001, r= 0. 706, respectively), and those in the 30 – 40 years group (p= 0. 001, r= 0. 649; p= 0. 001, r= 0. 696).

Furthermore, response to CRT {{may be difficult to}} predict in these patients. The aim of our study was to investigate whether predictors for CRT success differ between patients with AF and SR and to study the influence of present or developing AF on response to CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined consecutive patients in whom CRT was implanted disregarding the atrial rhythm. Atrial fibrillation was defined as either current or earlier AF, response to CRT was defined as a decrease in the left ventricular end-systolic volume of > or = 10 % after 6 months. Total atrial conduction <b>time</b> (<b>TACT),</b> a measure to predict the risk of developing AF, was determined by echocardiography. We included 114 patients, of whom 56 (49 %) were known with AF (23 current AF and 33 earlier AF). The other 58 patients had no history of AF. After 6 months, response in current and earlier AF and that in SR patients was comparable (56, 58 and 55 %, respectively). In AF patients, multivariate analysis revealed a shorter TACT at baseline [odds ratio (OR) 16. 7 (1. 5 - 185. 3), P = 0. 02] and an interventricular mechanical delay (IVMD) > 40 ms [OR 10. 4 (1. 0 - 110. 9), P = 0. 05] as predictors for response. Non-responders more frequently suffered from new-onset AF (P = 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Failure to CRT is associated with new-onset AF.

6000|$|In {{the middle}} of all this bustle of reform planned, achieved, frustrated, and replanned, and the never-ending {{underground}} warfare that surges in a Native State, move the English officers--the irreducible minimum of exiles. As a caste, the working Englishmen in Native States are curiously interesting; and the traveller whose <b>tact</b> by this <b>time</b> has been blunted by tramping, sits in judgment upon them as he has seen them. In the first place, they are, they must be, the fittest who have survived; for though, here and there, you shall find one chafing bitterly against the burden of his life in the wilderness, one to be pitied more than any chained beast, the bulk of the caste are honestly and unaffectedly fond of their work, fond of the country around them, and fond of the people they deal with. In each State their answer to a question is the same. The men with whom they are in contact are [...] "all right" [...] when you know them, but you've got to [...] "know them first," [...] as the music-hall song says. Their hands are full of work; so full that, when the incult wanderer said: [...] "What do you find to do?" [...] they look upon him with contempt and amazement, exactly as the wanderer himself had once looked upon a Globe-trotter, who had put to him the same impertinent query. And--but here the Englishman may be wrong--it seemed to him that in one respect their lives were a good deal more restful and concentrated than those of their brethren under the British Government. There was no talk of shiftings and transfers and promotions, stretching across a Province and a half, and no man said anything about Simla. To one who has hitherto believed that Simla is the hub of the Empire, it is disconcerting to hear: [...] "Oh, Simla! That's where you Bengalis go. We haven't anything to do with Simla down here." [...] And no more they have. Their talk and their interests run in the boundaries of the States they serve, and, most striking of all, the gossipy element seems to be cut altogether. It is a backwater of the river of Anglo-Indian life--or is it the main current, the broad stream that supplies the motive power, and is the other life only the noisy ripple on the surface? You who have lived, not merely looked at, both lives, decide. Much can be learnt from the talk of the caste, many curious, many amusing, and some startling things. One hears stories of men who take a poor, impoverished State as a man takes a wife, [...] "for better or worse," [...] and, moved by some incomprehensible ideal of virtue, consecrate--that is not too big a word--consecrate their lives to that State in all single-heartedness and purity. Such men are few, but they exist to-day, and their names are great in lands where no Englishman travels. Again the listener hears tales of grizzled diplomats of Rajputana--Machiavellis who have hoisted a powerful intriguer with his own intrigue, and bested priestly cunning, and the guile of the Oswal, simply that the way might be clear for some scheme which should put money into a tottering Treasury, or lighten the taxation of a few hundred thousand men--or both; for this can be done. One tithe of that force spent on their own personal advancement would have carried such men very far.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Advanced light {{trapping}} in {{thin film}} solar cells involves coupling light into guided modes {{at the front}} and back interfaces respectively. Accomplishing in an optimal way of these two tasks requires the integrating of properly engineered random or periodic light trapping schemes for both surfaces, which relates to two independent processing steps. Here, we focus on integrating the two-step processes into one-step process by using a nanoscale inverted pyramid structure. We show that the one-step approach can provide excellent broadband light trapping at {{the front and back}} surfaces for the solar cells, and a relative gain of 43 % for the short circuit current and a gain of 26 % for the efficiency have been achieved compared with the results obtained for cells without light trapping structure. The successful use of the one-step process, on the other hand, depends on the geometrical nature of the inverted pyramid, which allows for better conformal sequential deposition. The proposed one-step light trapping approach will simple the process, reduce the <b>tact</b> <b>time</b> and lower the production cost, all of which are believed to be beneficial to the industrial mass production...|$|E

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the oxidative autoclave {{dissolution of}} iron sulfides when leaching the ore of the Shanuch deposit was previously described mathematically {{based on the}} data on the average process rate [1], and the assumption was formulated that the total process rate {{is limited by the}} oxygen absorption. This study is aimed at verifying this assumption for nickel and copper sulfides with the evaluation of the process rate every 10 min (Δτ) of the experiment. We preliminarily calculated the current absorption rate of oxygen during the dissolution of iron sulfides according to the equation (1) where vFe is the absorption rate, molFe/min; 0. 635 is the stoichiometric coefficient, which takes into account the consumption of O 2 by the corresponding reactions; 23 and 9 are the total number of moles of oxygen and sulfide iron according to the reaction stoichiometry; CMe is the metal concentration in the solution, g/dm 3; is the diffusivity of oxygen in the pulp; τc is the con <b>tact</b> <b>time,</b> s; Fp is the parabola area, m 2; and Caq is the amount of oxygen dissolved in water, g/dm 3.

40|$|Purpose – The purpose {{with this}} study is to {{investigate}} how an assembly line for products with long cycle time, high product variation and operators who follow the products through the flow can be planned for a high resource utilization as well as the challenges that can arise when planning an assembly line with an increasing demand and how these can be handled. Method – To fulfill {{the purpose of this study}} a case study was conducted at Mastec Components AB in Vaggeryd. The empirical data gathered from the case study was obtained through interviews, observations and document studies. The empirical data was then analysed against theory, which means that pattern matching was used and the analyse led to the studies results. Findings – This study illustrates how an assembly line with special demands can be planned to gain high resource utilization. When the products cycle times are multiple they can be sorted into product families to simplify the planning and it also enables a tacted planning method to be used. The study also presents how the usage of time buffers can facilitate the planning of an assembly line. Moreover the study illuminates the importance of controlling tact, both from the customer and the own production. When demand increases it is important that the production line is capable to keep up, therefore some arrangements can be done to reduce waste and increase capacity. Possible alternatives can be buffers, allocating resources and parallel assembly lines. Implications – The study investigates a type of assembly line where the operators follow the products through the flow. This type of assembly line is unexplored in theory and thereby a knowledge gap has been identified which partly have been covered by this study. Further on, the study contributed to an increased understanding of the consequences that occur when operators follow the flow and when products have long varying cycle times. The study also shows the value of calculating tact and use the advantages from it to easier handle variation in demand. Limitations – The case study was performed as one case study which means that only one unit has been analysed. This was due to the lack of resources to do several case studies, both regarding time and ability to find more facilities with similar conditions. If it were possible to conduct more case studies the results could have been more general. Keywords – Tact, <b>tact</b> <b>time,</b> tacted planning, assembly line, planning, operators, buffer...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of novel white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) for solid-state lighting and flat-panel display applications. Firstly, non-doped type WOLEDs employing novel emitters featuring aggregation-induced emission are demonstrated. Due to elimination of the doping procedures, the fabrication process is much simplified, resulting in a reduced <b>TACT</b> <b>time</b> and an improved performance repeatability compared to conventional doped type WOLEDs. By employing emitters with good charge carrier mobility, bilayer non-doped WOLEDs are further demonstrated. The material cost is cut down significantly due to reduction of the number of materials/layers used to construct such bilayer WOLEDs. Secondly, efficient WOLEDs with evenly separated red, green and blue peaks are demonstrated in a new three-emitter platform. In such system, WOLEDs based on a novel yellowish-green emitter demonstrate remarkably higher efficiency together with excellent color rendering capability as compared to the commercial benchmark green emitter Ir(ppy) 3. The demonstrated WOLEDs with peak total efficiency up to 66 lm/W and high color rendering index up to 91 would be ideal candidates to bring WOLEDs into the next generation flat-panel display and solid-state lighting market. To further enhance the efficiency of the WOLEDs, two simple, low cost and scalable substrate modification methods for effectively extracting the substrate waveguide light from OLEDs are proposed. By simply sandblasting the edges and the backside surface of glass, a 20 % forward efficiency improvement has been achieved. To further increase the scattering probability, scattering films consisting of organic nanoparticles/nanowires are employed. OLEDs with scattering films demonstrated a forward efficiency improvement up to 31 %. The proposed simple, low cost and scalable substrate modification techniques capable of simultaneously improving the luminous efficiency and uniformity are very attractive for large area WOLED lighting panel applications. Finally, top-emitting WOLEDs for display applications are developed. In the first implementation, by taking advantage of the microcavity effect, efficient top-emitting blue OLEDs are firstly obtained and by capping a red color conversion layer on top of the blue OLEDs, a white emission resulting from the mixing of the converted red emission and the unabsorbed blue emission is achieved. The color converted top-emitting WOLEDs exhibiting pure white color and extremely high color stability can potentially be used to construct high-contrast white-black medical displays. In the second implementation, the microcavity effect is effectively suppressed by using a low reflection cathode. With an Yb (5 nm) /Au (15 nm) /MoO 3 (30 nm) composite cathode, the demonstrated top-emitting WOLEDs exhibit negligible interference effect and consequently show broadband white emission with evenly separated red, green and blue peaks. The successful demonstration of the top-emitting WOLEDs on a SVGA+ microdisplay shows their great potential application in high-resolution full-color displays...|$|E
40|$|Interrupts {{and stops}} {{has become a}} big problem within in the {{construction}} industry. The productivity has continuously fallen since the mid 90 s. It {{is necessary for the}} construction sector to raise concern with the productivity and to learn from other sectors. Theorie s from other sectors should be taken into consideration in hope to change the productivity in the construction sector, the goal is to optimise the tools and theories from other sectors. The industry sector has developed a Lean production system that aims to minimize and eliminate all waste in the production industry. The goal is to create something similar within construction. The Toyota Production System has been developed over the last decade and Porsche Consulting have now come up with a similar model for the construction industry to build within <b>tact</b> <b>time.</b> This thesis will look at the study of two projects. One is OiB and the other one is KS. OiB is built after Statsbygg own standards and procedures while KS is built after Lean Management and Porsche tact. A big part of this thesis is the study of the two projects based documents and existing theory giving by Porsche Consulting. The analysis of OiB shows that it what was more contractors than originally planned. Therefore the project had a lot of conf licts related to 20 contractors. The project was lead by hierarchical leading structure, without any further involvement of workers. The project is built upon the the procedures of Statsbygg. The project was built within agreed time and budget. The analysi s of KS shows that the cooperation between the different contractors had a alot of challenges. This was because the two different contractors had different theories about Lean, one was the entrepreneur and the other was the consultant. The production got l ate because the drawings was late, this resulted with further delays within the building. This incident caused a lot of stress, and the lack of experience didnt make it any easier. Majority of people involved in this project used Porsche tact for the very first time. Both of the contractors have lost money on on this project, but the builder contractor got the building done within agreed time and budget. 5 Implementing of new systems gives a lot of challenges, lean is a wide term and all organisations have t heir own way of interpreting it. The gap between the parties in this project caused alot of challenges. Correct use of tact planning claims detailed and massive planning. This needs to be trained on and will become easier with experience. Lean is still in development within the construction industry and further research is needed in order for it to be optimized. This thesis is built on a Lean project. It is recommended that this topic is researched on furthermore in to order generalize and standardize the t heor ies and thought we have foud in this thesi...|$|E
