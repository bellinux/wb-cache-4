40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that disinhibition of deep {{layers of the}} inferior colliculi unmasks coordinated cardiovascular, somatomotor and respiratory responses to multimodal sensory stimuli in the anesthetized rat. As these effects were maintained following extensive decerebration, we proposed that they were mediated by a previously undescribed projection from the inferior colliculus to pontine, brainstem or spinal cardiorespiratory and motor control nuclei. Here we directly examine that hypothesis. Efferent projections from the inferior colliculus were labelled by an AAV vector that drives fluorescent reporter expression. Three weeks after injection into the inferior colliculi, rats were sacrificed and brains examined for evidence of <b>terminal</b> <b>labelling</b> in regions known to drive sympathetic, respiratory or motor outputs. Vector injections confined to the region that drives physiological responses resulted in extensive pontine and medullary projections, with little evidence of projections innervating targets in the spinal cord or rostral to the hypothalamus. The greatest density of <b>terminal</b> <b>labelling</b> was observed within the rostral ventromedial medulla and Raphe nuclei and included putative synaptic contacts with spinally projecting neurons. In contrast, no labelling was apparent in other respiratory or cardiovascular control nuclei in the ventrolateral medulla. The functional significance of these projections was confirmed in electrophysiological experiments in vivo, in which stereotypical sympathetic, respiratory and motor responses evoked by disinhibition of the colliculus, recorded in the splanchnic, phrenic and sciatic nerves respectively, were blocked by microinjection of GABA agonists {{in the region of}} densest <b>terminal</b> <b>labelling.</b> We conclude that a previously undescribed projection from the colliculus to the RVMM/Raphe may {{play a key role in}} driving co-ordinated cardiorespiratory and motor responses to alerting sensory stimuli. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{a survey}} of several {{mammalian}} genomes, namely humans, rodents and bovines, {{the differences in the}} 5 -methylcytosine (m 5 C) content show that repeated DNA sequences from sperm were undermethylated and from various somatic tissues were heavily methylated. This report shows a pattern of methylation in male newt (Amphibia, Urodela) Triturus cristatus carnifex (T. c. c.) unlike that so far described by other authors in mammals. Using methylation sensitive and insensitive enzymes (HpaII and MspI) and successive 3 ′ <b>terminal</b> <b>labelling</b> (fill-in), we found a greater degree of DNA methylation in premeiotic germ and sperm cells compared to somatic tissue such as hepatocytes. Furthermore the degree of total DNA methylation in spermatozoa appears somewhere between premeiotic germ cells and somatic tissue. Blot hybridization shows that two highly conserved repetitive sequences in amphibian T. c. c., pTvm 1 and pTvm 8, contribute significantly to the degree of DNA methylation, suggesting a function for these sequences, such as a role in transcriptional regulation...|$|E

The injections {{were confined to}} one barrel column (i. e. barrel in layer IV + cortical tissue above and below it). Axonal terminations could be demonstrated in three thalamic nuclei: reticularis (RT), ventrobasalis (VB) and posterior (PO). Anterograde <b>terminal</b> <b>labelling</b> was obtained in RT + VB; in PO only; or in RT + VB + PO. The terminals labelled in PO were much larger than those in RT and VB. The termination areas in RT, VB and PO were shaped like rods which have a rostro-caudal orientation. These cortico-thalamic projections are discretely and topographically organized. The clearest such arrangement was found in VB. Here, projections from the A row of barrels in BF terminate dorsally, whereas those from the C row end ventrally. Barrel A 1 projects to the lateral part of VB, whereas A 4, to more medial parts; other rows are arranged similarly. These results were compared with the distribution of thalamo-cortical projection neurons that were labelled after iontophoretic HRP injections in individual barrels.

Electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral fore- or hindimbs or somatotopically corresponding parts of the contralateral motor cortex evoked climbing fibre field potentials at the same cerebellar recording sites. Forelimb-related responses were located in the C 1 zone in the paramedian lobule or lobulus simplex and hindlimb-related responses were located in the C 1 zone in the copula pyramidis. Microinjections of anterograde axonal tracer (Fluoro-Ruby or Fluoro-Emerald) were made into the fore- or hindlimb parts of the motor cortex where stimulation evoked the largest cerebellar responses. After a survival period of 7 – 10 days, the neuraxis was examined for anterograde labelling. No <b>terminal</b> <b>labelling</b> was ever found in the inferior olive, but labelled terminals were consistently found in a well-localized site in the dorso-medial medulla, ventral to the gracile nucleus, termed the matrix region. Pharmacological inactivation of the matrix region (2 mm caudal to the obex) selectively reduced transmission in descending (cerebro-olivocerebellar) but not ascending (spino-olivocerebellar) paths targeting fore- or hindlimb-receiving parts of the C 1 zone. Transmission in spino-olivocerebellar paths was either unaffected, or in some cases increased. The identification of a novel pre-olivary relay in cerebro-olivocerebellar paths originating from fore- and hindlimb motor cortex has implications for the regulation of transmission in climbing fibre pathways during voluntary movements and motor learning...|$|E

40|$|We {{observed}} {{the growth of}} 2 sublines of leukaemia L 1210 in histocompatible DBA 2 mice given 10 (3) cells i. p. and studied the protective effect of Corynebacterium parvum (CP). The growth of subline L 1210 -M was unaffected by pretreatment with CP or admixture with 10 (5) peritoneal cells (PC) from CP-treated mice. In contrast, the growth of subline L 1210 -C was inhibited; CP pretreatment increased the proportion of long-term survivors (70 % vs 20 %) and admixture with CP-PC prolonged the survival time (59 days vs 49 days; P less than 0. 05). In vitro experiments indicated that Sublines M and C were equally sensitive to cytostasis by CP-PC, as measured in a <b>terminal</b> <b>labelling</b> assay (greater than 90 % inhibition of proliferation). However, subline C was much more sensitive to cytolysis (18 h 125 IUDR-release assay) by CP-PC; percentage specific release from L 1210 -C was at least 90 %, whilst from L 1210 -M it was generally less than 25 %. The differential susceptibility of the 2 sublines to cytolytic PC was maintained through 75 passages in culture. The effector cells {{were considered to be}} macrophages, because they were adherent, phagocytic, and sensitive to silica. Cytolysis was unrelated to endotoxin contamination, because it was not inhibited by polymyxin B, and was inhibited by pre-incubating PC in culture medium for 24 or 48 h before adding target cells. Thus the relevance of nonspecific macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro to tumour resistance in vivo may depend on the strength of the cytotoxic reaction...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{precision}} of retinotopy in primate visual cortex is commonly thought {{to result from}} highly ordered arrangement of fibres in the visual pathways. However, rigid point-to-point representation is hardly compatible with findings of a substantial reorganization of visual cortical maps after peripheral and central lesions. Such observations could {{be accounted for by}} divergence in the optic radiation. To explore the hypothesis of fibre divergence, we made small knife cuts in the distal optic radiation of macaca fascicularis. After subsequent axonal tracing by injecting W G A- H R P into lateral geniculate nucleus, we studied the course of distal fibres in white matter. The amount of divergence was assessed by measuring, relative to the prevailing fibre course, length and orientation of labelled fibres between lesion and entry into cortex. Lesion sizes between 1 mm to 3 mm did not result in any detectable diminution of <b>terminal</b> <b>labelling</b> in layer I V C of striate cortex. Individual labelled fibres were found to diverge symmetrically from both sides into the gap distal to the lesion. Divergence starts at a distance of about 3 mm before cortex. At the white matter boundary, less than 10 % of all fibres still retain the original direction, with the remaining fibres taking any other orientation without preference. We estimate that this corresponds to a divergence of visual afferents encompassing about 6 — 10 mm of cortical distance, if intracortical arborization of terminal fibres is taken into account. Possible consequences for functional plasticity in the adult primate visual cortex are discussed.

40|$|Three {{series of}} {{experiments}} were done to investigate the output pathways from the central nucleus of the amygdala (ACe) involved in the control of arterial pressure. The first {{series of experiments}} provided the first demonstration that the arterial pressure responses elicited during stimulation of ACe were mediated via a direct pathway to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST). Microinjection of retrograde tract tracers into depressor regions of BST resulted in labelled neurons within predominantly the lateral subdivision of ACe. In addition, iontophoresis of the anterograde tract tracer PHA-L into cardiovascular responsive regions of ACe resulted in fiber and presumptive <b>terminal</b> <b>labelling</b> within the cardiovascular responsive region of BST. Furthermore, the depressor responses elicited during stimulation of ACe were attenuated after blocking synaptic transmission BST.;The second series of experiments showed unequivocally that ACe neurons received inputs from the ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Using retrograde and anterograde tract tracers in combination with immunohistochemistry for the catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, it was demonstrated that the A 1 noradrenergic cell group in VLM predominantly innervated ACe. In addition, stimulation of sites within VLM that overlapped this catecholaminergic cell group were shown to alter the discharge rate of 47 % of spontaneously active single units in ACe. Of these units 44 % also responded to baroreceptor afferent inputs.;The third series of experiments provided evidence for inputs to ACe neurons that may function to modulate the cardiovascular output from ACe. Single units in ACe that were silent and were antidromically activated by stimulation of cardiovascular responsive sites within BST did not respond orthodromically to VLM and baroreceptor afferent inputs. However, it was demonstrated that ACe units (6 / 12) that projected directly to BST responded orthodromically to stimulation of insular cortex or paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. Microinjections of L-glutamate into ACe {{in the presence of}} tyramine or noradrenaline within ACe, significantly attenuated the depressor responses elicited from ACe. In addition, GABAergic neurons in ACe were also shown {{for the first time to}} alter the cardiovascular output from ACe.;These data have provided evidence for a cardiovascular pathway from ACe to BST that may be modulated by noradrenergic inputs from VLM...|$|E

The results complemented a parallel study of retrograde neuronal labeling attributable to injecting WGA-HRP into NRTP and neighboring pontine nuclei. Small 3 H-leucine injections confined to MT, MST, LIP, area 7 a, or area 7 b, produced multiple patches of pontine <b>terminal</b> <b>label</b> distributed as follows: (1) An injection within MT produced <b>terminal</b> <b>label</b> limited to the dorsolateral and lateral pontine nuclei, (2) Injections restricted to MST or LIP showed patches of <b>terminal</b> <b>label</b> in the dorsal, dorsolateral, lateral, and peduncular pontine nuclei. (3) Area 7 a targets the dorsal, dorsolateral, lateral, peduncular, and ventral pontine nuclei, whereas area 7 b projects, additionally, to the dorsomedial and paramedian pontine nuclei. Notably, no projections were seen to NRTP from any of these cortical areas. In contrast, injections made by other investigators into cortical areas anterior to the central sulcus revealed cerebrocortical afferents to NRTP, in addition to nuclei of the basal pontine gray. With our pontine WGA-HRP injections, retrograde neuronal labeling was observed over a large extent of the frontal cortex continuing onto the medial surface which included {{the lining of the}} cingulate sulcus and cingulate gyrus. Significant subcortical sources for afferents to the NRTP and basal pontine nuclei were the zona incerta, ventral mesencephalic tegmentum, dorsomedial hypothalamic area, rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, red nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus. The combined anterograde and retrograde labeling data indicated that visuo-motor cortico-pontine pathways arising from parietal cortices target only the basal pontine gray, whereas the NRTP, together with select pontine nuclei, is a recipient of afferents from frontal cortical areas.
