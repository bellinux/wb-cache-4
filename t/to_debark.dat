5|$|After {{arriving}} off Trondheim, Admiral Hipper successfully passed {{herself off}} as a British warship long enough to steam past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. The ship entered the harbor and docked shortly before 05:30 <b>to</b> <b>debark</b> the mountain troops. After the ground troops seized control of the coastal batteries, the ship left Trondheim, bound for Germany. She was escorted by Friedrich Eckoldt; she reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, and went into drydock. The dockyard workers discovered the ship had been damaged more severely by the collision with Glowworm than had previously been thought. Nevertheless, repairs were completed {{in the span of}} two weeks.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{withdrew the}} next day as well, {{carrying}} the wounded British sailors to Jamaica before putting into Port-au-Prince, <b>to</b> <b>debark</b> the many foreign refugees picked up at Cape Haiten. After consultations with the American Consul, Capt. Walker took De Soto back to Cap-Haïtien on 7 November. There, he negotiated with a British squadron under Captain Macguire in HMS Galatea {{in the hopes of}} averting a retaliatory bombardment of the town, particularly as the Americans feared such an act would provoke widespread unrest and attacks on foreigners throughout Haiti. These talks failed and on 9 November, the British squadron bombarded the town in conjunction with an attack by President Geffrard's forces. With the defensive works destroyed and the town falling to government forces, the rebel leaders took refuge on De Soto. Capt. Walker then carried them to Monte Christo in the Dominican Republic. De Soto returned to Cape Haiten {{to keep an eye on}} events until 13 December when she sailed for home, arriving in Hampton Roads on 19 December.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawknife}} {{is commonly}} used to remove large slices of wood for flat faceted work, <b>to</b> <b>debark</b> trees, or to create roughly rounded or cylindrical billets for further work on a lathe, or it can shave like a spokeshave plane, where finer finishing is less of concern than a rapid result. The thin blade lends itself to create complex concave or convex curves.|$|E

30|$|Our {{analysis}} revealed that large saplings {{within the range of}} 30  cm in height and 3  cm in DBH in subalpine forests were most susceptible for debarking by sika deer. In addition to the size, saplings in low elevation zone or near subalpine grasslands were more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>debarking</b> by sika deer. This information may be useful to improve monitoring deer impact, or determining where to construct deer fences in the subalpine region. At the same time, deer population control in the subalpine region should be conducted in forests of low elevation zone or near subalpine grasslands.|$|R
25|$|Manchuria was {{acquired}} by the Navy from the United States Shipping Board on 10 April 1918 and commissioned USS Manchuria (ID-1633) at New York on 25 April 1918, Commander Charles S. Freeman in command, and assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force. Manchuria departed New York with a convoy on 30 April with the 18th Field Artillery and the 153d and 154th Infantry Battalions embarked for Europe arriving in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 May <b>to</b> <b>debark</b> her passengers.

25|$|The Bolshevik {{revolution}} left Russia's vast southern territories unguarded, {{except for}} a few thousand Armenian volunteers equipped with castoff Russian arms, commanded by Tovmas Nazarbekian and an even smaller force of refugees from western Anatolia led by Andranik Ozanian, spread along a line extending from Yerevan to Van and Erzinjan. The Third Army's offense headed by Vehib Pasha began on February 5. The Ottoman forces moved through east of the line between Tirebolu and Bitlis and took Kelkit on February 7, Erzincan on February 13, Bayburt on February 19, Tercan on February 22, the Black Sea port of Trabzon on February 24. The incoming sea-borne reinforcements began <b>to</b> <b>debark</b> at Trabzon. Manzikert, Hınıs, Oltu, Köprüköy and Tortum followed over the following two weeks. By March 24 the Ottoman forces were crossing the 1914 frontier into what had been Russian Empire territory.|$|E
25|$|Invasion by air is an {{invention}} of the 20th century and modern warfare. The idea involves sending military units into a territory by aircraft. The aircraft either land, allowing the military units <b>to</b> <b>debark</b> and attempt their objective, or the troops exit the aircraft while still in the air, using parachutes or similar devices to land in the territory being invaded. Many times air assaults {{have been used to}} pave the way for a ground- or sea-based invasion, by taking key positions deep behind enemy lines such as bridges and crossroads, but an entirely air-based invasion has never succeeded. Two immediate problems are resupply and reinforcement. A large airborne force cannot be adequately supplied without meeting up with ground forces; an airborne force too small simply places themselves into an immediate envelopment situation. Arguments in favor of this method generally relate to the ability to target specific areas that may not necessarily be easily accessible by land or sea, a greater chance of surprising the enemy and overwhelming defensive structures, and, in many cases, the need for a reduced number of forces due to the element of surprise. Arguments against this method typically involve capacity to perform such an invasion—such as the sheer number of planes that would be needed to carry a sufficient number of troops—and the need for a high level of intelligence in order for the invasion to be successful.|$|E

50|$|Vernon County {{carried out}} {{training}} {{activities in the}} days that ensued, lifting 185 field troops from E Company, 2nd Battalion, 26th Marine Regiment, from Chu Lai <b>to</b> Danang. <b>Debarking</b> the Marines on 10 August 1969, Vernon County loaded cargo that day for shipment to Okinawa. Although initially slated to depart on 10 August 1969, the loss of the ship's stern anchor forced a delay of one full day. She ultimately accomplished the cargo lift, however, reaching White Beach, Okinawa, on 16 August 1969.|$|R

6000|$|On the 27th McClernand's corps was all at Hard Times, and McPherson's was {{following}} closely. I had {{determined to make}} the attempt to effect a landing {{on the east side}} of the river as soon as possible. Accordingly, on the morning of the 29th, McClernand was directed to embark all the troops from his corps that our transports and barges could carry. About 10,000 men were so embarked. The plan was to have the navy silence the guns at Grand Gulf, and to have as many men as possible ready <b>to</b> <b>debark</b> in the shortest possible time under cover of the fire of the navy and carry the works by storm.

30|$|Tree and sapling sizes {{affected}} {{the occurrence of}} debarking but the effects of sizes showed opposite patterns for trees and saplings (Tables  1 and 3). Higher percentages of debarked small trees were also reported in many previous studies (Akashi and Nakashizuka 1999; Yokoyama et al. 2001; Nagaike and Hayashi 2003; Jiang et al. 2005; Kiffner et al. 2008; Takeuchi et al. 2011; Borkowski and Ukalski 2012), although the reasons were not clarified. One possibility for the selective debarking of small trees is the relative ease of debarking smaller trees (Ando et al. 2004). In contrast to trees, the relationship between sapling size and the occurrence of debarking has rarely been examined. Takatsuki and Gorai (1994) compared the size structure of trees between two distinct areas in Japan that differed in deer density. They showed that forests with high deer density lacked saplings[*]>[*] 90  cm in height, whereas there were abundant saplings shorter than 90  cm in forests both under high and low deer densities. In the present study, {{one reason for the}} low debarking intensity on small saplings (Table  1) is that they are more difficult to find than large saplings. Consequently, saplings > 30  cm in height and[*]<[*] 3  cm in DBH might be more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>debarking</b> by deer, suggesting that these might be a possible optimal size for debarking by sika deer.|$|R
40|$|A {{case study}} on the {{behavioral}} responses of ambrosia beetles to some pesticidal formulations was carried out at a logging area in West Kalimantan in 1981. Each pesticide formulation was sprayed <b>to</b> <b>debarked</b> logs of fresh 1 % felled ramin trees (Gonystylus bancanus Kurz. }. The tested logs were, then, allowed for the beetle infestations for four weeks, and inspections were conducted weekly to count the beetle tunnels. A lower intensity of the beetle infestation on the treated logs than those on the controls was considered as an inhibitory response. in contrast, a higher intensity of the infestation on the treated logs was indicatively caused by a stimulatory response. These following conclusions are drawn from this study: 1. A highly inhibitory response on the ambrosia beetle attacks was shown by treatments with pesticide containing 50 % cypermethrin or 50 % fenithrotion. 2. Ramin logs treated with pesticide containing either 30 % TCMTB or a mixture of 90 % thiourea + 10 % quarternary ammonium + 0. 1 % diazenium dioxy seemed to be highly stimulating to the beetles. The stimulating effect of the second formulation initially decreased and lost afterwards if the diazenium dioxy component was increased by 0. 1 to 0. 2 %. A doubtful record was shown if the TCMTB was mixed with 2 % borax. 3. The pesticide containing 5 % Cu- 8 -oxyquinolinolate and 80 % dichlofluanid were also unaffected to the beetle response...|$|R

60|$|Then {{we came to}} Ponta do Sol, {{the only}} {{remarkable}} site on the trip, famous for bodice-making and infamous for elephantiasis. Here a huge column of curiously contorted basalt has been connected by a solid high-arched causeway with the cliff, which is equally remarkable, showing a central boss of stone with lines radiating quaquaversally. There are outer steps and an inner flight leading under a blind archway, the latter supplied with a crane. The landing in the levadia, or surf, is abominable and a life-boat waits accidents outside. It works with the heavy Madeiran oars, square near the grip and provided with a board into whose hole the pin fits. The townlet, capital of the 'comarca,' fronted by its little Alameda and a strip of beach upon which I should prefer <b>to</b> <b>debark,</b> shows a tall factory-chimney, noting the sugar-works of Wilhabram Bros. There is a still larger establishment at the Serra d'Agoa in the Arco [Footnote: Arco (bow, arch) is locally applied to a ridge or to the district bounded by it.] da Calheta (Arch of the Creeklet), a property of the Visconde de Calçada.

40|$|Public {{agencies}} {{tackling the}} issues of natural resource management need objective analysis to anticipate the ecosystem consequences of their actions. Mathematical models {{can be regarded as}} an effective tool to support decision makers in this context because of their predictive capacity and of their ability to describe complex natural systems.

As an example, we consider a case study where a domestic herbivore, the sheep, was introduced as a natural regulator of grass growth. The results show that the introduction of sheep is not currently sustainable and that it should be complemented by other measures in order to tackle both the issue of regulating grass growth and <b>to</b> prevent <b>debarking</b> of the newly planted trees...|$|R
