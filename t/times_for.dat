5|$|Gould's five {{brothers}} were all notable rugby players and athletes. His brother Bob was a forward who played 136 <b>times</b> <b>for</b> Newport Rugby Football Club, whom he captained in the 1886–87 season. Bob was also capped 11 <b>times</b> <b>for</b> Wales between 1882 and 1887, and captained his country once, versus Scotland in 1887. A younger brother, Bert, was a centre who played three <b>times</b> <b>for</b> Wales – he appeared with Gould in the Welsh {{team that won}} the Triple Crown {{for the first time}} in 1893. His other brothers – Harry, Gus and Wyatt – all played rugby for Newport. Wyatt captained Newport in 1905–06, and Harry played for them in their inaugural season of 1875–76. For the first 29 seasons of its existence, Newport RFC always had at least one of the Gould brothers in the team. Wyatt played for the club until 1907; he also ran the 400m hurdles for Great Britain in the 1908 Summer Olympics.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of their performances during the game, Tennessee's James Stewart and Virginia Tech's Maurice DeShazo were named the game's most valuable players. Stewart finished the game having carried the ball 22 <b>times</b> <b>for</b> 85 yards and three rushing touchdowns. Stewart also caught one pass for seven yards and threw a touchdown pass for 19 yards. On the other side, DeShazo completed 17 of his 30 passes for 140 yards and two interceptions. He also ran the ball 11 <b>times</b> <b>for</b> 39 yards and a rushing touchdown.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} rushing offense, {{the two teams}} {{differed}} wildly. Virginia Tech, led by Vick, ran for 278rushing yards. Florida State, meanwhile, ran for just 30yards. The Seminoles were led on the ground by Chaney, who carried the ball four <b>times</b> <b>for</b> 43yards, and Minor, who carried the ball nine <b>times</b> <b>for</b> 35yards. Much of these two players' rushing total was negated by Chris Weinke, who lost 41yards on seven carries. Virginia Tech, bolstered by Vick's 97rushing yards, also saw André Kendrick accumulate 69yards and two touchdowns with 12carries and Shyrone Stith pick up 68yards on 11carries.|$|E

40|$|The test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> core-external {{interconnect}} {{shorts and}} opens is typically {{much less than}} that for core-internal logic. Therefore, prior work on test-infrastructure design for core-based system-ona-chip (SOC) has mainly focused on minimizing the test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> core-internal logic. However, as feature sizes shrink for newer process technologies, the test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> signal integrity (SI) faults on interconnects cannot be neglected. The test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> SI faults can be comparable to, or even larger than, the test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the embedded cores. We investigate the impact of interconnect SI tests on SOC test-architecture design and optimization. A compaction method for SI faults and algorithms for test-architecture optimization are also presented. Experimental results for the ITC’ 02 benchmarks show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the overall testing <b>time</b> <b>for</b> core-internal logic and core-external interconnects...|$|R
