5|$|The {{coastal plain}} of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to {{deciduous}} forests and <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> of the Piedmont. The Appalachian Mountains divide {{the eastern seaboard}} from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.

5|$|The highway {{continues}} {{parallel to}} the state line from the Marensico area through the national forest toward Watersmeet. That unincorporated community {{is the home of}} the Watersmeet High School Nimrods, the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel. The area is also where the waters meet; <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> drain to Lake Superior via the Ontonagon River, to Lake Michigan via the Brule and Menominee rivers, or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers. Also located in the area are the Sylvania Wilderness, and the Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation, which includes the Lac Vieux Desert Casino and Resort. The highway travels southeasterly from Watersmeet around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County. US2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 (FFH16) near Golden Lake in Stambaugh Township {{in the middle of the}} national forest. The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M‑73. In town, US2 intersects M‑189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} geography of New England is diverse {{for such a}} small area. Southeastern New England is covered by a narrow coastal plain, while the western and northern regions are dominated by <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> and worn-down peaks of {{the northern end of}} the Appalachian Mountains. The Atlantic fall line lies close to the coast, which enabled numerous cities to take advantage of water power along the numerous rivers, such as the Connecticut River, which bisects the region from north to south.|$|E
25|$|Greensboro {{is located}} among <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> of North Carolina's Piedmont, {{situated}} midway between the state's Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains {{to the west}} and the Atlantic beaches and Outer Banks to the east. The view of the city from its highest building—the Lincoln Financial tower (commonly known as the Jefferson-Pilot Building after its previous owner)—shows an expanse of shade trees in the city. Interstates 40 and 85 intersect at the city, and the planned I-73 is to pass through its borders.|$|E
25|$|The {{wines are}} all {{produced}} around rivers, mainly the Rhine and its tributaries, often sheltered by mountains. The rivers have significant microclimate effects to moderate the temperature. The soil is slate in the steep valleys, {{to absorb the}} sun's heat and retain it overnight. On <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> the soil is lime and clay dominated. The great sites are often extremely steep so they catch the most sunlight, but they are difficult to harvest mechanically. The slopes are also positioned facing the south or south-west to angle towards the sun.|$|E

50|$|The area of {{land that}} is {{occupied}} by Doncaster East mostly consists of <b>rolling</b> <b>hills,</b> creek valleys and short ridges.

25|$|Topography {{is mostly}} gently {{rolling in the}} Springfield and Salem Plateaus, whereas the Saint Francois Mountains are more rugged. Although the Springfield formation's surface is {{primarily}} Mississippian limestone and chert, the Salem Plateau is older Ordovician dolostones, limestones, and sandstones. Both are rife with karst topography and form long, flat plains. The formations are separated by steep escarpments that dramatically interrupt <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills.</b> Although much of the Springfield Plateau has been denuded of the surface layers of the Boston Mountains, large remnants of these younger layers are present throughout {{the southern end of}} the formation, possibly suggesting a peneplain process. The Springfield Plateau drains through wide, mature streams ultimately feeding the White River.|$|E
25|$|After this settlement, George Fisher, who was {{commissioned}} by the Métis in Manitoba, set out to explore the land around the area. He was to report back on {{the conditions of the}} land. Fisher found that this new land was abundant with other animals besides buffalo to hunt, like mule and white tail deer, pronghorn antelope and elk. He also noted that there were more than just animals to hunt. Other food like wild saskatoons, chokecherries and strawberries were in the area. There were also protection from <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills,</b> springs and creeks that other lands did not have. This exploration {{led to the development of}} a new settlement, La Montagne de Bois, or Wood Mountain.|$|E

25|$|The {{municipality}} has rolling hills, {{mountain ranges}} and flatlands. Most of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> cross the territory from south to north, paralleling the Querétaro-San Luis Potosí highway. Most plains {{are located in}} the north, and are of sedimentary soil with some protrusions of volcanic rock. Altitude varies from 1,900 to 2,460 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at mountains called El Buey, Pie de Gallo, El Patol, El Nabo, and El Paisano. The city proper is on a plain at 1,900 meters. There is only one river, the Querétaro River, which carved the La Cañada. There are numerous streams, many of them seasonal, and fresh water springs near the mountain areas. The climate is temperate and semi-dry in which the summers can be hot, with high up to 36C in May and June. Freezing temperatures are possible in the winter.|$|E
25|$|Twomey’s Calistoga Estate Vineyard, {{surrounding}} the Calistoga Winery, and Healdsburg Estate Vineyard, on the Healdsburg winery property, are planted with Sauvignon Blanc. Their sources of fruit for their Merlot, Pinot noir and Sauvignon blanc wines come from estate-owned vineyards in the Napa, Russian River and Anderson Valleys, and from independent partner growers {{who have a}} contract with Twomey to grow grapes for them. The Duncan family’s purchase of the Soda Canyon Ranch vineyard in 1999 in southeastern Napa Valley was the impetus for Twomey’s creation. They originally purchased Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard to produce Cabernet Sauvignon for Silver Oak. However, when winemaker Daniel Baron discovered it was also planted with quality French clones of Merlot, he approached the Duncans about making a Merlot using techniques he learned while working in France and Twomey began. Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard is located in <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> of southeastern Napa Valley and its volcanic soils are tightly planted with French Merlot clones.|$|E
25|$|The City of Hoover was {{incorporated}} in 1967. It {{was named after}} William H. Hoover, a local insurance company owner. The area had been known as the Green Valley community since the 1930s and was mostly a residential community. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the city was still mostly residential with a small City Hall that included space for the police department. The annexation of the Riverchase business and residential community on September 8, 1980 provided a base of large office buildings and employers to the city. A significant change to the city occurred when Interstate I-459 was opened with a major interchange with Interstate I-65 within the city. The most dramatic change occurred in 1986 when the Riverchase Galleria shopping-hotel-office complex opened. This significantly increased the tax revenue for the city. It was the catalyst to bring new residents and businesses to the city. The city has grown extremely fast with annexations and new developments. The city now provides services from many large city facilities including a Municipal Center, a Library, and a Public Safety Center. Residents and businesses {{are drawn to the}} city because of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>hills</b> and nice residential areas, schools, city services, shopping, and business communities. The city will likely continue to boom population wise; the population has risen significantly in Hoover from 2008 and is now 81,619 as of the 2010 Census.|$|E
