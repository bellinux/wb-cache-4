5|$|Brown {{and white}} {{granulated}} sugar are 97% <b>to</b> <b>nearly</b> 100% carbohydrates, respectively, with less than 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white sugar.|$|E

The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.|$|E
