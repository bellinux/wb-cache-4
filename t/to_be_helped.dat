5|$|At over 80, Mondragón {{was still}} able to mount on horseback, though he had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> by two men and could only wear light armour. He first came to {{prominence}} at the Battle of Mühlberg, in 1547, {{and was one of the}} few Spanish officers of good fame in the rebel provinces, being portrayed in a positive light by contemporaneous Dutch authors such as Hugo Grotius and Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Mondragón planned not only to relieve Groenlo, but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle. The Dutch general, however, on receiving news of his enemy's march, set fire to supplies, tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two miles out of Groenlo. Mondragón could therefore ressuply the town unmolested.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on {{the cause of his}} illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In the 1961–62 NBA season, {{the aging}} Cousy {{slowly began to}} fade statistically, {{averaging}} 15.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists, and was voted into the All-NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations. Still, he enjoyed a satisfying postseason, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4–3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title. Finally, in the 1962–63 NBA season, {{the last of his}} career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination. In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4–2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: {{in the fourth quarter of}} Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> to the bench. He went back in with Boston up 1. Although he did not score again, his was credited with providing an emotional lift that carried the Celtics to victory, 112–109. The game ended with Cousy throwing the ball into the rafters.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson {{struggled}} in the 2011 playoffs, {{as he returned}} from a lower-body injury that kept him from the six games {{near the end of}} the regular season. Recording three points over 11 games against the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was suspected he was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, he fell to the ice while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his adductor tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. With Samuelsson out of the lineup, Vancouver advanced to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins.|$|E

5|$|The Canucks {{entered the}} 2012 playoffs against the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings. With Daniel {{out with a}} {{concussion}} Vancouver lost the first two games. In Game 3, Henrik received a hard hit from Kings' forward Dustin Brown—he had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> onto the bench following the hit {{and went to the}} locker room for six minutes. Despite later returning to the game, the Canucks lost 1–0. With Daniel back in the lineup for Game 4, Henrik registered a goal and an assist in a 3–1 Canucks' victory. Facing elimination in Game 5, Henrik scored a power play goal late in the first period to give Vancouver the early lead, though Canucks were unable to add another goal and eventually lost 2–1 in overtime. Henrik finished the playoffs with two goals and five points to lead the team in scoring.|$|E
5|$|Tony wanders in {{delirium}} {{until he}} is rescued by Mr. Todd, who rules over a small native tribe in a remote clearing in the jungle. Todd nurses Tony back to health. Although illiterate, Todd owns copies of the complete works of Charles Dickens, and asks Tony to read to him. However, when Tony's health recovers and he asks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> on his way, the old man repeatedly demurs. The readings continue, but the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing as Tony realises he is being held against his will. When a search party finally reaches the settlement, Todd arranges that Tony be drugged and kept hidden; he tells the party that Tony has died, and gives them his watch to take home. When Tony awakes he learns that his hopes of rescue are gone, {{and that he is}} condemned to read Dickens to his captor indefinitely. Back in England, Tony's death is accepted; Hetton passes to his cousins, who erect a memorial to his memory, while Brenda marries Tony's friend Jock Grant-Menzies.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{recovered}} and Clemson's kick returner {{ran out of}} bounds at the Tigers' 12-yard line. Dantzler scrambled for two yards, but Virginia Tech linebacker Jake Houseright was injured during the play and left the game. After a delay while the injured Houseright was helped off the field, Dantzler scrambled for six yards. Bernard Rambert gained a first down with a two-yard run, then he gained five yards on a run up the middle. Dantzler followed the gain with a 13-yard run {{of his own and}} a first down at the Clemson 40-yard line. Rambert caught a five-yard pass from Dantzler, then he ran for one yard up {{the left side of the}} field. During the play, Rambert was injured and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> off the field. He was replaced by third-string freshman running back Keith Kelly. Dantzler threw an incomplete pass on third down, then Somaini punted the ball to Virginia Tech. The kick bounced off the chest of the Virginia Tech kick returner, and the loose ball was scooped up by Robert Carswell of Clemson. Following the turnover, Clemson's offense had a first down at the Tech 20-yard line with 8:44 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|During the off-season, Kariya {{became a}} {{restricted}} free agent before re-signing with the Ducks to a one-year, $10 million contract in July 2002. Prior to the signing, the Ducks made two key acquisitions, signing playmaking centre Adam Oates to a one-year deal and trading for winger Petr Sýkora from the New Jersey Devils. Both acquisitions {{were made with}} Kariya's input, {{as well as with}} the expectation they would play on a line with him. Although Oates was injured at the beginning of the season (during which time Kariya played with his usual centre, Rucchin), the trio formed the Ducks' top line. Despite playing under a defensive system, implemented by new head coach Mike Babcock, the arrival of Kariya's new linemates coincided with a resurgence in offensive production for him in 2002–03. Several months into the campaign, however, his father died of a heart attack. The Ducks gave Kariya the option to sit out the following game against the Vancouver Canucks, which he played nonetheless on December 28, 2002. He recorded an assist in a 7–3 loss. At mid-season, Kariya was selected as a reserve to his seventh and final NHL All-Star Game, held in February 2003. He scored the deciding shootout goal for the Western Conference, as his team beat the East 6–5. While his 25 goals marked the lowest total of his career since his 22-game 1997–98 season, his 56 assists approached a personal best. With 81 points over 82 games, he led the Ducks in scoring for the fifth time. His efforts helped the Mighty Ducks to the seventh seed in the West, marking the team's return to the playoffs for the first time in four years. Matching up against the second-seeded Red Wings in the first round, Kariya opened the playoffs with a triple-overtime winner in Game 1, resulting in a 2–1 Ducks win. Anaheim went on to sweep the Red Wings in four games; Kariya scored his second goal of the series in the deciding contest, a 3–2 overtime win. It marked the second time in league history that a team eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion in four-straight games in the first round. The Mighty Ducks went on to eliminate the Dallas Stars and Minnesota Wild in the next two rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. During Game 6 of the series against New Jersey, a contest in which the Ducks faced elimination, Kariya received a hard open-ice hit from opposing defenceman Scott Stevens. Laying motionless on the ice for several minutes, he needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> to the dressing room. Many felt Kariya's equipment changes following his first concussion may have saved him from being rendered unconscious from the Stevens hit. Four-and-a-half minutes of playing time later, he returned to the game. Following his return, he scored on a slapshot while skating down the wing to give the Ducks a 4–1 lead. Anaheim went on to win the game 5–2 to force a Game 7; Kariya finished the contest with a goal and two assists. Reactions regarding Stevens' hit were divided following the game. Kariya told reporters that after looking at replays that Stevens had used his elbow, while Ducks Head Coach Mike Babcock described it as a late hit. The play was not penalized during the game, however, and Stevens received no disciplinary measures from the League. Playing the deciding Game 7 in New Jersey, the Ducks lost the Stanley Cup by a 3–0 score. Over 21 games, Kariya finished third on the team in playoff scoring (behind Adam Oates and Petr Sýkora), scoring six goals and 12 points. Much of Anaheim's success was predicated on goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère's performance, who was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. Kariya, meanwhile, was often singled out for his lack of consistent impact throughout the playoffs. As the highest-profile player on the Ducks, he drew matchups against opposing teams top defencemen during the post-season, such as Willie Mitchell against the Wild and Stevens against the Devils. He had also played part of the post-season with a separated shoulder.|$|E

25|$|Altruism {{research}} suggests that helping behaviour is more likely when there are similarities between the helper and the person being helped. Recent research has considered the role of similarity, and more specifically, shared group membership, in encouraging bystander intervention. In one experiment (2005), researchers found that bystanders {{were more likely to}} help an injured person if that person was wearing a football jersey of a team the bystander liked as opposed to a team the bystander did not like. However, when their shared identity as football fans was made salient, supporters of both teams were likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped,</b> significantly more so than a person wearing a plain shirt.|$|E

25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1862, Kane had {{partially}} recovered from his wound {{and returned to the}} Bucktails. They served as part of Brig. Gen. George Dashiell Bayard's cavalry in the Shenandoah Valley, fighting against Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. At Harrisonburg, he and 104 picked riflemen were sent to the rescue of a regiment that had fallen into an ambush. Kane encountered three Confederate regiments on June 6, 1862. He was struck by a bullet that split the bone below his right knee and his men left him on the field. When he tried to rise after the fighting was over, a Confederate soldier broke his breastbone with a blow from the butt of his rifle and Kane, unconscious, was captured. He was exchanged, for Williams C. Wickham, in mid-August. He returned to duty in time for the Northern Virginia Campaign, but was so weakened that another officer led his regiment. He had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> onto his horse and was forced to walk using crutches; his Harrisonburg wound would reopen repeatedly for the next two years.|$|E
25|$|Keeton played several good-standard matches {{during the}} Second World War, {{including}} appearing {{for a team}} representing the National Police in 1943. He was available for Nottinghamshire from the resumption of English first-class cricket in 1946 and his form seemed merely to carry on from its pre-war excellence. In 1946, {{he was one of}} only seven English batsmen to pass 2000 runs in the season, with 2021 at an average of 43.93, including five centuries. The aggregate was lower in the run-glut sun-filled summer of 1947, but he maintained his average, and though both aggregate and average were down in 1948, he still scored more runs than any other Nottinghamshire batsman. Against the 1948 Australians, Keeton was hit over the heart by a ball from fast bowler Ray Lindwall and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> from the pitch; a precautionary X-ray revealed that the ribs damaged in the 1935 lorry accident had not been broken again, though Keeton did not resume his innings and missed the next two county matches.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of the SA-15 class ships was further proven when icebreaker Admiral Makarov, after having been immobilized for five days, pushed the freshly delivered Nizhneyansk at full power through the ice separating the vessels from Pevek, arriving at the city as the first ships of the year 1983. The freighter received only minor ice damage in the process. During the particularly difficult season, during which around fifty cargo ships were trapped in ice in the East Siberian Sea, the SA-15 class freighters {{were sent to the}} Northern Sea Route {{as soon as they were}} delivered from the Finnish shipyards. They were used to unload cargo from icebound ships and deliver the much-needed supplies to isolated communities along the coast. The ships also acted as escort icebreakers, using their stern notches to tow smaller ships through the ice fields even though it was not their original purpose. Among the ships that received assistance from the new SA-15 class ships was the nuclear icebreaker Sibir which had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> on several occasions by Okha. Unlike the freighters, the icebreaker had no abrasion-resistant coating and suffered from severe hull corrosion that considerably increased the ice resistance of the vessel.|$|E
