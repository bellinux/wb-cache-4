To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E
5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a <b>tiny</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic.

The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E

40|$|Divergent {{migration}} of planets within a viscous circumstellar disk can engender resonance crossings and dramatic excitation of orbital eccentricities. We provide quantitative criteria for <b>the</b> viability <b>of</b> this mechanism. For <b>the</b> orbits <b>of</b> two bodies to diverge, {{a ring of}} viscous material must be shepherded between them. As the ring diffuses in radius {{by virtue of its}} intrinsic viscosity, the two planets are wedged further apart. The ring mass must be smaller than the planetary masses so that <b>the</b> crossing <b>of</b> an individual resonance lasts longer than the resonant libration period. At the same time, the crossing cannot be of such long duration that the disk's direct influence on the bodies' eccentricities interferes with the resonant interaction between the two planets. This last criterion is robustly satisfied because resonant widths are typically <b>tiny</b> <b>fractions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbital radius. We evaluate our criteria not only for giant planets within gaseous protoplanetary disks, but also for shepherd moons that bracket narrow planetary rings in the solar system. A shepherded ring of gas orbiting at a distance of 1 AU from a solar-type star and having a surface density of less than 500 g/cm^ 2, a dimensionless alpha viscosity of 0. 1, and a height-to-radius aspect ratio of 0. 05 can drive two Jovian-mass planets through the 2 : 1 and higher-order resonances so that their eccentricities amplify to values of several tenths. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirement that the disk mass in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planets be smaller than the planet masses, divergent resonance crossings may figure significantly into <b>the</b> orbital evolution <b>of</b> planets during <b>the</b> later stages <b>of</b> disk evolution, including the debris disk phase.
