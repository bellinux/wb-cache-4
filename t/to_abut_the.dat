5000|$|The Little Plain Historic District is a {{predominantly}} residential historic district located in Norwich, Connecticut. When originally listed in 1970, it was centered on Little Plain Park, located about half way between modern downtown Norwich and the Norwichtown green, the colonial {{center of the}} town. From the late 18th century onward this area became a desirable and fashionable area to live, as it was closer to the growing port area of the city. The area was mostly built out by about 1875, and features a rich concentration of Greek Revival, Gothic Revival and Italianate houses, although older and later styles are also represented. [...] The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and enlarged in 1987.

Past the dam, now wider, it continues to flow southwest in a wooded corridor past a Red Hook town park on the west, just outside the Red Hook village line before it flows under Linden Avenue (Dutchess County Route 79). West of Linden it meanders again as it flows to the west for the next mile, just inside the edge of a large wooded area that abuts worked fields, then turns northwestward to cross under Aspinwall Road.|$|E
30|$|The {{treatment}} of end-stage hip arthritis with arthroplasty {{in the young}} or active carries a concerning burden of revision due to improved life expectancy [1]. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) utilising a shorter femoral stem has been proposed to be useful in tackling this challenge. Shorter femoral stems {{have been shown to}} better load the proximal metaphyseal bone, improving proximal implant fixation and osseointegration as well as reducing bone loss from stress shielding [2, 3]. Proponents of their use also declare a lower incidence of mid-thigh pain, as by proximity, the tip of the short stem is less likely <b>to</b> <b>abut</b> <b>the</b> diaphyseal endo-cortices [4, 5]. The more physiological loading resulting from short stem use may be the reason why there is an emergence of studies demonstrating they may be protective against the risk of a periprosthetic fracture when compared with longer uncemented stem designs [6].|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The cytoplasmic bridge {{system that}} links all cells of a Volvox embryo and plays {{a crucial role}} in {{morphogenesis}} is shown to form as a result of localized incomplete cytokinesis; sometimes bridge formation occurs before other regions of the cell have begun to divide. Vesicles, believed to be derived from the cell interior, align along the presumptive cleavage furrow in the bridge-forming region. Apparently it is where these vesicles fail to fuse that bridges are formed. Conventional and high voltage transmission electron microscopy analyses confirm that bridges are regularly spaced; they possess a constant, highly ordered structure throughout cleavage and inversion. Concentric cortical striations (similar to those observed previously in related species) ring each bridge throughout its length and continue out under the plasmalemma of the cell body <b>to</b> <b>abut</b> <b>the</b> striations of neighboring bridges. These striations are closely associated with an electron-dense material that coats the inner face of the membrane throughout the bridge region and appears to be thickest near the equator of each bridge.

40|$|We {{present an}} MRI-based {{anatomic}} {{analysis of a}} series of seven human brains with the semilobar form of holoprosencephaly. The analysis defines a set of common descriptors for a pattern of topo-logical anomaly which is uniform for the set of seven brains. The core of the anomaly is a rostro-caudally aligned midline gray matter ‘seam ’ that extends from the telencephalic-suprachiasmatic junc-tional region <b>to</b> <b>abut</b> <b>the</b> posterior aspect of the callosal commissure. The seam forms the ventricular roof throughout its extent. Rostrally it is formed by the conjoined heads of caudate/accumbens nuclei. It continues caudally as a gray matter bridge in the fundus of the inter-hemispheric fissure, where it bridges right and left neocortex. Fornix, septal nuclei and septal limb of the choroid plexus are absent, and the telencephalic ventricles communicate with the diencephalic via open septal limbs of the choroid fissures. By contrast, the temporal limb of hippocampal formation and the choroid plexus are normal and the temporal limb of the choroid fissure is closed. This topological anomaly of conjoined left and right cortical and nuclear gray matter into a midline seam and absent septal structures is thus confined to the region of the midline telencephalic hemisphere evagination. Total telencephalic growth is strongly correlated with the length of this topologically abnormal midline telencephalic segment. The set of findings is consistent with graded failure of induction of rostral to caudal specification in the midline rostral telencephalic zone...|$|E
40|$|We have {{compared}} methicillin-resistant (Mcr) Staphylococcus aureus isolates from Australia, the UK and the USA {{with regard to}} chromosomal inserts of the macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS) -resistance transposon Tn 554. The American isolates were known to have a distinctive Tn 554 insert, designated insert 6, which was closely associated epidemiologically with the methicillin-resistance phenotype. Southern blots of DNA from Australian and London, UK Mcr isolates were hybridized {{with a range of}} probes related to Tn 554. The isolates had similar or identical Tn 554 inserts, and we consider them to be a single group, designated 'Australondon'. Australondon isolates were compared in detail with a deletion mutant, ANS 62, that had lost the methicillin-resistance determinant rnec, plus other resistance determinants resident in the rnec region of the chromosome, and with an American Mcr isolate containing Tn 554 insert 6. The Australondon isolates had three Tn 554 inserts. Sequence analysis with the polymerase chain reaction showed that all of these inserts differed from classical Tn 554 in that the 3 ' 4 errninal residues of the transposons were reverse complements of the usual GATGTA. One of the Australondon inserts, designated 6 B, closely resembled Tn 554 insert 6 in the sequence of its left flanking chromosomal DNA. This insert was found <b>to</b> <b>abut</b> <b>the</b> deletion from the rnec region which results in strain ANS 62.

40|$|Background/purpose: Little {{is known}} about the force-transmission {{characteristics}} and patterns of telescopic-retained removable partial dentures (RPDs) as related to their type and rigidity (rigid and/or resilient) and <b>the</b> number of <b>abutting</b> teeth supporting <b>the</b> telescopic dentures. In this study, we compared the strain around <b>the</b> <b>abutting</b> teeth and edentulous ridges supporting telescopic-retained RPDs with different designs using a strain gauge technique. Materials and methods: A maxillary model including four abutting teeth (# 14, 13, 23, and 24) was constructed and is referred to as Case 1. In total, four RPD frameworks (two resilient and two rigid) were fabricated for Case 1 with a conventional telescope retainer and attachment-retained telescopic retainer (ARTR) groups. A vertical static load of 280 N was applied, and strain values obtained from the strain gauges were recorded. RPDs were modified according to the following cases—Case 2 included teeth 14, 13, and 23; Case 3 included teeth 14 and 13; and Case 4 included teeth 13 and 23 —and measurements were repeated. A randomized block analysis of the variance test was conducted using a general linear model procedure with statistical software. Multiple comparisons between groups were performed using Tukey’s honest significant difference test (α= 0. 05). Results: RPDs with an ARTR produced more strain distal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>abutting</b> teeth than RPDs with a conventional telescope retainer. Both retainer types with a rigid design produced more strain distal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>abutting</b> teeth than did retainers with a resilient design. RPDs supported by four, three, and two unilateral abutting teeth produced similar strain patterns. RPDs supported by two bilateral <b>abutting</b> teeth produced <b>the</b> highest strain distal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>abutting</b> teeth, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the strains produced by RPDs supported by either two unilateral or bilateral <b>abutting</b> teeth. <b>The</b> highest strain values were obtained from strain gauges distal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> “terminal” <b>abutting</b> teeth. Directions of the principal strain were in a vertical direction for gauges located distal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> terminal <b>abutting</b> teeth. More strain was produced on the posterior edentulous ridges. Conclusion: RPDs with an ARTR and both retainer types with a rigid design produced more strain distal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>abutting</b> teeth.
