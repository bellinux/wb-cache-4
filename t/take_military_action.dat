5|$|When the Treaty of Paris, {{under which}} Spain was to cede the Philippines to the United States, {{was made public}} in December 1898, Luna quickly decided to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action.</b> He {{proposed}} a strategy {{that was designed to}} trap the Americans in Manila before more of their troops could land by executing surprise attacks (guerrilla warfare) while building up strength in the north. If the American forces penetrated his lines, Luna determined that he would wage a series of delaying battles and prepare a fortress in northern Luzon, particularly the Cordillera. This, however, was turned down by the High Command, who still believed that the Americans would grant full independence.|$|E
5|$|As {{happened}} to {{other members of}} the royal family, Boril's ascension forced Strez and his closest supporters to flee, in that case to neighbouring Serbia, where he was welcomed by the reigning Stefan Nemanjić (1196–1228) in 1207 or early 1208. Even though Boril requested the extradition of Strez to Bulgaria, the Serbian ruler hoped to use Strez as a puppet in gaining Bulgarian-held territory. Stefan believed that Strez's royal ancestry and imperial aspirations would make it much easier to impose Serbian rule over Macedonia, Kosovo and Braničevo, as well as Belgrade, all captured by Bulgaria under Kaloyan. At the same time, Boril was unable to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against Strez and his Serbian patron, as he had suffered a major defeat {{at the hands of the}} Latins at Plovdiv. Stefan went as far as to become a blood brother of Strez in a ceremony which Stefan was hoping would secure Strez's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against North Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} a presidential {{election}} and he did not want the U.S. public to believe that he was leading their country into war. Therefore, Johnson decided to wait until after the election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E
50|$|Another view at {{odds with}} {{liberalism}} is that technological innovation and industrialization increase the ability of some countries to exercise power. As trade flows {{and the level of}} interdependence increases, so do the incentives for states to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>actions</b> to reduce their economic vulnerability.|$|R
2500|$|The invasion's Turkish Armed Forces {{code name}} was Operation Atilla. Among Turkish {{speakers}} {{the operation is}} also referred as [...] "Cyprus Peace Operation" [...] (...) or [...] "Operation Peace" [...] (...) or [...] "Cyprus Operation" [...] (...) , as Turkey <b>took</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> on the pretext of a peacekeeping operation.|$|R
50|$|On 14 May 1948 the State of Israel was {{established}} by the Israeli Declaration of Independence. The Arab League and Arab countries were opposed to any partition of Palestine and {{to the establishment of}} Israel, and <b>took</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against the newly formed state in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.|$|R
25|$|North Korea {{threatened}} to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> if South Korea continued to drop leaflets fomenting revolt, Korean Central News Agency reported. According to {{reports in the}} South Korean media, there have been small pockets of protests in North Korea.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Morse, {{who had won}} {{re-election}} in 1962, {{was one of only}} two United States senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (Alaska's Ernest Gruening was the other), which authorized an expansion of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. His central contention was that the resolution violated Article One of the United States Constitution, granting the president the ability to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> {{in the absence of a}} formal declaration of war.|$|E
25|$|On 13 February 2012, {{the trial}} for the {{remaining}} four defendants began in the Auckland High Court. At {{the request of the}} defendants the trial was heard before a jury. In the court the prosecution said the four persons on trial were the ringleaders of the organised criminal group which trained for months to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against civilian targets in their cause for an independent Tuhoe nation, with Tame Iti as leader.|$|E
50|$|On 15 July 1974, a {{military}} coup d'état orchestrated by the right-wing military junta of Athens and the Cypriot National Guard deposed the Cypriot President Makarios. With the pretext of a peacekeeping operation, Turkey <b>took</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> and invaded Cyprus west of Kyrenia in the dawn of 20 July 1974.|$|R
50|$|After {{the signing}} of the peace accords that ended the Second Indochina War the North Vietnam spent two years {{rebuilding}} its military; South Vietnam was hamstrung in its responses by a fear the U.S. Congress would cut off all aid if it <b>took</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against communist buildup. Its army lacked reserves, while the NVA was growing.|$|R
50|$|At the 1916 Easter Rising, 300 Irish Volunteers {{assembled}} at Glenquin Castle, {{but they}} did not <b>take</b> any <b>military</b> <b>action.</b>|$|R
25|$|Morse made a brief {{run for the}} Democratic Party's presidential {{nomination}} in 1960. In 1964, only Morse and Ernest Gruening (D-AK) in the U.S. Senate, opposed the controversial Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. It authorized the president to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> in Vietnam without a declaration of war. He continued {{to speak out against}} the war in the ensuing years, and lost his 1968 bid for reelection to Bob Packwood, who criticized his strong opposition to the war. Morse made two more bids for reelection to the Senate before his death in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Missionaries {{were not}} {{reluctant}} to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> if they considered it {{an effective way}} to Christianize Japan. They often associated military action against Japan with the conquest of China. They thought that well-trained Japanese soldiers who had experienced long civil wars would help their countries conquer China. For example, Alessandro Valignano said to the Philippine Governor {{that it was impossible to}} conquer Japan because the Japanese were very brave and always received military training but that Japan would benefit them when they would conquer China. Francisco Cabral also reported to the King of Spain that priests were able to send to China two or three thousand Japanese Christian soldiers who were brave and were expected to serve the king with little pay.|$|E
25|$|Ankara is {{particularly}} cautious about an independent Kurdish state arising from a destabilized Iraq. Turkey has fought an insurgent {{war against the}} Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish guerrilla group (recognized as a terrorist organization by both the United States and the European Union) seeking Kurdish independence, {{in which more than}} 37,000 people have lost their lives. This has led Ankara to pressure the U.S. into clamping down on guerrilla training camps in northern Iraq, though the U.S. remains reluctant due to northern Iraq's relative stability compared {{to the rest of the}} country as well as its lack of spare forces to divert away from the more contentious areas of Iraq. On October 17, 2007, the Turkish Parliament voted in favour of allowing the Turkish Armed Forces to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against the PKK rebels based in northern Iraq. In response, U.S. President George W. Bush stated that he did not believe it's in Turkey's interests to send troops into Iraq.|$|E
50|$|In practice, a {{protectorate}} {{often has}} direct foreign relations {{only with the}} protecting power, so other states must deal with it by approaching the protector. Similarly, the protectorate rarely <b>takes</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> on its own, but relies on the protector for its defence. This is distinct from annexation, in that the protector has no formal power to control {{the internal affairs of}} the protectorate.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time London was {{stepping}} up pressure on the Provisional Government to <b>take</b> aggressive <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against anti-Treaty units in the south.|$|R

25|$|Organized {{opposition}} to a possible future military attack against Iran by the United States (US) {{is known to have}} started during 2005–2006. Beginning in early 2005, journalists, activists, and academics such as Seymour Hersh, Scott Ritter, Joseph Cirincione, and Jorge E. Hirsch began publishing claims that American concerns over the alleged threat posed by Iran's nuclear program might lead the US government to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against that country in the future. These reports, and the concurrent escalation of tensions between Iran and some Western governments, prompted the formation of grassroots organisations, including Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran in the US and the United Kingdom, to advocate against potential military strikes on Iran. Additionally, several organizations and individuals, including the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, a former United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq, Scott Ritter, the Non-Aligned Movement of 118 states, and the Arab League, have publicly stated their {{opposition to}} a would-be attack on Iran.|$|E
25|$|While {{the regular}} army was being formed, U.S. commanders {{around the country}} needed {{additional}} troops more quickly, and thus the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (which became the Iraqi National Guard by July 2004) was formed. Coalition commanders formed these militia-type units separately in each area; only later were they gradually brought together as one force. There were several instances where they have refused to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against fellow Iraqis, such as in Fallujah, deserted, or allegedly aided the resistance. It is alleged that most guardsmen were drawn from the Shia majority in Southern Iraq or the Kurdish majority in northern Iraq, {{rather than from the}} Sunni area which they were ordered to attack. In September 2004, {{a senior member of the}} National Guard, General Talib al-Lahibi was arrested on suspicion of having links with insurgent groups. In December 2004, it was announced that the Iraqi National Guard would be dissolved. At this time its strength was officially over 40,000 men. Its units became part of the army. The absorption of the ING by the regular army appears to have taken place on January 6, 2005, Iraqi Army Day.|$|E
500|$|Coenwulf {{was unwilling}} to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> in Kent without {{acknowledgement}} from Pope Leo III that Eadberht was a pretender. The basis for this assertion was that Eadberht had reportedly been a priest, and as such had given up any right to the throne. Coenwulf wrote to the Pope and asked Leo to consider making London {{the seat of the}} southern archbishopric, removing the honour from Canterbury; it is likely that Coenwulf's reasons included the loss of Mercian control over Kent. Leo refused to agree to moving the archiepiscopate to London, but in the same letter he agreed that Eadberht's previous ordination made him ineligible for the throne: ...|$|E
50|$|In 1874, Chinese and Japanese {{relations}} were put under strain when the Japanese <b>took</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against Taiwan {{in order to}} pacify natives. Conflict between China and Japan would be averted in Korea in 1885 thanks to the negotiations between Li Hongzhang and Itō Hirobumi {{which led to the}} Tianjin Convention, which established a joint protectorate over Korea. This would postpone a war over Korea by a decade.|$|R
5000|$|On Friday, 31 May 1452, Philip the Good {{declared}} war on Ghent. A month earlier, from April 1452, the Ghent city government was forced to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>actions</b> to secure supplies from the local region. They marched along the Scheldt river to Oudenaarde, Spiere and Helkijn, and along the Dender to Aalst and Geraardsbergen.

50|$|Investigative {{journalist}} Jeremy Scahill {{travels to}} Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, {{and other countries}} where the United States has <b>taken</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> in the War on Terror. In Afghanistan, he investigates the United States military and government cover-up of the deaths of five civilians, including two pregnant women killed by US soldiers from the Joint Special Operations Command. After investigating the attack, Scahill travels to other sites of JSOC intervention, interviewing both proponents and opponents, and the survivors, of such raids, including U.S. Senator Ron Wyden.|$|R
500|$|Clark {{started the}} bombings codenamed Operation Allied Force on March 24, 1999, on orders {{to try to}} enforce U.N. Resolution 1199 {{following}} Yugoslavia's refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement. However, critics note that Resolution 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and does not authorize any organization to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action.</b> Secretary of Defense William Cohen felt that Clark had powerful allies at the White House, such as President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who allowed him to circumvent The Pentagon in promoting his strategic ideas. Clark felt, however, {{that he was not}} being included enough in discussions with the National Command Authority, leading him to describe himself as [...] "just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States". This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington, D.C., to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops, and Clark agreed.|$|E
500|$|Goa, Daman and Diu {{remained}} an outstanding issue. On 15 August 1955, five thousand non-violent demonstrators marched against the Portuguese at the border, and {{were met with}} gunfire, killing 22. In December 1960, the United Nations General Assembly rejected Portugal's contention that its overseas possessions were provinces, and formally listed them as [...] "non-self-governing territories". Although Nehru continued to favour a negotiated solution, the Portuguese suppression of a revolt in Angola in 1961 radicalised Indian public opinion, and increased {{the pressure on the}} Government of India to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action.</b> African leaders, too, put pressure on Nehru to take action in Goa, which they argued would save Africa from further horrors. On 18 December 1961, following the collapse of an American attempt to find a negotiated solution, the Indian Army entered Portuguese India and defeated the Portuguese garrisons there. The Portuguese took the matter to the Security Council but a resolution calling on India to withdraw its troops immediately was defeated by the USSR's veto. Portugal surrendered on 19 December. This take-over ended the last of the European colonies in India. Goa was incorporated into India as a centrally administered union territory and, in 1987, became a state.|$|E
2500|$|In Islamabad alone, Aziz's {{government}} {{was forced to}} <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action,</b> codename Silence after chairing {{a meeting with the}} President. In 2009, Aziz maintained that his government had tried at every level of extreme to resolve the Lal Masjid issue through talks to save lives. In a television interview, Aziz maintained that [...] "We gave them time to leave the mosque and the Imam-e-Kaaba Abdul Rahman Al-Sudais also came to Pakistan on my request in connection with the issue.".|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1840s, the Argentine Confederation {{attempted}} to regulate {{traffic on the}} Paraná and Uruguay rivers, which impacted upon Anglo-French trade with the landlocked Paraguay. As a result, Britain and France <b>took</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> in the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata. Although militarily successful, the victories against Argentine forces proved somewhat pyrrhic and both withdrew their forces and made treaties with Argentina. The peace treaty with the British {{is referred to as}} the Convention of Settlement; or the Arana-Southern Treaty.|$|R

25|$|The 2010 presidential {{election}} {{led to the}} 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis and the Second Ivorian Civil War. International organizations reported numerous human-rights violations by both sides. In the city of Duékoué, hundreds of people were killed. In nearby Bloléquin, dozens were killed. UN and French forces <b>took</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against Gbagbo.

The country was severely damaged by the war, and observers say it will be a challenge for Ouattara to rebuild the economy and reunite Ivorians.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{highlight}} in {{the debate}} happened when candidates were asked by Chris Matthews {{if they need to}} go to Congress to get authorization to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against Iran's nuclear facilities, if they were president of the United States. While Hunter, Huckabee, McCain, Thompson and Giuliani replied they would not obtain Congressional authorization if there was an imminent threat from Iran. Romney replied, [...] "You sit down with your attorneys and (they) tell you what you have to do..."

2500|$|In the {{following}} few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the Wahnzettel ("Madness Letters")—to {{a number of}} friends including Cosima Wagner and Jacob Burckhardt. Most of them were signed [...] "Dionysos", though some were also signed [...] "der Gekreuzigte" [...] meaning [...] "the crucified one". To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: [...] "I have had Caiaphas put in fetters. Also, last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner. Wilhelm, Bismarck, and all anti-Semites abolished." [...] Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot and summoned the European powers to <b>take</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against Germany, that the pope should be put in jail and that he, Nietzsche, created the world and was in progress of having all anti-Semites shot dead.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{downfall}} of the regime of Saddam Hussein, the relations between the KRG and Turkey have been in flux. Tensions marked a high stage in late February 2008 when Turkey unilaterally <b>took</b> <b>military</b> <b>action</b> against the PKK which at times uses the northern Iraq region as a base for militant activities against Turkey. The incursion, which lasted eight days, could have drawn the armed forces of Kurdistan into a broader regional war. However, relations have been improved since then, and Turkey now has the largest share of foreign investment in Kurdistan.|$|R
50|$|During the Hellenistic era (1st century BC) Celenderis {{was in a}} {{political}} coalition with {{the kingdom of the}} Ptolemys of Egypt, and faced severe difficulties from piracy. This problem persisted until Ancient Rome <b>took</b> <b>military</b> <b>actions</b> against the pirates, and Celenderis enjoyed a second period of wealth as the Romans secured the Mediterranean trade routes. They built a city around the port with villas, palaces, waterworks, and baths. During the Middle Ages, the grandeur persisted as the city was controlled by Byzantium, and in the 11th century the Armenians.|$|R

Additionally, they attempted {{to come to terms with}} Jelačić himself, but he insisted on the recentralization of Habsburg authority as a pre-condition to any talks. By the end of August, the imperial government in Vienna officially ordered the Hungarian government in Pest to end plans for a Hungarian army.
