25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we <b>think</b> <b>can</b> run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked to}} name that year's notable indie films and {{director}}s, famed film critic Roger Ebert stated [...] "First-time director Eddie O’Flaherty was able to work outside the system to make Fighting Tommy Riley, a film that I <b>think</b> <b>can</b> play in any theater or any multiplex. And yet it’s a boxing picture that {{is quite different from}} any formula boxing picture you’ve ever seen. In the final analysis, it’s not even really about boxing." ...|$|E
500|$|In the lyrics, Lo compares {{falling in}} love to being under the {{influence}} of drugs. Regarding the track's composition, she stated that [...] "all of the verses are drug references. It is comparing a high to being in love, which I <b>think</b> <b>can</b> be kind of the same thing". According to Scandipop, the artist is saying in the lyrics that [...] "no – she's not on drugs, it's all that amazing love she's in which is making her so high". Carrie Battan of Pitchfork wrote that Lo insists [...] "she's back on her feet and reaching for the stars—she's not on drugs, she's just in love" [...] in the verse, [...] "I'm up with the kites in a dream so blue / I live in the sky / You come live here, too". The line, [...] "I'm queen of the clouds, make my wish come true" [...] served as the inspiration for the title of the singer's debut album. Both Tim Jonze of The Guardian and Jamieson Cox of Time noted that the track's message contrasted that of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", in which the artist sings about using drugs in order to forget her former boyfriend.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I <b>think</b> <b>can</b> make a lot bigger jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and all you have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E
