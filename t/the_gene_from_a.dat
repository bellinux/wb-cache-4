A groEL mutant of E. coli, transformed with the Klebsiella pneumoniae nif gene cluster, failed to accumulate nitrogenase components [Govezensky et al. (1991) J. Bacteriol., 173, 6339 - 6346]. Transformation with sugE reversed the mutant phenotype. In wild type K. pneumoniae, transformation with sugE accelerated the rate of nitrogenase biogenesis after nif derepression. In E. coli, transformation with sugE enabled bacteriophage T 4 growth in a groEL mutant.

40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Mycobacterium are major {{pathogens}} of man and animals. Tuberculosis causes almost 3 million deaths per year, currently making it {{the leading cause of}} death among bacterial infectious diseases. However, our knowledge of these pathogens is limited. This thesis investigated two questions (i) the role of mycobacterial catalases in isoniazid sensitivity, and (ii) the presence of an acid tolerance response. The mycobacterial M-catalase is thought to play a role in isoniazid sensitivity. Bacterial catalase enzymes are highly conserved at the amino acid level. An experimental strategy to clone the mycobacterial M- catalase gene sought to exploit this feature. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed, based on previously cloned catalase genes, in an attempt to amplify the mycobacterial catalase gene using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Despite repeated attempts, this approach was unsuccessful. An attempt to identify <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mycobacterial library using the catalase gene of Escherichia coli (katE) as a hybridisation probe also failed. Resistance to acidic environmental conditions is important for many mycobacterial species. Evidence was sought for the existence of an adaptive acid tolerance mechanism in the mycobacteria. To identify any genes that showed increased transcription in response to a decrease in extracellular pH, a promoter probe library was constructed with bacterial luciferase as the reporter. A clone (pSGA 197) was identified that showed increased bioluminescence at the adaptive pH. The mycobacterial DNA insert in this clone was sequenced. Examination of the sequence revealed that the insert's putative acid-regulated promoter was located downstream from an open reading frame that coded for a possible sensor-kinase protein...|$|E

Legionella pneumophila, the causative organism of Legionnaires' disease, {{is one of}} a small number of bacterial species that contain a CuZnSOD, residing in the periplasm, in addition to an iron SOD (FeSOD) in their cytoplasm. To investigate CuZnSOD function, we purified the enzyme from wild-type L. pneumophila, obtained amino acid sequence data from isolated peptides, cloned and sequenced <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> L. pneumophila library, and then constructed and characterized a CuZnSOD null mutant. In contrast to the cytoplasmic FeSOD, the CuZnSOD of L. pneumophila is not essential for viability. However, CuZnSOD is critical for survival during the stationary phase of growth. The CuZnSOD null mutant survived 10 (4) - to 10 (6) -fold less than wild-type L. pneumophila. In wild-type L. pneumophila, the specific activity of CuZnSOD increased during the transition from exponential to stationary-phase growth while the FeSOD activity was constant. These data support a role of periplasmic CuZnSOD in survival of L. pneumophila during stationary phase. Since L. pneumophila survives extensive periods of dormancy between growth within hosts. CuZnSOD may contribute to the ability of this bacterium to be a pathogen. In exponential phase, wild-type and CuZnSOD null strains grew with comparable doubling times. In cultured HL- 60 and THP- 1 macrophage-like cell lines and in primary cultures of human monocytes, multiplication of the CuZnSOD null mutant was comparable to that of wild type. This indicated that CuZnSOD is not essential for intracellular growth within macrophages or for killing of macrophages in those systems...|$|E

The process has been well characterized in Escherichia coli, with the identification and characterization of many cell division genes. The ftsZ gene is essential in E. coli as the gene product plays a critical role in the initiation and formation of the septum at the division site. In efforts to understand cell division at the molecular level in N. gonorrhoeae, the ftsZ gene has been identified and preliminary characterization is reported. The gonococcal ftsZ consists of a 1179 bp open reading frame, encoding a 41. 3 kDa protein. Sequence analysis has shown the gonococcal FtsZ to be highly similar to other known FtsZ proteins, with conservation of the GTP binding motif. In vitro transcription/translation shows the gene encodes a protein migrating at 43 kDa. Western blot analysis of gonococcal lysates and commensal Neisseria lysates detected an immunoreactive band using an anti-E. coli FtsZ antisera. Attempts to clone the gonococcal ftsZ gene in an E. coli host indicate that expression of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> putative native promoter is lethal to the cell.

The CHO mutant EM 9 has 10 -fold-higher sensitivity to ethyl methanesulfonate, 1. 8 -fold-higher sensitivity to ionizing radiation, a reduced capacity to rejoin single-strand DNA breaks, and a 10 -fold-elevated level of sister chromatid exchange compared with the CHO parental cells. The complementing human gene was cloned from a cosmid library of a tertiary transformant. Two cosmid clones produced transformants that showed approximately 100 % correction of the repair defect in EM 9 cells, as determined by the kinetics of strand break repair, cell survival, and the level of sister chromatid exchange. A nearly full-length clone obtained from the pcD 2 human cDNA expression library gave approximately 80 % correction of EM 9, as determined by the level of sister chromatid exchange.

40|$|In the brewing industry, {{the rapid}} and {{efficient}} utilisation of fermentable carbohydrates are considered important {{attributes of the}} culture yeast. However, fermentation capabilities vary widely between brewing strains of yeast, {{especially with regard to}} the utilisation of individual sugars. Accordingly, this study was performed to determine the physiological and genetic basis for the differences in fermentation performance by brewing strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae when presented with a composite of carbohydrates typical 1 y present in wort. Additionally, our investigation involved the determination of whether a desirable attribute of one strain is transferable to other strains. A model fermentation system employing a defined medium has been used to study sugar transport and catabolising capabilities. An emphasis has been placed on characterising the kinetics of utilisation of the predominant wort carbohydrate maltose as influenced by the presence of fructose, glucose and sucrose. The first phase of our study involved a survey of twenty eight strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae consisting of brewing, baking, distilling, wine and laboratory strains, with regard to their fermentation kinetics and pattern of sugar utilisation. Stronger correlations were established between shorter duration of fermentation and biomass formation and rates of maltose or monosaccharide removal. Conversely, neither high rates of sucrose hydrolysis nor the early onset of maltose utilisation had a strong influence on overall rates of fermentation. The survey also revealed three patterns of maltose and sucrose utilisation: repressible, constitutive and non-utilisers. Furthermore, sucrose utilisation by brewing strains was seen in two forms: cell-associated and noncell-associated. In order to explain the divergent maltose and sucrose utilisation patterns exhibited by the strains under investigation, the presence and distribution of genes of the MAL loci as well as the SUC 2 gene was determined. Sequences corresponding to the MAL 1 (AGT 1), MAL 2, MAL 3 and MAL 4 locus were detected in the strains studied. Multiple copies of the invertase gene were also detected in the industrial strains using SUC 2 sequence as probe. Strains that exhibit the ability to utilise maltose in the presence of repressing sugar glucose and/or fructose, displayed high to moderate and largely consistent expression of the AGT 1 gene compared to non-constitutive maltose utilisers. The pattern of expression is in agreement with the pattern of maltose removal from the medium by these industrial strains, thereby suggesting that the permease encoded by AGTl plays {{a more active role in}} maltose uptake compared to those encoded by other MALxl genes. The kinetics of AGT 1 expression was, however, seen to be independent of the timing and levels of expression of the transcriptional activators, MAL 33 and MALl 3. The pattern of sucrose utilisation correlated poorly to the kinetics of SUC 2 expression, suggesting that other SUC gene(s) play a greater role in the utilisation of this sugar. To examine the importance of consistent and strong expression of the AGT 1 gene with regards to non-repressible maltose utilisation, we expressed <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> constitutive strain (NCYC 1681) in a laboratory strain (209) displaying a repressible maltose phenotype. The recipient strain was found to constitutively express AGTl and exhibited a two-fold increase in the maximum rates of maltose transport compared to the control (vector only) strain. Moreover, the pattern of maltose depletion was similar to that of the donor strain, whereby maltose was removed simultaneously with glucose in the experimental system used. However, the transformant failed to mirror the complete utilisation of maltose seen for NCYC 1681, instead the maltose taken up was apparently released back into the medium following the depletion of glucose. In assessing the basis for differences in the kinetics of AGTl expression between brewing strains displaying a constitutive (NCYC 1681) or non-constitutive (CBL 1 B) maltose phenotype, the structural gene as well as its promoter region were cloned and sequenced. In addition, a comparison was also made between the MAL 31 permease gene and flanking sequences of both strains. All sequences were compared with those already reported for the laboratory strain S 288 c in the Saccharomyces genome database. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the MAL 31 gene and its upstream regulatory region in both brewing strains showed them to be closely matched to that of the corresponding region of S 288 c. However, we did find that with the exception of a few single base pair changes, only 318 bp of sequence immediately upstream of AGTl was identical between the brewing and laboratory strain. Further upstream, the sequence became different from that of the laboratory strain and there was no corresponding MALl 2 gene identified. Instead an extra non-coding sequence, which runs for at least 1500 bp was detected. Additionally, we suspect that the strong levels of AGTl expression by the constitutive strain was likely to be due to the absence of nucleotide sequence from its promoter, which correspond to the recognition site of the repressor protein encoded by MIG 1. The project is now at the stage of being able to make use of these initial findings to construct strains that have the potential to show optimised fermentation attributes. Thesis (Ph. D.)

50|$|Due to the {{conservative}} nature of <b>the</b> <b>genes,</b> {{it is believed that}} <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> evolved <b>from</b> <b>a</b> common ancestral <b>gene,</b> giving rise to over 40 functionally distinct isoforms. The expression of these isoforms is highly regulated and variable throughout development. The diversity of tropomyosin expression, both in space and in time, provides the potential not only to regulate actin filament function but to create specialised actin filament populations.|$|R
