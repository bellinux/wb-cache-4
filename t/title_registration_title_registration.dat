50|$|In land law, {{a system}} of <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> (Torrens <b>title)</b> is in place, {{allowing}} any person to quickly retrieve (usually through the internet) a summary of ownership and other rights towards any parcel of land. The legal transfer of land is only effectuated when a deed is executed and registered in the Land Registry Bureau (also known as Tabo or Tabu, טאבו). Under the Torrens title system, the Land Registry serves as an absolute guarantee of the title, allowing for a relatively easy and safe negotiation of land transactions. As of 2016, about 4% of the country's land area is still registered under a pre-Torrens, deeds registration system.|$|R

The opening of the register provided for a transformation to arise, changing <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> from a record of land holding into a data resource of significant economic value. As a consequence of processes of commodification, that utilise the new wealth and property found in and on title data, {{it is argued that}} a practical and conceptual transformation has arisen.

The case studies in this thesis will explore the use of data derived from the register, and its integration within associated business models outside of the Registry to create revenue streams and to exploit the new property found in and on data. The thesis will explore and evidence multiple processes of the commodification of data and of risk that change conveyancing and marketing practices. Examples of the commodification of title data will be explored through an analysis of: the publication of 'Price Paid' data, the use of the title register and title data by the real estate sector and the emergence of property title fraud.

For many years, Ghana experienced minimal success in formalizing land {{ownership and}} <b>title</b> <b>registration.</b> However, public confidence and expectations were raised once more in 2008 with the merger of four disparate land agencies into the New Lands Commission (NLC) under the overarching ambit of the Land Administration Project (LAP).

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the temporal}} effects of <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> {{and their relationship}} to race. It traces the move away from the retrospection of pre-registry common law conveyancing and toward the dynamic, future-oriented Torrens <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> system. The Torrens system, developed in early colonial Australia, enabled the production of ‘clean’, fresh titles that were independent of their predecessors. Through a process praised by legal commentators for ‘curing’ titles of their pasts, this system produces indefeasible titles behind its distinctive ‘curtain’ and ‘mirror’, which function similarly to magicians’ smoke and mirrors by blocking particular realities from view. In the case of title registries, those realities are particular histories of and relationships with land, which will not be protected by property law and are thus made precarious. Building on interdisciplinary work which theorises time as a social tool, I argue that Torrens <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> produces a temporal order which enables land market coordination by rendering some relationships with land temporary and making others indefeasible. This ordering of relationships with land in turn has consequences for the human subjects who have those relationships, cutting futures short for some and guaranteeing permanence to others. Engaging with Renisa Mawani and other critical race theorists, I argue that the categories produced by Torrens <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> systems materialise as race...|$|R
40|$|In November 2005, {{as part of}} an omnibus statute {{amending}} 11 different acts, the British Columbia {{government made}} several significant changes to BC 2 ̆ 7 s Land Title Act. The government announced that the changes to the <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> system would 2 ̆ 7 ensure immediate legal certainty of land title for a person acting in good faith, who unknowingly acquired a fee simple interest in the property through a forged transfer, provided the individual did not participate in the fraud 2 ̆ 7. In an effort to assuage fears of those who had acquired interests in a system that, if it needed to be fixed, had been somewhat less than secure, the government 2 ̆ 7 s information bulletin assured the public that BC’s registration system was 2 ̆ 7 already highly regarded 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 considered world-class 2 ̆ 7. The changes then were to be understood as improvements to what was already a good <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> system. Whatever its quality, the <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> system laboured with uncertainty over its central organizing principle. Did <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> in BC operate on the basis of immediate or deferred indefeasibility? The difference between the two principles lies in the security they provide the person who in good faith acquires an interest in land based on a void document such as a forged transfer instrument. Put simply, under immediate indefeasibility the registered owner of a fee simple interest is immune to a challenge that the registered owner acquired the interest {{on the basis of a}} void instrument. Under a deferred system the registered owner of a fee simple interest only holds indefeasible title if he or she is one step away from the fraudulent activity. A person who acquires an interest on the basis of a void instrument remains vulnerable to the claim of the person who has wrongfully deprived of his or her interest. The language in the government’s information bulletin – 2 ̆ 7 immediate legal certainty 2 ̆ 7 – suggests it intended to establish that BC’s <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> system rests on a foundation of immediate indefeasibility. If that were the intent, is that what the November 2005 amendments have done? Is it now unequivocally clear that BC operates on the basis of immediate indefeasibility? And if so, are property interests more secure as a result? This article reviews the previous sources of uncertainty in the Land Title Act, outlines the changes to it, and suggests their effect on those whose property interests are affected by fraudulent activity. It begins with a brief description of the manner in which the common law treated forged instruments purporting to transfer an interest in land and then outlines the nature of, and different approaches to, indefeasible <b>title</b> in <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|Systems of {{land law}} must balance {{competing}} goals of securing title for existing interests in land with facilitating their transfer. <b>Title</b> <b>registration</b> systems operate to facilitate transfers of interests in land. They reflect {{a choice to}} enhance the security of transfers of interests, providing what has been characterized as dynamic security {{at the expense of}} the static security of existing interests. One of the cardinal principles of <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> is the abolition of the doctrine of notice. In equity, if purchasers of a legal interest have notice of a prior equitable interest, then they take their interest subject to that prior interest. To do otherwise is to perpetrate a fraud. Most <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> systems abolish notice; prior unregistered interests do not affect purchasers who register their interests, whether or not they have notice of the prior interest, except, so many <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> statutes provide, in the case of fraud. This article investigates the evolution of provisions purporting to abolish notice in Torrens title jurisdictions, it describes the variety of provisions that emerged, it reviews the longstanding uncertainty in British Columbia over the extent to which the doctrine of notice is abolished, and it considers a number of proposals for reform. It concludes that the uncertainty is a function of an unresolved policy choice between static and dynamic security, and that the British Columbia Court of Appeal or the legislature needs to intervene to clarify that choice...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of security and}} certainty of land tenure cannot be overemphasized. A key justification for {{it is that it}} provides incentives for investment in land and therefore an impetus for sustainable economic development. In the customary land sector in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), land is vested in communities represented by families/clans, tribes and chiefs. These families/clans, tribes and chiefs are commonly referred to as traditional landholding institutions. It is, however, believed that property rights to land emanating from these institutions are insecure and uncertain, implying a disincentive to investment and therefore a barrier to economic development. This belief appears to be premised on the fact that customary ownership of land is not formally recorded or registered. Thus, since the colonial era, governments have been embarking on various land <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> programmes supposedly to guarantee greater security and certainty of customary land tenure for sustainable development. Evidence, however, abounds in the sub region to indicate that: (a) land <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> has done little to guarantee security and certainty of land tenure; and (b) there is no clearly discernible link between land <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> and investment behaviour. These form the basis of the thesis pursued in this paper. The paper argues that increasing security and certainty of land tenure does not necessarily require the <b>registration</b> of land <b>titles</b> and therefore defines the ingredients of secure and certain land rights.

In this study, I have tried to identify some of the shortcomings of the framework within which more equitable access to land to a larger number of Ghanaians is to be provided.

Secondly, such successful implementation is dependent on the prevailing political, economic and social conditions. Thirdly, collaboration between government departments responsible for policy formulation and implementation of <b>title</b> <b>registration</b> is also crucial. With regard to electronic conveyancing, China should appreciate that although it strives to achieve a system of ‘title by registration’ from the existing system of ‘registration of title, it is doubtful whether the English system of electronic conveyancing is compatible with the current stage of Chinese development. However, on the issue of indemnity, China can also learn from the Act by stipulating in its own indemnity provision the detailed circumstances under which indemnity would be payable: for example, a formula for calculating the amount of indemnity; a failure or reduction of claim for indemnity in the event of fraud or lack of care, and the recovery of compensation by the registrar from person(s) who cause or significantly contribute to loss through fraud.

40|$|The {{proposed}} Hong Kong Land <b>Title</b> <b>Registration</b> {{system does}} not include provisions for the variation in boundary location or remedying any discrepancies in the boundary locations of a land parcel.

Of the possible mechanisms it is concluded that an alternative to adverse possession, statutory encroachment, is preferable to part parcel adverse possession.
