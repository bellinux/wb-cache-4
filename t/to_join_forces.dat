5|$|After Storm {{departed}} ECW, Psaltis {{became a}} color commentator on ECW pay-per-views {{and the television}} series ECW on TNN. On December 3, 2000 at the Massacre on 34th Street pay-per-view, {{as part of a}} new angle, she announced that she would become the manager of the winner of the opening match pitting Simon Diamond and Swinger against Christian York and Joey Matthews. Although York and Matthews won the bout, Psaltis opted <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with Diamond and Swinger, whom she managed until ECW declared bankruptcy in April 2001.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his best course of action would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E
5|$|Montfort's {{support was}} now dwindling, and Edward retook Worcester and Gloucester with {{relatively}} little effort. Meanwhile, Montfort {{had made an}} alliance with Llywelyn and started moving east <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with his son Simon. Edward managed to make a surprise attack at Kenilworth Castle, where the younger Montfort was quartered, {{before moving on to}} cut off the earl of Leicester. The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons' War, the Battle of Evesham, on 4August 1265. Montfort stood little chance against the superior royal forces, and after his defeat he was killed and mutilated on the field.|$|E

50|$|The {{intention}} of local governments is thus to promote development by exploring complementarity with partners facing similar problems, {{with a view}} <b>to</b> <b>joining</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> arrive at solutions more easily. In addition, they explore opportunities alongside international organizations that offer assistance programs for local development projects.|$|R
5|$|That {{still left}} two {{separate}} governments {{claiming to be}} Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw, and Dmowski's in Paris. To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces,</b> with Piłsudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and Commander-in-Chief while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the Paris Peace Conference. Articles 87–93 of the Versailles Treaty and the Little Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.|$|E
5|$|Although Pulaski {{frequently}} {{suffered from}} malaria while stationed in Charleston, {{he remained in}} active service. At the beginning of September Lincoln prepared to launch an attempt to retake Savannah with French assistance. Pulaski was ordered to Augusta, where he was <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with General Lachlan McIntosh. Their combined forces were {{to serve as the}} forward elements of Lincoln's army. Pulaski captured a British outpost near Ogeechee River. His units then acted as an advance guard for the allied French units under Admiral Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing. He rendered great services during the siege of Savannah, and in the assault of October 9 commanded the whole cavalry, both French and American.|$|E
5|$|In August 937, Olaf {{crossed the}} Irish Sea with his army <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with Constantine and Owen and in Livingston's opinion this {{suggests}} that the battle of Brunanburh occurred in early October of that year. According to Paul Cavill, the invading armies raided Mercia, from which Æthelstan obtained Saxon troops as he travelled north to meet them. Michael Wood wrote that no source mentions any intrusion into Mercia. John of Worcester wrote that the invaders entered via the Humber but no other chronicler mentioned this. Because of the lack of sources supporting the claim, along with other issues, philologist Paul Cavill argues John's statement is not true. According to Symeon of Durham, Olaf had 615 ships but this number is likely exaggerated.|$|E

His actions as part of this special unit brought him a bar on his Military Cross.|$|R
5|$|The Major Crimes Unit {{learns that}} Stringer has been buying {{real estate and}} {{developing}} it to fulfill his dream of being a successful legitimate businessman. Believing that the bloody turf war with Marlo is poised to destroy everything the Barksdale crew had worked for, Stringer gives Major Colvin information on Avon's weapons stash. Brother Mouzone returns to Baltimore and tracks down Omar <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces.</b> Mouzone tells Avon that his shooting must be avenged. Avon, remembering how Stringer disregarded his order which resulted in Stringer's attempt to have Brother Mouzone killed, furious over D'Angelo's murder to which Stringer had confessed, and fearing Mouzone's ability to harm his reputation outside of Baltimore, informs Mouzone of Stringer's upcoming visit to his construction site. Mouzone and Omar corner him and shoot him to death.|$|E
5|$|The method. The Commando Brigade, {{consisting}} of No.s 3, 4 and 6 Army Commandos and No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando, {{to land on}} the extreme flank of the Allied Forces on Queen beach (Sword) and cut inland <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with two brigades dropped inland by glider and parachute. No. 4 Commando to destroy a battery and the garrison in Ouistreham and then rejoin the Brigade. The rest of the Brigade, landing 30 minutes after No.4, to fight through enemy defences to reach and reinforce Brigades of the 6th Airborne Division, meeting astride the bridges spanning the River Orne and the Caen Canal. Glider Regiments of the Airlanding Brigade would arrive later the same evening descending in country cleared of the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Admiral de Grasse had {{the option}} to attack British forces in either New York or Virginia; he opted for Virginia, {{arriving}} at the Chesapeake {{at the end of}} August. Admiral Graves learned that de Grasse had sailed from the West Indies for North America and that French Admiral de Barras had also sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, and he concluded that they were going <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> at the Chesapeake. He sailed south from New York with 19 ships of the line and arrived {{at the mouth of the}} Chesapeake early on 5 September to see de Grasse's fleet at anchor in the bay. De Grasse hastily prepared most of his fleet for battle—24 ships of the line—and sailed out to meet him, and the two-hour engagement took place after hours of maneuvering. The lines of the two fleets did not completely meet; only the forward and center sections fully engaged. The battle was consequently fairly evenly matched, although the British suffered more casualties and ship damage, and it broke off when the sun set. The British tactics have been a subject of debate ever since.|$|E
50|$|The B3 Field Front Command {{employed}} three regiments in {{the effort}} to conquer the Central Highlands: the 32nd to set up the ambush to destroy the ARVN relief column; the 33rd to put a siege of the Pleime camps; and the 66th <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>force</b> with the 32nd and 33rd to overrun Pleiku city.|$|R

5|$|Between {{the events}} of the first game and Halo 2, the Chief and a few other {{survivors}} return to Earth, warning of an impending Covenant attack; this attack forms the first mission of the game. Meanwhile, the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05, to fulfill their religious prophecy and to do so launch an attack on Earth. Helping the Chief to defend the Earth are Sergeant Avery Johnson and Commander Miranda Keyes. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings and are led by a former Elite commander named the Arbiter (also a player character) <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with humanity to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all the rings for firing from the Ark.|$|E
5|$|For the 2007 presidential {{election}}, Le Pen and Mégret agreed <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces.</b> Le Pen came {{fourth in}} the election with 11% of the vote, and the party won no seats in the legislative election of the same year. The party's 4.3% support was the lowest score since the 1981 election and only one candidate, Marine Le Pen in Pas de Calais, reached the runoff (where she was defeated by the Socialist incumbent). These electoral defeats partly accounted for the party's financial problems. Le Pen announced {{the sale of the}} FN headquarters in Saint-Cloud, Le Paquebot, and of his personal armoured car. Twenty permanent employees of the FN were also dismissed in 2008. In the 2010 regional elections the FN appeared to have re-emerged on the political scene after surprisingly winning almost 12% of the overall vote and 118 seats.|$|E
5|$|In 1070 Sweyn II of Denmark {{arrived to}} take {{personal}} command of his fleet and renounced the earlier agreement to withdraw, sending troops into the Fens <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with English rebels led by Hereward the Wake, {{at that time}} based on the Isle of Ely. Sweyn soon accepted a further payment of Danegeld from William, and returned home. After {{the departure of the}} Danes the Fenland rebels remained at large, protected by the marshes, and early in 1071 there was a final outbreak of rebel activity in the area. Edwin and Morcar again turned against William, and although Edwin was quickly betrayed and killed, Morcar reached Ely, where he and Hereward were joined by exiled rebels who had sailed from Scotland. William arrived with an army and a fleet to finish off this last pocket of resistance. After some costly failures the Normans managed to construct a pontoon to reach the Isle of Ely, defeated the rebels at the bridgehead and stormed the island, marking the effective end of English resistance. Morcar was imprisoned {{for the rest of his}} life; Hereward was pardoned and had his lands returned to him.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the Khmer Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed the Khmer Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the Khmer Rouge leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with other non-communist movements. However, the idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.|$|E
5|$|Montfort's {{success was}} illusory, however. The {{terms of the}} Peace of Canterbury were {{rejected}} by a papal legate in negotiations at Boulogne. Meanwhile, the Marcher lords did not leave the country, and remained a thorn {{in the side of}} the regime. The triumvirate at the head of government broke up when the Earl of Gloucester defected to the royalist side. In May, Edward was able to escape captivity, with Gloucester's help. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches. He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn, and then moved east <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with his son Simon. Edward, however, routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle. On 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham, forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field. Even with Montfort dead resistance remained, particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons, and by the end of the year the garrison surrendered.|$|E
5|$|On the October 27 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H would offer John Cena a chance <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with The Authority, which Cena refused. This led to Triple H announcing a five-on-five tag team {{elimination}} match for Survivor Series, {{with a team}} representing The Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon announced that if Team Authority would lose, they would be removed from power. On the November 21 episode of SmackDown, Triple H announced that if Team Cena lost, all of Team Cena, except Cena himself, would be fired. At Survivor Series, Big Show joined The Authority by betraying Cena, but Sting made his WWE debut, attacking crooked referee Scott Armstrong and Triple H, and assisted Dolph Ziggler in pinning Rollins to give Team Cena the victory, putting the Authority out of power.|$|E

5|$|Reed and Sue {{contemplate}} abandoning {{their lives}} as superheroes {{in order to have}} a normal life and raise a family, but are unaware Johnny is listening. With the Surfer creating craters around the globe, Reed determines that the next will appear in London. The team arrives too late to stop the crater, which drains the River Thames, but they manage to prevent the London Eye from collapsing after it is damaged by the quake (although Johnny nearly thwarts their attempt when he unwillingly switches powers with Reed). Meanwhile, the Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past Latveria, where the cosmic energy affects their ex-friend Victor Von Doom, freeing him from two years encased in metal. A scarred Doom traces the Surfer to the Russell Glacier and offers <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces.</b> When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer retaliates, blasting Doom through the ice, but the cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization. Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a {{dilapidated}} train engine {{in the middle of}} the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis-esque Phenac City in time to see two men dragging a sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing about it. Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} led by Montfort soon {{ran into}} problems. He negotiated a treaty with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales, {{an act that}} made him unpopular with the English Marcher lords. In May Edward escaped captivity, {{with the help of}} Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who had now come over to the royal side. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches.
