5|$|Pietro Boyesen (1819–1882) was a Danish {{photographer}} who {{spent most of}} his professional life in Rome. Boyesen had a talent for composition and characterization. In contrast to the boring studio portraits which were so common at the time, Boyesen would have his subjects pose outdoors in intimate Roman settings. By playing with the subjects clothes and <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surroundings, Boyesen would produce works presenting a somewhat timid but intimate charm.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pride from outside males who attempt to take over their relationship with the pride.|$|E
5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, and <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E

5|$|Season five {{features}} Monica and Chandler {{trying to}} keep their new relationship a secret from their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show's 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy, Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls: Leslie and Chandler. (They had originally thought {{that there were two}} boys and one girl, but decided to keep the name Chandler, despite the baby turning out a girl.) Emily states that the only condition in which she would remain married to Ross is if he stops all communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but during a last dinner with all six main characters together, Emily phones Ross and, upon discovering Rachel is there, realizes she does not trust him, which ends the marriage. Phoebe begins a relationship with a police officer, Gary (Michael Rapaport), after finding his badge and using it as her own. Monica and Chandler go public with <b>their</b> <b>relationship,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surprise and happiness of their friends. They decide to get married on a trip to Las Vegas, but change their plans after witnessing Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumble out of the wedding chapel.|$|E

25|$|In addition, prehistoric {{fossils of}} similar owls have been {{recovered}} from many islands in the Caribbean (Barbuda, Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Mona Island, and Puerto Rico).

The show's costume designer Catherine Ashton announced via Twitter that the third season will reportedly end with some closure and a big cliffhanger.|$|E
25|$|Neutral monists {{adhere to}} the {{position}} that perceived {{things in the world}} can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.|$|E
25|$|This Sufi order openly {{converted}} to the heterodox branch of twelver Shi'a Islam {{by the end}} of the 15th century.

The Safavid rulers claimed to be descended from Ali himself and his wife Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, through the seventh Imam Musa al-Kazim.
