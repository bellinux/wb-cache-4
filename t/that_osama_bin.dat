5|$|On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, {{who was at}} a {{restaurant}} with his wife, to inform him <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden had been killed. The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E

The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls {{and then into the}} house. As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently, in October 2001, U.S. forces (with UK and {{coalition}} allies) invaded Afghanistan {{to oust the}} Taliban regime. On 7 October 2001, the official invasion began with British and U.S. forces conducting airstrike campaigns over enemy targets. Kabul, {{the capital city of}} Afghanistan, fell by mid-November. The remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants fell back to the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, mainly Tora Bora. In December, Coalition forces (the U.S. and its allies) fought within that region. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden escaped into Pakistan during the battle.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the 9/11 Commission noted <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>Bin</b> Laden {{was seen}} being congratulated {{on the day}} of the Khobar attack, and stated there were reports in the months {{preceding}} the attack that Bin Laden was seeking to facilitate a shipment of explosives to Saudi Arabia. According to the United States, classified evidence suggests that the government of Iran was the key sponsor of the incident, and several high-ranking members of their military may have been involved. A U.S. federal court speculated that the Khobar Towers bombing was authorized by Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{pipeline}} was {{to pass through}} Afghanistan, {{it was necessary to}} work with the Taliban. The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, moved into CentGas in 1997. In January 1998, the Taliban, selecting CentGas over Argentinian competitor Bridas Corporation, signed an agreement that allowed the proposed project to proceed. In June 1998, Russian Gazprom relinquished its 10% stake in the project. On 7 August 1998, American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed. The United States alleged <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was behind those attacks, and all pipeline negotiations halted, as the Taliban's then leader, Mullah Omar, announced that bin Laden had the Taliban's support. Unocal withdrew from the consortium on 8 December 1998, and soon after closed its offices in Afghanistan and Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, Livingstone criticised public {{spending}} cuts {{announced by the}} recently elected Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, which he stated amounted to £45 billion a year for London alone, and were [...] "beyond Margaret Thatcher's wildest dreams" [...] as well as threatening to result in widespread division and poverty across the capital. In May 2011, Livingstone said he was [...] "appalled" [...] <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden had been shot dead by US Special forces [...] "in his pyjamas" [...] and [...] "in front of his kid," [...] and that the values of a western democracy would have been best demonstrated if Bin Laden had been put on trial and his words challenged.|$|E
500|$|On February 27, 2007, {{at about}} 10am, {{a suicide bomber}} killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney.

The bomb went off outside the front gate while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away. He reported hearing the blast, saying [...] "I heard a loud boom... The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate." [...] The purpose of Cheney's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban.|$|E
50|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, CCHR promulgated a conspiracy theory assigning responsibility for the attacks to Ayman al-Zawahiri, alleging <b>that,</b> as <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's personal psychiatrist, he was the principal mastermind behind the attacks and had brainwashed bin Laden using pain, drugs and hypnosis.|$|R

500|$|Thomas {{disagreed}} {{strongly with}} the plurality's determination that {{the legality of}} the charges against Hamdan are doubtful because he was charged [...] "not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded ... but with an 'agreement' the inception of which long predated ... the [...] ". He lambasted the plurality for second-guessing the Executive's judgment, arguing that the Court's disagreement was based upon [...] "little more than its unsupported assertions" [...] and constituted [...] "an unprecedented departure from the traditionally limited role of the courts with respect to war and an unwarranted intrusion on executive authority". Thomas further disagreed with the plurality's assumption that the date of the enactment of the AUMF constituted the start of war, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's declaration of jihad in August 1996 could be considered a declaration of war. Under this view, the enactment by Congress of the AUMF did not mark the beginning of the conflict with al Qaeda, but rather authorized the Executive to use force to combat it. Additionally, Thomas wrote that under the common law of war, which is [...] "flexible and evolutionary in nature", war courts are permitted a degree of latitude in their jurisdiction. In holding otherwise, the plurality failed to properly defer to the judgment of the Executive and military commanders.|$|E

2500|$|According to Christopher Hitchens, Moore {{had argued}} in a {{previous}} public debate <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and thus questions the treatment of bin Laden in the film.

Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous 'distraction' from the fight against him. I believe that I understand the convenience of this late conversion." [...] Hitchens was subsequently invited to appear on Joe Scarborough's MSNBC talk show, Scarborough Country, at which point a tape recording of his debate with Moore at the Telluride Film Festival in 2002 was replayed.|$|E
