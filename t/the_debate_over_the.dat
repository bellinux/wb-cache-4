5|$|Leaving the Flames organization, McGrattan {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Anaheim Ducks, and was subsequently assigned to the AHL's San Diego Gulls for the 2015–16 season. During a January 19, 2016, game against the San Antonio Rampage, McGrattan was knocked unconscious {{in a fight with}} Daniel Maggio. The incident, in which he fell face-first to the ice and had to be stretchered off the ice, renewed <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place of fighting in hockey.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E

2500|$|During <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Education Reform bill, Cox worked {{together}} with Michael Alison {{to ensure that}} a commitment was made that state education was 'broadly Christian' in character. [...] The bill later passed as the Education Reform Act 1988.|$|R
5|$|In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said Japan {{wanted to}} shed the passiveness it has {{maintained}} {{since the end}} of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Abe said Japan wanted to play a key role and offered neighboring countries Japan's support. In recent years, they have been engaged in international peacekeeping operations including the UN peacekeeping. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society. New military guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{was unable}} to {{directly}} influence the Johnson administration, which expanded U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He became increasingly wary of what he felt was undue influence by the CIA and big businesses on foreign policy. In 1964 during <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Senator Wayne Morse wanted to call Shoup to testify against the measure, but was blocked by Senator J. William Fulbright. On 14 May 1966, Shoup began publicly attacking the policy in a speech delivered to community college students at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, California, for their World Affairs Day.|$|E
5|$|The CIA Damage Assessment Team (DAT) {{reviewed}} {{the credibility of}} all of the Agency's Soviet agents from the mid-1980s onward, then separated them into three groups: those who Ames admitted to betraying but continued providing intelligence; those whom Ames was suspected of betraying and those whom Ames' spying may have helped the Soviets identify; and the agents whom neither Ames nor Moscow uncovered. The DAT thus deemed intelligence supplied by the first group suspicious, although investigators acknowledged that it may have included genuine material as feed. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> second group's bona fides proved especially contentious, while the information from the third group of agents was considered credible despite some concerns that even they may have been compromised.|$|E
25|$|Woll was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of craft unionism. During <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), Woll portrayed himself as a conciliator and mediator, but worked behind the scenes to undercut Mine Workers president John L. Lewis and other proponents of industrial unionism.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{proposed}} national constitution became moot {{when news}} of Italian troop movements in Tyrol {{and near the}} Venetian border reached Vienna in April 1866. The Austrian government ordered partial mobilization in the southern regions; the Italians responded by ordering full mobilization. Despite calls for rational thought and action, Italy, Prussia, and Austria continued to rush toward armed conflict. On 1 May, Wilhelm gave von Moltke command over the Prussian armed forces, {{and the next day}} he began full-scale mobilization.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{route for}} the {{remainder}} of the Green Line was finally resolved in December 1984. Residents and D.C. government officials asked WMATA to build stations at Congress Heights and Southern Avenue in order to promote economic development and provide service to St. Elizabeths Hospital and Greater Southeast Community Hospital. In December 1984, WMATA's Board of Directors agreed to return the Green Line to its original route, and build the Congress Heights and Southern Avenue stations. The U.S. district court approved WMATA's decision and dissolved its March 1982 injunction, which had barred construction of the $483 million southern Green Line (now estimated to cost $132 million more than the Rosecroft route).|$|E
5|$|The feud between Razor Ramon and I.R.S. ended {{shortly after}} the Royal Rumble. On the January 31, 1994 edition of Monday Night Raw, the 1-2-3 Kid stole Ramon's chains back from I.R.S., {{bringing}} the feud to an end. Shawn Michaels’ attack on Razor Ramon increased the hostility between the two. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> true holder of the Intercontinental Championship was settled at WrestleMania X in a ladder match with both belts suspended above the ring. This ended the feud between Michaels and Ramon, although Ramon continued to feud with Michaels’ friend Diesel.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} {{of the name of}} the autonomous community was initially seen as fairly minor compared to <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> flag and the powers which would be granted to the Generalitat Valenciana. However it became the issue which almost caused the rejection of the Statute of Autonomy by the Congress of Deputies in 1982.|$|R
40|$|An {{examination}} of <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> so-called 'false' memory syndrome. In this paper, I concur that memory is malleable, but interrogate notions {{of truth and}} falsity underlying standards {{used to evaluate the}} accuracy of memories of abuse. Such standards divert us, I suggest, from recognizing the truth behind widespread recollections of abuse at the hands of patriarchy...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> case revived <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{corporate}} personhood. The {{question whether}} corporations {{should be treated}} as persons has been presented to the Supreme Court before. In the 1886 case Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, 118 U.S. 394, the Supreme Court decided that corporations could be regarded as persons {{for the purposes of the}} Fourteenth Amendment.|$|R
5|$|With {{the dispute}} resolved, the {{discovery}} team proposed Eris on September 6, 2006. On September 13, 2006 this name {{was accepted as}} the official name by the IAU. Brown decided that, because the object had been considered a planet for so long, it deserved a name from Greek or Roman mythology, like the other planets. The asteroids had taken {{the vast majority of}} Graeco-Roman names. Eris, whom Brown described as his favorite goddess, had fortunately escaped inclusion. The name in part reflects the discord in the astronomical community caused by <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> object's (and Pluto's) classification.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{proposed}} Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic {{proposal that}} would have allowed individuals to sue their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), favoring instead a more limited bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient's ability to appeal HMO decisions. Many doctors in the Republican legislative caucus felt their party's bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and Tennessee Senator Bill Frist were notable exceptions. Fletcher's position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA). After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler's bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000. However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher's 53 percent. The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Garran {{published}} The Coming Commonwealth, {{an influential}} {{book on the}} history of the Federation movement and <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 1891 draft of the Constitution of Australia. The book was based on material he prepared for a course on federalism and federal systems of government, which he had planned to give at the University of Sydney, but which failed to attract a sufficient number of students. Nevertheless, the book was both unique and popular, as one of the few books on the topic at the time, with the first edition quickly selling out. Soon after its publication the Premier of New South Wales George Reid, who had been elected as a New South Wales delegate to the 1897–1898 Constitutional Convention, invited Garran to be his secretary. At the Convention, Reid appointed him secretary of the Drafting Committee, at Barton's request; he was also a member of the Press Committee.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, {{a number}} of {{philosophers}} and social scientists began to question the very presuppositions that theories of moral character and moral character traits are based on. Due {{to the importance of}} moral character to issues in philosophy, it is unlikely that <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> nature of moral character will disappear anytime soon.|$|R
5000|$|The main work {{detailing}} {{his vision}} of the world is Barnameh-ye Enqelabi-ye Fada'ian-e Eslam (The Revolutionary Programme of Fada'ian-e Eslam), [...] "published in October/November 1950, in <b>the</b> heat of <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> nationalization of the oil industry", where he exposes a paradigm close to that of the utopian socialists like Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier or Robert Owen.|$|R
5000|$|Shays' Rebellion {{directly}} {{influenced the}} United States' Constitutional Convention, with future U.S. President George Washington citing {{it as his}} reason for coming out of retirement. During <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Constitution, in encouraging a stronger Federal government, future U.S. President James Madison cautioned the attendees that [...] "the rebellion in Massachusetts is a warning, gentlemen." ...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the prime}} opponents of Wilson and the League was Senate Majority Leader Henry Cabot Lodge. After McNary {{demonstrated}} his skill in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> League, Lodge took him under his wing, and the two formed a longtime friendship. The friendship helped McNary secure favorable committee assignments and ushered him into the inner power circle of the Senate. Early in his career, he {{served as chairman of}} the Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands Committee, and {{as a member of the}} Agriculture and Forestry Committee. In 1922, President Warren G. Harding asked McNary to be the Secretary of the Interior to replace Albert B. Fall because of Fall's involvement in the ongoing Teapot Dome scandal. McNary declined, preferring to stay in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He {{was caught}} in the middle during <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Arlington Memorial. The initial {{proposal}} to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet {{for the sake of the}} Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The film reignited <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of}} the Terran society in Heinlein's world, and several critics accused Verhoeven of {{creating}} a fascist universe. Others, and Verhoeven himself, have stated that the film {{was intended to be}} ironic, and to critique fascism. The film has also been described as criticizing the jingoism of U.S. foreign policy, the military industrial complex, and the society in the film, which elevates violence over sensitivity. It received several negative critical reviews, reviewers suggesting that it was unsophisticated and targeted a juvenile audience, although some scholars and critics have also supported its description as satirical. The absence of the powered armor technology drew criticism from fans. The success of the film's endeavor to critique the ideology of the novel has been disputed.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{is needed}} to {{determine}} the prevalence of the disorder in those who have never been in therapy, and the prevalence rates across cultures. These central issues relating to the epidemiology of DID remain largely unaddressed despite several decades of research.

25|$|Also, the {{standard}} of plenary sittings of the European Parliament is to stream <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Internet. In addition, the public can observe sittings directly from a separate gallery. Also, nearly all sittings of Parliamentary Committees are observable by the public, except for certain matters such as requests for removal of the parliamentary immunity of a Member of the European Parliament.|$|R
5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb County Courthouse was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee County courthouse were chosen {{as the model for}} the new DeKalb County Courthouse. Though the courthouse was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than the DeKalb County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and the battle over the county seat had begun.|$|E
5|$|Themes from Plato and his {{influence}} on Western political philosophy are also {{prevalent in the}} novel. Mainly, <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> nature of 'Good Society' and how to achieve it are seen in {{the positions of the}} Supreme. He argues that it is the ruler's role, as well as his duty and obligation, to bring about the good society, and this can only be done by the imposition of absolute order from above. The dictator’s job is to bring about the Good Society, to impose the needed order, and the people's job is to obey the dictator, thereby enjoying the fruits of the good society. The result of such behavior by both the ruler and the ruled will be good for everyone.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of the tripoint is unique {{as it was the}} result of inadequate survey equipment used during <b>the</b> 18th century. <b>The</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{location of}} the tripoint and the boundaries between Virginia and Tennessee drew tension and led to the Supreme Court decision of Virginia v. Tennessee, which led to the modern borders and established the 1802 tripoint in 1893.|$|R
25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Washington, DC, smoke-free law, {{city council}} member Carol Schwartz {{proposed}} {{legislation that would}} have enacted either a substantial tax credit for businesses that chose to voluntarily restrict smoking or a quadrupling of the annual business license fee for bars, restaurants and clubs that wished to allow smoking. Additionally, locations allowing smoking would have been required to install specified high-performance ventilation systems.|$|R
5000|$|During <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Indemnity and Oblivion Bill Cary [...] "took {{a strong}} line towards the regicides, {{and argued that}} any member who had sat in the {{high court of justice}} should be {{excluded}} from the house. Regarding individual parliamentarians, he wished to make William Sydenham and John Pyne liable for any penalty short of death, and he opposed the limited punishment proposed for Francis Lascelles." ...|$|R
