5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>my</b> heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

500|$|The sampled {{content on}} Endtroducing..... {{originates}} from various sources, including music of genres ranging from hip hop, jazz, funk, psychedelia, and heavy metal {{as well as}} films and interviews. DJ Shadow layered, programmed, and cut samples into smaller fragments to create new tracks. He opted to sample from more obscure selections, making it a personal rule of his to lean away from using more popular material, saying: [...] "I've always pushed myself to use obscure things, and if I use something obvious, it's usually only <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>my</b> own rules." [...] Samples of more prominent artists such as Björk and Metallica are, however, present throughout the record. Minor vocal contributions were provided by American rappers Lyrics Born and Gift of Gab, both personal friends of DJ Shadow.|$|E
