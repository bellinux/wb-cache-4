6000|$|Never was any {{commander}} more beloved. He governed men {{by their}} reason and their affections; {{they knew that}} he was incapable of caprice or tyranny and they obeyed him with alacrity and joy, because he possessed their confidence as well as their love. [...] "Our Nel," [...] they used to say, [...] "is as brave as a lion and as gentle as a lamb." [...] Severe discipline he detested, though he had been bred in a severe school. He never inflicted corporal punishment if it were possible to avoid it; and when compelled to enforce it, he, who was familiar with wounds and death, suffered like a woman. In his whole life, Nelson was never known to act unkindly towards an officer. If he was asked to prosecute one for ill behaviour, he used to answer, [...] "That there was no occasion for him to ruin a poor devil who was sufficiently his own enemy to ruin himself." [...] But in Nelson there was more than the easiness and humanity of a happy nature: he did not merely abstain from injury; his was an active and watchful benevolence, ever desirous not only <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>justice,</b> but to do good. During the peace he had spoken in parliament upon the abuses respecting prize-money, and had submitted plans to government for more easily manning the navy, and preventing desertion from it, by bettering the condition of the seamen. He proposed that their certificates should be registered, and that every man who had served, with a good character, five years in war, should receive a bounty of two guineas annually after that time, and of four guineas after eight years. [...] "This," [...] he said, [...] "might, at first sight, appear an enormous sum for the state to pay; but the average life of seamen is, from hard service, finished at forty-five. He cannot, therefore, enjoy the annuity many years, and the interest of the money saved by their not deserting would go far to pay the whole expense." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{expected}} that the French would attempt some of the passages between the Bahamas; and Lord Hood, thinking of this, said to Nelson, [...] "I suppose, sir, from {{the length of time}} you were cruising among the Bahama Keys, you must be a good pilot there." [...] He replied, with that constant readiness <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>justice</b> to every man which was so conspicuous in all his conduct through life, that he was well acquainted with them himself, but that in that respect his second lieutenant was far his superior. The French got into Puerto Cabello, on the coast of Venezuela. Nelson was cruising between that port and La Guapra, under French colours, for the purpose of obtaining information; when a king's launch, belonging to the Spaniards, passed near, and being hailed in French, came alongside without suspicion, and answered all questions that were asked concerning the number and force of the enemy's ships. The crew, however, were not a little surprised when they were taken on board and found themselves prisoners. One of the party went by the name of the Count de Deux-Ponts. He was, however, a prince of the German empire, and brother to the heir of the Electorate of Bavaria: his companions were French officers of distinction, and men of science, who had been collecting specimens in the various branches of natural history. Nelson, having entertained them with the best his table could afford, told them they were at liberty to depart with their boat, and all that it contained: he only required them to promise that they would consider themselves as prisoners if the commander-in-chief should refuse to acquiesce in their being thus liberated: a circumstance which was not likely to happen. Tidings soon arrived that the preliminaries of peace had been signed; and the ALBEMARLE returned to England and was paid off. Nelson's first business, after he got to London, even before he went to see his relations, was to attempt to get the wages due to his men for the various ships in which they had served during the war. [...] "The disgust of seamen to the navy," [...] he said, [...] "was all owing to the infernal plan of turning them over from ship to ship; so that men could not be attached to their officers, nor the officers care the least about the men." [...] Yet he himself was so beloved by his men that his whole ship's company offered, if he could get a ship, to enter for her immediately. He was now, for the first time, presented at court. After going through this ceremony, he dined with his friend Davison at Lincoln's Inn. As soon as he entered the chambers, he threw off what he called his iron-bound coat; and, putting himself at ease in a dressing gown, passed the remainder of the day in talking over all that had befallen them since they parted on the shore of the River St. Lawrence.|$|E

The criminal justice system in India is essentially an instrument of social control; society considers some behaviors so dangerous. The object of the criminal <b>justice</b> system is <b>to</b> <b>render</b> public <b>justice,</b> <b>to</b> punish the criminal and to see that the trail is concluded expeditiously before the memory of the witness fades out. But unfortunately, over the period of the time its shine is diminishing because of defective criminal justice system. Therefore, we are in a critical juncture of time, there is need to reformulate the justice system to address the challenges of the present day. The police system in any country has to play a very significant role in crime investigation and prevention. This initiative by the police is useful for getting the crime date and information but it does not serve the purpose of designing an action to prevent the crime. It has become a major challenge for the police system to deter and prevent crimes and movements of criminals. There is no information of any kind that is available before the occurrence of criminal acts. This results in increase in crime rate and delay in <b>rendering</b> <b>justice.</b> This paper highlights modernization of police station in various aspects like, analysis of the committees set up by the government, use of location aware application technology to keep watch on the movements of criminals, clearance in investigation process and etc., which can be useful in prevention of crimes, non delay in <b>rendering</b> <b>justice</b> and thereby bring down the crime rate...|$|R

Drawing on the social theory and sociology of Pierre Bourdieu and on Lipsky's work on street-level bureaucracy, we argue that criminal justice social workers (as street-level bureaucrats) face both 'vertical' and 'horizontal' pressures in seeking to establish and fulfil their professional identities in this field. Moreover, these pressures are often counter-veiling, serving <b>to</b> <b>render</b> criminal <b>justice</b> social workers perennially insecure and marginal in their influence on sentencing. The vertical pressures relate to changes in the penal field which serve to create political and policy imperatives that are, to some extent, at odds with the social workers' habitus. The horizontal pressures relate to the lack of capital (symbolic, cultural and social) which social workers suffer in this field. That said, we also draw on the study's findings to argue both that there are ways of managing these pressures and that the pressures themselves will be reconfigured, offering social workers new opportunities and threats...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "castle folk", that is peasants {{living in}} a village of a castle district, {{provided}} with food, wine, weapons or other goods the comes of the castle and his retinue.

Counts were also responsible for collecting taxes, tolls and customs. They only forwarded {{two thirds of the}} income deriving from these levies to the king, the income's remaining part was due to them. The grant of castle lands to individuals began to erodate the economic functions of castle districts already in the 12th century. King Andrew II (1205 - 1235) was the first monarch to distribute large parcels among his followers, which [...] "undermined the social and military organisation upon which the prestige of the counts" [...] rested (Pál Engel). [...] Royal monopoly of holding castles was abolished under King Béla IV (1235 - 1270). Hundreds of new castles were built in this period by noblemen. [...] "The ispáns of counties shall not render judicial sentences concerning the estates of the servientes except in cases pertaining to coinage and tithes." [...] Golden Bull of 1222 Counts were also entitled <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>justice</b> in their districts. Heads of a county had jurisdiction over all the inhabitants of that county, but otherwise the counts' jurisdiction only covered the commoners who lived in the estates attached to the castle. Each comes appointed his own judicial deputy to assist him. However, more and more landowners received immunity from the jurisdiction of the comes from the monarchs. Furthermore, a rebellion of the so-called [...] "royal servants" [...] (in fact landowners directly subjected to the sovereign) forced King Andrew II to issue a charter known as the Golden Bull of 1222 which exempted them of the jurisdiction of the ispáns. The development of towns set further limits to the counts' authority, since at least 20 settlements received the right to self-government under King Béla IV (1235 - 1270). Counties were developing from an institute of royal administration into a body of self-government of the local noblemen {{in the course of the}} 13th century, but the ispán, [...] "a royal appointee" [...] (Erik Fügedi) remained their heads. Accordingly, the ispáns supervised the activities of the judges elected by the community of local noblemen with the task to [...] "revise existing property rights" [...] (Pál Engel) in many counties in Transdanubia in 1267. The existence of the institution of elected [...] "judges of the nobles" [...] is documented in more and more counties from the 1280s.
