5|$|As Beckett's ship, the Endeavour, {{approaches}} {{to destroy the}} Pearl, the Dutchman rises, now captained by Will, and the crew free of Jones' curse. Together, the two pirate ships destroy the Endeavour, with a stunned Beckett going down with the ship while his navy retreats, demoralized {{by the loss of}} both the Endeavour and their commander in Beckett. With Will now forever bound to escort souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the beach of an abandoned island. Will departs on the Dutchman, leaving Elizabeth pregnant and with the chest containing his heart.|$|E
5|$|Major urinary {{proteins}} (Mups), {{also known}} as α2u-globulins, are a subfamily of proteins found in abundance in the urine and other secretions of many animals. Mups provide a small range of identifying information about the donor animal, when detected by the vomeronasal organ of the receiving animal. They belong to a larger family of proteins known as lipocalins. Mups are encoded by a cluster of genes, located adjacent <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> a single stretch of DNA, that varies greatly in number between species: from at least 21 functional genes in mice to none in humans. Mup proteins form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a ligand-binding pocket that accommodates specific small, organic chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{specimens}} of Pinacosaurus {{of different ages}} found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness, while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative {{to the rest of}} the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical halfrings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>On</b> the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim; gradually the ossification extended towards the middle regions. On the rest of the body, the ossification process progressed from the neck onwards in the direction of the tail. Young ankylosaurs are commonly found together but adults are found separate, suggesting they were solitary.|$|E

5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of shoes were observed lying next <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E

25|$|The dimer method {{can be used}} to find {{possible}} transition {{states without}} knowledge of the final structure or to refine a good guess of a transition structure. The “dimer” is formed by two images very close <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the PES.

25|$|Birefringence {{and other}} polarization-based optical effects (such as optical {{rotation}} and linear or circular dichroism) {{can be measured}} by measuring {{the changes in the}} polarization of light passing through the material. These measurements are known as polarimetry. Polarized light microscopes, which contain two polarizers that are at 90° <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> either side of the sample, are used to visualize birefringence. The addition of quarter-wave plates permit examination of circularly polarized light. Birefringence measurements have been made with phase-modulated systems for examining the transient flow behavior of fluids.|$|E

25|$|On July 19, 2010, Ellerbe {{denied that}} {{negotiations}} ever took place {{and nothing was}} ever agreed on.

25|$|Sometimes, the {{problems}} with pushers and helpers arose not from the hardware but the politics and the economics. In the 1880s, the BR and the Erie shared locomotive facilities at Clarion Junction. They had an agreement that each company would provide helper service <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the basis of whose engine was first up at the enginehouse when a train came along needing a push. After some years of this, the BR management realized that their engines were {{doing most of the}} work. The Erie crews had acquired the knack of finding something wrong with their engines, keeping them conveniently immobilized {{when it was time for}} work. The agreement ended.|$|E
25|$|Historically Norwegians {{considered}} {{what they}} called Lussinatten the longest night {{of the year and}} no work was to be done. From that night until Christmas, spirits, gnomes and trolls roamed the earth. Lussi, a feared enchantress, punished anyone who dared work. Legend also has it that farm animals talked <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> Lussinatten, and that they were given additional feed on this longest night of the year. The Lussinatt, the night of 13 December, was largely forgotten in Norway {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, though still remembered as an ominous night, and also celebrated in some areas, especially in Mid, Central and Eastern inland.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 Hadlee helped New Zealand to a 1–0 series win in England, {{their first}} over that country in England. Hadlee's {{outstanding}} personal {{performance in the}} second test at Nottingham (his county 'home') where he took 10 wickets and scored 68 in New Zealand's first innings powered his team to victory. In this test Hadlee, often a controversial character, added to this side of his reputation when he felled (and hospitalised) England wicketkeeper and Nottinghampshire teammate Bruce French with a nasty bouncer. During the New Zealand v West Indies test at Christchurch in March 1987, Hadlee and captain Jeremy Coney had a disagreement {{in the dressing room}} prior to the game. It progressed to not talking <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> the field, communicating through John Wright at mid-on.|$|E
25|$|A {{log cabin}} fire-build {{likewise}} {{begins with a}} tinder pile. The kindling is then stacked around it, as {{in the construction of}} a log cabin. The first two kindling sticks are laid parallel <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>on</b> opposite sides of the tinder pile. The second pair is laid on top of the first, at right angles to it, and also {{on opposite sides of the}} tinder. More kindling is added in the same manner. The smallest kindling is placed over the top of the assembly. Of all the fire-builds, the log cabin is the least vulnerable to premature collapse, but it is also inefficient, because it makes the worst use of convection to ignite progressively larger pieces of fuel. However, these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Lombard {{contingent}} had left Nicomedia, a separate force under William II of Nevers arrived at Constantinople. He had crossed into Byzantine territory over the Adriatic Sea from Bari, and the march to Constantinople {{was free of}} incident, an unusual occurrence for a crusade army. He quickly marched out to meet the others, but in fact never caught up with them, although the two armies must have been close <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> numerous occasions. William briefly besieged Iconium (Konya) but could not take it, and he was soon ambushed at Heraclea Cybistra by Kilij Arslan, who had just defeated the Lombards at Mersivan and was eager to stamp out these new armies as soon as possible. At Heraclea almost the entire contingent from Nevers was wiped out, except for the count himself {{and a few of}} his men.|$|E
