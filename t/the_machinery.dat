5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among <b>the</b> <b>machinery</b> and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of <b>the</b> <b>machinery</b> by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{assess the}} effects of MAR and Jacob’s type {{agglomeration}} economies on a sample of firms in <b>the</b> <b>machineries</b> and textiles industries in Greece for the periods 1989 - 91 and 1999 - 01. The analysis employs a stochastic production frontier function and allows agglomeration economies to enter as inputs and/or as factors reducing inefficiency. Results re-confirm that {{the effects of}} agglomeration economies are industry specific. In our study, <b>the</b> <b>machineries</b> industry benefits from MAR type agglomeration economies and the textiles industry benefits from Jacob’s type agglomeration economies. Agglomeration economies may exercise a twin effect on firms’ productive efficiency. First, {{as in the case of}} <b>the</b> <b>machineries</b> industry in our study, MAR agglomeration economies may act as a new input and affect the kernel of the production frontier. Second, agglomeration economies may act as a factor reducing technical inefficiency with non-neutral effects with labour and capital as in the case of both <b>the</b> <b>machineries</b> and <b>the</b> textiles industries in our study. Finally, it is indicated that agglomeration economies establish a type of â€œpath dependenceâ€ for firms. Firms that make significant use of agglomeration economies survive to the next period at higher percentages in comparison to other firms in the same industry. At the same time, entrants are favoured by MAR type agglomeration economies while incumbents are favoured by Jacob’s type agglomeration economies. ...|$|R

5|$|Advances in {{military}} architecture {{over the previous}} century had led to the construction or enhancement of fortresses that could withstand the pounding of cannonballs and mortar shells. For both Gebhard and Ernst, winning the war required mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless array of enemy artillery fortresses. These could be protected with relatively small garrisons, but taking them required both expensive artillery and enough men to storm the battlements. Furthermore, the victor had to maintain and defend all his possessions as they were acquired. Even the ruin of the Godesburg required a garrison and a defensive strategy; as a strategic point on the north-south road from Bonn to Koblenz, it came under siege in 1586 and again in 1588. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt, was not a war of assembled armies facing each other on a field, but a war of artillery sieges. It required men who could operate <b>the</b> <b>machinery</b> of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep <b>the</b> <b>machinery</b> of war operating.|$|E
