5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)â€”an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.|$|E

50|$|Siddons' head is very thinly {{painted with}} a {{delicate}} and fine brush while <b>the</b> <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face is {{kept to a}} fine, thin layer. In fact, Reynolds feared that by over-glazing, he would ruin the final outcome.|$|R
25|$|There are {{variations}} on {{the color of the}} cloak, and in which objects Santa Muerte holds in her hands. Interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> robe and accoutrements also vary. Images of Santa Muerte range from mass-produced articles sold in shops throughout Mexico and the U.S. to handcrafted effigies, to tattoos. Sizes vary immensely from icons held in one hand to those requiring a pickup truck to transport them.|$|E
500|$|News {{accounts}} elaborated on her beauty, {{describing her}} as [...] "lovely in disposition, so graceful in manners and so intelligent in features, {{that she was}} a favorite of all who knew her", and that her hair [...] "was of extraordinary length and beauty, measuring a yard and a quarter". [...] One of the only contemporary accounts by someone who actually saw her was that of James Wilkinson, who described her as [...] "a country girl of honest family in circumstances of mediocrity, without either beauty or accomplishments." [...] Later accounts embellished details; historian Richard Ketchum notes that <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair has been described as everything from black to blonde to red; he also cites an 1840s examination of an alleged lock of her hair that described it as [...] "reddish".|$|E
500|$|When Barbie {{first came}} out, {{she was the}} subject of a lot of criticism, some of which that claimed Barbie was too mature-looking for children. Midge was the first same-size friend of Barbie ever sold, and was created to oppose these controversies aimed at Barbie. She had a fuller, gentler face mold that was less sexually intimidating, {{although}} her body proportions were the same as Barbie and they both stood at [...] tall. [...] This allowed the two dolls to be able to share clothes and accessories. Her head mold was stamped [...] "1958", the same as Barbie. When Midge arrived, the markings on the straight leg body mold they shared changed to include both her and Barbie. [...] Midge had shoulder-length hair that flipped at the ends. Buyers had an option of buying a doll with one of three different hair colors: red, blond, or brunette. Her face was usually brushed with freckles. The dolls that were sold without freckles had a longer hair style and are now hard to find. [...] Depending on the doll's hair color, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two-piece swimming suit varied. If Midge had red hair her swimsuit was yellow and orange, for blond hair it was in two shades of blue, and if she was brunette it was pink and red. [...] The first vintage Midge dolls had a value of $175 MIB (Mint In Box) in 2007.|$|E

60|$|The three {{partners}} turned quite <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair; Jackson Wells alone remained {{white and}} rigid. She came on, her very short upper lip showing her white teeth with her panting breath.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{hair was}} lost in the profusion of powder with which it was covered; but a slight curling of the {{extremities}} in some degree relieved the formality of its arrangement, and gave a look of feminine softness to the features.|$|E
60|$|Though Faith {{spoke with}} vexation, she also spoke with feeling. Her dark eye swam in tears, and <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brown cheek deepened, until her {{companion}} saw new reasons to forget his discontent in sympathies, which, however obtuse they might be, were never entirely dormant.|$|E
5000|$|B'Elanna Torres is {{sometimes}} seen wearing an overcoat over her normal uniform which matches <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> normal uniform, {{but has a}} pocket on the right breast for carrying small tools.

60|$|As {{again the}} raft righted and drifted on, Dorothy and Ojo {{laughed at the}} ducking they had received; but Scraps was much dismayed and the Scarecrow took out his {{handkerchief}} and wiped the water off the Patchwork Girl's patches {{as well as he}} was able to. The sun soon dried <b>her</b> and <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> patches proved good, for they did not run together nor did they fade.|$|R
60|$|He {{gave his}} number and street, and she thanked {{him with the}} benevolence that availed so much with the lower classes. He went away thrilling and tingling, with that girl's tones in his ear, her motions in his nerves, and <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face filling his sight, which he printed on the air {{whenever}} he turned, as one does with a vivid light after looking at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "'This {{is rather}} unusual stuff {{for a woman}} to be reading. Some {{literary}} lady doubtless. Better look her up, Warburton. You'll know her by <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stockings when she comes down to lunch,' said a jolly old gentlenoan, in a tone that made me 'rouge high,' as Evelina says.|$|E
6000|$|We {{took our}} {{departure}} at once. Mrs. Eyrecourt (leaving some of <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose among the flowers) patted me encouragingly with her fan, {{and told the}} doctor that he was forgiven, on the understanding that he would [...] "never do it again." [...] In five minutes more we were in Dr. Wybrow's study.|$|E
60|$|I {{decided to}} take Milly into my confidence, and finally on the {{strength}} of that I got to sleep. In the morning I went to my hotel, had breakfast, attended to my mail, and then boarded a car to go out to Milly's house. She was waiting for me on the porch, dressed as I liked to see her, in blue and white, and she wore violets that matched <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E

After winning her next start in restricted allowance company at Belmont Park on May 8, she was laid up until November, winning another restricted allowance at Aqueduct by 8 3/4 lengths.|$|R
2500|$|The Darnley Portrait {{features}} a crown and sceptre {{on a table}} beside the queen, {{and was the first}} appearance of these symbols of sovereignty separately used as props (rather than worn and carried) in Tudor portraiture, a theme that would be expanded in later portraits. [...] Recent conservation work has revealed that Elizabeth's now-iconic pale complexion in this portrait is the result of deterioration of red lake pigments, which has also altered <b>the</b> <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was not}} at Jane, Anne gazed {{that day}} in dismay and surprise. It was at Ruby Gillis, who sat beside her in the choir. What had {{happened}} to Ruby? She was even handsomer than ever; but her blue eyes were too bright and lustrous, and <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheeks was hectically brilliant; besides, she was very thin; the hands that held her hymn-book were almost transparent in their delicacy.|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned back}} in her seat and laughed. He sat and watched her. Distinctly she was, in certain ways, the most {{beautiful}} woman he had ever seen. It was true that she was pale and that her neck was a trifle thin, but her face was so aristocratic and yet so piquant, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes so delightful, her mouth so soft and yet so humorous. She laid her hand upon his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Miss Goff, with a {{confused}} impression that red hair was aristocratic, and dark brown (<b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own) vulgar. She {{had risen to}} shake hands, and now, after hesitating a moment to consider what etiquette required her to do next, resumed her seat. Miss Carew sat down too, and gazed thoughtfully at her visitor, who held herself rigidly erect, and, striving to mask her nervousness, unintentionally looked disdainful.|$|E
50|$|Lagerfeld's {{apartment}} in Paris {{was published in}} the French issue of Architectural Digest in May 2012. He also revealed his vast collection of Suzanne Belperron's pins and brooches and used <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blue chalcedony rings as the starting point for the Chanel spring/summer 2012 collection.|$|R
60|$|Mistress Endicott was <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> wax, <b>her</b> {{husband was}} {{gripping}} her wrist with {{a clutch of}} steel, trying, through the administration of physical pain, to keep alive <b>her</b> presence <b>of</b> mind.|$|R

6000|$|The Lady: [...] "No, {{but that}} would have been just the thing. It {{suggests}} <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair; it would go with her. Well, I will have the smilax too, though I don't like it. I don't see why all the flowers should take to being so inexpressive. Send all the smilax you judge best. It's quite a long table, nine or ten feet, and I want the vine going pretty much all about it." ...|$|E
60|$|Jacopo {{was again}} in the attic of the Doge's palace, {{accompanied}} by the gentle Gelsomina. As they threaded the windings of the building, he recounted to the eager ear of his companion all the details connected with the escape of the lovers; omitting, {{as a matter of}} prudence, the attempt of Giacomo Gradenigo on the life of Don Camillo. The unpractised and single-hearted girl heard him in breathless attention, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheek and the changeful eye betraying the force of her sympathies at each turn in their hazardous adventure.|$|E
6000|$|A {{young lady}} was entering, dressed in plain silk, {{and the color}} of it was a pale blue! Excepting a white rose at her breast, she wore no {{ornament}} of any sort. Doubly distinguished by the perfect simplicity of her apparel, and by her tall, supple, commanding figure, she took rank at once as the most remarkable woman in the room. Moving nearer to her through the crowd, under the guidance of the complaisant Major, young Linwood gained a clearer view of her hair, her complexion, and <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes. In every one of these particulars she was the living image of the woman described by Doctor Lagarde! ...|$|E
50|$|Diosa {{is known}} for making {{promises}} of getting naked if her country's national football team wins a football tournament, just like Larissa Riquelme does; the two have gotten naked in public several times already. Also, like Riquelme, she became an internet phenomenon: first, when she got naked in front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> twitcam and was watched by more than 30,000 people in less than 12 minutes and became a trending topic until she got censored by Twitter, and later when she appeared dressed in short clothes with <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> national football team. She has worked also as a calendar model.|$|R
5000|$|For {{this song}} the law court show [...] "Richterin Barbara Salesch" [...] (Judge Barbara Salesch) was shown, where the plaintiff, Regina Zindler, accused her {{neighbour}} because a snowberry bush (Knallerbsenstrauch) was growing into her chain-link fence (Maschendrahtzaun), hence damaging it. The 51-year-old Zindler {{spoke with a}} strong Vogtlander accent, {{and tried to make}} her speech more credible by using legalese to accentuate important passages; however, <b>the</b> <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dialect and her insistence to always specifically describe her fence as a wiremesh fence and the neighbours bush as a common snowberry bush added to the hilarity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand {{away from}} that horse!" [...] she said, her whole face taking <b>the</b> grayish <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips, but her black eyes growing smaller and brighter. [...] "Hand me those reins, and let me pass! What canaille are you to stop me?" ...|$|R
