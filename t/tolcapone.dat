25|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> {{inhibits}} the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging {{the therapeutic}} effects of levodopa. It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, {{have been used}} to complement levodopa. However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it is limited in its availability. A similar drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time. Entacapone is available for treatment alone (COMTan) or combined with carbidopa and levodopa (Stalevo).|$|E
25|$|In healthy adults, longterm visual {{episodic memory}} can be {{enhanced}} specifically through administration of the Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor Donepezil, whereas verbal episodic memory can be improved in persons with the val/val genotype of the val158met polymorphism through administration of the CNS penetrant specific catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitor <b>Tolcapone.</b> Furthermore, episodic memory is enhanced through AZD3480, a selective agonist at the neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor, which is developed by the company Targacept. Currently, {{there are several other}} products developed by several companies—including new catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitors with fewer side effects—that aim for improving episodic memory. A recent placebo controlled study found that DHEA, which is a functional cortisol antagonist, improves episodic memory in healthy young men (Alhaj et al. 2006).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> was {{introduced}} into European market in August 1997 and subsequently into the United States market in March 1998. Liver toxicity {{was reported in}} four people who were administered <b>tolcapone,</b> three people died due to complications. Consequentially, the marketing authorization of <b>tolcapone</b> was suspended from December, 1998 until August, 2004 when it was lifted. In November 1998, the company that manufactured <b>tolcapone</b> voluntarily [...] removed the drug from the market. The authorization was then renewed in August 2009.|$|E
50|$|Combining <b>tolcapone</b> with non-selective {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors such as {{phenelzine}} or tranylcypromine is contraindicated. <b>Tolcapone</b> is also contraindicated {{for people with}} liver diseases or increased liver enzymes.|$|E
50|$|COMT inhibitors include <b>tolcapone,</b> {{entacapone}} and opicapone, {{which are}} used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Risk of liver toxicity and related digestive disorders restricts the use of <b>tolcapone.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of {{reported}} complications, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning for <b>tolcapone</b> and label revisions that aimed to regulate the monitoring of those prescribed <b>tolcapone</b> for Parkinson's disease in November 1998. A number of other countries withdrew <b>tolcapone</b> from the market; Australia in February 1999, Bulgaria in April 1999, Iceland in November 1998, Lithuania in December 1998.|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} of the binding affinity of <b>tolcapone,</b> represented by the inhibition constant Ki (2.5 nM), {{can be thought of}} as the dissociation constant for enzyme and inhibitor complex kinetics. Maximum catalytic activity denotes the efficacy of <b>tolcapone</b> (Vmax = 58.4 pmol/min·mg).|$|E

5000|$|... 99% of <b>tolcapone</b> is in monoanionic form in {{the body}} because the {{physiological}} pH is 7.4. <b>Tolcapone</b> penetrates the blood-brain barrier much better than two other nitrocatechols, nitecapone and entacapone, because it has higher lipophilicity due to its R-substituent. Partition coefficients quantify {{the ability of the}} molecule to cross the blood-brain barrier. LogPIdce= 0.2, -1.4, -0.4 for <b>tolcapone,</b> nitecapone and entacopone respectively. Partition coefficients in this case were measured in 1,2-dichloroethane/H2O solution which caused molecules to be in ionized form. There is no current explanation for how these charged molecules permeate the blood-brain barrier.|$|E
50|$|Digestive {{symptoms}} include nausea and diarrhea; further dopaminergic side effects include orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, sweating and dizziness. <b>Tolcapone</b> causes more severe diarrhea than entacapone; {{this was the}} most common reason for therapy termination in studies. Urine discoloration comes from yellow <b>tolcapone</b> metabolites being excreted in the urine and is harmless.|$|E
50|$|Other {{side effects}} regard the {{increase}} in dopaminergic activity, including digestive symptoms. Treatment with <b>tolcapone</b> {{runs the risk of}} eliciting or prolonging dyskinesia; this can be counteracted by decreasing the dose of levodopa. This occurs because the administration of <b>tolcapone</b> results in the accumulation of the biological methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in the striatum that induces Parkinson symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Pharmaceutical {{examples}} include entacapone, tolcapone,opicapone and nitecapone. <b>Tolcapone</b> also acts inside the CNS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> {{selectively}} and reversibly binds to the {{catalytic site}} of COMT {{in both the}} periphery and {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) with greater affinity than any of the three catecholamines, including levodopa. It thereby prevents the 3-O-methylation of levodopa by COMT in the periphery, which produces 3-O-methyldopa, a major metabolite that competes with levodopa to cross the blood-brain barrier. More of the levodopa that is administered reaches the CNS. Additionally, levodopa that has already reached the CNS, after being converted to dopamine, will not be degraded as quickly when <b>tolcapone</b> inhibits COMT activity. Thus, <b>tolcapone</b> improves the bioavailability and reduces the clearance of levodopa and subsequently dopamine from the CNS.|$|E

50|$|Without {{administration}} of <b>tolcapone,</b> the beneficial effects of levodopa tend to wear off more quickly, resulting in motor fluctuations.|$|E
5000|$|Catechol O-methyl {{transferase}} (COMT) inhibitors such as entacapone and <b>tolcapone,</b> {{which are}} used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> has {{demonstrated}} significant liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity) that limits the drug's utility. Entacapone is an alternative, largely {{since it has}} a more favorable toxicity profile.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> — used in {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease who are not appropriate candidates for other adjunctive therapies. Use is restricted due to high chances of hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|As with entacapone, no {{relevant}} liver toxicity {{has been}} found in studies. This is in contrast to the first COMT inhibitor <b>tolcapone,</b> which could cause - in some cases lethal - liver insufficiency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa or levodopa/benserazide medications. Levodopa is a prodrug for dopamine, which reduces Parkinson symptoms; carbidopa and benserazide are aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|NMS and {{associated}} rhabdomyolysis have been rarely observed under the older COMT inhibitors <b>tolcapone</b> and entacapone. This typically occurs {{shortly after the}} beginning of a COMT inhibitor add-on therapy when the levodopa dose has been reduced, or after discontinuation of a COMT inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with entacapone, another nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor, <b>tolcapone</b> has a longer half life (2.9 hours vs. 0.8 hours) and can better penetrate the blood-brain barrier, acting {{both in the}} central nervous system and in the periphery. However, entacapone is less toxic for the liver.|$|E
50|$|People taking opicapone very {{commonly}} (18%) experience dyskinesia. Other {{common side}} effects (in 1 to 10% of patients) include dizziness, strange dreams, hallucinations, constipation, dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure), and muscle spasms. Apart from spasms, these side effects are also known from <b>tolcapone</b> and entacapone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> (brand name Tasmar) {{is a drug}} used {{to treat}} Parkinson's disease (PD). It is a selective, potent and {{reversible}} nitrocatechol-type inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). It has demonstrated significant liver toxicity, {{which has led to}} suspension of marketing authorisations in a number of countries.|$|E
50|$|Catecholamines cause general {{physiological}} {{changes that}} prepare {{the body for}} physical activity (fight-or-flight response). Some typical effects are increases in heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and a general reaction of the sympathetic nervous system. Some drugs, like <b>tolcapone</b> (a central COMT-inhibitor), raise the levels of all the catecholamines.|$|E
50|$|The {{half-life}} of <b>tolcapone</b> is two {{to three}} hours, the volume of distribution (Vd) being 0.3 L/kg (21 L in an average 70 kg person). 60% of the metabolites are excreted via the urine and 40% via the feces. Only 0.5% of the drug are excreted in unchanged form via the urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} COMT, an enzyme which degrades dopamine. It {{has been used}} to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible complications such as liver damage. A similarly effective drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function. Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.|$|E
50|$|As yet, {{there is}} no cure {{available}} for HPPD. A study presented by Dr. Henry Abraham, at the Annual Meeting of the Biological Psychiatry Society in 2012, showed that two drugs, <b>tolcapone</b> and levocarb that are primarily used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease improved the symptoms of HPPD in one third of the 20 test subjects who had participated in the trial. As <b>tolcapone,</b> and levocarb, are not approved for use in HPPD, the principal treatments that are available seek to reduce distress without treating the underlying cause. Primarily benzodiazepines including clonazepam, diazepam and alprazolam are prescribed with a fair amount of success. The anticonvulsant drug levetiracetam has been reported to diminish some of the visual symptoms, as well as reduce depersonalization and derealization symptoms, that can occur along with HPPD. The efficacy of levetiracetam in treating HPPD has been documented in a prospective study. Another anticonvulsant, lamotrigine, has also been used to successfully treat HPPD.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> is an {{intensely}} yellow, odorless, bitter tasting, non-hygroscopic, crystalline compound with a {{relative molecular mass}} of 273.25 g/mol. It melts at 143 to 146 C, is practically insoluble in water and acids but soluble in 0.1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The pKa values are 4.5 and 10.6 for the two phenyl groups; and the maximum absorption is at 268 nm (in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid / ethanol). Its chemical name is 3,4-dihydroxy-4'-methyl-5-nitrobenzophenone.|$|E
50|$|A {{synthesis}} of <b>tolcapone</b> proposed in 2008 {{begins with a}} Grignard reaction between a benzaldehyde derivative and p-tolyl magnesium bromide. The alcohol thus produced is then converted to a ketone using sodium t-butoxide. The benzyl protecting group is removed by palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation {{in the presence of}} ammonium formate. A nitro group is introduced at the 5-position adjacent to the hydroxyl group unmasked in the cleavage of the benzyl ether. The synthesis ends with cleavage of the methoxy group using aluminum chloride to yield the product alcohol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> {{inhibits}} the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging {{the therapeutic}} effects of levodopa. It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, {{have been used}} to complement levodopa. However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it is limited in its availability. A similar drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time. Entacapone is available for treatment alone (COMTan) or combined with carbidopa and levodopa (Stalevo).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tolcapone</b> {{is quickly}} absorbed from the gut to about 85%. It has an {{absolute}} bioavailability of 65%, {{which is only}} slightly decreased when taken with food. The substance reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after about two hours. When in the bloodstream, it is almost completely (>99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. The main inactivation step is glucuronidation; other processes are methylation by COMT, hydroxylation by CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 with subsequent oxidation to a carboxylic acid, and possibly a minor path with reduction to an amine with subsequent acetylation.|$|E
50|$|While {{increase}} of dopamine levels is a desired interaction, <b>tolcapone</b> can theoretically {{also increase the}} levels of other drugs metabolised by COMT, such as the AADC inhibitors carbidopa and benzerazide, as well as methyldopa, dobutamine, apomorphine, adrenaline, and isoprenaline. In studies, a slight interaction with benzerazide was seen, but not with carbidopa. Other interactions with this group of drugs have not been studied. A related type of theoretical interactions is with drugs that increase catecholamine concentrations, such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors; these also showed only slight effects in practice. Combination with non-selective MAO inhibitors might be dangerous.|$|E
