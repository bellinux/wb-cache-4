25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes together. In {{this case}} the collet {{is in the form of}} a truncated cone drilled and threaded down the centreline. The collet diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A <b>threaded</b> <b>stud,</b> anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull the collet into the tube. The increasing diameter of the collet forces the inner tube to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the outer tube thus locking the two tubes together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|E

5000|$|Swaging is {{a method}} of wire rope {{termination}} that refers to the installation technique. The purpose of swaging wire rope fittings is to connect two wire rope ends together, or to otherwise terminate one end of wire rope to something else. A mechanical or hydraulic swager is used to compress and deform the fitting, creating a permanent connection. There are many types of swaged fittings. <b>Threaded</b> <b>Studs,</b> Ferrules, Sockets, and Sleeves are a few examples. [...] Swaging ropes with fibre cores is not recommended.|$|R
50|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>Stud</b> - A <b>threaded</b> <b>stud</b> is a {{fastener}} {{consisting of a}} shank portion which is driven into the base material (and is therefore not visible after fastening) and a threaded portion (which remains visible after the fastening).

40|$|Abstract. The {{reactor vessel}} body and closure head are {{fastened}} with the stud bolt {{that is one}} of crucial parts for safety of the reactor vessels in nuclear power plants. It is reported that the stud bolt is often experienced by fatigue cracks initiated at <b>threads.</b> <b>Stud</b> bolts are inspected by the ultrasonic technique during the overhaul periodically for the prevention of failure which leads to radioactive leakage from the nuclear reactor. The conventional ultrasonic inspection for stud bolts was mainly conducted by reflected echo method based on shadow effect. However, in this technique, there were numerous spurious signals reflected from every oblique surfaces of the thread. In this study, ultrasonic phased array technique was applied to investigate detectability of flaws in stud bolts and characteristics of ultrasonic images corresponding to different scanning methods, that is, sector and linear scan. For this purpose, simplified stud bolt specimens with artificial defects of various depths were prepared...|$|R

50|$|A lug nut is a nut {{with one}} rounded or conical (tapered) end, used on steel and most {{aluminum}} wheels. A set of lug nuts are typically used {{to secure a}} wheel to <b>threaded</b> wheel <b>studs</b> and thereby to a vehicle's axles.Some designs (BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volkswagen) use lug bolts instead of nuts, which screw into a tapped (threaded) hole in the wheel's hub or drum brake or disc. This configuration {{is commonly known as}} a bolted joint.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the {{anchoring}} system used in the shape is important. In addition to the normal considerations of alloy type and anchor size, the precast shape design must also consider all alternatives for attaching the shape to the structure. Numerous methods can be used, including <b>threaded</b> <b>stud</b> attachments through the wall, welded fixtures, or bolted assemblies.|$|E

50|$|Early U.S. lamp {{manufacturers}} used {{different and}} incompatible bases. The Thomson-Houston Electric Company used a <b>threaded</b> <b>stud</b> {{at the bottom}} of the socket, and a flat contact ring. The Sawyer-Mann or Westinghouse base used a spring clip acting on grooves in the bulb base, and a contact stud {{at the bottom of}} the lamp. By about 1908, the Edison base was most common in the U.S., with the others falling out of use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of more efficient OHC mass-production car engines in the 1960s, combining overhead crossflow valves with the low cost of a single camshaft encouraged engines with overhead rockers, directly beneath a single overhead camshaft. [...] These rockers combined the function of sliding tappet, rocker and adjustment device. Adjustment was usually by a <b>threaded</b> pivot <b>stud</b> beneath the rocker. Linear sliding tappets became a problem for wear and demanded careful lubrication. Some engines, such as the Ford Pinto, developed a poor reputation for camshaft wear and encouraged aftermarket improvements to their lubrication systems.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} fatigue lifetime acceptance test criterion by which <b>studs</b> having rolled <b>threads,</b> larger than 1. 0 inches in diameter, {{can be assured}} to meet minimum quality attributes associated with a controlled rolling process. This criterion is derived from a stress dependent, room temperature air fatigue database for test studs having a 0. 625 inch diameter threads of Alloys X- 750 HTH and direct aged 625. Anticipated fatigue lives of larger threads are based on thread root elastic stress concentration factors which increase with increasing thread diameters. Over the thread size range of interest, a 30 % increase in notch stress is equivalent to a factor of five (5 X) reduction in fatigue life. The resulting diameter dependent fatigue acceptance criterion is normalized to the aerospace rolled thread acceptance standards for a 1. 0 inch diameter, 0. 125 inch pitch, Unified National thread with a controlled Root radius (UNR). Testing was conducted at a stress of 50 % of the minimum specified material ultimate strength, 80 Ksi, and at a stress ratio (R) of 0. 10. Limited test data for fastener diameters of 1. 00 to 2. 25 inches are compared to the acceptance criterion. Sensitivity of fatigue life of threads to test nut geometry variables was also shown {{to be dependent on}} notch stress conditions. Bearing surface concavity of the compression nuts and thread flank contact mismatch conditions can significantly affect the fastener fatigue life. Without improved controls these conditions could potentially provide misleading acceptance data. Alternate test nut geometry features are described and implemented in the rolled <b>thread</b> <b>stud</b> specification, MIL-DTL- 24789 (SH), to mitigate the potential effects on fatigue acceptance data...|$|R

Although {{they are}} usually used to attach pipe and {{fittings}} to mechanical supports in buildings, they do not connect the pipes to each other. Fasteners commonly used with piping are a stud bolt with nuts (usually fully threaded, with two heavy, hexagonal nuts); a machine bolt and nut; or a powder-actuated tool (PAT) fastener (usually a nail or <b>threaded</b> <b>stud,</b> driven into concrete or masonry).|$|E
50|$|The {{ultrasonic}} horn {{is commonly}} a solid metal rod {{with a round}} transverse cross-section and a variable-shape longitudinal cross-section - the rod horn. Another group includes the block horn, which has a large rectangular transverse cross-section and a variable-shape longitudinal cross-section, and more complex composite horns. The devices from this group are used with solid treated media. The length of the device must be such that there is mechanical resonance at the desired ultrasonic frequency of operation - one or multiple half wavelengths of ultrasound in the horn material, with sound speed dependence on the horn’s cross-section taken into account. In a common assembly, the ultrasonic horn is rigidly connected to the ultrasonic transducer using a <b>threaded</b> <b>stud.</b>|$|E

50|$|GM ceased {{production}} of the Northstar series in July 2010, with the final cars to receive it, the Cadillac DTS, Buick Lucerne, and Cadillac STS, rolling off the line in 2011. Newer Cadillac V8 models like the CTS-V use the GM LS small-block OHV engine, marking {{a return to a}} simpler push rod engine design. The North star has been plagued from the beginning with reliability issues, particularly head gaskets that fail when head bolts pull out of the block, allowing coolant to seep into the oil system. To exacerbate the situation, the entire engine must be completely removed to replace the head gasket, and a solution implemented to repair the head bolts. The cost to repair is usually upwards of $3000, and involves adding inserts (Normserts, timeserts) in the block to better grip the bolts. The LC3 supercharged variant, with its sealed deck design, has been largely immune from these issues. Cadillac implemented design changes throughout the Northstar's run (particularly 2000 and 2004), lengthening the head bolts and making the threads coarser, but even the 2004+ engines have experienced head gasket failures. The only way to bulletproof the engine is to tap deeper, drill extremely coarse <b>threads,</b> and <b>stud</b> the head to the block.|$|R
