5|$|During {{the period}} of Persian {{imperial}} rule in the region (c. 550–330 BCE), the Qedarites exercised control over the desert areas bordering Egypt and Israel and the traffic related to Arabian incense trade upon which Gaza depended. Herodotus (c. 484–425 BCE) writes of {{their presence in the}} northern Sinai near the Egyptian border where they may have been engaged by the Achaemenids, the Persian imperial authorities, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> border secure as well as their control of the city of Gaza.|$|E
5|$|While Germanicus enjoyed {{some success}} in his campaigns against Arminius and his allies, Tiberius decided not to attempt to conquer the Germans and {{recalled}} Germanicus to Rome. The effort {{it would have taken}} to conquer Germania Magna was deemed too great when compared with the low potential for profit from acquiring the new territory. Rome regarded Germany as a wild territory of forests and swamps, with little wealth compared to territories Rome already had. However, the campaign significantly healed the Roman psychological trauma from the Varus disaster, and greatly recovered Roman prestige. In addition to the recovery of two of the three lost eagles, Germanicus had fought Arminius, the leader who destroyed the three Roman legions in 9 AD, and defeated him in numerous battles. In leading his troops across the Rhine without recourse to Tiberius, he contradicted the advice of Augustus <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> river as the boundary of the empire, and opened himself to potential doubts from Tiberius about his motives in taking such independent action. This error in political judgement gave Tiberius reason to controversially recall his nephew. Tacitus attributed the recall to Tiberius' jealousy of the glory Germanicus had acquired, and, with some bitterness, claims that Germanicus could have completed the conquest of Germania had he been given full independence of action.|$|E

25|$|Standing at 6 feet 3 {{inches tall}} (1.91 m) and {{weighing}} 200 pounds (91kg), Westbrook {{is a point}} guard who has established himself {{as one of the}} most athletic players in NBA history. He is also widely known for playing at a high level of intensity and for being able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> intensity for the majority of his playing time. Westbrook will often look to push the pace of the game for transition points and attack the basket. Though attacking the rim is his forte, he will frequently pull up for medium range jump shots. Westbrook regularly creates good scoring opportunities for his teammates, resulting in him averaging over seven assists per game for his career. Westbrook is widely recognized as one of the best all-around players in the NBA, having recorded 90 triple-doubles over his career (82 regular season, 8 playoff). His 82 regular season triple-doubles is ranked fourth-most all-time and his eight playoff triple-doubles is tied for seventh-most all-time. 42 of his 82 regular season triple-doubles came during the 2016–17 season, breaking Oscar Robertson's single-season record of 41, a record he set during the 1961–62 season. He subsequently joined Robertson as the only players in NBA history to average a triple-double for a season. Westbrook's three-point shooting and turnovers are often brought to attention when pundits criticize his game. He averages 30% on three-point field goal attempts and 3.9 turnovers a game for his career.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
