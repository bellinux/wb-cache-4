5|$|England batted {{first to}} score 362, {{but when the}} West Indies batted, Ganteaume and his opening partner, George Carew shared a {{partnership}} of 173. Once more, Ganteaume was criticised for slow batting, although he later suggested that he had concentrated on scoring singles to allow his in-form partner to face the bowling. On the third day, he carried on batting to reach his century, {{the first in a}} Test match by a Trinidadian in Trinidad. The innings took around 270 minutes, but he slowed down as he neared three-figures, and the West Indies' captain sent out a note asking the batsmen to score faster. Other batsmen also batted slowly, and Ganteaume later claimed that England used negative, run-saving tactics to slow the scoring rate. He did not bat in the second innings, when the West Indies needed to score runs quickly in an unsuccessful attempt to win the game. The match was drawn, having been earlier interrupted by rain which cut the playing time, but in the knowledge <b>that</b> <b>quick</b> scoring was vital, Ganteaume's slow batting adversely affected the West Indies' chances of victory.|$|E
25|$|The first Martian flyby {{mission was}} Mariner 4 which arrived in 1965. <b>That</b> <b>quick</b> two-day pass (July 14–15, 1965) was limited and crude {{in terms of}} its {{contribution}} to the state of knowledge of Martian climate. Later Mariner missions (Mariner 6, and Mariner 7) filled in some of the gaps in basic climate information. Data-based climate studies started in earnest with the Viking program in 1975 and continues with such probes as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.|$|E
25|$|Before the Gold Rush of 1849 {{there were}} only a few hundred people living in tents and wooden shanties within San Francisco. However, after the gold rush the {{population}} of San Francisco would increase fifty-fold in just two years—from 492 in 1847 to over 25,000 in 1849. <b>That</b> <b>quick</b> and extreme growth combined with a lack of strong and robust government would create many opportunities for criminals, corrupt politicians, and brothel owners. For many decades murderers and robbers could commit their crimes without punishment, sometimes boldly in public view. As a result, the Barbary Coast became a wild area representative of the Old West, and had many problems with political corruption, gambling, crime, and violence.|$|E

25|$|In many countries, {{local and}} {{national}} government often refuse to recognize slums, because the slum are on disputed land, or because of the fear <b>that</b> <b>quick</b> official recognition will encourage more slum formation and seizure of land illegally. Recognizing and notifying slums often triggers a creation of property rights, and requires that the government provide public services and infrastructure to the slum residents. With poverty and informal economy, slums do not generate tax revenues {{for the government and}} therefore tend to get minimal or slow attention. In other cases, the narrow and haphazard layout of slum streets, houses and substandard shacks, along with persistent threat of crime and violence against infrastructure workers, makes it difficult to layout reliable, safe, cost effective and efficient infrastructure. In yet others, the demand far exceeds the government bureaucracy's ability to deliver.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with , many Hindus embrace vegetarianism to respect higher forms of life. Estimates of strict lacto vegetarians in India (includes adherents of all religions) who never eat any meat, fish or eggs vary between 20% and 42%, {{while others are}} either less strict vegetarians or non-vegetarians. Those who eat meat seek Jhatka (quick death) method of meat production, and dislike Halal (slow bled death) method, believing <b>that</b> <b>quick</b> death method reduces suffering to the animal. The food habits vary with region, with Bengali Hindus and Hindus living in Himalayan regions, or river delta regions, regularly eating meat and fish. Some avoid meat on specific festivals or occasions. Observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef. The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure, and Hindu society honours the cow {{as a symbol of}} unselfish giving.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the major}} {{projects}} the Federal City Council pushed for in the 1960s were Inner Loop highway system and its associated Three Sisters Bridge, and the Washington Metro subway system. The Inner Loop was strongly opposed by local citizens, who felt it was unnecessary, destroyed many neighborhoods, and despoiled the environment. However, Representative William Natcher, chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for the District of Columbia of the House Committee on Appropriations, {{was not only a}} strong advocate of bridge and highway construction but also convinced that construction of the Inner Loop was essential to the growth of the District of Columbia. The Federal City Council, too, advocated the Inner Loop {{as a response to the}} flight of retail and light industry for the suburbs (a trend which began in the 1950s). The organization believed <b>that</b> <b>quick</b> and easy automobile access to the city (with lots of inexpensive parking) would draw shoppers and retailers back. A large subway system was equally important, as the Federal City Council concluded that surface transit alone could not meet the needs of the rapidly growing D.C. metropolitan area. The organization pushed hard for construction of Metro even though Representative Natcher threatened to cancel the subway project if the Inner Loop was not constructed. The organization also wished to ensure that wealthier suburbanites would be able to reach the downtown D.C. shopping district, in the hopes this would reverse or at least stop the flight of retail out of the city.|$|E

25|$|The pre-match {{interest}} surrounded Brian Lara and {{his attempt}} to equal the first-class record of scoring six centuries in consecutive innings. After rain wiped out the first day Lara soon {{found himself in the}} middle as Middlesex chose to field first and Warwickshire lost an early wicket. He made 26 before edging a leg side delivery from Richard Johnson through to the wicket-keeper. The visitors were all out for 211, with no batsman passing fifty. Desmond Haynes was dismissed off the first ball of the reply but Middlesex lost no further wickets in the remainder of the day. Mike Roseberry and Mike Gatting, not out overnight, shared 77 for the second wicket before the latter was dismissed for 52. Roseberry also shared 79 with Mark Ramprakash (37) before going on to complete a 17th first-class century. He was ninth out as the middle and lower order offered little resistance and Middlesex's lead was restricted to 38. The deficit was turned into a lead by the close with Lara scoring a 52-ball half-century. He completed a sixth century in seven innings on the final morning, adding 85 from 84 balls, <b>that</b> <b>quick</b> scoring enabled a declaration leaving Middlesex a target of 269 from 50 overs. They began well, reaching 129/1 before Tim Munton took the wickets of Gatting and Ramprakash in consecutive deliveries followed by Roseberry in his next over. The chase continued but another double strike from Munton left Middlesex to settle for the draw.|$|E

Similarly, Edge described Underworld as a [...] "rare game that manages to provide a real adventure to go along with its action", praising its frenetic pace and Lara's new abilities.

2500|$|It {{was during}} September 2004 <b>that</b> <b>Quick</b> officially {{began working with}} Tokyopop on {{bringing}} Off Beat to shelves, having decided that there would only be three books in her series, making it the shortest story she has ever conceived. On the subject of her work, she has stated:"I thought I would like {{to write a story}} that takes place in the city but without trying to be gritty/edgy, or overly glamorized...Something kind of everyday but a bit quirky and fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|Off Beat {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by readers. It has received praise for its unique style {{of art and}} humour, slow unraveling plot, and {{has been described as}} [...] "a wildly imaginative romantic drama, filled with all the hopes, dreams and anxiety of a teenager {{trying to make sense of}} his place in the world." [...] Readers find Off Beats setting especially appealing, feeling <b>that</b> <b>Quick</b> has effectively crafted a [...] "pure U.S. city" [...] which has lent itself to a distinct American characterization despite influences from conventional modes of Japanese manga. Conversely, a minority of critics has dismissed these aspects as disorienting when compared to other manga, but nonetheless find redeeming qualities in the story and character development.|$|E
2500|$|Off Beat {{is divided}} into chapters. Each volume {{is made up of}} six {{cumulative}} chapters (i.e. Chapter 6 carries over from Volume 1 into Chapter 7 at the beginning of Volume 2). Preceding the very first chapter of the series is a short prelude which establishes Tory's overanalytic attitude and motivation, with Chapter 1 leaping a time span of 347 days. In contrast to the prelude which looks back a full year, there is an epilogue at the end of Chapter 18 which takes a glance into the future for the main characters. [...] Several chapter headings and pages not directly linked to the storyline make use of monochromatic versions of Off Beat illustrations <b>that</b> <b>Quick</b> has produced independent of her work on the manga.|$|E

2500|$|Edmonds {{wrote that}} Gough spread the attacking {{divisions}} evenly, {{when he could}} have reinforced the II Corps by weakening the army further north then included in an appendix, the Fifth Army Operation Order of 27 June, which showed that the green line was the main objective, not the red line (fourth objective). Advance guards of all arms were to advance after the protective barrage ended, to reconnoitre and occupy undefended ground and tactically valuable features up to the red line. The order emphasised that several organised battles on a wide front were necessary and <b>that</b> <b>quick</b> reorganisation would be needed after each attack. In the II Corps area on the Gheluvelt Plateau, {{the distance to the}} green line was [...] on the right of the 24th Division at Klein Zillibeke and [...] along the Ypres–Roulers railway, on the left flank, which was a shorter distance to the green line than on the other corps fronts.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Off Beats tone {{is derived}} from its {{relation}} to urban culture. The fictional version of New York City <b>that</b> <b>Quick</b> has constructed is incredibly rich in detail, with attention to minuscule factors such as street addresses and subway/bus commute schedules. Often, the establishing shots of a scene will concentrate on landscape to capture in essence how a given area affects or portrays characters within that scene. Examples include shots of busy traffic and corner stores, Tory's messy room, and a dilapidated park. References are made to such problems as gang warfare, counterfeiting, illegal immigration, arms dealing, and terrorism {{in the form of}} bomb threats. Conspiracy theory and hacker subculture are also subjects that are explored. Editor Lillian Diaz-Przybyl has commented:"It features a spot-on, great depiction of New York. Everything Fake does wrong with setting, this does right. The location sets a brilliant backdrop for a really great story with a smart Walter Mitty twist, and cute guys to boot! It's truly manga with an American sensibility. The character designs are unique and appealing, the romance is sweet and understated, and it actually looks like Queens, which makes me really happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{this led}} to a {{difficult}} season, despite <b>that</b> <b>quick</b> start, one that included two eight-game losing streaks (the longest such streaks for the franchise since 1988) and a seven-game losing streak, losing months in June, August and September, and an 83-78 record, the worst for the Cardinals since the 1999 team finished 75-86. [...] However, that record was still good enough to finish first in a weak National League Central. [...] On the season's final day, the Cardinals made the playoffs for the sixth time in the last seven seasons, edging the second-place Houston Astros by a game and a half. [...] Once the playoffs began, the lightly regarded Cardinals surprised baseball fans everywhere by beating the San Diego Padres in the four-game Division Series, beating the New York Mets in the seven-game NLCS, and beating the Detroit Tigers in the 2006 World Series four games to one, winning the tenth, and probably most unlikely, World Series championship in franchise history. [...] Their [...]516 winning percentage is the lowest ever for a World Series champion. [...] This season ironically contrasted with 2004 in that that team were considered overwhelming favorites but were swept in the World Series, resulting in a bittersweet three-year period for the Cardinals.|$|E
