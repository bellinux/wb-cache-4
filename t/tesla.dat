5|$|In America, Angier meets {{scientist}} Nikola <b>Tesla</b> {{and asks}} him to build him the machine <b>Tesla</b> built for Borden. While waiting for <b>Tesla</b> to finish, Angier deciphers Borden's diary, which he discovers to be fraudulent: Borden confesses that <b>Tesla</b> {{has nothing to}} do with Borden's trick and that Borden ordered Olivia to give Angier the diary to send him away. Angier confronts <b>Tesla,</b> who admits to never having built any device for Borden but has successfully built a replicating machine for Angier, capable of reproducing animate and inanimate objects a distance from the machine. As <b>Tesla</b> departs, he advises Angier to destroy the machine.|$|E

5|$|<b>Tesla</b> was {{the fourth}} of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, {{who was killed in}} a horse riding {{accident}} when <b>Tesla</b> was aged five. In 1861, <b>Tesla</b> attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the <b>Tesla</b> family moved to the nearby Gospić, Lika where Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tesla</b> wrote {{a number}} of books and {{articles}} for magazines and journals. Among his books are , compiled and edited by Ben Johnston; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola <b>Tesla,</b> compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The <b>Tesla</b> Papers.|$|E

25|$|In the 100 years since, others such as Robert Golka {{have built}} {{equipment}} similar to <b>Tesla's,</b> but long-distance power transmission {{has not been}} demonstrated, and the scientific consensus is his World Wireless system would not have worked. Contemporary scientists point out that while <b>Tesla's</b> coils (with appropriate antennas) can function as radio transmitters, transmitting {{energy in the form}} of radio waves, the frequency he used, around 150kHz, is far too low for practical long-range power transmission. At these wavelengths the radio waves spread out in all directions and cannot be focused on a distant receiver. <b>Tesla's</b> world power transmission scheme remains today what it was in <b>Tesla's</b> time: a bold, fascinating dream.|$|R

Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and <b>Tesla</b> was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, <b>Tesla</b> made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.|$|E

5|$|In late 1886, <b>Tesla</b> met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York {{attorney}} Charles F. Peck. The two {{men were}} experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the <b>Tesla</b> Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1/3 to <b>Tesla,</b> 1/3 to Peck and Brown, and 1/3 to fund development. They set up a laboratory for <b>Tesla</b> at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1937, after midnight one night, <b>Tesla</b> left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While {{crossing}} a street {{a couple of blocks}} from the hotel, <b>Tesla</b> was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries were never known; <b>Tesla</b> refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.|$|E

5|$|On 17 April 1879, Milutin <b>Tesla</b> {{died at the}} age of 60 after {{contracting}} {{an unspecified}} illness. Some sources say that he died of a stroke. During that year, <b>Tesla</b> taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospić.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after leaving}} the Edison company, <b>Tesla</b> was working on {{patenting}} an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced <b>Tesla</b> to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the <b>Tesla</b> Electric Light & Manufacturing. <b>Tesla</b> worked {{for the rest of}} the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to <b>Tesla</b> in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tesla</b> Motors {{designed}} its Model S {{to allow}} fast battery swapping.

The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to <b>Tesla,</b> a large number of Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E

5|$|<b>Tesla</b> {{obtained}} around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, {{and various}} sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are {{a minimum of}} 278 known patents issued to <b>Tesla</b> in 26 countries. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Many inventions developed by <b>Tesla</b> were not put into patent protection.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tesla</b> read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. <b>Tesla</b> related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, <b>Tesla</b> was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, {{he would be able to}} envision it in realistic detail. <b>Tesla</b> would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, <b>Tesla</b> had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{subsequent}} claims by <b>Tesla</b> biographers that Edison and <b>Tesla</b> were the original recipients and that neither {{was given the}} award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep <b>Tesla</b> from getting the $20,000 prize money.|$|E

50|$|Bitter {{electromagnets}} {{are used}} where extremely strong fields are required. The iron cores used in conventional electromagnets saturate and cease {{to provide any}} advantage at fields above a few <b>teslas,</b> so iron core electromagnets are limited to fields of about 2 <b>teslas.</b> Superconducting electromagnets can produce stronger magnetic fields but are limited to fields of 10 to 20 <b>teslas,</b> due to flux creep, though theoretical limits are higher. For stronger fields resistive solenoid electromagnets of the Bitter design are used. Their disadvantage is that they require very high drive currents, and dissipate large quantities of heat.|$|R
