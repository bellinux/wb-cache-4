40|$|K+ {{movements}} during <b>the</b> <b>shutting</b> {{and subsequent}} opening of trap-lobes in Aldro-vanda vesiculosa were measured using 86 Rb as a tracer for K+. Immediately after <b>the</b> <b>shutting,</b> {{a large amount}} of 86 Rb pre-loaded in the trap-lobes was detected in the hollow space inside <b>the</b> <b>shut</b> trap. This may indicate that much of the K+ in the active motor cells leaks out during <b>the</b> <b>shutting,</b> resulting in turgor loss in the cells. 86 Rb(K+) uptake in the trap was active. During the opening process, enhanced 86 Rb uptake was observed. The time course of this uptake was {{similar to that of the}} opening of the trap-lobes, and both courses were accelerated by IAA. Enhanced K+ uptake may restore the turgor in active motor cells. The quantity of K+ that moved during <b>the</b> <b>shutting</b> or opening was estimated as 20 % of that in the active motor cells in the open state of the trap-lobes. The K+ efflux across the membranes of the active motor cells may be caused by a large increase in bulk flow triggered by an action potential, and was estimated as 6, 200 pmol-cm- 2. Key words: Aldrovanda vesiculosa — IAA — • K+ movement — Rapid trap shutting — Trap opening...|$|R
