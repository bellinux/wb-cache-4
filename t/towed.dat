An example of a statute regulating the operation of <b>tow</b> trucks and the <b>towing</b> industry in Victoria is the Victorian Accident <b>Towing</b> Services Act.|$|R

The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of <b>towed</b> loads, and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1954, 706 Squadron, a second-line unit, flew aboard {{to conduct}} {{trials of the}} anti-submarine version of the Whirlwind helicopter. They were {{successful}} enough that the squadron was redesignated as 845 Squadron afterwards and Perseus ferried them to Malta in April. The ship continued on to deliver relief supplies to Singapore intended for Korea and was reduced to reserve again upon her return on 12 July. The Admiralty intended to convert her to a submarine depot ship and she was <b>towed</b> to Belfast to begin work in 1955. The cutbacks from the 1957 Defence White Paper caused the conversion to be cancelled and the ship was <b>towed</b> to Gare Loch to await a decision on the ship's disposition. Perseus sold for scrap in May 1958 and <b>towed</b> to Port Glasgow to begin demolition.|$|E

5000|$|The Accident <b>Towing</b> Services Act was {{the first}} {{dedicated}} statute regulating Victoria's <b>towing</b> industry and replaced provisions in the former Transport Act 1983.

In essence, <b>towing</b> vehicles damaged in a road accident and the individuals working in that sector are subject to tight controls while trade <b>towing</b> activities such as breakdown <b>towing</b> have few controls.|$|R
