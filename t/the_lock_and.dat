5|$|Kelston Lock and weir have {{permanent}} moorings {{above and}} below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford Lock and weir are overlooked by {{the remains of the}} Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is a pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> weir. The lock was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In its heyday, between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. Hanham is the last tidal lock, after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook.|$|E
25|$|Pacific salmon are anadromous; they hatch in lakes, rivers, and streams—or, {{nowadays}} fish hatcheries—migrate to sea, {{and only}} {{at the end of their}} life return to fresh water to spawn. When the Corps of Engineers first built <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> dam, they changed the natural drainage route of Lake Washington. <b>The</b> <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> dam blocked all salmon runs out of the Cedar River watershed. To correct this problem, the Corps built a fish ladder as <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> were constructed to allow salmon to pass around <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> dam.|$|R

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal {{drainage}} problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854. The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for Sewers, for use as a drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by {{interactions with the}} substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E
5|$|Keynsham {{is located}} where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing {{rights for the}} Millground and Chewton {{sections}} of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to Chub, Roach, European perch and Rudd, along with good numbers of Gudgeon, Dace and Trout. Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> the weir. The weir {{side of the island}} is also the mouth of the River Chew.|$|E

5|$|There was {{friction}} between the new owners and the Commissioners of Sewers. The railway company proposed {{the creation of a}} railway between Highbridge and Glastonbury in 1850, and the Somerset Central Railway was authorised by Parliament on 17 June 1852. The canal was transferred to the new company, and was used to speed the construction of the railway, earning £312 in the year ending September 1853. The line followed the route of the canal closely, with much of it built on the towpath. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854.|$|E

25|$|The vault door is also molded {{of special}} {{concrete}} {{used to make}} the panels, but it can be made in several ways.

25|$|If {{the lock}} were empty, the boat {{would have had}} to wait 5 to 10 minutes while the lock was filled. For a boat {{travelling}} upstream, the process is reversed; the boat enters the empty lock, and then the chamber is filled by opening a valve that allows water to enter the chamber from the upper level.

25|$|The {{design of}} the bridge was not {{appreciated}} {{by many of the}} residents of Loxwood, because of its steel barriers, and following a period of consultation and fund-raising, planning permission was obtained to replace them with lower, brick-faced parapets, to match the adjacent lock and footbridge. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> footbridge achieved second place in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Community Benefit Awards in 2010. The Trust's success was particularly welcome, as it was the only entry in the category by a voluntary organisation, rather than a professional one.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} general control {{framework}} for multiple mechanical systems interacting with environments and/or humans under coordination requirements. The key innovation is the passive decomposition which {{enables us to}} achieve the two requirements of such systems simultaneously: motion coordination and energetic passivity of the closedloop system. It decomposes the system dynamics into shape system addressing <b>the</b> coordination aspect, <b>locked</b> system representing overall dynamics of the coordinated system, and dynamic couplings between <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> shape systems. <b>The</b> dynamic couplings can be cancelled out without violating passivity. Thus, the coordination aspect (shape system) and the dynamics of <b>the</b> coordinated system (<b>locked</b> system) can be decoupled from each other while enforcing passivity. Also, by designing <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> shape controls to enforce passivity of their respective systems, passivity of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. We analyze and exhibit geometry of the passive decomposition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> shape systems. I...|$|R
