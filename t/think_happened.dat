25|$|The game {{is usually}} self-refereed, {{relying on the}} players to call their own infractions {{and to try to}} play within the rules of the game. It is assumed that players will not {{intentionally}} violate the rules and will be honest when discussing foul calls with opponents. This is called Spirit of the Game. After a call is made, the players should decide on an outcome, based on what they <b>think</b> <b>happened</b> and how the rules apply to that situation. If a player has been fouled on a catch, they will often gain possession of the disc. If the players cannot agree on a catching foul, the disc can be given back to the thrower, with play restarting as if before the disputed throw.|$|E

Byatt says some of the characters in her fiction represent her [...] "greatest terror which is simple domesticity [...] I had this image of coming out from under and seeing the light for a bit and then being shut in a kitchen, which I <b>think</b> <b>happened</b> to women of my generation." [...] Like Babel Tower, A Whistling Woman touches on the utopian and revolutionary dreams of the 1960s.

2500|$|McKenna {{was opposed}} to Christianity and most forms of {{organized}} religion or guru-based forms of spiritual awakening, favouring shamanism, which he believed was the broadest spiritual paradigm available, stating that: [...] "What I <b>think</b> <b>happened</b> {{is that in the}} world of prehistory all religion was experiential, and it was based on the pursuit of ecstasy through plants. And at some time, very early, a group interposed itself between people and direct experience of the 'Other.' This created hierarchies, priesthoods, theological systems, castes, ritual, taboos. Shamanism, on the other hand, is an experiential science that deals with an area where we know nothing. It {{is important to remember that}} our epistemological tools have developed very unevenly in the West. We know a tremendous amount about what is going on in the heart of the atom, but we know absolutely nothing about the nature of the mind." ...|$|E

6000|$|How {{the fellow}} {{came to be}} a {{shipowner}} {{at the same time}} was quite a tale. He came out third in a home ship nearly fifteen years ago, Captain Eliott remembered, and got paid off after a bad sort of row both with his skipper and his chief. Anyway, they seemed jolly glad {{to get rid of him}} at all costs. Clearly a mutinous sort of chap. Well, he remained out here, a perfect nuisance, everlastingly shipped and unshipped, unable to keep a berth very long; pretty nigh went through every engine-room afloat belonging to the colony. Then suddenly, [...] "What do you <b>think</b> <b>happened,</b> Harry?" ...|$|E

60|$|Not {{knowing what}} to do the poor magpie had to agree, and flying back, with a heavy heart, he threw one of his young ones out of the nest. The fox seized it in his mouth and ran off in triumph, while the magpie, though deeply grieved for the loss of his little one, found some comfort in the thought that only a bird of {{extraordinary}} wisdom would have dreamed of saving the rest by the sacrifice of the one. But what do you <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> Why, a few days later, Michael the fox might have been seen sitting under the very same tree, and a dreadful pang shot through the heart of the magpie as he peeped at him from a hole in the nest.|$|E

[...] "Why, {{there was a man}} over in Rottenberg who was flat on his back with half a dozen fatal diseases. The doctors gave him just three days to live,--three days, think of it! His wife nearly cried her eyes out. Then along came this Gumley man with a trunk full of his Red Pills for Red-Blooded People. He didn't exactly know if the dying man was red-blooded or not, but he took a chance and gave the fellow sixteen pills, four after breakfast, four after dinner, four after supper and four on retiring, and the next day, what do you <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> That man {{got up and went to}} work, and he's been at his Job ever since." ...|$|E
60|$|What do you <b>think</b> <b>happened</b> this morning? Two wedding-presents arrived. The {{first was}} a very nice fish slice and fork in a case. It was from dear old Mrs. Jones Beyrick, on whom we really had no claim whatever. We all think it so kind of her, and such a nice fish-slice. The other was a {{beautiful}} travelling-bag from Uncle Arthur. Stamped in gold upon it were the letters M.C., I said, 'Oh, what a pity! They have put the wrong initials.' That made mamma laugh. I suppose one soon gets used to it. Fancy how you would feel if it were the other way about, and you changed your name to mine. They might call you Selby, but you would continue to feel Crosse. I didn't mean that for a joke, but women make jokes without intending it. The other day the curate drove up in his donkey-cart, and mother said, 'Oh, what a nice tandem!' I think that she meant to say 'turn- out'; but papa said it was the neatest thing he had heard for a long time, so mamma is very pleased, but I am sure that she does not know even now why it should be so funny.|$|E

Gabriela opens the door to the cellar, when Eduardo freaks out and decides he wants to go, leaving the door ajar and the killer an escape route. Eduardo leaves when Gabriela refuses to go with him, and she picks up a knife, dancing around the house where the blood is, acting out what she <b>thinks</b> <b>happened</b> - all while the killer watches.|$|R

[...] "When I proposed the separation, and mentioned my reasons, I expected to find some difficulty in persuading Mrs. Presty {{to give up the}} adventurous journey with her daughter and her grandchild. I reminded her that she had friends in London who would receive her, and got snubbed for taking the liberty. 'I know that as well as you do. Come along--I'm ready to go with you.' It isn't agreeable to my self-esteem to own it, but I expected to hear her say that she would consent to any sacrifice for the sake of her dear daughter. No such clap-trap as that passed her lips. She owned the true motive with a superiority to cant which won my sincerest respect. 'I'll do anything,' she said, 'to baffle Herbert Linley and the spies he has set to watch us.' I can't tell you how glad I was that she had her reward on the same day. We were too late at the station, and we had to wait for the next train. And what do you <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> The two scoundrels followed us instead of following Mrs. Linley! They had inquired no doubt at the livery stables where we hired the carriage--had recognized the description of us--and had taken the long journey to London for nothing. Mrs. Presty and I shook hands at the terminus the best friends that ever traveled together with the best of motives. After that, I think I deserve another glass of wine." ...|$|E
60|$|One {{would like}} to peep covertly into Amy's diary (octavo, with the word 'Amy' in gold letters {{wandering}} across the soft brown leather covers, {{as if it was}} a long word and, in Amy's opinion, rather a dear). To take such a liberty, and allow the reader to look over our shoulders, as they often invite you to do in novels (which, however, are much more coquettish things than plays) would be very helpful to us; we should learn at once what sort of girl Amy is, and why to-day finds her washing her hair. We should also get proof or otherwise, that we are interpreting her aright; for it is our desire not to record our feelings about Amy, but merely Amy's feelings about herself; not to tell what we <b>think</b> <b>happened,</b> but what Amy thought happened. The book, to be sure, is padlocked, but we happen to know where it is kept. (In the lower drawer of that hand-painted escritoire.) Sometimes in the night Amy, waking up, wonders whether she did lock her diary, and steals downstairs in white to make sure. On these occasions she undoubtedly lingers among the pages, re-reading the peculiarly delightful bit she wrote yesterday; so we could peep over her shoulder, while the reader peeps over ours. Then why don't we do it? Is it because this would be a form of eavesdropping, and that we cannot be sure our hands are clean enough to turn the pages of a young girl's thoughts? It cannot be that, because the novelists do it. It is because in a play we must tell nothing that is not revealed by the spoken words; you must find out all you want to know from them; there is no weather even in plays nowadays except in melodrama; the novelist can have sixteen chapters about the hero's grandparents, but we cannot even say he had any unless he says it himself. There can be no rummaging in the past for us to show what sort of people our characters are; we are allowed only to present them as they toe the mark; then the handkerchief falls, and off they go.|$|E

40|$|Although {{students}} often ask for grammar help, writing center tutors are conflicted over {{whether and how}} much to provide such help because of how they internalize the tutoring mandates found in training manuals, tutoring literature, and writing center policies. This results in disconnects between what happens in tutorials and what tutors and writers <b>think</b> <b>happens,</b> with grammar being prioritized regardless of stated agendas or document needs. Solutions to this problem include educating writers and instructors, as well as educating tutors to address grammar productively when and if it is warranted...|$|R
