40|$|We {{present the}} first {{experimental}} demonstration {{of a novel}} type of narrowband and wavelength-tunable multilayer <b>transmission</b> <b>filter</b> for the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region. The operating principle of the filter is based on spatially overlapping the nodes of a standing wave field with the absorbing layers within the multilayer structure. For a wavelength with a matching node pattern, this increases the transmission as compared to neighboring wavelengths where anti-nodes overlap with the absorbing layers. Using Ni/Si multilayers where Ni provides strong absorption, we demonstrate the proper working of such anomalous <b>transmission</b> <b>filter.</b> The demonstration is carried out at the example of 13. 5 nm wavelength and at normal incidence, providing a 0. 27 nm-wide transmission peak. We also demonstrate wavelength tunability by operating the same Ni/Si filter at different wavelengths by varying the angle of incidence. As the multilayer filter is directly deposited on the active area of an EUV-sensitive photodiode, this provides an extremely compact device for easy spectral monitoring in the EUV. The transmission spectrum of the filter is modeled and found {{to be in good}} agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} includes investigations on infrared {{mirrors and}} filters for next generation thermal imaging and spectrometer-on-a-chip applications {{operating in the}} long-wavelength infrared (LWIR, 8 - 15 microns) spectral region. Using the concept of high index-contrast gratings, which have been studied in the near-infrared spectrum, we have demonstrated broadband reflectors and narrowband <b>transmission</b> <b>filters</b> using silicon/silicon-dioxide and silicon/air gratings. Using finite element method simulations, photolithography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, we designed, fabricated, characterized, and analyzed structure response. We provide the first demonstration of broadband reflectance in the LWIR using a high contrast grating, with the silicon/silicon-dioxide grating exhibiting reflectance greater than 70 percent between 13 and 16 microns. We subsequently developed a suspended silicon/air grating to eliminate the lossy silicon dioxide layer, which was limiting the reflectance of the silicon/silicon-dioxide system. LWIR broadband reflectors operating at normal and oblique incidence (15 degrees) with reflectances greater than 85 percent and 90 percent, respectively, are demonstrated. These studies are followed with a group theoretical analysis showing strong plane wave coupling to guided modes supported by the grating {{is responsible for the}} broadband reflectance at normal incidence. We show that other modes are symmetry protected at normal incidence, preventing plane wave coupling. Off-normal incidence relaxes the selection rules and enables weak coupling to these previously protected modes. We use this analysis to predict narrowband <b>transmission</b> <b>filtering</b> capabilities by coupling to transverse magnetic and transverse electric mode sets supported by the grating. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize narrowband <b>transmission</b> <b>filtering</b> capabilities based on the optimized broadband reflector and the group theoretical analysis.

Furthermore, the filtered wavelength is demonstrated to predictably change with the grating period, making it attractive for possible hyperspectral imaging applications...|$|R

Our previous work demonstrated that resonant absorption and subsequent fluorescence near the entrance window of an optically thick potassium cell acts as a 1 GHz wide (. 002 nm) imaging screen <b>transmission</b> <b>filter</b> with high quantum efficiency (> 60 %). With laser illumination at the potassium absorption line center, this screen has an outstanding imaging capability (33 μm resolution). The work presented here focuses on using an ultra-thin (200 micron) potassium vapor cell to maintain image quality for in-band but off-resonant photons that are present with broad band radiation such as that from flames, plumes and discharges. In a thick cell, those photons are absorbed farther away from the entrance window and lead to background luminosity and image blurring. By employing a thin cell, it is shown that the filter maintains the high quantum efficiency (~ 50 %) and good imaging capability (~ 20 lines per mm) with broad band light, has a transmission linewidth of between 1. 5 and 2 GHz (0. 003 ~ 0. 004 nm), and an out-of-band rejection of better than 1000.

40|$|A novel fibre Bragg grating <b>transmission</b> <b>filter</b> {{employing}} a fibre polarisation splitter has been fabricated and tested. The device has a total insertion of 1. 2 dB and potentially {{can be reduced}} below 0. 5 dB. Since their first demonstration [l], photoinduced Bragg gratings in optical fibres {{have been shown to}} be suitable for a number of applications. The high reflectivity possible at a given wavelength means that they can be used as narrow bandpass filters, reflectors in fibre lasers, wavelength selective taps and in sensors [2 4. Chirped gratings have also been proposed and shown to be very promising for the compression of optical. pulses and the compen-sation of chromatic dispersion suffered in high speed optical com-munications systems [5 - 7]. One of the problems associated with using gratings in some of these applications is that they operate in reflection, so to recover the reflected radiation they must be used in conjunction with a 5050 fibre coupler, incurring a signal loss of at least 6 dB. This high insertion loss can make such devices impractical in real sys-tems. Two possible solutions have recently been proposed: using two identical gratings in a Michelson interferometer configuration [8], and a ‘grating frustrated coupler ’ [9], in which one of the halves of a fibre coupler contains a Bragg grating at the interac-tion region.

40|$|Advances in {{solid-state}} device design now allow {{the spectrum of}} transmitted electrons in thermionic and thermoelectric devices to be engineered {{in ways that were}} not previously possible. Here we show that the shape of the electron energy spectrum in these devices has a significant impact on their performance. We distinguish between traditional thermionic devices where electron momentum is filtered in the direction of transport only and a second type, in which the electron filtering occurs according to total electron momentum. Such “total momentum filtered” thermionic devices could potentially be implemented in, for example, quantum dot superlattices. It is shown that whilst total momentum filtered thermionic devices may achieve an efficiency equal to the Carnot value, traditional thermionic devices are limited to an efficiency below this. Our second main result is that the electronic efficiency of a device is not only improved by reducing the width of the <b>transmission</b> <b>filter</b> as has previously been shown, but also strongly depends on whether the transmission probability rises sharply from zero to full transmission. The benefit of increasing efficiency through a sharply rising transmission probability is that it can be achieved without sacrificing device power, in contrast to the use of a narrow <b>transmission</b> <b>filter</b> which can greatly reduce power. We show that devices that have a sharply rising transmission probability significantly outperform those that do not and that such transmission probabilities may be achieved with practical single and multibarrier devices. We discuss how the shape of the electron energy spectrum will also {{have an effect on the}} electronic efficiency of thermoelectric devices due to mathematical equivalences in the ballistic and diffusive formalisms.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns techniques {{for the formation of}} periodic structures in optical fibres. Two different methods of producing such structures are studied in detail. The first of these involves a breakdown mechanism (known as the 'fibre fuse') that permanently damages the core glass in a periodic manner leaving it unable to guide light. The dynamics of this mechanism are studied, with a view to controlling it for the production of interactive grating structures. It is determined that, due to a sharp rise in fibre absorption with temperature, a thermal shock-wave, with a typical thermal gradient of several hundred degrees Kelvin per micron, forms and travels along the fibre, heating the core glass {{to such an extent that}} damage occurs. The periodicity of the resultant damage arises from thermal focusing and de-focusing of light in the region of this shock-wave. The second method makes use of the photorefractivity observed in certain germanosilicate fibres on exposure to moderate intensity blue light of wavelength ~ 480 nm or UV light ~ 240 nm. A single-mode fibre <b>transmission</b> <b>filter</b> is demonstrated for the first time, produced by exposing a fibre Sagnac loop mirror to 488 nm holographic fringes. Average index changes are shown to occur if such fibres are exposed to spatially uniform blue or UV light, indicating that grating formation is by a different mechanism to the local charge separation which occurs in photorefractive crystals. The various characteristics of these average index changes are measured and analysed, with the conclusion that they result from defect centre formation, driven by two photon absorption with blue light, or single photon absorption with UV light. Associated birefringence changes are also measured and are exploited in a hi-bi fibre to periodically perturb the birefringence axes, producing a narrow-line <b>transmission</b> <b>filter...</b>|$|E
