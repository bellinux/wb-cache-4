500|$|Celebration {{received}} {{a score of}} 84/100 at Metacritic, indicating [...] "universal acclaim" [...] from music critics. Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph gave the collection {{four out of five}} stars and said: [...] "Madonna's Celebration shows just how consistently she delivers the goods, with tracks such as 'Music', 'Ray of Light', 'Frozen' and 'Don't Tell Me'", with [...] "only a couple of [...] which feel dispensable." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the compilation four out of five stars and commented that [...] "functionally, what Madonna and fans are really celebrating with the release of Celebration is the hard proof that Madonna's back catalogue is now so immense and so varied that she can release a behemoth, two-disc greatest hits package that shoehorns in 36 songs and still manages to significantly short-change the singer's legacy", though also noticing that [...] "the album is missing songs, doesn't always include <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>ones,</b> [...] seems to have been sequenced by a not particularly intuitive Genius playlist." [...] Tim Sendra from AllMusic praised that [...] "the collection does a fine job of living up to the title— it's certainly a celebration of Madonna's career and includes some of the most celebratory and thrilling pop music ever created." [...] While reviewing the double-disc deluxe edition version of the album, he commented: [...] "The 34-track double-disc Deluxe Edition has an easier time of it than the single-disc 18-track release does."

60|$|Katherine, Duchess of Bellamont, was beautiful: {{small and}} {{delicate}} in structure, with a dazzling complexion, {{and a smile}} which, though rare, was of the most winning and brilliant character. Her rich brown hair and her deep blue eye might have become a dryad; but her brow denoted intellect of a high order, and her mouth spoke inexorable resolution. She was a woman of fixed opinions, and of firm and compact prejudices. Brought up in an austere circle, where on all matters irrevocable judgment had been passed, which enjoyed the advantages of knowing exactly what was true in dogma, what just in conduct, and what correct in manners, she had early acquired the convenient habit of decision, while her studious mind employed its considerable energies in mastering every writer who favoured those opinions which she had previously determined were <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
60|$|Altogether, {{about three}} hundred people were burnt in Queen Mary's reign for denying one or {{other of the}} doctrines that the Pope thought <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>ones.</b> It was a terrible time; and the queen, who had only longed to do right and restore her country to the Church, found herself hated and disliked by everyone. Even the Pope, who had a quarrel with her husband, did not treat her warmly; and the nobles, who had taken {{possession}} of the abbey lands, were determined never to let her restore them. Her husband did not love her, or like England. However, he persuaded her to help him in a war with the French, with which England out to have had nothing to do, and the consequence was that a brave French duke took the city of Calais, the very last possession of the English in France. Mary was so exceedingly grieved, that she said that when she died the name of Calais would be found written on her heart.|$|E
60|$|Well, the {{soldiers}} were there close by--there was no use trying to resist--so we followed the servant up; but {{when he tried to}} beguile us into a drawing-room, Livy drew the line; she wouldn't go in. And she wouldn't stay up there, either. She said the princess might come in at any moment and catch us, and it would be too infernally ridiculous for anything. So we went down stairs again--to my unspeakable regret. For it was too darling a comedy to spoil. I was hoping and praying the princess would come, and catch us up there, and that those other Americans who were expected would arrive, and be taken for impostors by the portier, and shot by the sentinels--and then it would all go into the papers, and be cabled all over the world, and make an immense stir and be perfectly lovely. And by that time the princess would discover that we were not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>ones,</b> and the Minister of War would be ordered out, and the garrison, and they would come for us, and there would be another prodigious time, and that would get cabled too, and--well, Joe, I {{was in a state of}} perfect bliss. But happily, oh, so happily, that big portier wouldn't let us out--he was sorry, but he must obey orders--we must go back up stairs and wait. Poor Livy--I couldn't help but enjoy her distress. She said we were in a fix, and how were we going to explain, if the princess should arrive before the rightful Americans came? We went up stairs again--laid off our wraps, and were conducted through one drawing room and into another, and left alone there and the door closed upon us.|$|E
