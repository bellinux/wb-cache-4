5|$|Parentage : The Apollodorus {{responsible}} for the Library lists Troilus last of Priam and Hecuba's sons – a detail adopted in the later tradition – but then adds that {{it is said that}} the boy was fathered by Apollo. On the other hand, Hyginus includes Troilus {{in the middle of a}} list of Priam's sons without further comment. In the early Christian writings the Clementine Homilies, it is suggested that Apollo was Troilus' lover rather <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father.</b>|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government {{more or less}} formally into the divine monarchy he believed it to be. By moving the centre of power to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured his own family members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Louis VIII died in 1226, {{leaving his}} 12-year-old son, Louis IX, to inherit the throne, {{supported}} by a regency government. The young French King was in a much weaker position <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> and faced opposition {{from many of the}} French nobility who still maintained their ties to England, leading to a sequence of revolts across the country. Against this background, in late 1228 a group of potential Norman and Angevin rebels called upon Henry to invade and reclaim his inheritance, and Peter de Dreux, the Duke of Brittany, openly revolted against Louis and gave his homage to Henry.|$|E
25|$|In {{mind and}} manner he {{is a strange}} replica of <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> with all <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> suddenness and awareness, and I should say, more <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> ability.|$|R

5000|$|... 408 BC: The Persian king, Darius II, {{decides to}} aid Sparta {{in the war}} and makes his son Cyrus a satrap. However, Cyrus starts {{collecting}} an army to benefit his own interests, rather <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's.</b>|$|R
5|$|Upon his {{accession}} to the imperial throne, Joseph ruled less land <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> had in 1740. Believing that the emperor must possess enough land {{to maintain the}} Empire's integrity, Maria Theresa, who was used to being assisted {{in the administration of}} her vast realms, declared Joseph to be her new co-ruler on 17 September 1765. From then on, mother and son had frequent ideological disagreements. The 22million gulden that Joseph inherited from his father was injected into the treasury. Maria Theresa had another loss in February 1766 when Haugwitz died. She gave her son absolute control over the military following the death of Count Leopold Joseph von Daun.|$|E
5|$|In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent {{obtained}} a position {{for him at}} the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father.</b> Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as {{the degree to which the}} firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Mundhir's arrest {{provoked}} a revolt led by his four sons, especially the eldest, Nu'man, a man described by John of Ephesus as even more capable and warlike <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father.</b> For two years, the Ghassanid army launched raids into the Byzantine provinces from their {{bases in the}} desert, even defeating and killing the Byzantine dux of Arabia in a battle at Bostra. Tiberius reacted by raising a Chalcedonian brother of Mundhir to the Ghassanid kingship. A large army with Magnus at its head was dispatched east to counter Nu'man and install his uncle as king. The latter was swiftly done, but the new king died after only twenty days. Magnus also had some success in subduing or subverting the allegiance of some minor Arab tribes away from the Ghassanids. Magnus died shortly before Tiberius's own death in August 582, and with Maurice's accession to the throne, Nu'man journeyed to Constantinople to achieve a reconciliation with Byzantium. Instead, he too was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death, quickly commuted to house arrest.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not in}} {{his mind}} to enlist save in the company and after being again assured of the corporal's protection, {{therefore}} he insisted on presenting himself as the old man's recruit rather <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> offering.|$|R
50|$|In {{his younger}} days he favoured soccer as his sport {{and it was}} only at the age of 14 that he began to play tennis, at his own insistence rather <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's,</b> who was adamant not to {{pressure}} his son into the sport.|$|R

5|$|Jackson won the Democratic primary with 48% of {{the vote}} to Jones's 39%, with the rest {{of the vote}}s {{scattered}} among the other three candidates. The Republicans nominated Thomas Somer. Since the district was overwhelmingly Democratic, Jackson was the favorite for the December 12, 1995 special election. Jackson won the general election with 76% of the vote; his victory was widely anticipated. Upon his victory, Jackson made it known he would be a liberal voice in opposition to Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich. He took office on December 15, 1995. Jackson was perceived as less charismatic <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> and less credentialed than his predecessor, but his family pedigree was expected to help him politically. In August 1996, Somer withdrew from a rematch leaving Jackson with no major party opposition in the November 1996 general election. As a result, Jackson received 94% of the vote in the general election.|$|E
5|$|The Regent let his ministers {{take full}} charge of {{government}} affairs, playing a far lesser role <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father.</b> The {{principle that the}} prime minister was the person supported by {{a majority in the}} House of Commons, whether the king personally favoured him or not, became established. His governments, with little help from the Regent, presided over British policy. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned Catholic emancipation, the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales was expected to support the Whig leader, William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville. He did not, however, immediately put Lord Grenville and the Whigs into office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.|$|E

60|$|This {{child was}} educated in an {{hereditary}} hate of the Dacre family. His uncle was daily painted as a tyrant, whom he classed in his young mind with Phalaris or Dionysius. There {{was nothing that}} he felt keener <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> wrongs, and nothing which he believed more certain <b>than</b> <b>his</b> uncle's wickedness. He arrived at his thirteenth year when <b>his</b> <b>father</b> died, and {{he was to be}} consigned to the care of that uncle.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, {{he married}} his wife Leonore (1904-1973) {{who was also}} a biologist. They would become {{acclaimed}} as a husband and wife research team in Turkey.

25|$|During Sarkozy's childhood, {{his father}} founded his own {{advertising}} agency and became wealthy. The {{family lived in}} a mansion owned by Sarkozy's maternal grandfather, Benedict Mallah, in the 17th Arrondissement of Paris. The family later moved to Neuilly-sur-Seine, {{one of the wealthiest}} communes of the Île-de-France région immediately west of Paris. According to Sarkozy, his staunchly Gaullist grandfather was more of an influence on him <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> whom he rarely saw. Sarkozy was raised Catholic.|$|E
25|$|The 12th Earl {{exercised}} a much tighter grip {{on power}} in the region <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> dominating parliamentary representation at every election. It was Darras's turn again in 1404, when he was sent to Parliament with John Burley, another lawyer who worked mainly for the Fitzalans and who had fought alongside Darras in the naval campaign of 1387. Burley had also held the wardship of Robert Corbet, the heir of Sir Roger and nephew of Joan.|$|E

He {{was established in}} Mantua by 1683, where he worked both as a musician and a violin maker.

His style is more fluid <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's,</b> demonstrating a reaction against Wang Xizhi's calligraphy. Amongst his innovations is the one-stroke cursive script, which blends all characters in the writing in a single stroke. Until the Tang Dynasty his influence and reputation rivaled and even surpassed that of <b>his</b> <b>father.</b>|$|R
25|$|Amenhotep II (sometimes called Amenophis II {{and meaning}} Amun is Satisfied) was the seventh Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Egypt. Amenhotep {{inherited}} a vast kingdom {{from his father}} Thutmose III, and held it {{by means of a}} few military campaigns in Syria; however, he fought much less <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> and his reign saw the effective cessation of hostilities between Egypt and Mitanni, the major kingdoms vying for power in Syria. His reign is usually dated from 1427 to 1401 BC.|$|E
25|$|Philip {{was more}} {{religious}} <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> and {{was convinced that}} if the Protestants were resorting to military force, then he must do likewise.

Philip succeeded three times with popes Urban VII, Gregory XIV, and Innocent IX. But the fourth time, he failed to prevent the election of the pro-French Clement VIII.|$|E

25|$|Zeus came {{to learn}} from either Themis or Prometheus, after Heracles had {{released}} him from Caucasus, that, like his father Cronus, {{one of his sons}} would overthrow him. Another prophecy stated that a son of the sea-nymph Thetis, with whom Zeus fell in love after gazing upon her in the oceans off the Greek coast, would become greater <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father.</b> Possibly for one or both of these reasons, Thetis was betrothed to an elderly human king, Peleus son of Aiakos, either upon Zeus' orders, or because she wished to please Hera, who had raised her.|$|E

Less {{than a year after}} al-Mutawakkil's accession, however, the chief judge suffered a debilitating stroke that left him partially paralyzed, and his son Muhammad was forced to take up the actual discharge of his duties. Muhammad proved to be less influential <b>than</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> and the family's standing declined as al-Mutawakkil spent the next several years taking hostile steps against the Mu'tazilites, dismissing a number of Ibn Abi Du'ad's qadis from office and ordering an end to debate over the nature of the Qur'an.|$|E

He was assassinated by adherents of Nawab Zaman Khan, an influential chieftain who resented the favour shown by Shah Shuja to his rival Naib Aminullah Khan. One of the assassins was Shah Shuja's godson, Shuja' al-Daula.
