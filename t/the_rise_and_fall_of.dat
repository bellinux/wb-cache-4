5|$|The show {{is about}} <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> a relationship, juxtaposing a couple, Mark (Robert Bathurst) and Becky (Fiona Gillies), who meet {{and fall in}} love before getting {{separated}} and finally divorced.

Some of the first series followed a non-linear dual structure, contrasting the rise of the relationship with the separation. Other episodes were ensemble farces, predominantly including the couple's friends Robert (Paul Raffield) and Tracy (Tracie Bennett). Paul Mark Elliott also appeared as Trevor, Becky's lover.|$|E
