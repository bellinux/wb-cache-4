5|$|In January 1894, the Fasci were outlawed and brutally {{repressed}} on {{the orders}} of Prime Minister Francesco Crispi. Many leaders were put in jail; Cascioferro fled to Tunis for a year. After serving his sentence {{for his role in}} the peasant unrest, Cascioferro returned to a position of social power and pressured authorities in Palermo <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> charge of granting emigration permits in the district of Corleone. According to Mafia historian Salvatore Lupo, Cascioferro was involved in clandestine emigration networks.|$|E
5|$|Keith Miller {{was called}} to South Africa as {{emergency}} cover, but luckily for the Australias, there were almost two months of warm-up matches before the Tests started. Johnston recovered {{in time for the}} final tour match before the Tests, a match against a South African XI, effectively a full-strength Test team. Johnston took 2/81 in his only innings but it was enough for captain Lindsay Hassett <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Test team.|$|E

He attended a Catholic boarding school with Le Puy-en-Velay and caused a scandal by taking part in communion without being baptized. His parents withdrew him from the boarding school <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> school in Ambert.|$|E

5|$|Bakshi {{recognized}} Kricfalusi's talent, {{and wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{charge of a}} project that would showcase the young animator's skills. Bakshi and Kricfalusi co-wrote the screenplay Bobby's Girl as a take on the teen films of the era. Jeff Sagansky, president of production at TriStar Pictures, put up $150,000 to develop the project, prompting Bakshi {{to move back to}} Los Angeles. When Sagansky left TriStar, Bakshi was forced to pitch the film again, but the studio's new executives did not understand its appeal and cut off financing. Bakshi and Zingarelli began to develop a feature about Hollywood's Golden Age, and Bakshi Productions crewmembers worked on proposed cartoons influenced by pulp fiction. Bobby's Girl was reworked as a potential prime time series called Suzy's in Love, but attracted no serious interest.|$|E
5|$|During the May 21, 2001 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, he {{suffered}} a legitimate and career-threatening injury. In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, {{he suffered a}} tear in his left quadriceps muscle, causing it to come completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He even allowed Jericho <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E
5|$|Zoldak {{was moved}} to a relief role {{full-time}} for the 1949 Cleveland Indians season {{due to a lack}} of depth with the departures of Ed Klieman and Russ Christopher. On July 27, Zoldak managed to hit his only career home run against the New York Yankees off Ed Lopat. However, the game was rained out, and the only home run of his career was erased. In 27 games that season, Zoldak had a 12 record with a 4.25 ERA. Zoldak had struggled in spring training the prior year due to both being out of shape and a lack of pitching control, but was impressive enough in 1950 after losing the weight and regaining his control that manager Lou Boudreau decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the starting rotation to begin the year. He pitched poorly in his first starts, and was placed back in the bullpen for the rest of the year; Indians management considered demoting him to the minor leagues, and would have been sent to the San Diego Padres in May if not for the intervention of Johnny Berardino, who wanted to play on the west coast and agreed to a demotion instead. Zoldak spent the full season with Cleveland, and had a 42 record and a 3.96 ERA in 33 games.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of Hogwarts, the four founders {{hand-picked}} students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the most appropriate house. The student's own choices may affect the decision: the clearest example is the Hat telling Harry that he would do well in Slytherin in the first book, but ultimately selecting Gryffindor after Harry asks it not <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Slytherin.|$|E
25|$|When King Charles {{was brought}} to trial, Burges was the foremost, at great {{personal}} risk, in protesting against the proceeding with his usual freedom and vigour. On 14 January 1649, the day preceding that on which the king was brought from Windsor to be arraigned before the high court of justice, Burges preached at Mercers' Chapel, denouncing the measure in the strongest terms. He and his friends had taken up {{the cause of the}} parliament, as he declared in the 'Vindication', published while the trial was in progress, 'not to bring his majesty to justice (as some now speak), but <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a better capacity to do justice'.|$|E
25|$|Allen Craig was {{the hero}} in Game 1 of the World Series, {{singling}} off Alexi Ogando {{to break a}} 2–2 tie. The Cards managed to win. The next day, Craig was almost the hero again when he singled off Ogando {{for the second straight}} night. The Rangers came back to win, 2–1, though, for Jason Motte's only blown save of the postseason. The next game, Albert Pujols went 5-for-6 with three home runs <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> company with Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players to hit three homers in a World Series game. Pujols also set a record with 14 total bases, hits in four consecutive innings, and tied a Series record with five hits, total bases, RBIs, and runs scored in one game.|$|E

25|$|In 1889 Sir Henry Loch was {{appointed}} high commissioner and governor of Cape Colony after succeeding Sir Hercules Robinson. In 1890 Sir Gordon Sprigg, the premier of the colony, resigned, {{and a government}} under Rhodes was formed. Prior {{to the formation of}} this ministry, and while Sir Gordon Sprigg was still in office, Hofmeyr had approached Rhodes and offered <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> office as a Bond nominee, but the offer was declined. When Rhodes was invited to take office after the downfall of the Sprigg ministry, however, he asked the Bond leaders to meet him and discuss the situation. His policy of customs and railway unions between the various states when added to the personal esteem which many Dutchmen at the time had for him, enabled him to undertake and to successfully carry out the business of government.|$|E
25|$|Born in Rochester, New York, Wang is {{the second}} of three sons of {{immigrants}} from Taiwan of waishengren heritage. His father, a pediatrician, and his mother, moved to the United States to further their college studies in the early 1960s. Influenced by his older brother, Leo Wang, who had been taking violin lessons since he was seven, Wang began to develop a curious interest towards the violin and its musical counterparts when he was three. He begged his mother <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> violin lessons with his brother but his mother was against it, reasoning {{that he was too}} young. When Wang turned six, his mother enrolled him in violin classes, performing along with his brother. As he became a teenager, he began taking piano lessons, also teaching himself the guitar. He also worked several jobs to earn money to buy a second hand drum kit.|$|E
25|$|In retirement, Brabham {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} motorsport events, appearing at contemporary and historic motorsport events around the world where he often drove his former Cooper and Brabham cars until the early 2000s. In 1999, after competing at the Goodwood Revival at the age of 73 he commented that driving stopped him getting old. Despite a large accident at the 2000 Revival, the first racing accident <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> hospital overnight, he {{continued to}} drive until at least 2004. By the late 2000s, ill-health was preventing him from driving in competition. In addition to the deafness caused by years of motor racing without adequate ear protection, his eyesight was reduced due to macular degeneration and he had kidney disease for which by 2009 he was receiving dialysis three times a week. Nonetheless, that year he attended a celebration of the 50th anniversary of his first world championship at the Phillip Island Classic festival of motorsport, and in 2010 flew to Bahrain with most of the other Formula One world Drivers' Champions for a celebration of 60 years of the Formula One world championship. Brabham was the oldest surviving F1 champion.|$|E

25|$|Tebow started against Kentucky despite {{suffering}} from a respiratory illness and taking two bags of intravenous fluids before the game. He ran for two touchdowns <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> 2nd place on the all-time SEC touchdown list and he also threw for a touchdown. Late in the third quarter, he {{was hit in the}} chest by Kentucky defensive end Taylor Wyndham, fell backwards, and hit {{the back of his head}} on the knee of Florida tackle Marcus Gilbert, who was wearing a hard knee brace. Upon impact, Tebow briefly displayed a prominent fencing response with his left arm, indicating that a concussion had taken place. He lay motionless for several minutes before being helped to the sidelines, where he vomited. He was taken by ambulance to the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center. A CT scan showed no bleeding in the brain, with the injury described as a mild concussion. Coach Urban Meyer stayed the night in the hospital with Tebow, who was discharged in the morning. Coincidentally, Florida did not have a game scheduled for the following Saturday, and Tebow was cleared to play in the Gators' next contest at LSU on October 10, two weeks after the incident.|$|E
25|$|Raiden {{appears in}} the latest installment, Mortal Kombat X. During the Neatherrealm war Raiden and Fujin team up to take down a horde of demons and {{come face to face}} with some of the Defenders Raiden lost in the {{previous}} game that are now under Quan Chi's control. They manage to defeat Shinnok and lock him in an amulet thanks to Johnny Cage's unlocked power. During a confrontation with Quan Chi in his fortress, he is not only able to resurrect a mortally wounded Johnny with Sonya's help, but he is also able to resurrect Jax, Scorpion, and Sub-Zero by combining his magic with his, giving him hope that he can save the other fallen Earthrealm warriors. Years later he catches Kung Lao's cousin Kung Jin stealing a statue from his temple given to him from Jin's family. Raiden allows Jin to beat him in a fight to release his anger on Raiden for his involvement in Kung Lao's death, and encourages the young warrior to join the Shaolin Monks. Another couple of years later, Raiden finds that Shinnok's amulet has been stolen, and he and the new Earthrealm Defenders work to stop Shinnok from being freed. After conversing with Bo' Rai Cho over his regret of losing Liu Kang and Kung Lao and reminiscing an older mission, he is attacked by Shinnok and his corrupted former allies. The revenants badly injure Raiden allowing Shinnok to hold him prisoner and take over the Jinsei Chamber. Shinnok is later stopped by Johnny's daughter Cassie. After which, Raiden requests Kung Jin and Cassie <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Jinsei Chamber, where he purifies it while drawing energy from Shinnok. In the epilogue, Raiden now appears in a darker form similar to his appearance in Deception and Armageddon and warns the new Neatherrealm rulers, Liu Kang and Kitana, that he will show no mercy to anyone who threatens Earthrealm, and gives them Shinnok's decapitated but still living head to prove his point.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} best known for the {{introduction}} of recurring character Elim Garak. Fields said of the character at the time, [...] "we didn't want to make him an out and out spy, because then what would you do with him after the episode? You'd have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> jail on Bajor. So we tread a pretty thin line." [...] Fields had decided when creating the character that the station needed a Cardassian on-board and when no-one objected to his suggestion <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a tailor shop, that became Garak's profession. This was a reference to The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which used a tailor shop as a front, as Fields had begun his writing career on that series. Andrew Robinson had originally been considered for the part of Odo, {{and was one of the}} final three actors vying for the part alongside Gerrit Graham and René Auberjonois. Robinson was invited back to audition for Garak, while Graham was cast as the Hunter in [...] "Captive Pursuit".|$|E

500|$|Kubo {{has stated}} that Ichigo's {{greatest}} strength is his considerate and thoughtful nature; he always thinks about other's needs.

When asked in an interview {{if he had any}} plans to focus on the love triangle between Ichigo, Orihime, and Rukia, Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it as he didn't want to focus on romance.
