25|$|Sonnino's uncompromising {{severity}} towards others {{proved to}} be an obstacle to form his own government for a long time. Nevertheless, Sonnino served twice briefly as Prime Minister. On 8 February 1906 Sonnino formed his first government, which lasted only three months; on 18 May 1906, after a mere 100 days, he was forced to resign. He proposed major changes to transform Southern Italy, which provoked opposition from the ruling groups. Land taxes were to be reduced by one-third, except for <b>the</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> landowners. He also proposed the establishment of provincial banks and to subsidize schools. His reforms provoked opposition from the ruling groups. He was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti.|$|E

500|$|Under Walsh's management, Diageo {{has been}} careful to [...] "manage for value", {{and to avoid}} overpaying for assets. According to Nick Goodway of The Independent, Walsh [...] "has been canny in {{allowing}} others to bid for <b>the</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> rivals and then pick up the brands that fall out of those deals cheaply". Walsh has been criticised for his decision to exit the Indian spirits market in 2002 by disposing of Gilbey's Green Label, a strategy which he reversed in 2012 with the acquisition of a stake in United Spirits. David Wighton commented in The Times that Diageo's acquisition of United Spirits had seen the company's owner, Vijay Mallya, [...] "utterly outmanoeuvred by a canny rival prepared to play the long game." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the early}} guided summiters, Richard Bass (of Seven Summits fame) responded in an {{interview}} about Everest climbers and {{what it took to}} survive there, [...] "Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt <b>the</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> mountains. People don't realise the difference between a 20,000-foot mountain and 29,000 feet. It's not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—an exponential curve. People climb Denali [...] or Aconcagua [...] and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here, I’m going to try Everest.' But it's not like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{fundamental}} flaw of 'War Horse' is that Nick Stafford, {{who wrote}} the script 'in association' (that's how the credit reads) with South Africa's Handspring Puppet Company, has taken a book that was written for children and tried {{to give it the}} expressive weight of a play for adults. Not surprisingly, Mr. Morpurgo's plot can't stand the strain. Dramatic situations that work perfectly well {{in the context of the}} book play like Hollywood clichés onstage. In the first act, the craftsmanship is so exquisite that this doesn't matter—much—but things go downhill fast after intermission. <b>The</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> problem is the last scene, about which, once again, the drama critics' code commands silence. This much must be said, though: A play that is so forthright about the horrors of war owes its audience a more honest ending." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second innings began {{a little}} better: following-on {{for the second}} time in the series, the top order worked harder, and built some {{reasonable}} partnerships. Atherton made 63 before succumbing to the wiles of May and dragging himself too far from safety, offering a stumping chance of the type that Healy rarely missed. Stewart top-scored with 78, and all the specialist batsmen made starts. [...] None, however, could convert that into <b>the</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> score that England needed from them to have a chance of saving the match. [...] Hussain was left stranded with the tail, but neither he nor the bowlers could make any impression, and they got seriously bogged down. Hussain's 18 not out took nearly two hours to compile, and the 16 that he and Caddick added together for the seventh wicket almost an hour.|$|E

Describing the album as involving, [...] "a bit too much computer", he identifies its highlight as [...] "Berufsjugendlich" [...] ("Professional Teen") which is, [...] "so smart that you have to laugh", with a lyric which, [...] "takes the wind out of the sails of any critic".

2500|$|In a November 2014, {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Reubens explained why the film {{took so long}} to be made, saying: [...] "I think part of what happened with this project is it got leaked probably {{a year and a half}} or two years before we really wanted anyone to know about it. I was doing a Q somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, [...] "Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?" [...] The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn’t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and—I don’t really know the answer. I think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it's just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, and we now have such an amazing company involved, and that's <b>the</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> announcement that hasn’t been made yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was not {{selected}} in the first 4 rounds of the draft, where he was projected to go by some. Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't want {{to be one of those}} running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. I want to make sure I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I would say I fit in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson is kind of like the super-fast one, and LenDale White is like <b>the</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> one. I would kind of be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E
