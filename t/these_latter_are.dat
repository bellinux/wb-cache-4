25|$|These demonstratives (as stem forms) {{can have}} masculine, {{feminine}} and non-singular forms (and as such are pronominal) {{as well as}} case forms. Í- 'here, this' and se/si- 'there, that (not too far away)' take the gender/number morphemes as suffixes, and the other demonstratives take them as prefixes. Note that ka- 'non-specifically here' and kai- 'there in the distance in a non-specific position' cannot appear with the gender/number morphemes, as <b>these</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> specific by their nature. Í- and se/si- also take an article forming affix -bi to become demonstrative articles (e.g. KLY senuubi kaazi, KKY senaubi kaz 'that boy', KLY senaabi kaazi, KKY senabi kaz 'that girl', KLY sepalab kaazi, KKY sepalbi kaz 'those two children', sethabi kœzil 'those children').|$|E

2500|$|In the {{broadest}} and {{most widely used}} sense, an introduced species is synonymous with non-native and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms; these adequately fit the basic definition given above. However, some sources add to that basic definition [...] "and are now reproducing in the wild", which removes from consideration as introduced species that were raised or grown in gardens or farms that do not survive without tending by people. With respect to plants, <b>these</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> in this case defined as either ornamental or cultivated plants.|$|E
2500|$|The Republic of Ireland {{is often}} {{referred}} to by the Nationalist and Republican communities by the term [...] "the Twenty-six Counties", with the connotation that the state constituted as such forms only a portion of the ideal political unit of the Irish Republic, which would consist of all of the thirty-two counties into which the island is divided. [...] The term [...] "the Six Counties" [...] (of Northern Ireland) is also used. Other Nationalist terms in use include [...] "the North of Ireland" [...] and [...] "the North". <b>These</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> terms also used by the Irish national broadcaster RTÉ. [...] More extreme terms for Northern Ireland include [...] "the occupied six counties" [...] or [...] "occupied Ireland", which are often used by people who reject the idea of Northern Ireland as a separate entity from the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|For fear of discrimination, some {{fled to the}} {{mountains}} after World War II while many others changed their names in the attempts to assimilate. Many were also killed (c. 10,000 Japanese Mestizos and Japanese) while others were deported {{as an act of}} retaliation. Their Japanese identity may take on extremes, some have completely lost their Japanese identity while others have [...] "returned" [...] to Japan, the homeland of their forebears. There is also a number of contemporary Japanese-mestizos, not associated with the history of the earlier established ones, born either in the Philippines or Japan. <b>These</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> the resultant of unions between Filipinos and recent Japanese immigrants to the Philippines or Japanese and immigrant Filipino workers in Japan. Most Japanese mestizos speak Tagalog and/or other Philippine languages. They may also be known as Japinos, although this term is considered derogatory by many. There are believed to be between 100,000 and 200,000 Japanese-mestizos in the country, but no accurate figure is currently available. Thousands of war-displaced ethnic Japanese still live in the country and are denied recognition as Japanese nationals in order to return to Japan.|$|E

60|$|Cirri.--First pair {{remote from}} the second; their rami nearly equal, and about {{one third of the}} length of the rami of the second cirrus; thickly clothed with bristles: rami of the second cirrus of equal thickness, but little shorter than those of the sixth cirrus; the three or four basal {{segments}} of the anterior ramus are thickly clothed with spines; the other segments, and all the segments on the third pair, resemble the segments of the three posterior pair. <b>These</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> elongated, not protuberant, and support eight pairs of spines with very minute intermediate spines; those in the dorsal tufts are numerous and long.|$|E
60|$|Caudal Appendages (Pl. IV, fig. 8 a´, f), multiarticulate, thin, tapering, in one {{specimen}} equalling, {{in another}} just exceeding, in length the pedicels {{of the sixth}} cirrus. In the latter specimen there were thirteen segments, of which the basal segments were broader and shorter than the upper; <b>these</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> slightly constricted round the middle, so that they resemble, in a small degree, an hour-glass. Their upper margins are surrounded by rings of bristles; the terminal segment being surmounted by one or two very fine bristles much longer than the others. The two appendages are closely approximate; each arises from a narrow elongated slip, attached {{to the side of}} the pedicel of the sixth cirrus.|$|E
60|$|Accomplished {{literature}} {{is all very}} well in its way, no doubt, but much more fascinating to the contemplative man are the books {{that have not been}} written. <b>These</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> no trouble to hold; there are no pages to turn over. One can read them in bed on sleepless nights without a candle. Turning to another topic, primitive man in the works of the descriptive anthropologist is certainly a very entertaining and quaint person, but the man of the future, if we only had the facts, would appeal to us more strongly. Yet where are the books? As Ruskin has said somewhere, à propos of Darwin, it is not what man has been, but what he will be, that should interest us.|$|E

All these scales are dentated, the upper rows most plainly and only on their basal margins; the lower little beads are very slightly crenated round their entire margins; they are mingled with star-headed spines (fig. 3 e) of yellow chitine. Basal calcareous discs thin, plainly marked exteriorly by concentric lines of growth, and covered by the usual yellow membrane, including the horny, spindle-shaped bodies.|$|E

"The printed {{information}} hitherto extant [in {{regard to}} the Corporation of Trinity House] {{is limited to the}} charter of confirmation granted by James the Second (with the minor concession, by Charles the Second, of Thames Ballastage) and a compilation from the records of the Corporation down to 1746, by its then secretary, Mr Whormby, supplemented by a memoir drawn up, in 1822, by Captain Joseph Cotton, then Deputy-master. But the data of <b>these</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> necessarily imperfect, as the destruction by fire, in 1714, of the house in Water Lane had already involved a disastrous loss of documentary evidence, leaving much to be inferentially traced from collateral records of Admiralty and Navy Boards. These, however, sufficiently attest administrative powers and protective influence scarcely inferior to the scope of those departments." ...|$|E
60|$|Variability of Birds, and {{especially}} of their secondary Sexual Characters.—Variability and inheritance are {{the foundations for}} the work of selection. That domesticated birds have varied greatly, their variations being inherited, is certain. That birds in a state of nature present individual differences is admitted by every one; and that they have sometimes been modified into distinct races, is generally admitted.[178] Variations are of two kinds, which insensibly graduate into each other, namely, slight differences between {{all the members of the}} same species, and more strongly-marked deviations which occur only occasionally. <b>These</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> rare with birds in a state of nature, and it is very doubtful whether they have often been preserved through selection, and then transmitted to succeeding generations.[179] Nevertheless, it may be worth while to give the few cases relating chiefly to colour (simple albinism and melanism being excluded), which I have been able to collect.|$|E

60|$|The {{indication}} of {{character in a}} woman who had so little opportunity of independent action, is worth noting, as it serves to mark the spirit in which her children would be reared, and to explain why the sons so entirely fell short of all that was greatest and noblest in their father. The devotion, honor, and generosity, that made the iron of his composition bright as well as hard, was utterly wanting in them, or merely appeared in passing inconsistencies, and it is but too likely that they derived no gentler training from their mother. There were ten children, four sons and six daughters, but the names of <b>these</b> <b>latter,</b> <b>are</b> very difficult to distinguish, as Adela, Atheliza, Adelheid, or Alix, was a sort of feminine of Atheling, a Princess-Royal title, and was applied to most of the eldest daughters of the French and German-princes, or, when the senior was dead, or married, to the surviving eldest.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} shown from many facts that the largest amount of life can be {{supported}} on each area, by great diversification or divergence in the structure and constitution of its inhabitants. We have, also, seen that the continued production of new forms through natural selection, which implies that each new variety has some advantage over others, inevitably leads to the extermination of the older and less improved forms. <b>These</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> almost necessarily intermediate in structure, {{as well as in}} descent, between the last-produced forms and their original parent-species. Now, if we suppose a species to produce two or more varieties, and these in the course of time to produce other varieties, the principal of good being derived from diversification of structure will generally lead to the preservation of the most divergent varieties; thus the lesser differences characteristic of varieties come to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species, and, by the extermination of the older intermediate forms, new species end by being distinctly defined objects. Thus, also, we shall see how it is that organic beings can be classed by what is called a natural method in distinct groups--species under genera, and genera under families.|$|E
6000|$|A narrow rim of {{the broad}} flat {{exterior}} part of each lobe is turned inwards, so that, when the lobes are closed, the exterior surfaces of the infolded portions come into contact. The edge itself bears a row of conical, flattened, transparent points with broad bases, like the prickles on the stem of a bramble or Rubus. As the rim is infolded, these points are directed towards the midrib, and they appear at first {{as if they were}} adapted to prevent the escape of prey; but this can hardly be their chief function, for they are composed of very delicate and highly flexible membrane, which can be easily bent or quite doubled back without being cracked. Nevertheless, the infolded rims, together with the points, must somewhat interfere with the retrograde movement of any small creature, as soon as the lobes begin to close. The circumferential part of the leaf of Aldrovanda thus differs greatly from that of Dionaea; nor can the points on the rim be considered as homologous with the spikes round the leaves of Dionaea, as <b>these</b> <b>latter</b> <b>are</b> prolongations of the blade, and not mere epidermic productions. They appear also to serve for a widely different purpose. [page 325] ...|$|E
