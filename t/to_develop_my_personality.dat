First and {{foremost}} I {{would like to}} thank Elizabeth Richmond-Garza, whose intellectual engagement and passion for literary studies inspired me to pursue this degree in the first place. She has, for many years, been a challenging, thoughtful, and patient advisor who has consistently pushed me <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>my</b> often eccentric ideas into intelligible work. Katherine Arens has also been a huge inspiration; her academic rigor, wicked sense of humor, and practical advice have been essential to my sustained enthusiasm for the study of comparative literature. The opportunity to work closely with Peg Syverson in the Computer Writing and Research Lab was a highlight of my graduate experience at UT. My work took new directions in the lab, allowing me to work in a stimulating atmosphere and to explore different ways of incorporating computer technologies into literary studies and pedagogy.
