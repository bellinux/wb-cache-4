People, who {{went in search of}} <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> found <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> grazing at the present {{location}} of the monastery. The people of the area then worshipped <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and the location where it was found and venerated it every year. Eventually, to honour the sacred site, the Tawang Monastery was built at the site.|$|E
5|$|Campaign school, Campagneschule or Campagne, where <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> learns {{collection}} and balance through all gaits, turns and maneuvers. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> learns to shorten and lengthen his stride, perform lateral movements to the side, and is {{introduced to the}} more complex double bridle. This is the longest training phase and may take several years.|$|E

5000|$|The frog {{is also an}} {{important}} part of <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> circulatory system [...] - [...] it pumps blood up <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> leg each time the frog makes contact with the ground. The blood flows down <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> leg into <b>the</b> digital cushion, a fibrous part of the inner hoof located just above the frog which contains a network of blood vessels. <b>The</b> <b>horse's</b> weight then compresses the frog on the ground, squeezing the blood out of the digital cushion, and pushing it back up <b>the</b> <b>horse's</b> legs.|$|R
5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient breast harness was <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> collar. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> collar was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 accurately displays the cushioned collar behind the cross bar. An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> collar as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E

The other demon is grabbing the reins of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen seated on a horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's hooves or their heads under Khandoba's knees.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Bowling {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} in <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> genome project.

50|$|In 1952 <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were {{discovered}} on Takarajima by Shigeyuki Hayashida, {{a professor of}} Kagoshima University, and designated <b>the</b> Tokara <b>horse.</b> It was theorized that <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were brought to Takarajima from Kikaijima around 1900. In 1953, <b>the</b> Tokara <b>horse</b> was designated a natural monument of Kagoshima. When Professor Hayashida first discovered <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> he counted 43. Their numbers gradually declined during the 1960s because of agricultural mechanization, however, and {{it was difficult to}} monitor the population on Takarajima. Therefore, some of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were transferred to the Mt. Kaimon Natural Park and Iriki Farm, part of the agricultural department of Kagoshima University.|$|R

5|$|Sports such as polo do {{not judge}} <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> itself, but rather use <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{as a partner}} for human {{competitors}} as {{a necessary part of}} the game. Although <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task. Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other, and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.|$|E

5|$|The fossils {{from near}} Santa Fé {{included}} <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> tooth which had puzzled Darwin {{as it had}} been previously thought that horses had only come to the Americas in the 16th century, close to a Toxodon tooth and a tooth of Mastodon andium (now Cuvieronius hyodon). Owen confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> tooth was of an extinct South American species which he named Equus curvidens, and its age was confirmed by a corroded horse tooth among the Punta Alta fossils. This discovery was later explained as part of the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A troika (тройка, [...] "triplet" [...] or [...] "trio") is a {{traditional}} Russian harness driving combination, using three horses abreast, usually pulling a sleigh. It differs from most other three-horse combinations in that <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> are harnessed abreast. <b>The</b> middle <b>horse</b> is usually harnessed in a horse collar and shaft bow; <b>the</b> side <b>horses</b> are usually in breastcollar harness. The troika is traditionally driven so that <b>the</b> middle <b>horse</b> trots and <b>the</b> side <b>horses</b> canter; <b>the</b> right-hand <b>horse</b> {{will be on the}} right lead and <b>the</b> left-hand <b>horse</b> on <b>the</b> left lead.

5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> had been poisoned. He stated that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, the {{assumptions}} and theories developed by historians are not definitive, and debate still rages on many issues, {{such as the}} breeding or size of <b>the</b> <b>horse,</b> {{and a number of}} sources must be consulted {{in order to understand the}} breadth of the subject.|$|E
5|$|Domestication of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{most likely}} {{took place in}} central Asia prior to 3500 BC. Two major sources of {{information}} are used to determine where and when <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.|$|E
2500|$|The modern law of {{conversion}} crystallised after {{the case of}} Fouldes v Willoughby , [...] Two <b>horses</b> owned by <b>the</b> plaintiff were placed on a river ferry. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> were put back on the shore by the defendant ferryman. The plaintiff/owner of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> remained on <b>the</b> ferry and subsequently lost <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b> It was held {{that this was a}} trespass, but not a conversion, since there was no interference with the plaintiff's [...] "general right of domination" [...] over <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{decorated}} <b>horses</b> {{were originally}} those for Shinto priests (kannushi), twelve in number,　and in the Hosokawa clan period, only upper-class samurai families presented <b>horses.</b> <b>The</b> {{distance from the}} shrine to the otabisho (destination of　the parade) was short, and kannushi did not ride on <b>the</b> <b>horses.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> decorations on <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> became gradually gala and greater. The decorations on <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> were originally from the symbols of sexual organs. There had been two schools, but only Ando school has been observed. After the Meiji Restoration, decorated horses were prepared by town people, and recently <b>the</b> decorated <b>horses</b> number about 60.

500|$|By 1993, the Kuntz {{brothers}} had {{a herd of}} 150 horses, including those purchased from the park {{over the course of}} several auctions and their descendants. They used <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> mainly for ranching and endurance races. In 1993, the Nokota was declared the Honorary State Equine of the state of North Dakota. In 1994, researchers conducted a study of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> in <b>the</b> park and on the Kuntz's ranch, and discovered that none of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> in <b>the</b> park, and only about 20 on the ranch, had characteristics consistent with <b>the</b> Colonial Spanish <b>Horse.</b> Since then, <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> on <b>the</b> Kuntz ranch have been bred to maintain and improve their Spanish characteristics. In 1999, the Kuntz brothers founded <b>the</b> Nokota <b>Horse</b> Conservancy to protect and conserve <b>the</b> Nokota <b>horse.</b> <b>The</b> Nokota <b>Horse</b> Conservancy [...] tracks around 1,000 living and dead horses, and Nokota horses can be found throughout the United States.|$|R
