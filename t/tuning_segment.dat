Most recently BBS has engineered the Air Inside Technology (AIT) where hollow chambers are created within the wheel structure to compensate for the small air volume in modern ultra-low-profile tyres, reduce unsprung weight, improve handling dynamics, and increase fuel efficiency without sacrificing strength and rigidity. This innovation earned BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik the Automechanika Innovation Award 2006 in the <b>tuning</b> <b>segment.</b> [...] BBS entered into a technical cooperation agreement in 1990 with ASA, a Korean company that was starting wheel production.|$|E

40|$|Wavelength-tunable sampled grating {{distributed}} Bragg reflector (SG-DBR) lasers {{are used}} for telecommunications applications in which the laser is set to a communication channel and changed infrequently. SG-DBR lasers can be tuned to any wavelength over a 50 nm tuning range with fast transition times using a set of three control currents. This paper demonstrates generation of fast linear wavelength ramps covering the entire tuning range of the laser. Continuous and linear wavelength sweeps are achieved by applying three time synchronized waveforms to the front mirror, back mirror, and phase sections of the laser. Continuous wavelength coverage is achieved by appending 50 separate mode-hop-free <b>tuning</b> <b>segments.</b> The wavelength stitching transitions require a maximum of 60 ns for amplitude, wavelength, and thermal settling time to allow the laser and drive electronics to equilibrate. Full band wavelength ramps with 100 kHz repetition rates have been demonstrated. An example FMCW LIDAR application of this fast wavelength ramp is given...|$|R
5000|$|Celluloid dickeys {{were popular}} for their {{waterproof}} and stain-resistant properties. Unlike traditional cloth shirt-fronts, they remained sleek, bright white, {{and did not}} wilt or wrinkle. Celluloid dickeys simulated {{the look of a}} formal shirt bib for day and evening wear. They were designed in a variety of patents, such as: rounded, flat-end, no restraints, a restraint tab {{at the end of the}} bib or side straps that tied at the wearer's back. For this reason, they were popular with entertainers, musicians, and other performers. Nevertheless, they were frequently maligned and spoofed for their stiffness, unmanageability, and tendency to pop out of place. In one notable Looney <b>Tunes</b> <b>segment,</b> Bugs Bunny conducts an arrogant opera singer and makes him hold a note so long that his dickey snaps out of his waistcoat and rolls up to his throat. [...] "The flapping dickey", a famous Vaudeville cliché, involves a dickey which has been intentionally rigged to flap in a comical fashion.|$|R

40|$|Networks {{have become}} multipath: mobile devices have {{multiple}} radio interfaces, datacenters have redundant paths and multihoming {{is the norm}} for big server farms. Meanwhile, TCP is still only single-path. Is it possible to extend TCP to enable it to support multiple paths for current applications on today’s Internet? The answer is positive. We carefully review the constraints — partly due to various types of middleboxes — that inﬂuenced the design of Multipath TCP and show how we handled them to achieve its deployability goals. We report our experience in implementing Multipath TCP in the Linux kernel and we evaluate its performance. Our measurements focus on the algorithms needed to efﬁciently use paths with different characteristics, notably send and receive buffer <b>tuning</b> and <b>segment</b> reordering. We also compare the performance of our implementation with regular TCP on web servers. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from designing MPTCP...|$|R

40|$|Topological superconductors can host Majorana quasiparticles which {{supersede}} the fermion/boson dichotomy {{and offer}} a pathway to fault tolerant quantum computation. In one-dimensional systems zero-energy Majorana states are bound {{to the ends of}} the topologically superconducting regions. An experimental signature of a Majorana bound state is a conductance peak at zero source-drain voltage bias in a tunneling experiment. Here, we identify the bulk topological phase in a semiconductor nanowire coupled to a conventional superconductor. We map out its phase diagram through the dependence of zero-bias peak on the chemical potential and magnetic field. Our findings are consistent with calculations for a finite-length topological nanowire. Knowledge of the phase diagram makes it possible to predictably <b>tune</b> nanowire <b>segments</b> in and out of the topological phase, thus controlling the positions and couplings of multiple Majorana bound states. This ability is a prerequisite for Majorana braiding, an experiment in which Majorana quantum states are exchanged in order to both demonstrate their non-abelian character and realize topological quantum bits.

40|$|We devise in {{this paper}} a regression-based {{algorithm}}, called algorithm FTP-DS (Frequent Temporal Patterns of Data Streams), to mine frequent temporal patterns for data streams. While providing a general framework of pattern frequency counting, algorithm FTP-DS has two major features, namely one data scan for online statistics collection and regressionbased compact pattern representation. To attain the feature of one data scan, the data segmentation and the pattern growth scenarios are explored for the frequency counting purpose. Algorithm FTP-DS scans online transaction flows and generates candidate frequent patterns in real time. The second important feature of algorithm FTP-DS is on the regression-based compact pattern representation. Specifically, to meet the space constraint, we devise for pattern representation a compact ATF (standing for Accumulated Time and Frequency) form to aggregately comprise all the information required for regression analysis. In addition, we develop the techniques of the segmentation <b>tuning</b> and <b>segment</b> relaxation to enhance the functions of FTP-DS. With these features, algorithm FTP-DS is able to not only conduct mining with variable time intervals but also perform trend detection effectively.

40|$|The {{development}} of flexible fibers for {{the delivery of}} laser energy led to the first endoscopic laser applications in humans in the early 1970 s. Since that time, much has been learned about applications throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The risks appear to be minimal. The coagulative effect of laser energy is used to treat gastrointestinal hemorrhage and small, benign mucosal lesions. The ablative effect of the Nd:YAG laser on tissue is used for palliative therapy for malignant gastrointestinal disorders and incisional therapy for anatomic lesions such as strictures or cysts. New laser modalities that potentially can be <b>tuned</b> throughout large <b>segments</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum, new fiber-optic delivery systems with specialized tips and new methods of sensitizing tissue to laser energy all indicate that the endoscopic laser should continue to have many new and innovative applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we address}} the issue of {{recovering}} and segmenting the apparent velocity field in sequences of images. As for motion estimation, we minimize an objective function involving two robust terms. The first one cautiously captures the optical flow constraint, while the second (a priori) term incorporates a discontinuity-preserving smoothness constraint. To cope with the nonconvex minimization problem thus defined, we design an efficient deterministic multigrid procedure. It converges fast toward estimates of good quality, while revealing the large discontinuity structures of flow fields. We then propose an extension of the model by attaching to it a flexible object-based segmentation device based on deformable closed curves (different families of curve equipped with different kinds of prior can be easily supported). Experimental results on synthetic and natural sequences are presented, including an analysis of sensitivity to parameter <b>tuning.</b> Index Terms—Closed <b>segmenting</b> curve, incremental multiresolution, motion segmentation, multigrid nonconvex minimization, optical flow, robust estimators.

40|$|Figure 1 : An {{example of}} complex editing. The user uses one stroke to {{increase}} local contrast {{and another to}} increase local brightness on the original image (a). With just two strokes, our adaptive masking computes editing masks to the respective user-strokes as shown in (b) and (c), resulting the output image (d). Our paper focuses on producing high quality results in an efficient framework with low user intervention. Selective editing, also known as masking, is a common technique to create localized effects, such as color (hue, saturation) and tonal management, on images. Many current techniques require parameter tuning or many strokes to achieve suitable results. We propose a fast novel algorithm that requires minimal strokes and parameter <b>tuning</b> from users, <b>segments</b> the desired selection, and produces an adaptive feathered matte. Our approach consists of two steps: first, the algorithm extracts color similarities using radial basis functions; second, the algorithm segments the region the user selects to respect locality. Because of the linear complexity and simplicity in required user-input, the approach is suitable for multiple applications including mobile devices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} two current related {{projects}} on music and dementia are described. One {{is a project}} which culminated in a performance made up of memory jingles, {{some of which were}} algorithmically generated and developed for an early-stage dementia patient. She provided a list of her ordered daily activities and a description of one of her medication dosages. The daily activity list was rhythmically adjusted, and a tune was written to it, by a composer. However it is not possible for all people with dementia to have a “composer-in-residence”. Hence computer music techniques were also investigated towards some form of automation of composition. This algorithm was used to compose a tune for the medication description from the volunteer. A few weeks later she exhibited the ability to recall both tunes and words in multiple informal environments (including high pressure situations). The second project is a form of “research by production”. It details the making of a 60 minute BBC radio program which was produced in collaboration with people living with dementia and experts and carers. The program consisted of a mixture of <b>tunes</b> and documentary <b>segments.</b> These discussed various topic relating to dementia, radio and music (including an on the above memory jingles research). The structure of the program was designed {{in such a way as}} to make it more understandable to people living with dementias...|$|R
40|$|Aromatic tuning, i. e. {{repositioning}} aromatic residues {{found at}} the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane (TM) domains within bacterial receptors, has been previously shown to be {{an efficient way to}} modulate signal output from the aspartate chemoreceptor (Tar) and the major osmosensor EnvZ of Escherichia coli. In the case of Tar, changes in signal output consistent with the vertical position of the native Trp-Tyr aromatic tandem within TM 2 were observed. In contrast, within EnvZ, where a Trp-Leu-Phe aromatic triplet was repositioned, the surface that the triplet resided upon was shown to be the major determinant governing signal output. However, these previous studies failed to determine whether moving the aromatic residues within TM 2 of Tar or EnvZ was sufficient to physically reposition the TM helix within a membrane. Recent coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations predicted displacement of Tar TM 2 upon moving the aromatic residues at the cytoplasmic end of TM 2. Here, we have employed a glycosylation-mapping technique to demonstrate that repositioning the Trp-Tyr tandem within Tar TM 2 is sufficient to displace the C-terminal boundary of the helix relative to the membrane. In a similar analysis of EnvZ, an abrupt initial displacement of TM 2 was observed but no subsequent movement was seen, suggesting that the vertical position of TM 2 is not governed by the location of the Trp-Leu-Phe triplet. In summary, our results support recent CG-MD simulations with aromatically <b>tuned</b> Tar <b>segments</b> that demonstrated that the Trp-Tyr tandem is sufficient to displace TM 2 within a membrane. Our results also provide another set of experimental data, i. e. the resistance of EnvZ TM 2 to being displaced upon aromatic tuning, which could be useful for subsequent refinement of the initial CG-MD simulations. We suggest that differences observed between the behavior of helices are due to the inherently different properties of the residues being repositioned (i. e. Trp or Tyr versus Phe). Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methodologies, how moving flanking aromatic residues might impact steady-state signal output and the potential to employ aromatic tuning in other bacterial membrane-spanning receptors...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the IPHI project (High Intensity Proton Injector), the RFQ cavity is divided into 6 sections of 1 meter each, which are assembled in 3 coupled segments. We present the tuning procedure of the IPHI aluminium cold model, that is (i) adjusting coupling capacitances and dipole rods for optimum stability and (ii) tuning the 96 slugs to achieve constant inter-vane voltage. Fields inside RFQ quadrants are measured by a fully automated bead-pull system. Tuning this 6 -meter long cold model is a comprehensive training in view of the future tuning of the copper RFQ with the variable voltage profile. THE IPHI COLD MODEL A 6 -meter aluminum cold model has been built to validate the tuning procedure of the IPHI RFQ. To tune it, several devices have to be adjusted at different steps of machining and assembling. The cold model can be divided in 2 -meter long segments with capacitive coupling in-between which can be set by additional shims (Figure 1). The <b>tuning</b> of the <b>segment</b> end regions is made by machining the thickness of the end and coupling plates, and by dipole rods length adjustments. Finally, irregular tuners distribution and RF inputs will be used to achieve the setting of the inter-vane voltage. Here, we will work with 24 slug tuners and 2 RF ports (used as slugs) per quadrant for the tuning procedure of the model (Figure 2). Moreover a fully automated test bench has been developed to measure the field distribution [1]. Based on the perturbation method, a bead is guided successively through 4 quadrants and field distribution of excited mode is obtained. This test bench will be used to identify modes for the stability analysis and then for the tuning process of a constant voltage profile.
