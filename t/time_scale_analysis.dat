40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform a {{multiscale}} {{analysis of the}} food structuring process of the expansion of starchy snack foods like keropok, which obtains a solid foam structure. In particular, we want to investigate {{the validity of the}} hypothesis of Kokini and coworkers, that expansion is optimal at the moisture content, where the glass transition and the boiling line intersect. In our analysis we make use of several tools, (1) <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> <b>analysis</b> from the field of physical transport phenomena, (2) the scale separation map (SSM) developed within a multiscale simulation framework of complex automata, (3) the supplemented state diagram (SSD), depicting phase transition and glass transition lines, and (4) a multiscale simulation model for the bubble expansion. Results of the <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> <b>analysis</b> are plotted in the SSD, and give insight into the dominant physical processes involved in expansion. Furthermore, the results of the <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> <b>analysis</b> are used to construct the SSM, which has aided us {{in the construction of the}} multiscale simulation model. Simulation results are plotted in the SSD. This clearly shows that the hypothesis of Kokini is qualitatively true, but has to be refined. Our results show that bubble expansion is optimal for moisture content, where the boiling line for gas pressure of 4 bars intersects the isoviscosity line of the critical viscosity 10 (6) Pa. s, which runs parallel to the glass transition line...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for constructing differential equation models to answer prediction questions. A prediction question poses a hypothetical scenario {{and asks for}} the resulting behaviors of specific real-valued state variables (“quantities of interest”). A model for such a question should include only those aspects of the scenario relevant to the quantities of interest. Furthermore, it should include only as much detail as is necessary to answer the question. Some previous methods may build models that fail to relate the quantities {{of interest to the}} conditions of the scenario, while others have limited ability to exclude irrelevant aspects. Additionally, while many decisions on how much detail to include can be determined by an appropriate choice of the <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> of <b>analysis,</b> previous approaches require the question to provide this <b>time</b> <b>scale.</b> Our modeling algorithm overcomes these limitations by identifying the ways in which quantities of interest interact with conditions in the scenario.

We here review the results of such a framework for free-living marine nematodes. Although field experiments have illustrated substantial dispersal in nematodes at ecological <b>time</b> <b>scales,</b> <b>analysis</b> of the genetic diversity illustrated the importance of priority effects, founder effects and genetic bottlenecks for population structuring between patches < 1 km apart. In contrast, only little genetic structuring was observed within an estuary (< 50 km), indicating that these small scale fluctuations in genetic differentiation are stabilized over deeper <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> through extensive gene flow. Interestingly, nematode species with contrasting life histories (extreme colonizers vs persisters) or with different habitat preferences (algae vs sediment) show similar, low genetic structuring. Finally, historical events have shaped the genetic pattern of marine nematodes and show that gene flow is restricted at large geographical scales. We also discuss the presence of substantial cryptic diversity in marine nematodes, and end with highlighting future important steps to further unravel nematode evolution and diversity. </p...|$|R

Oscillations with periods of six months (semi-annual) and one year (annual) were identified in all records. Both annual and semi-annual oscillations are non-stationary in time. The dominant pattern of interannual to decadal variability, which captures the out of phase variations of temperature and wind speed with sea level pressure, shows a persistent 2 - 3 years oscillation. This oscillation is related with a wave-train atmospheric circulation pattern similar to the Pacific South American (PSA) modes. This suggests a tropical origin of this oscillation. The second pattern of interannual to decadal variability, which captures in-phase variations of these variables, shows enhanced variability at 5 - 6 year <b>time</b> <b>scales.</b> This oscillation is induced by the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) which shows enhanced variability at these <b>time</b> <b>scales.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the variability of high resolution stable isotope time series from four ice cores from Neumayer region reveals similar oscillations.

For the purposes of vegetation monitoring, a commonly used technique is the Maximum NDVI Composite, {{used in conjunction with}} variety of other constraints. The current paper proposes an alternative based on the medoid (in reflectance space) over the time period (the medoid is a multi-dimensional analogue of the median), which is robust against extreme values, and appears to be better at producing imagery which is representative of the time period. For each pixel, the medoid is always selected from the available dates, so the result is always a single observation for that pixel, thus preserving relationships between bands. The method is applied to Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery to create seasonal reflectance images (four per year), with the aim being a regular time series of reflectance values which captures the variability at seasonal <b>time</b> <b>scales.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the seasonal reflectance values suggests that resulting temporal image composites are more representative of the time series than the maximum NDVI seasonal composite...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} dynamic {{equations}} on time scales {{is a relatively}} new and active area of mathematics that unifies and extends the study of differential equations and difference equations. A time scale T is a nonempty closed subset of the real numbers. In <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> <b>analysis</b> we work with ∆- derivatives and ∆- integrals. When T is the set of real numbers these are extensions of the main concepts of calculus, the derivative and the integral of a function. An open question is finding the exact value of a ∆- integral of a Riemann ∆-integrable function on an arbitrary time scale. We will be concerned with this and questions arising from the theory of ∆- integration when the time scale is a fractal. In this research project, students will calculate the so-called Taylor monomials when the time scale is the Cantor set. Taylor monomials are defined recursively through ∆- integration. R. J. Higgins and A. Peterson [3] have calculated such monomials for a few time scales, but in general they are difficult to find. Our computations will use the formulae given in [1] adapted to the Cantor set [4]. In addition, students will explore various definitions of exponential functions on time scales and use recent research [2] to calculate and study exponential functions on the Cantor set. Students will be introduced to notions and results of <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> <b>analysis,</b> some measure theory, and fractals.
