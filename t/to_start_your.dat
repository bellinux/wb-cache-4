It used the taglines [...] "Miss it, miss out" [...] and [...] "The only way <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>your</b> weekend" [...] on promotional adverts for the show. As well as the main presenters, there were regulars such as comedy duo Trevor and Simon, and later Ben, Gez and Rich from The Cheese Shop and SuperGirly.

From 1994 until 2000, there was a showbiz segment called the Electric Circus, which featured the latest films, music, computer games and gossip.
