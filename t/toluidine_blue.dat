25|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be confirmed}} by the characteristic appearance of the chest x-ray, which shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates, and an arterial oxygen level (PaO2) that is strikingly lower than would be expected from symptoms. Gallium 67 scans are also useful in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in approximately 90% of cases and are often positive before the chest x-ray becomes abnormal. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the causative organism in sputum or bronchio-alveolar lavage (lung rinse). Staining with <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue,</b> silver stain, periodic-acid schiff stain, or an immunofluorescence assay will show the characteristic cysts. The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of 2 to 8 (and {{not to be confused}} with Histoplasma or Cryptococcus, which typically do not form aggregates of spores or cells). A lung biopsy would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli. Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity which is characteristic of this pneumonia.|$|E

This is then made into a smear which can be examined microscopically. Sometimes the biopsy site can be selected with adjunct methods which aim to highlight areas of dysplasia. <b>Toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> staining, where the dye is preferentially retained by dysplastic tissue, is sometimes used, but there is high false positive rate. Other methods involve the use of illuminescence, relying on either the property of normal autoflorescent molecules in mucosa such as collagen and keratin which is lost from areas of dysplasia or carcinoma under blue light, or by initially staining of the mucosa with <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> or dilute acetic acid and examination under white light.|$|E

5000|$|Stains used in chromoendoscopy {{have three}} major mechanisms. Absorptive stains have an {{affinity}} for particular mucosal elements, and include Lugol's iodine, methylene blue, <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> and crystal violet (gentian violet) [...] Lugol's iodine specifically stains non-keratinized squamous epithelium, and consequently is useful for identifying squamous tissue, squamous dysplasia and squamous cell carcinomas. Methylene blue stains absorptive epithelium and is useful for identifying abnormality in the small intestine and colon. Barrett's esophagus involves change in the mucosa of the esophagus into a tissue that includes glands (intestinal metaplasia), and as a result, can be identified with methylene blue staining. Also, methylene blue {{has been used to}} identify dysplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis. <b>Toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> stains nuclei of malignant cells blue, and is used in oral and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Crystal violet is absorbed into intestinal and neoplastic cells and is used to identify Barrett's esophagus and colonic neoplasms.|$|E
50|$|Some of the dyes {{used are}} {{methylene}} blue, prussian blue, brilliant cresyl blue, <b>Toluidine</b> <b>Blue</b> O, Basic Blue 3, Methylene Green, Taylor's Blue, Janus Green B, Meldola's Blue, Thionin, Nile Blue, and Celestine Blue. The leuco dye is prepared by chemical reduction using a suitable reducing agent. The method commercially used by Flexplay and SpectraDisc employs methylene blue reduced by sodium dithionite.|$|E
50|$|Alkaline {{solutions}} of <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> {{are commonly}} used for staining semi-thin (0.5 to 1 μm) sections of resin-embedded tissue. At high pH (about 10) the dye binds to nucleic acids and all proteins. Although everything in the tissue is stained, structural details are clearly visible because of the thinness of the sections. Semi-thin sections are {{used in conjunction with}} ultra-thin sections examined by electron microscopy.|$|E
50|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} endoscopy. It {{is sometimes}} performed with chromoendoscopy, {{a method that}} assists the endoscopist by enhancing the visual difference between cancerous and normal tissue, either by marking the abnormally increased DNA content (<b>toluidine</b> <b>blue)</b> or failing to stain the tumor, possibly due to decreased surface glycogen on tumor cells(Lugol). Infrared fluorescent endoscopy and ultrasonic endoscopy can interrogate vascular abnormalities such as esophageal varices.|$|E

50|$|The metachromatic {{properties}} of dimethylmethylene blue, a thiazine dye {{closely related to}} <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue,</b> have been exploited to assay glycosaminoglycans extracted from cartilage and other connective tissues. The absorption peak shifts from about 630 nm (red absorption, therefore blue colour) to about 530 nm {{in the presence of}} GAG. Humbel and Etringer's original assay was developed by others to create a stable and widely used dimethylmethylene blue reagent.|$|E
5000|$|In chemistry, orthochromasia is the {{property}} of a dye or stain to not change color on binding to a target, as opposed to metachromatic stains which change color. The word {{is derived from the}} Greek [...] (correct, upright), and chromatic (color). <b>Toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> {{is an example of a}} partially orthochromatic dye, as it stains nucleic acids by its orthochromatic color (blue), but stains mast cell granules in its metachromatic color (red).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Figure 13. High {{resolution}} {{light microscopy}} on <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> stained semithin section (~1 mm thick ultramicrotomesection) of Epon-embedded mouse heart (6 month old) shows the limited space where cardiomyocyte progenitors {{have been found}} by electron microscopy. Cardiac stem cell niche {{is located in the}} subepicardial area surrounding coronary artery next to the emergence from aorta (red rectangle). EM revealed a dozen of cell types, including TC as well as cardiomyocyte progenitors and precursors.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism for}} metachromasia requires {{the presence of}} polyanions within the tissue. When these tissues are stained with a concentrated basic dye solution, such as <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue,</b> the bound dye molecules are close enough to form dimeric and polymeric aggregates. The light absorption spectra of these stacked dye aggregates {{differ from those of}} the individual monomeric dye molecules. Cell and tissue structures that have high concentrations of ionized sulfate and phosphate groups—such as the ground substance of cartilage, heparin-containing granules of mast cells, and rough endoplasmic reticulum of plasma cells—exhibit metachromasia. This depends on the charge density of the negative sulfate and carboxylate anions in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG). The GAG polyanion stabilizes the stacked, positively-charged dye molecules, resulting in a spectral shift as the conjugated double bond π-orbitals of adjacent dye molecules overlap. The greater the degree of stacking, the greater the metachromatic shift. Thus, hyaluronic acid, lacking sulphate groups and with only moderate charge density, causes slight metachromasia; chondroitin sulfate, with an additional sulfate residue per GAG saccharide dimer, is an effective metachromatic substrate, whilst heparin, with further N-sulfation, is strongly metachromatic. Therefore, <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> will appear purple to red when it stains these components.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{tricyclic}} thiazines (e.g. <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue,</b> {{methylene blue}} and azure A etc.), which are metachromatic due to switching from monomeric to stacked aggregates, Alcian blue is apparently orthochromatic. In common with Astra blue {{and other similar}} dyes, this property {{that it does not}} change color either by change in concentration or by combination with substrates, makes it very suitable for microspectrophotometry. The apparent lack of metachromasia is not because it is truly orthochromatic but because [...] "it is already fully metachromatic" [...] in aqueous solution.|$|E
50|$|Metachromasia (var. metachromasy) is a {{characteristic}} {{change in the}} color of staining carried out in biological tissues, exhibited by certain dyes when they bind to particular substances present in these tissues, called chromotropes. For example, <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> becomes dark blue (with a colour range from blue-red dependent on glycosaminoglycan content) when bound to cartilage. Other widely used metachromatic stains are the haematological Giemsa and May-Grunwald stains that also contain thiazine dyes. The white cell nucleus stains purple, basophil granules intense magenta, whilst the cytoplasms (of mononuclear cells) stains blue. The absence of color change in staining is named orthochromasia.|$|E
50|$|The {{staining}} of nuclei by hemalum is ordinarily due to binding of the dye-metal {{complex to}} DNA, but nuclear staining {{can be obtained}} after extraction of DNA from tissue sections. The mechanism {{is different from that}} of nuclear staining by basic (cationic) dyes such as thionine or <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue.</b> Staining by basic dyes occurs only from solutions that are less acidic than hemalum, and it is prevented by prior chemical or enzymatic extraction of nucleic acids. There is evidence to indicate that coordinate bonds, similar to those that hold aluminium and hematein together, bind the hemalum complex to DNA and to carboxy groups of proteins in the nuclear chromatin.|$|E
50|$|Surface mucous {{cells have}} large {{quantities}} of mucin granules in their apical (top) surface and project short microvilli into the lumen of the stomach. Mucins are large glycoproteins that give the mucus its gel-like properties. As mucins are lost during routine histology preparation, they stain pale, but if preserved correctly the cells stain strongly with special techniques like PAS or <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue,</b> the last representing the anionic nature of foveolar cell secretions. Below the mucin granules, surface mucous cells have a Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, and small amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Mucous neck cells are located within gastric glands, interspersed between parietal cells. These are shorter than their surface counterpart and contain lesser quantities of mucin granules in their apical surface.|$|E
5000|$|Nucleic acids are {{generally}} basophilic {{because they have}} a very high density of negative charge due to the sugar phosphate backbone. However, in contrast to other basic i.e. cationic dyes, Alcian blue usually (given the right pH and salt concentrations, and normal temperature and duration in minutes, not hours) preferably stains acidic glycosaminoglycans but not the chromatin and nissel substance, the mechanism of which had been a mystery {{for a long time and}} various theories were proposed. Though the presumed basis of the staining is its positive charge attracted to negative structures (e.g. acidic sugars), bulkiness (width 2.5-3 nm, compared to <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> ~0.7 x1.1 nm) makes its diffusion very slow in less permeable parts of the tissue and thus prevent it from staining highly negative yet compact structures such as chromatin and nissl substance. However prolonged staining (few days at 25 °C) or DNA denaturing conditions may allow Alcian blue to also stain the nucleus. The isolation of the positive charge from the aromatic electron cloud by the intervening methylene bridges makes the localized positive charged regions [...] "hard" [...] ions in contrast to soft ions where the charge is delocalized over the whole aromatic pi cloud. When these hard cations encounter the hard anions e.g. in form of sulfate they form salts without regard for the precise chemical nature of the anion. The resulting salts are highly stable but can be slowly exchanged with high concentration of salts. Washing with water or alkali treatment after staining causes base catalyzed hydrolysis and removal of the pendant positively charged side chains and the resulting compound is Phthalocyanine Blue, which forms a blue water-insoluble dye precipitate. The precipitates are so robust that they withstand harsh conditions like PAS or other counterstaining and also dehydration and embedding treatments (in contrast <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> is partially extracted away during dehydration). This unleachability is the chemical basis of the ingrain dyeing for which AB (Ingrain blue 1) was originally designed by the dye industry.|$|E

Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity which is characteristic of this pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|Specifically, TEM {{should be}} used for {{diagnostic}} purposes when it: (1) provides useful (complementary) information {{in the context of a}} carefully considered differential diagnosis; (2) provides an ‘improved’ diagnosis that results in better treatment strategies and; (3) is time & cost effective in respect to alternative techniques. For diagnostic purposes solid tissues are prepared for TEM in the same way as other biological tissues, they are fixed in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide then dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. The epoxy resin block is trimmed and the target tissue is selected using a light microscope by viewing semithin sections stained with <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue.</b> The block is then retrimmed and the specific area for observation is ultrathin sectioned, preferably using a diamond knife. The ultrathin sections are collected on 3mm copper (mesh) grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to make the contents of the tissue electron dense (and thus visible in the electron microscope).|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} {{aspiration}} sites varies with testis size and ranges from 4 (to confirm obstruction) to 15 per testis (for nonobstructive azoospermia). FNA is performed with a sharp-beveled, 23-gauge, one-inch needle using the established suction cutting technique. [...] Precise, gentle, in-and-out movements, varying from 5 mm to 8 mm, {{are used to}} aspirate tissue fragments. Ten to 30 needle excursions are made at each site. Suction is released, and then the tissue fragments are expelled onto a slide, gently smeared, and immediately fixed in 95% ethyl alcohol. Pressure is applied to each site for hemostasis. A routine Papanicolaou stain is performed. Smears are reviewed by experienced cytologists for (a) specimen adequacy (defined as at least 12 clusters of testis cells or at least 2000 well-dispersed testis cells) and (b) {{the presence or absence}} of mature sperm with tails. For immediate interpretation, fixed slides are stained with undiluted <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> and read with brightfield microscopy after 15 seconds. Patients take an average of two pain pills after the procedure. Complications in over 800 patients have included one episode of hematospermia and, in another patient, post-operative pain for 7 days.|$|E
50|$|In aqueous {{solution}} {{large numbers of}} Alcian blue molecules stack together as micelles of very large size, too large to be even dialysed. Thus even at a fairly high dilution, it has an absorption maximum at ~600-615 nm, which is actually not the absorption maximum of a dye monomer but that of the multimer. Since the absorbed light is of yellow orange spectrum, the transmitted/reflected light is perceived by our eye as the complementary color of slightly greenish blue or cyan. In {{aqueous solution}} Alcian blues continue to be metachromatic at molar concentrations one hundredth those at which <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> is mainly orthochromatic. Only a very small shoulder of the absorption curve at 670-680 nm represent the monomeric dye, which is usually the minority and becomes even lesser minority (<108M) in presence of salts. However, when the solvent is DMSO—a non-protic solvent of moderately high dielectric constant, Alcian blue does not aggregate and a big monomeric absorption peak can be well visualized. A similar spectral shift to the longer monomeric peak is also observed when solvents like ethanol (or ethanol water mixture) {{is used as a}} vehicle or when nonionic detergents like Triton X-100 are used, that make exogenous micelles.|$|E
50|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vesicles, which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue.</b> Gas vacuoles, which are freely permeable to gas, are membrane-bound vesicles present in some species of Cyanobacteria. They allow the bacteria to control their buoyancy. Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments, present in magnetotactic bacteria, that contain magnetic crystals.|$|E

40|$|Background: Early {{detection}} of oral cancer at potentially malignant disorders (PMDs) stage reduces the morbidity and improves the survival rates {{and quality of}} life of patient. <b>Toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> has been developed as an adjunct to conventional examination for early {{detection of}} dysplastic lesions. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of <b>toluidine</b> <b>blue</b> in the detection of PMDs and to compare the results with histopathological examination.
