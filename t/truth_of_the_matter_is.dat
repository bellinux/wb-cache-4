In all but one case, the dead are either young or already made-up, such that [...] "the viewer can easily tolerate these images on the screen". The one corpse {{that had not been}} found for several days is never shown on screen. No bodies show the gaunt figure of one who has died after a long illness, or the cuts and bruises of an accident victim. Japanologist Mark R. Mullins writes that the gratitude shown in Departures would probably not have occurred in real life; according to Coffinman, there [...] "is nothing lower on the social scale than the mortician, and the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that [...] fear the coffinman and the cremator just as much as death and the corpse".|$|E

It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel {{of one of the most}} successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E

[...] In the same publication, however, referring to Ament: [...] "The <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is,</b> that the missionary has been made the scapegoat by conspiring and corrupt native officials, and by immoral foreigners now in China and their ignorant brethren here in the United States." ...|$|E

[...] The truth is that we cannot account for where this money is going, and it is likely going into the pockets of the top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. [...] The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so it’s good enough to bring them home permanently.” The Amendment passed 228–191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.|$|E

2500|$|On April 29, 2008, U.S. President George W.

2500|$|Modern historians, however, {{state that}} the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> this: There are indeed {{numerous}} ancient records of Mongol raids and occupations of Jerusalem (from Western, Armenian, or Arab sources), and in 1300 the Mongols did achieve a brief victory in Syria which caused a Muslim retreat, and allowed the Mongols to launch raids into the Levant as far as Gaza {{for a period of}} a few months. During that year, rumors flew through Europe that the Mongols had recaptured Jerusalem and were going to return the city to the Europeans. [...] However, this was only an urban legend, as the only activities that the Mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through Palestine, {{which may or may not}} have even passed through Jerusalem itself. [...] Regardless of what the Mongols may or may not have done, there is no evidence that Molay was ever a Mongol commander, and he probably never set foot in Jerusalem.|$|E

[...] If Texas had been half this consistent all season, it'd be playing in a bowl game [...] But Mack Brown will settle for a better-late-than-never performance with an impressive 52–34 victory over the Pac-10 co-champion Sun Devils in a Holiday Bowl that was just shorter than the Bush years. [...] Texas had {{made a habit of}} finishing strong with some spirited fourth-quarter rallies all season, but this time it started stronger than garlic breath and never let up. [...] This Texas team knocked the ever-living stuffing out of ASU. This Texas team showed fire, showed passion and mostly showed up. These Longhorns finished the year with a fulfilling game that could possibly squeeze them into the top 10 and should titillate their fans for eight months and stoke a high 2008 preseason national ranking.” ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Schopenhauer, the Will (the great Will {{that is the}} thing-in-itself, not the {{individual}} wills of humans and animals, which are phenomena of the Will) conflicts with itself through the egoism that every human and animal is endowed with. [...] Compassion arises from a transcendence of this egoism (the penetration of the illusory perception of individuality, so that one can empathise with the suffering of another) and {{can serve as a}} clue to the possibility of going beyond desire and the will. [...] Schopenhauer categorically denies the existence of the [...] "freedom of the will" [...] in the conventional sense, and only adumbrates how the will can be [...] "released" [...] or negated, but is not subject to change, and serves as the root of the chain of causal determinism. [...] His praise for asceticism led him to think highly of Buddhism and Vedanta Hinduism, as well as some monastic orders and ascetic practices found in Catholicism. [...] He expressed contempt for Protestantism, Judaism, and Islam, which he saw as optimistic, devoid of metaphysics and cruel to non-human animals. According to Schopenhauer, the deep <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that in cases of the over-affirmation of the will – that is, cases where one individual exerts his will not only for its own fulfillment but for the improper domination of others – he is unaware that he is really identical with the person he is harming, so that the Will in fact constantly harms itself, and justice is done in the moment in which the crime is committed, since the same metaphysical individual is both the perpetrator and the victim.|$|E
