Before and during World War II, West traveled widely, collecting material for books on travel and politics. In 1936–38, she made three trips to Yugoslavia, a country she came to love, seeing it as the nexus of European history since the late Middle Ages. Her non-fiction masterpiece, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is an amalgamation of her impressions from these trips. New York Times reviewer Katherine Woods wrote: [...] "In two almost incredibly full-packed volumes {{one of the most}} gifted and searching of modern English novelists and critics has produced not only the magnification and intensification of the travel book form, but, one may say, its apotheosis." [...] West was assigned by Ross' magazine to cover the Nuremberg Trials for The New Yorker, an experience she memorialized in the book A <b>Train</b> <b>of</b> <b>Powder.</b> In 1950 she was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She also went to South Africa in 1960 to report on Apartheid {{in a series of articles}} for the Sunday Times.|$|E
2500|$|Dame Cicely Isabel Fairfield DBE (21 December 1892 – 15 March 1983), {{known as}} Rebecca West, or Dame Rebecca West, was a British author, journalist, {{literary}} critic and travel writer. An author {{who wrote in}} many genres, West reviewed books for The Times, the New York Herald Tribune, the Sunday Telegraph, and the New Republic, {{and she was a}} correspondent for The Bookman. Her major works include Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (1941), on the history and culture of Yugoslavia; A <b>Train</b> <b>of</b> <b>Powder</b> (1955), her coverage of the Nuremberg trials, published originally in The New Yorker; The Meaning of Treason, later The New Meaning of Treason, a study of the trial of the British Fascist William Joyce and others; The Return of the Soldier, a modernist World War I novel; and the [...] "Aubrey trilogy" [...] of autobiographical novels, The Fountain Overflows, This Real Night, and Cousin Rosamund. Time called her [...] "indisputably the world's number one woman writer" [...] in 1947. She was made CBE in 1949, and DBE in 1959, in each case, the citation reads: [...] "writer and literary critic". She took the pseudonym [...] "Rebecca West" [...] from the rebellious young heroine in Rosmersholm by Henrik Ibsen.|$|E

The commander-in-chief of the artillery, Francisco Ramirez de Madrid, was ordered to take possession of this bridge. The approach to it was perilous in the extreme, from the exposed situation of the assailants and the number of Moors that garrisoned the towers.
