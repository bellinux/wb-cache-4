50|$|Ceramic molding {{has been}} around for centuries. When man {{discovered}} fire, they got curious of what they could do with the fire, so they experimented with the process of clay and fire, and began the technique known as ceramic molding, or pottery.

5000|$|The {{effect of}} the {{invasive}} fish in the area is as of now, uncertain, but many {{studies have been done}} <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what <b>exactly</b> is going on. [...] Some of these studies have shown that this breed of cychlid has spread into Bayou St. John and City Park. The cichlid acts aggressively toward native Largemouth bass, Western mosquitofish, sailfin mollies, and blue crabs. This aggressiveness can occur in the form of tail beating and mouth wrestling. [...] The fish also appears to cause reproductive failure of sheepshead minnows. The cichlid was largely unaffected by abiotic events like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita because of its high tolerance for salt-water intake. [...] In fact, these hurricanes actually helped the fish to take over the bayous of New Orleans. When the park flooded during Katrina, it helped the cichlid to spread.|$|R

500|$|After seven episodes, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{disliked the}} series {{so much that}} he {{discouraged}} viewers from watching it for that particular season. He supported this by stating that the premise of teenagers summoning monsters has been done to death and that the adaptation has no compelling mysteries nor are there deeper psychological dilemmas being explored. Eisenbeis shared sentiments with the Anime News Network reviewers when he elaborated on what he called the [...] "woefully underdeveloped" [...] characters of Devil Survivor 2 who are only given rudimentary back-stories. This had the added effect of making it nearly impossible <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> who <b>exactly</b> is a one-off character and who is a main character since they are all equally subjected to the threat of death. Eisenbeis noted that this made their demise genuinely shocking as it added to the viewing tension.

5000|$|Acid Brass was {{released}} to generally favourable reviews. Steve Huey of Allmusic was mixed in his assessment, who said [...] "the somewhat dodgy (and condescending) concept for this record, by artist Jeremy Deller, {{is that both}} brass bands and raves are staples of British working-class life, so a fusion of the two styles of music is natural. While the results are certainly well played, it's extremely difficult <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> who Acid Brass is supposed to appeal to, except maybe the kitsch audience." [...] Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club was favourable, saying: [...] "If the musicians weren't so serious about the endeavor, it wouldn't quite work, and as it stands, A Guy Called Gerald's 'Voodoo Ray' sounds pretty silly when played by a marching band. But the arrangements retain much of the simple hookiness of the originals." ...|$|E

40|$|Often, in an {{enterprise}} engineering (EE) project, {{it is quite}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what <b>exactly</b> needs <b>to</b> be done due to the rather generic (and often proprietary) character of the EE methods available. In addition, selecting appropriate elements from the multitude of available and emerging architecture frameworks (AFs) in order to model and manage the given EE undertaking is a non-trivial task. This chapter proposes a way to assist the inference of processes and to facilitate the selection and use of AF elements needed to accomplish EE projects. This is accomplished by assessing and organising AF elements into a structured repository (SR) using a generalised architecture framework (ISO 15704 : 2000 Annex A) and by providing a "method to create methods" (a meta-methodology) for specific EE tasks that also guides the selection of AF elements from the SR. A brief introduction outlining the previously mentioned EE problems {{is followed by the}} description of the meta-methodology principle and of the assessment reference used. Next, a case study presents a sample application of the meta-methodology for a real EE project. The chapter closes with conclusions on the presented approach and a description of further work to refine and enrich the meta-methodology.

40|$|ABSTRACT Why do {{we design}} {{architecture}}? How we design it? Why do we design architecture in this way, {{not in that}} way? What‘s the most important characteristic for architecture? How we can identity if architecture has realized all ideas we proposed before? With these questions, with the help from kind professors, I found one interesting place - Cao changdi, Beijing, China. Luckily, I found one interesting street and noticed there are some problems here. I needed <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what <b>exactly</b> are the problems and try {{to solve the problems}} with architecture. I found that relations and connections are missing at this street. They are supposed to be there, but they are invisible. Why not make them visible? I tried to direct this design based on the user’s stories or experiences. My approach was to visualize peoples’ experience in a new architecture through story boards, or ‘frame’ of applying the film director’s skills and design minds to approach architecture. Let peoples’ experience in an architecture become a movie. Applying the film director’s skills and minds to the design of architecture. Space {{plays an important role in}} architecture design. What happened in that space is what is important. Of course, stories would happen in that space. Then what’s the story? My thesis project would illustrate how three stories - visitor, villager and artist‘s experience help to direct the design...|$|R
