In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.|$|E

This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} NATO Research and Technology Organization (RTO) lectu series number 221, entitled Technologies for Future Precision Strike Missile Systems. The {{primary purpose of the}} lecture series was the disseminating of state-of-the-art scientific and technical knowledge among a wide audience. The lecture series identified significant developments in the enabling technologies and provided examples of the advancements. It also addressed the challenging requirements in areas such as adverse weather capability, time critical targets, high kill probability, no collateral damage, high survivability light-weight expeditionary warfare weapons, and affordability. Emerging technologies for precision strike missile systems that were addressed in the lecture series included: Mission planning <b>technology.</b> <b>Assessments</b> included off-board sensor integration, near-real-time mission planning, flight altitude, terrain following, and missile data links for in-flight targeting. Missile aeromechanics <b>technology.</b> <b>Assessments</b> included hypersonic airframes, low cost/high temperature structure, and ramjet propulsion. Guidance and control technology. An overview of existing guidance and control was given. Assessments included precision guidance and optimal guidance laws. Missile GPS/INS sensor <b>technology.</b> <b>Assessments</b> included low cost INS and GPS/INS integration. Missile design technology. An overview of the missile design process was given. Assessments included computer programs and electronic spreadsheets for conceptual design and missile deign criteria. Seeker <b>technology.</b> <b>Assessments</b> included active and passive imaging infrared and radar seekers. Missile/aircraft integration <b>technology.</b> <b>Assessments</b> included high firepower weapon concepts, reduced observables, and insensitive munitions. Simulation/validation <b>technology.</b> <b>Assessments</b> included hardware-in-the-loop and design validation. Automatic target recognition <b>technology.</b> <b>Assessments</b> included robust algorithms and hardware/algorithm optimization. The material in this publication was assembled to support a Lecture Series under the sponsorship of the Systems Concepts and Integration (SCI) Panel and the Consultant and Exchange programme of RTO. The lectures were first held March 23 - 24, 2000 in Atlanta Georgia USA, at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Following the lectures at Georgia Tech, the lectures were held April 3 - 4, 2000 in Turin, Italy and April 6 - 7, 2000 in Ankara, Turkey. Due to the interest in the lectures, they were reprised in 2001. Updated lectures were presented in Tbilisi, Georgia (18 - 19 June 2001), Bucharest, Romania (21 - 22 June 2001), Madrid, Spain (25 - 26 June 2001), and Stockholm, Sweden (28 - 29 June 2001) ...|$|R
