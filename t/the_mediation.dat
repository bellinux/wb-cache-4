5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further {{demanding}} that the League condemn Italy's and Germany's decision to recognise the Nationalists.

This charge was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard Viénot, the British and French representatives respectively, who appealed to the League to endorse <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> plan. The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation.

5|$|As the Byzantines {{relied upon}} the Ghassanids {{to cover the}} {{approaches}} to Syria, Mundhir's withdrawal left {{a gap in the}} Byzantine southern flank, which persisted for three years until 575 when Mundhir returned to the Byzantine allegiance through <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> of the general Justinian, who met Mundhir at Sergiopolis. Immediately after this reconciliation, Mundhir assembled an army in secret and launched an attack against Hirah, the Lakhmid capital, arguably the Arab world's largest, richest, and most culturally vibrant city at the time. The city was sacked, plundered, and put to the torch, except for the churches. According to John of Ephesus, Mundhir donated much of his booty from this expedition to monasteries and the poor. The same year, Mundhir visited Constantinople, where he was awarded a crown or diadem (stemma), marking the formal renewal of his role as Byzantium's chief Arab client-king.|$|E
