40|$|Abstract: The methodical {{and applied}} {{problems}} concerned {{the development of}} a passive gravity-gradient attitude control system for Russian/US nanosatellite REFLECTOR are considered. ACS consists of a proper distributed satellite mass and additional loads creating a needed tensor of inertia, and a set of hysteresis rods fabricated under the special technology from soft magnetic material. The composition of enumerated elements allows providing the satellite with <b>three-axis</b> <b>orientation</b> relative to the orbital reference system. Satellite dynamics is analysed by analytical and numerical methods. The problems of additional loads and hysteresis rods arrangement, its interaction with other on-board magnetized elements are investigated. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an indoor broadband ultrasonic system for estimation of a mobile deviceâ€™s 3 -D location and <b>three-axis</b> <b>orientation</b> using beacons. It presents the first implementation and characterization {{of a real}} frequency hopping spread spectrum-based ultrasonic positioning system, a novel application of uniform circular array angle of arrival estimation techniques to indoor location-orientation estimation and a novel hybrid algorithm for location-orientation estimation. The performance of the system was assessed experimentally. The system {{has been shown to}} provide better accuracy, robustness to noise and multipath than other previously reported indoor ultrasonic location or orientation estimation systems with comparable range in the typical office environment tested. The prototype provided location estimates with an error of less than 1. 5 cm and and error of less than 4. 5 in the yaw, 3 in the pitch and 3. 5 in the roll, in 95 % of cases...|$|E
40|$|Star {{trackers}} provide numerous {{advantages over}} other attitude sensors {{because of their}} ability to provide full, <b>three-axis</b> <b>orientation</b> information with high accuracy and flexibility to operate independently from other navigation tools. However, current star trackers are optimized to maximize accuracy, at the exclusion of all else. Although this produces extremely capable systems, the excessive mass, power consumption, and cost that result are often contradictory to the requirements of smaller space vehicles. Thus, it is of interest to design smaller, lower cost, albeit reduced capability star trackers that can provide adequate attitude and rate determination to small, highly maneuverable, low-cost spacecraft. This thesis discusses the analysis used to select hardware and predict system performance, as well as the algorithms that have been employed to determine attitude information and rotation rates of the spacecraft. Finally, the performance of these algorithms using computer simulated images, nighttime photographs, and images captured directly by star tracker prototypes is presented. by Kara M. Huffman.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} an alternative solution to computing the <b>three-axis</b> <b>orientations</b> of a tunnel-boring machine (TBM) during microtunneling and pipe-jacking operations. Comprehensive geometric foundations are given {{to shed light on}} the computing mechanism for deriving the TBM's three rotation angles of yaw, pitch, and roll through surveying a limited quantity of observation points on the TBM. Two well-established computing algorithms in space science are elaborated, including the deterministic triaxis attitude determination (TRIAD) algorithm and the optimal quaternion method. MonteCarlo simulations are conducted to assess the accuracies on the orientations determined by the two algorithms, given (1) different levels of point surveying errors and (2) varying distances between observation points. In relation to microtunneling applications, four layout options for fixing the observation points on the TBM are designed and evaluated. To prove the concept and verify the application value of the proposed computing approach, a practical implementation case is presented, in which the computational method of quaternion was used to fix a working TBM's orientations on a microtunneling site.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} determining the <b>three-axis</b> attitude (<b>orientation)</b> of a spacecraft from a sequence of Earth images taken while in orbit about the stationary Lagrange point between the Earth and the sun (LI). Two axes of information can be obtained simply by monitoring the Earth's position within the field-of-view of the camera. The third axis is obtained by correlating sequential Earth images {{in such a way}} as to detect the flow of the features within the Earth's disk over time. When taken correctly, this measurement is perpendicular to the Earth's spin axis and, consequently, locates the Earth's spin axis within the images. This is equivalent to determining the orientation of the spacecraft about the instrument's boresight. Actual data from the Galileo spacecraft is used to test the algorithms outlined in this paper...|$|R

Spacecraft Overview REX II was designed and constructed for the Air Force Space Test Program (STP) by CTA Space Systems (CTASS) in McLean, Virginia. Its mission is to operate two experimental payloads: a Rome Laboratory communications experiment, and a GPS attitude determination and control technology demonstration. The primary communications experiment advances research on electron density irregularities that cause disruptive scintillation effects on transionospheric radio signals. The secondary experiment demonstrates the first ever use of GPS attitude knowledge for closed-loop control. The REX II spacecraft is illustrated in Fig. 1. Its design is based on two previous STP missions: the original REX spacecraft launched in June 91 and RADCAL launched in June 93. Technical characteristics are summarized in Table I. It was launched into a 450 nmi circular polar orbit aboard a Pegasus XL out o...|$|R
