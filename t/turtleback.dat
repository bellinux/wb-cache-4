2500|$|The {{shipbuilder}} Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company {{laid down}} two destroyers on speculation (i.e. without a specific order) on 1 September 1905, as Yard Number 786 and 787.

The first of the two ships, which would later become HMS Albacore, was launched on 9 October 1906. [...] Palmer's was unable to find a customer for these ships, however, and offered to sell them to the Royal Navy on 5 December 1907 for £70,000–80,000 each. The Admiralty rejected the offer in February 1908, but in April two destroyers, [...] and , were lost in accidents and it was decided to order the two stock ships from Palmer's as replacements.
