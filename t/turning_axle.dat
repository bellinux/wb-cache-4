50|$|In 1982, Mini 4WD was {{produced}} by Tamiya. These toys were battery-powered vehicles that ran {{on a pair of}} AA battery and featured four-wheel drive. They were driven by a single motor that <b>turned</b> both <b>axles.</b> Of the first vehicles were a Ford Truck and a Chevrolet Truck.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the great}} {{innovations}} of the carriage was {{the invention of the}} suspended carriage or the chariot branlant (though whether this was a Roman or medieval innovation remains uncertain). The 'chariot branlant' of medieval illustrations was suspended by chains rather than leather straps as had been believed. [...] Chains provided a smoother ride in the chariot branlant because the compartment no longer rested on the <b>turning</b> <b>axles.</b> In the 15th century, carriages were made lighter and needed only one horse to haul the carriage. This carriage was designed and innovated in Hungary. Both innovations appeared around the same time and historians believe that people began comparing the chariot branlant and the Hungarian light coach. However, the earliest illustrations of the Hungarian 'Kochi-wagon' do not indicate any suspension, and often the use of three horses in harness.|$|R
50|$|A coil pump {{is a low}} {{lift pump}} which is {{composed}} of a tube, shaped as a coil and mounted on a rotating axle powered by an engine or an animal capable of <b>turning</b> the <b>axle</b> around rapidly.

2500|$|The term often {{refers to}} a human-powered crank {{which is used to}} {{manually}} <b>turn</b> an <b>axle,</b> as in a bicycle crankset or a brace and bit drill.

50|$|Historically the {{earliest}} known wind machine {{was made by the}} Persians and it was the panemone design, consisting of a wall, with slits, surrounding a vertical axle containing four to eight fabric sails. As the wind blew, the sails would <b>turn</b> the <b>axle,</b> which was in turn connected to grain grinders or some form of water transportation device (though little is known of the actual details of such methods).|$|R

50|$|This motion {{must be used}} to <b>turn</b> the car's <b>axle</b> or wheels. The {{most common}} {{solution}} is to attach a string to the mouse trap's arm and then wrap it around an axle. As the bar is released, it pulls on the string, causing the axle (and wheels) to turn.|$|R
50|$|Graue {{could not}} build his entire mill from onsite materials. He bought four buhrstones that <b>turned</b> on water-driven <b>axles</b> to grind locally grown corn and wheat. Quarried in France, the buhrstones, {{a type of}} millstone, were {{carefully}} dressed by specially trained craftsmen so as to form two level, gritty surfaces that would pulverize the grain between them.|$|R
40|$|REACT Project: Dartmouth is {{developing}} specialized alloys with magnetic properties {{superior to the}} rare earths used in today’s best magnets. EVs and renewable power generators typically use rare earths to <b>turn</b> the <b>axles</b> in their electric motors due to the magnetic strength of these minerals. However, rare earths are difficult and expensive to refine. Dartmouth will swap rare earths for a manganese-aluminum alloy that could demonstrate better performance and cost significantly less. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an easily scalable process that enables {{the widespread use of}} low-cost and abundant materials for the magnets used in EVs and renewable power generators...|$|R
60|$|A {{long stretch}} of smooth level road now lay before them. It {{required}} the merest touch on the treadles to send them skimming along like skaters on smooth ice, or swallows flying low.

25|$|Two wheels {{fixed to}} the same <b>axle</b> <b>turn</b> {{at the same speed}} as a vehicle goes around curves. This either forces one to slip, if possible, to balance the {{apparent}} distance covered, or creates uncomfortable and mechanically stressful wheel hop. To prevent this the wheels are allowed to turn at different speeds using a mechanical or hydraulic differential. This allows one driveshaft to independently drive two output shafts, axles that go from the differential to the wheel, at different speeds.|$|R

5000|$|Stompers {{were first}} created in 1980 by A. Eddy Goldfarb and sold by Schaper Toys. These toys were {{battery-powered}} vehicles that ran {{on a single}} AA battery and featured four-wheel drive. They were driven by a single motor that <b>turned</b> both <b>axles.</b> They were the first battery-powered, electric, true 4WD toys. Later, in the United Kingdom, Corgi Toys marketed identical toys in Corgi labeled packaging called Trekkers but made by Schaper. Genuine Stompers were sold by various companies around the globe and were also made by Schaper. There were similar products manufactured by Soma and LJN (Rough Riders). Both companies were involved in lawsuits by Goldfarb and Schaper. Settlements were made and the companies continued their line of toys. None of the imitators were as popular as the Schaper Stomper line however. As of 2015, Mr. Goldfarb continues {{to live and work}} at his design studio in Southern California.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1973-74, five AWD GAZ-24-95s were built. It used a UAZ {{transfer}} case, with a heavily modified floorpan. The front axle ended up being a Volga rear <b>axle</b> <b>turned</b> backwards, attached to UAZ joints for the steering, with front leaf springs (on stronger frame rails, to carry the greater load). The sump also had to be modified. In all, the changes added 90 kg. Some disadvantages were discovered during the tests and this modification remained experimental. One survives in the GAZ plant's museum, another perhaps in private hands in Nizhny Novgorod.|$|R
5000|$|Arnoux {{devised a}} system of chains and pulleys so that eah the wheels' {{correctly}} adjusted in yaw through the curve: {{as soon as the}} leading <b>axle</b> started to <b>turn,</b> all other <b>axles</b> would also <b>turn</b> by the same amount. Actually this was a fatal design flaw since in a long train not all carriages are on the same part of the curve. A compromise was to use pulleys of different diameters, with guide wheels on the locomotive to control their motion. Also, using a broad gauge of [...] was expected to give greater stability.|$|R
5000|$|Water {{is stored}} at a small, elevated, dam-like {{collection}} point. Typically, {{the water is}} diverted from a large stream or mill pond to the water wheel along a channel or pipe (also known as a flume or head race). The potential energy of the water's movement drives the blades of a wheel and converts it to mechanical energy, which in <b>turn</b> rotates an <b>axle</b> that drives the jander's mill stones. Water leaving the wheel is drained through a tail race. The passage of water is controlled by gates that allow some measure of flood control.|$|R
60|$|By this oblique motion, {{the island}} is {{conveyed}} to {{different parts of the}} monarch’s dominions. To explain the manner of its progress, let A B represent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line c d represent the loadstone, of which let d be the repelling end, and c the attracting end, the island being over C: let the stone be placed in position c d, with its repelling end downwards; then the island will be driven upwards obliquely towards D. When it is arrived at D, let the stone be <b>turned</b> upon its <b>axle,</b> till its attracting end points towards E, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards E; where, if the stone be again <b>turned</b> upon its <b>axle</b> till it stands in the position E F, with its repelling point downwards, the island will rise obliquely towards F, where, by directing the attracting end towards G, the island may be carried to G, and from G to H, by turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point directly downward. And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as often as there is occasion, {{the island is}} made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the obliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, the car plant made {{military}} vehicle engines, {{a military}} version of their heavy tractor renamed the SS-100, and half track troop carriers. The Hanomag 20 B, a four-wheel-drive Small Unit-Personnel Carrier was produced from 1937 until 1940 (circa 2000 built) under the parentage of Stoewer (as the R180, R200 and Type 40). Capacity problems by Stoewer resulted in co-production by both BMW (as the 325) and Hanomag. Together the three manufacturers made about 10,000 units. The special four-wheel-steering system was fitted on most models. Operating a [...] "lock-level" [...] between the front seats made the steerable rear <b>axle</b> <b>turn</b> sideways {{to a certain}} angle.|$|R
5000|$|Channel {{trucks are}} common on mountainboards, and {{are made up}} of an axles mounted to the truck bottom piece, which is {{suspended}} from a top hanger by a kingpin. They are mounted to the deck using nuts and bolts through the hanger part, on an angle, (usually 35°). When the board is tilted laterally the <b>axles</b> <b>turn</b> together to angle the wheels {{in the direction of the}} turn. Two polyurethane dampers sometimes known as [...] "egg shocks" [...] are mounted between the hanger and the axle housing on each truck to provide resistance to the lean of the rider during turning. Springs are mounted in the same place with the dampers inside them.|$|R
5000|$|A flavour of the {{religious}} fervour inspired by the Cameronians can be gauged from the symbolism and language of a poem, The Cameronian's Dream, which preserved their memory long after the events described above had taken place. Its author James Hyslop was a self-taught shepherd from the Cumnock-Sanquhar area in the south west of Scotland which was the seedbed of the two Covenanter Risings of 1666 and 1679. Written by Hyslop {{between the ages of}} fourteen and eighteen and published in 1821, the poem ends with a Cameronian's vision on the desolate moor at Airds Moss. :When the righteous had fallen, and the combat had ended,:A chariot of fire through the dark cloud descended;:Its drivers were angels, on horses of whiteness,:And its burning wheels <b>turned</b> upon <b>axles</b> of brightness; :A seraph unfolded its doors bright and shining,:All dazzling like gold of the seventh refining,:And the souls that came forth out of great tribulation,:Have mounted the chariots and steeds of salvation. :On the arch of the rainbow the chariot is gliding,:Through the paths of the thunder the horsemen are riding.:Glide swiftly, bright spirits, the prize is before ye:A crown never-fading, - a kingdom of glory! ...|$|R
5000|$|Concrete mixers are {{equipped}} with anywhere from two axles and up.Four, five and six axle trucks {{are the most common}} with the number being determined by the load and local legislation governing allowable loads on the road.These are necessary to distribute the load evenly and allow operation on weight restricted roads and to reduce wear and tear on normal roads. A two or three axle truck during the winter when road weight limits are reduced has no usable payload in many jurisdictions. Other areas may require expensive permits to operate.Additional axles other than those used for steering ("steers") or drivetrain ("drives") may be installed between the steers and drives or behind the drives.Mixers commonly will have multiple steering axles as well, which generally result in very large turning radii.To facilitate maneuvering the additional axles may be [...] "lift axles" [...] which allows them to be raised off the ground so that they do not scrub (get dragged sideways across the ground) on tight turns, or increase the vehicle's <b>turning</b> radius. <b>Axles</b> installed behind the drives are known as [...] "tag axles" [...] or [...] "booster axles", and are often equipped to turn opposite to the steering axle to reduce scrubbing and automatically lift when the truck is put into a reverse gear.|$|R

50|$|Typically, {{water is}} {{diverted}} from a river or impoundment or mill pond to a turbine or water wheel, along a channel or pipe (variously {{known as a}} flume, head race, mill race, leat, leet, lade (Scots) or penstock). The force of the water's movement drives the blades of a wheel or turbine, which in <b>turn</b> rotates an <b>axle</b> that drives the mill's other machinery. Water leaving the wheel or turbine is drained through a tail race, but this channel {{may also be the}} head race of yet another wheel, turbine or mill. The passage of water is controlled by sluice gates that allow maintenance and some measure of flood control; large mill complexes may have dozens of sluices controlling complicated interconnected races that feed multiple buildings and industrial processes.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} types of {{different}} wheels: normal plastic, one-way, aluminum, and lock-nut. Normal plastic wheels are fine, {{but they are not}} adequate for really fast cars. They become loose after disconnecting them from the axle several times. Additionally, they create drag when the car going through <b>turns</b> as the <b>axle</b> locks the two wheels at same speed, since the outer wheel must cover more distance than the inner wheel (relatively to the turn of the course). One-way wheels allow either side to roll faster than the other when turning, and minimize the speed loss in turns. Aluminum wheels are very light, sturdy, and best for speed. Some aluminum wheels have preventive measures against loosening with the axle. However, lock-nut wheels are the best in preventing the cars from losing the wheels during a run.|$|R
5|$|The SL79 make up 40 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the newer}} SL95. Following the {{delivery}} of the SL95 low-floor trams in 1999 and 2000, Oslo Sporveier has a pure articulated fleet. The newer series has a greater <b>turning</b> radius, heavier <b>axle</b> load and is two-directional. The radius and axle load of the SL95 {{makes it impossible for}} it to operate around Majorstuen, requiring lines 11, 12 and 19 to use SL79-units. With the 1999-extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line to Rikshospitalet, the tramway received its first terminus without a balloon loop, making it necessary for lines 17 and 18 to be served only by SL95 units. These also serve line 13, since it is a continuation of the service along the Sinsen Line from Majorstuen. The SL79 operate on the Briskeby, Ekeberg, Frogner, Gamleby, Grünerløkka–Torshov, Kjelsås and Vika Lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on section that are served by two lines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{train is}} powered by four diesel engines, each {{delivering}} , giving the train a total [...] to propel it. The engines are mounted in the MFA and MFB carriages, with two engines in each carriage. Each engine drives the axles on the bogies via an electronically controlled automatic gearbox. The engines are mounted so that the end which would normally point forwards in a rear-wheel-drive car, instead faces {{the center of the}} MFA and MFB carriages. Due to this mounting design and nature of combustion engines and {{to the fact that the}} train runs forward in both directions, a so-called [...] "reverse gear" [...] had to be attached to automatic gearboxes. They are responsible for making the <b>axles</b> <b>turn</b> the right way. These gears are normally not controlled directly by the train's driver; instead, the train's on-board computers check which of the two cabs is active to determine the train's primary driving direction, setting the reverse gears accordingly.|$|R
50|$|This four-horse mill {{is based}} on a central, vertical, heavy, 10 ft high, oak axle, with its base {{pivoting}} on an iron framework set {{in the middle of the}} gin gang floor. Its top end pivots under the mill's own tie beam (if it didn't, it would fall over) but the tie beam cannot rest on the pivot, or the mill would not <b>turn.</b> The main <b>axle</b> supports around its top end the main, 6 ft-diameter, horizontal gear wheel, with the teeth on the top surface. The main drive shaft, a massive oak pole, is girthed at one end by a secondary gear wheel which lies on the main gear wheel, thus turning the main drive shaft on its long axis. The main drive shaft runs from the main gear wheel through a hole in the threshing barn wall and in the barn it powers the threshing machine and other machines via further cogwheels and belts. Such a machine would create great torque stresses, and if it were ever to work again it would require re-engineering to ensure smooth and safe running, and beams which are seasoned and not cracked.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most basic}} act of diabolo {{manipulation}} is to spin {{it on the}} string. [...] "The string is placed between the circles, but {{in order for the}} diabolo to balance, it must maintain a spinning motion, much like a yo-yo." [...] However, [...] "considerably more skill is needed to twirl a diabolo...than the Yo-yo it resembles," [...] and, [...] "the enthusiasts in the game assert that it takes much higher training of eye and muscle than lawn tennis." [...] "Diabolo requires hard practice and highly developed skills, and deserves its independent status." [...] Typically, the user pulls the stick in his or her dominant hand so that the string moves along the <b>axle,</b> <b>turning</b> it. [...] "The player...swings the string right and left." [...] By doing this repeatedly and rapidly the diabolo rotates faster. The diabolo spin can be accelerated more quickly using various methods: the 'whip' rotates the diabolo faster by moving one handstick in front of the user's body and past the other handstick, the 'wrap' rotates the diabolo faster when the user wraps a loop of the string around the axle. Both methods increase the amount of string contact with the axle in any given time.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor obtaining close {{fits and}} tolerances, {{certain amount of}} {{machining}} has {{to be carried out}} on GFRP (Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic) composites, produced by primary manufacturing processes. A number of cylindrical GFRP composite parts are finish machined by <b>turning.</b> These include <b>axles,</b> bearings, spindles, rolls and steering columns. There is always a tradeoff between quality and productivity during machining operations. Hence it becomes essential to evaluate the optimal cutting parameters setting in order to satisfy these opposing requirements. In this study, a hybrid multiobjective optimization algorithm involving grey and fuzzy coupled with Taguchi methodology is used. Four process parameters, each at three levels are selected for the study viz. cutting tool nose radius, cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. Surface roughness parameter Ra, tangential cutting force Fz and material removal rate MRR are the chosen output performance measures. The experimental plan is laid according to Taguchi's orthogonal array L 27. Woven fabric based GFRP/ Epoxy tubes produced using hand layup process are finish turned using PCD cutting tool. Grey relational coefficients of the three performance measures are converted into a single multi performance characteristics index (MPCI) using Mamdani type fuzzy inference system. This MPCI is then optimized using Taguchi analysis. The parameter combination of A 2 B 1 C 1 D 3, i. e. tool nose radius of 0. 8 mm, cutting speed of 120 m/min, feed rate of 0. 05 mm/rev and depth of cut of 1. 6 mm, is evaluated as the optimum combination. The confirmatory experiment at these settings gave maximum value of MPCI, validating the results...|$|R
60|$|The pocket {{apparatus}} {{is similar}} to one originally made and used by Sir William J. Herschel (see Plate 3, Fig. 4, in which the roller and its bearings are drawn {{of the same size}} as those I use). A small cylinder of hard wood, or of brass tube, say 1-3/4 inch long, and 1/2 or 3/4 inch in diameter, has a pin firmly driven into each end to serve as an axle. A piece of tightly-fitting india-rubber tubing is drawn over the cylinder. The cylinder, thus coated with a soft smooth compressible material, <b>turns</b> on its <b>axle</b> in two brackets, each secured by screws, as shown in Plate 2, Fig. 4, to a board (say 6 × 2-1/2 × 1/4 inch) that serves as handle. This makes a very fair and durable roller; it can be used in the heat and damp of the tropics, and is none the worse for a wetting, but {{it is by no means}} so good for delicate work as a cylinder covered with roller composition. These are not at all difficult to make; I have cast them for myself. The mould is a piece of brass tube, polished inside. A thick disc, with a central hole for the lower pin of the cylinder, fits smoothly into the lower end of the mould, and a ring with a thin bar across it, fits over the other end, the upper pin of the cylinder entering a hole in the middle of the bar; thus the cylinder is firmly held in the right position. After slightly oiling the inside of the mould, warming it, inserting the disc and cylinder, and fitting on the ring, the melted composition is poured in on either side of the bar. As it contracts on cooling, rather more must be poured in than at first appears necessary. Finally the roller is pushed out of the mould by a wooden ramrod, applied to the bottom of the disc. The composition must be melted like glue, in a vessel surrounded by hot water, which should never be allowed to boil; otherwise it will be spoilt. Harrild's best composition is more than twice the cost of that ordinarily used, and is expensive for large rollers, but for these miniature ones the cost is unimportant. The mould with which my first roller was made, was an old pewter squirt with the nozzle cut off; its piston served the double purpose of disc and ramrod.|$|R
