The influences of different rotor teeth shapes on cogging torque, torque ripple and electromagnetic torque are analyzed by the 2 -D finite-element method (FEM). Then, the performance of FSPMs with different rotor teeth shapes are compared and evaluated comprehensively from the points of view of cogging torque, torque ripple, electromagnetic torque, flux linkage, back electromotive force (EMF), and so on.

Methods: Preschool children (332) with autism at special child care centre in Hong Kong were assigned to a test SSDHE intervention group (148 children) or a control CDHE intervention group (204 children) to learn the task of tooth brushing. Performance in tooth brushing was assessed using a standardized 13 -step pro forma. Number of <b>tooth</b> brushing <b>steps</b> and number of effective <b>tooth</b> brushing <b>steps</b> successfully completed were assessed and compared over time, and between groups in a 6 -month study. Results: The response rate to the study was 67 % (222 / 332). Over time, there were significant improvements in {{the overall number of}} <b>tooth</b> brushing <b>steps</b> completed among the test group (p< 0. 001) and the control group (p< 0. 001). Likewise, there were significant improvements in number of effective <b>tooth</b> brushing <b>steps</b> completed among the test group (p< 0. 001) and control group (p< 0. 001). Those in the test group completed a greater number of effective <b>tooth</b> brushing <b>steps</b> compared to the control group at 3 -months (p= 0. 009) and at 6 -months (p= 0. 003). Controlling for other factors in regression analyses, improvement in performance of tooth brushing at 6 -months was associated with baseline performance (OR 0. 46, 95 %CI 0. 35, 0. 60, p< 0. 001), social skill deficits (OR 0. 19, 95 %CI 0. 16, 0. 55, p< 0. 01), reading deficits (OR 0. 21, 95 %CI 0. 05, 0. 95, p< 0. 05) and parental education level (OR 0. 45, 95 % 0. 24, 0. 83, p< 0. 05). Conclusions: There was evidence of improvement in tooth brushing performance among preschool children with autism following the use of a social-story-based education intervention compared to a conventional education approach. However, child developmental factors, level of competency at baseline and parental education factors were key determinants of improvement in tooth brushing performance at 6 -months post intervention...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{quantify}} leakage flow and windage heating for labyrinth seals with honeycomb lands {{is critical in}} understanding gas turbine engine system performance and predicting its component life. Variety of labyrinth seal configurations (number of <b>teeth,</b> <b>stepped</b> or straight, honeycomb cell size) are in use in gas turbines, and for each configuration, there are many geometric factors that can impact a seal's leakage and windage characteristics. This paper describes {{the development of a}} numerical methodology aimed at studying the effect of honeycomb lands on leakage and windage heating. Specifically, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed utilizing commercial finite volume-based software incorporating the renormalization group (RNG) k-epsilon turbulence model with modified Schmidt number. The modified turbulence model is benchmarked and fine-tuned based on several experiments. Using this model, a broad parametric study is conducted by varying honeycomb cell size, pressure ratio (PR), and radial clearance for a four-tooth straight-through labyrinth seal. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. They further indicate that larger honeycomb cells predict higher seal leakage and windage heating at tighter clearances compared to smaller honeycomb cells and smooth lands. However, at open seal clearances larger honeycomb cells have lower leakage compared to smaller honeycomb cells...|$|R

The results demonstrated a good agreement when the line profile and region of interest measurements were used to determine the frequency minima. In the cases where minima were not detected, a limiting criterion was determined using the parameters from which the expected theory is reliant. The study was expanded further by the design and implantation of specificalIy designed phantoms that assessed the capabilities of the terahertz system. Successful measurements with good agreement to the theory were obtained for the phantoms and those that were immeasurable fell outside the limiting criteria. This technique has highlighted a method of analysing changes in refractive index and thickness between the boundaries of a sample, and with further study could lead to a successful terahertz pulsed imaging application.

However, the pressure profiles for the eccentric positions indicated little, if any, direct stiffness for this configuration in contrast to significant direct stiffness reported for the straight and three-step cylindrical seals over the range of test conditions.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{quantify}} leakage flow and windage heating for labyrinth seals with honeycomb lands {{is critical in}} understanding gas turbine engine system performance and predicting its component lifes. Variety of labyrinth seal configurations (number of <b>teeth,</b> <b>stepped</b> or straight, honeycomb cell size) are in use in gas turbines, and for each configuration, there are many additional geometric factors that can impact a seal’s leakage and windage characteristics. To achieve high performance in modern gas turbine engines, the labyrinth seals operate at low clearances and high rotational speed which are generally deployed with honeycomb lands on the stator. During the transient operation of aircraft engines, the stator and rotor mechanical and thermal growths differ from one another and can often result in the rotor’s incursion into the stator honeycomb structure. The incursions create rub-grooves in the honeycomb lands that can subsequently enlarge as the engine undergoes various manoeuvres. However, the effects of different honeycomb cell size, rotation and presence of rub-groove have not been thoroughly investigated in previously published work. The objective of the present research is to numerically investigate {{the influence of the}} above three factors on seal leakage and windage heating. The present work focuses the development of a numerical methodology aimed at studying above effects. Specifically, a three-dimensional CFD model is developed utilizing commercial finite volume-based software incorporating the RNG k-ε turbulence model. Detail validation of the numerical model is performed by comparing the leakage and windage heating measurements of several rig tests. The turbulent Schmidt number is found to be an important parameter governing the leakage prediction. It depends on honeycomb cell size and clearance for honeycomb seals, and Reynolds number in the presence smooth lands. The present numerical model with the modified RNG k- turbulence model predicts seal leakage and windage heating within 3 - 10 % with available experimental data. Using the validated numerical model, a broad parametric study is conducted by varying honeycomb cell size, radial clearance, pressure ratio and rotational speed for a four-tooth straight-through labyrinth seal with and without rub-grooves. They further indicate that presence of rub-grooves increases seal leakage and reduce windage heating, specifically at smaller clearance and for larger honeycomb cell size. Rotation significantly reduces leakage with smooth stator land and smaller honeycomb cells whereas the effect is minimal for larger (3. 2 mm) honeycomb cells. However, at very high rotational speed seal flow reduces in all seal configurations due to high temperature rise and Rayleigh line effects. At no rub condition and lower clearance, the larger honeycomb cells leak more flow due to high bypass flow through the honeycomb cells. This results into lower pocket swirl and higher windage. When the seal clearance increases the larger honeycomb cells offers more drag to the seal flow, therefore they leak less. At higher clearances the flow travels like a strong wall jet and isolates the pocket air from honeycomb cells. Hence, at open clearances labyrinth seals with any honeycomb cell size essentially produce the same pocket swirl and windage heating...|$|R
40|$|The stress {{distributions}} {{generated by}} dental implants {{in the surrounding}} bone were calculated {{by means of the}} finite-element technique for different implant shapes, loading situations and interface conditions. Five principally differing shapes were investigated; they were chosen to be representative for the typical axi-symmetric systems used at present: cylindrical (corresponding e. g. to IMZ-or TCP-implants), conical (similar to a <b>tooth</b> root) <b>stepped</b> (comparable to the type Tübingen), screw-shaped (e. g. like TPS-, Branemark-, Biolox-or CBS-screws) and hollow-cylindrical (comparable to the ITI-system). In order to exclude additional size effects, the shapes were normalized to equal length and maximum diameter. The loading direction was normally chosen parallel to the implant axis, in some cases also perpendicular to it. The interface conditions between bone and implant were assumed to simulate pure contact (only transfer of compression) or ongrowth in the spongy part (fixed bond, i. e. a dditional transfer of tensile and shear-stresses). The results exhibit remarkable differences between the different shapes. The highest stresses are generated by the conical implant under axial load and pure contact conditions (Fig. 2). In the latter case the radii of curvature play an important role. All stress peaks are additionally, however, differently diminished by a fixed ingrowth in the spongy region of the jaw (Fig. 3). Horizontal loading perpendicular to the implant axis does not produce such significant differences between the various shapes (Fig. 3). Thus, investigations under axial load will deliver the better criterion for evaluating the shape...|$|R

In this line, I evaluate the step of characterization of certain conflictive molar characters previously used, {{and their impact on}} phylogeny of octodontoids. I explore which the criteria followed to propose the hypotheses of correspondences for these characters are in light of the anatomical evidence. Based on the outcome of phylogenetic trees obtained previously, I analyze if the evolutionary transformations are compatible with character states observed in the terminals. New cladistic analyses based on recoded molar characters indicate that, unlike results recently obtained, the unorthodox position of Sallamys, Protadelphomys, and Willidewu as basal ctenomyines is not recovered. The position of Caviocricetus, Acarechimys–Neophanomysas as Octodontinae is not maintained. These results indicate that reanalyses of conflictive dental characters, scrutinizing data matrices, are particularly necessary to evaluate the current controversy on the phylogeny of octodontoids. Lower molar character definition and character states delimitation in octodontoids, being relevant to phylogenetic reconstruction, should be founded on anatomical examination, following explicit criteria of homology. Alternative hypotheses of “primary homology” proposed for the same molar traits in octodontoids indicate that each main group of caviomorphs requires its own anatomical study...|$|R

Keywords used were (post or core or buildup or dowel) and (teeth or <b>tooth).</b> Additional inclusion/exclusion <b>steps</b> were conducted, each step by two independent readers: (1) Abstracts describing post-and-core techniques to reconstruct endodontically treated teeth and their mechanical and physical characteristics were included (descriptive studies or reviews were excluded); (2) articles that included FRC post systems were selected; (3) in vitro studies, single-rooted human teeth, prefabricated FRC posts, and composite as the core material were the selection criteria; and (4) failure loads and modes were extracted from the selected papers, and failure modes were dichotomized (distinction was made between "favorable failures," defined as reparable failures, and "unfavorable failures,"defined as irreparable [root] fractures). RESULTS: The literature search revealed 1, 984 abstracts. Included were 244, 42, and 12 articles in the first, second, and third selection steps, respectively. Custom-cast post systems showed higher failure loads than prefabricated FRC post systems, whereas ceramic showed lower failure loads.

It investigates the ways in which the Court’s loose language in this area has detracted from careful doctrinal development in media law and has created organizational and operational confusion of constitutional consequence. It argues that, separate and apart from the substantive drawbacks that might accompany the Court’s failure to commit to a media-protecting Press Clause position, there are other large-scale, structural consequences that accompany the practice of such dicta-heavy constitutional imprecision and that these consequences ought to be seen as disconcerting. It discusses both the overarching jurisprudential and constitutional risks produced when the use of dicta predominates the Court’s analysis of any issue and the ways in which these risks are amplified and compounded in the area of press freedoms, where expressive liberties are at stake and the threat of chilling communicative behavior is pronounced...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiopacity}} of esthetic restorative materials {{has been}} established as an important requirement, improving the radiographic diagnosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the radiopacity of six restorative materials using a direct digital image system, comparing them to the dental tissues (enamel-dentin), expressed as equivalent thickness of aluminum (millimeters of aluminum). Five specimens of each material were made. Three 2 -mm thick longitudinal sections were cut from an intact extracted permanent molar tooth (including enamel and dentin). An aluminum step wedge with 9 steps was used. The samples of different materials were placed on a phosphor plate together with a <b>tooth</b> section, aluminum <b>step</b> wedge and metal code letter, and were exposed using a dental x-ray unit. Five measurements of radiographic density were obtained from each image of each item assessed (restorative material, enamel, dentin, each step of the aluminum step wedge) and the mean of these values was calculated. Radiopacity values were subsequently calculated as equivalents of aluminum thickness. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant differences in radiopacity values among the materials (P< 0. 0001). The radiopacity values of the restorative materials evaluated were, in decreasing order: TPH, F 2000, Synergy, Prisma Flow, Degufill, Luxat. Only Luxat had significantly lower radiopacity values than dentin. One material (Degufill) had similar radiopacity values to enamel and four (TPH, F 2000, Synergy and Prisma Flow) had significantly higher radiopacity values than enamel. In conclusion, to assess the adequacy of posterior composite restorations it is important that the restorative material to be used has enough radiopacity, in order to be easily distinguished from the tooth structure in the radiographic image. Knowledge on the radiopacity of different materials helps professionals to select the most suitable material, along with other properties such as biocompatibility, adhesion and esthetic...|$|R
40|$|Resin luting {{agents are}} used to lute {{indirect}} restorations to hard tooth tissues. The luting procedure consists mostly of several <b>tooth</b> pretreatment <b>steps</b> as etching, priming and application of adhesive and only {{at the very end}} applying of a resin luting agent. Such a multi-step luting procedure with separate adhesive system is quite time-consuming and technique sensitive. Therefore, constant inquiry from the practitioners for the resin luting agents with simplified application procedure, have moved the manufacturers to develop self-adhesive resin cements which require no tooth tissue pretreatment anymore. Numerous in vitro and few in vivo studies of the first self adhesive resin cement RelyX Unicem showed adequate bond strengths to hard tooth tissues and acceptable short-term clinical performance. The complex chemistry and relatively high viscosity of self-adhesive resin cements challenges the ability of them to interact with hard tooth tissues. Moreover, they interact directly with a smear layer. So, it was the question whether self-adhesive resin cements are able to create similar micromorphological adhesion pattern to resin luting agents with separate adhesive systems. We tried to answer this question with the present SEM morphological investigation. It was the aim to analyze and compare the adhesive interfaces of a control resin luting agent with self-etching primer (Panavia F and ED Primer) and adhesive interfaces of self-adhesive resin cements (RelyX Unicem, RelyX Unicem 2 and Clearfil SA Cement). The task was to find out which morphological characteristics (tags, lateral tags, hybrid layer or interdiffusion zone, pores and other) could be found in the specimens of self-adhesive resin cements, compare them on native polished, demineralized/deproteinized and fractured specimens in low vacuum mode. It was the aim to find out whether the polymerization mode has the influence on the morphological findings. At least, to clear if the present LV SEM method can be considered as appropriate method for adhesive interface examinations. It was hypothesized that the self-adhesive resin cements would have only superficial interaction with smear layer without ability to form resinous tags. This could not be confirmed because a few specimens of RelyX Unicem 2 and Clearfil SA Cement revealed the presence of tags in dentinal tubules. However, the interdiffusion zone was thin and appeared irregularly even within one SARC’s specimen. This SEM morphological study confirmed quite a weak interaction of all three SARC’s with hard tooth tissues. The weak adhesion to enamel led to microgap formation along the adhesive interface. There were more failed specimens in SARC’s experimental group than in Panavia control group. In this aspect, RelyX Unicem 2 and Clearfil SA Cement performed worse than RelyX Unicem. The micromorphology of the adhesive interface of the control luting agent Panavia and its ED Primer appeared similar to that reported in the literature for resin luting agents with self-etching adhesive systems. A good material adhesion – low number of failed specimens, no microgap formation at enamel-Panavia adhesive interface, a distinct hybrid layer, tags and lateral tags were characteristic for a dentin-Panavia adhesive interface. The demineralization/deproteinization and fracturing of specimens revealed some characteristics extra like lateral tags and complemented the information obtained from polished specimens. It was hypothesized that auto-polymerization would enhance the deeper diffusion of the luting agents and thicker interdiffusion zone could be detected. Specimen examinations showed insignificant differences of morphological findings. Although, tags were found mostly in auto-curing mode, the supposed thicker interdiffusion zone in auto-polymerized self-adhesive resin cement specimens was not present. Possibly the tags in Clearfil SA Cement and RelyX Unicem 2 specimens could be formed there, where the dentinal tubules were free of smear plugs. By contrast, ED Primer of Panavia has modified the smear plugs allowing resin to infiltrate into dentinal tubules in both curing modes, however, without influence on the thickness of the hybrid layer. Using low vacuum SEM method it was possible to depict the characteristic adhesive interface of native, minimally prepared specimens. In particular, material contrast in LV SEM allowed features to be revealed such as the interdiffusion zone (hybrid layer) or tags. Self-adhesive resin cements have shown less typical micromophological characteristics at adhesive interface when compared to a control resin luting agent in the present study. It can be concluded that self-adhesive resin cements have predominantly chemical interaction with smear layer. Although, the bond strength of self-adhesive resin cements in vitro studies is acceptable, for lasting clinical performance a combination of chemical and micromechanical adhesion with a formation of tags and sufficient interdiffusion zone would be more trustworthy. ...|$|R
40|$|Osteopetrosis is a {{metabolic}} bone {{disease in}} mammals {{characterized by a}} generalized skeletal sclerosis caused by reduced bone resorption. This reduced bone resorption is manifested in afflicted animals by abnormal bone shape, reduced or absent marrow cavities, extramedullary hemopoiesis, abnormal mineral homeostasis and absent or delayed tooth eruption. The available osteopetrotic animal mutations have been {{a constant source of}} fruitful investigations concerning the systemic regulation of osteoclastogenesis and bone metabolism. Tooth eruption, on the other hand, is a localized manifestation of the timely activation of bone resorption and bone formation on opposite sides of an erupting <b>tooth.</b> Its rate-limiting <b>step</b> is the speed of bone resorption to form the eruption pathway. In this dissertation, we used two osteopetrotic rat mutations, toothless (tl) and microphthalmia blanc (mib), to investigate the abnormal development of osteoclasts and tooth eruption in mutant rats with an emphasis on the role of systemic and local factors. The significant contributions to this work are listed below. 1. In the toothless rat, a mutation lacking erupted dentition due to severely reduced bone resorption, colony-stimulating factor- 1 (CSF- 1) promoted tooth eruption but this was delayed compared to normal rats. Eruption was accompanied by changes in the populations of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+) mononuclear cells in the dental follicle and TRAP+ osteoclasts on adjacent alveolar bone surfaces. These cell populations were dramatically increased in treated mutants compared to untreated tl rats, but the timing of their appearance was delayed compared to normal littermates. This lag in the appearance of osteoclasts and their precursors corresponded to the delay in eruption of first molars in treated tl rats. 2. CSF- 1 also accelerated the eruption of molars in normal rats. CSF- 1 increased the number of TRAP+ mononuclear cells in the dental follicle and TRAP+ osteoclasts on adjacent alveolar bone surfaces, but had no effect on the timing of their appearance in normal rats. 3. Our data revealed a differential effect on tooth eruption of the growth factors CSF- 1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF). CSF- 1 accelerated eruption of molars in normal rats, but had no effect on incisor eruption. On the other hand, EGF accelerated incisor eruption; but did not affect molar eruption in normal rats. 4. We have described the mechanism for the transient, mild form of osteopetrosis inherited by mib rats. Mutant animals possess a typical sclerosis at birth, which diminished [...] but was not resolved [...] during the first postnatal month. These characteristics are caused by early reductions in osteoclast number and function which improve to normal levels by 4 weeks. Osteoclast numbers were severely reduced in mib rats between birth and 2 weeks, but improved to near normal levels by 4 weeks. Neonatal abnormalities in osteoclast function included reduced staining for the functional enzymes TRAP and TrATPase, decreased levels of mRNA for both TrATPase and CAll, and inability to form a well-developed ruffled border. None of these defects were apparent after the first postnatal month. 5. Finally, we have shown that the dental abnormalities caused by the mild, transient form of osteopetrosis in mib rats are limited to incisor defects and delayed eruption of all teeth. Histologic and radiographic examination of mutant incisors revealed that, contrary to the situation in normal rats, the apex of the incisors of mib rats failed to extend past the first molar region to the third molar. The incisor apex of newborn mib rats was misshaped due to ankylosis of incisor matrices with alveolar bone. This ankylosis was temporary, being resolved by the third postnatal day. The delayed eruption of incisors in mib rats and abnormal shape and occlusion of these teeth in older animals is a consequence of the temporary ankylosis in newborn rats...|$|R

Traditional ways of human computer interaction using keyboards, mice and display monitors are being replaced by more natural modes such as speech, touch, and gesture. The continuous progress of technology brings to an irreversible change of paradigms of interaction between human and machine. They are now used in daily life in many devices that have revolutionized the way users interact with machines. In fact new PCs, tablets and smartphones are moving increasingly toward a direction that will bring in a short time to have interaction paradigms so advanced that will be completely transparent to users. The various modes of human-machine interaction, through voice recognition are without doubt one of the most considered. Many attempts have been in recent years to automate the process of voice communication with which they interact between themselves persons. A number of researchers have revealed that a speech reading system is beneficial complement to an audio speech recognition system by using of visual cues of the speakers, such as face in noisy environment. However, robust and precise extraction of visual features is a challenging problem in object recognition, due to high variation in pose, lighting and facial makeup. Most of the existing approaches use constraints such as the use of reflective marker on subjects lips, lip movements recorded with a fixed camera position (head mounted camera) and lip segmentation in organized illumination conditions. Furthermore, there is no common consensus about the visual features selection and their significance for a particular phoneme. Speech is the natural procedure of communication. Therefore speech would be an apparently preferred option for human computer interaction. In the past years, development in technology, combined with a significant reduction in cost, has led to the pervasive use of automated speech recognition in variety of systems such as telephony, human-computer interaction and robotics.   Visual speech cues are prospective source of speech information and they are apparently not affected in noisy acoustic environmental condition and cross talking between speakers. Visual information of a speaker is the key component of Speech Recognition system such as outside area of mouth, mouth gestures and facial expressions. The major problem to develop an accurate and robust speech recognition system is to find the precise visual feature extraction method. Sometime hearer observes improper from speaker because of the incompatible effect of visual features. These visual features have great role in the lip reading process. These interpretations gave a motivation for developing a computer speech recognition system. I propose a speech recognition system using face detection, lip extraction and tracking with some pre-processing techniques to overwhelmed the pose/lighting variation problems. The proposed approach is useful for face/lip detection and tracking in sequence of images and to augment global facial features to improve the recognition performance.  The Proposed approach consists of four major parts, firstly detecting/localizing human faces, lips and define the lip region of interest in the first frame, secondly apply some pre-processing to overwhelmed the inference triggered by illumination effects, shadow and teeth appearance, thirdly create contour line with using sixteen key points with geometric constraint and stored the coordinates of these constraints. Finally track the lip contour with their coordinates in the following frames. The proposed method not only adapts to the lip movement, but also robust in contrast to the appearance of teeth, shadows and low contrast environment. Extensive experiments show the encouraging results and the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the existing methods. However, several factors were found during the experiments which may lead to an increase of the error rate. The key challenge for the recognition system is to get precise results with different environmental conditions and disturbing visual domain effects, such as illumination, shadow and <b>teeth.</b>  Three pre-processing <b>steps,</b> namely illumination equalization, teeth detection and shadow removal developed, aiming at investigating edge information and global statistical characteristics which are sensitive to the uneven illuminations and susceptible to the complex appearance in presence of teeth and shadow. In contrast, the proposed method, which is aimed at local region analysis, can successfully avoid the complex appearance (e. g. low contrast, shadow, moustaches and teeth). The high average extraction performance is reached. Experimental results show also some unsatisfactory results due to very low contrast and bad low resolution camera. A standard video camera (Logitech) is used to record English alphabets uttered by users is applied. Proposed method is an easy to implement and a computationally efficient algorithm that is capable of locating face and mouth and lips feature points throughout an entire image sequence. The extracted feature parameters are suitable for speech recognition and can greatly improve recognition accuracy. An approach to detect and track lip boundaries in a precise way is presented. The basic idea of this new approach is that not only it highlights the lips but also avoids other factors, (such as false lip pixels) and recovers from failures. The new approach is implemented in the lip tracking module. Using this lip tracking module from the lip boundary lines a feature vector of 16 points lip model of the speaker’s lips, stores the coordinates of these points and tracks these coordinates during the utterance by the speaker and tracked in every image of the image sequence. The strength of the new approach has also been evaluated by testing the system in noisy real world facial image sequences. Experiments have shown that outliers detecting and better predicting ROIs can further reduce the number of frames with locating or tracking failures.   Computers {{have become more}} pervasive than ever {{with a wide range of}} devices and multiple ways of interaction.
