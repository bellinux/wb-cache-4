5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish,</b> and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
5|$|Reality TV was {{a popular}} genre of {{television}} programming in the UK in 2002. The third series of the UK version of Big Brother—which was showing while Russian's con took place—attracted audience figures of approximately 5.8million. Most British reality TV programmes at the time centred on a team of people <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> a specific goal or target. For example, the 2000 series Jailbreak challenged a group to escape from a mock prison, while the 2001 series The Mole gave the contestants the task of discovering which of them was sabotaging their attempts to win money. Most reality TV shows offered a cash reward to successful participants—both Jailbreak and the first series of The Mole offered a prize of £100,000.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe mathematics self-concept and anxiety of twelfth grade students according to their mathematics achievement preferences. There were a total of 3 students involved in this study. In the collection of data, the researcher employed three types of instruments: mathematics test, Mathematics SelfConcept Scale (MSC) and Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI). Mathematics test determined the participants’ achievement preference: high, standard and low achievement. The MSC found the participants’ mathematics self-concept. The TAI found the participants’ mathematics anxiety. The study revealed that students who had high achievement in mathematics would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> test in any level of difficulty and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> any form of test. These students had no worry or fear in facing mathematics test. Meanwhile, students who had standard achievement in mathematics would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> test in standard and low level of difficulty and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> the test. These students felt nervous but could focus their mind and had no physical characteristics in facing mathematics test. Moreover, students who had low achievement would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> low level of test. These students felt nervous, unsteadiness and could not focus their mind but had no physical characteristics in facing mathematics test...|$|R

5|$|Stephen Báthory's reign {{marks the}} end of szlachta's reform movement. The foreign king was skeptical of the Polish {{parliamentary}} system and had little appreciation for what the execution movement activists had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish.</b> Batory's relations with Sienicki soon deteriorated, while other szlachta leaders had advanced within the nobility ranks, becoming senators or being otherwise preoccupied with their own careers. The reformers managed to move in 1578 in Poland and in 1581 in Lithuania the out-of-date appellate court system from the monarch's domain to the Crown and Lithuanian Tribunals run by the nobility. The cumbersome sejm and sejmiks system, the ad hoc confederations, and the lack of efficient mechanisms for the implementation of the laws escaped the reformers' attention or will to persevere. Many thought that the glorified nobility rule had approached perfection.|$|E
