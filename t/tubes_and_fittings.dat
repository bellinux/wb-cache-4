40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{instrument}} specifications {{given in}} current international (ISO) and national (ASAE) standards state that measured values should be within 90 % {{of the true}} amplitude of vacuum change at the various locations in the milking machine. Recommendations are given for the minimum sampling rate and response rate of instruments used to measure vacuum changes for dry, wet, milking–time, and cleaning–time tests. These minimum performance requirements should ensure that the measurement accuracy stated in the ISO and ASAE standards are met. A simple method was developed to measure the response rate of a vacuum recording system. The method can be used, quickly and easily, by field or laboratory technicians to specify the response rate of their vacuum recording systems. The predominant effects on response rate of vacuum recording systems are caused by the fittings connecting the electronic vacuum recorder to the measurement point. A major source of measurement error was water or milk in connecting <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings.</b> Dry and wet tests in the milkline and receiver confirmed previous studies showing {{that the rate of}} vacuum change during dry tests or in dry parts of the milking machine are much lower than those in wet parts of the machine. The fastest vacuum changes were measured in the short milk tube and mouthpiece chamber during a liner slip in a milking–time test.

40|$|The receiver's {{emittance}} and {{vacuum pressure}} {{are the two}} of great significance issues on the heat-loss which is the main factor reducing {{the efficiency of the}} parabolic though systems. In this paper, the thermal steady-state equilibrium method was used to test the receivers’ heat-loss. The receivers with increasing emittance were tested to study the variation of heat-loss. Meanwhile, the variable vacuum pressure in the annulus that affects the efficiency of the system was investigated. The influence of vacuumizing rate and getters on the vacuum pressure and heat-loss were discussed. The result shows that the emittance and vacuum pressure affect the receiver's heat-loss dramatically, and the emittance is the major influence factor on the thermal properties. The receiver with 0. 08 emittance and 10 − 3  Pa vacuum pressure has a satisfactory heat-loss of 215. 6  W/m at 400  °C. The analysis further reveals that the synergistic effect of both emittance and vacuum pressure on the heat-loss can be reflected by the packaging temperature of the glass <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>fitting</b> formula has been established to estimate the receivers’ heat-loss according to the packaging temperature of the glass tube...|$|R
5000|$|Isaac Newton {{built his}} {{reflecting}} telescope as a proof for his theory that white light {{is composed of}} a spectrum of colours. He had concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). The telescope he constructed used mirrors as the objective which bypass that problem. To create the primary mirror Newton used a custom composition of metal consisting of six parts copper to two parts tin, an early composition of speculum metal. He devised means for shaping and grinding the mirror {{and may have been}} the first to use a pitch lap to polish the optical surface. He chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction: he had satisfied himself that the chromatic, and not the spherical aberration, formed the chief faults of refracting telescopes. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a [...] "Newtonian telescope", a secondary [...] "diagonal" [...] mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an eyepiece mounted {{on the side of the}} telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made all the <b>tube,</b> mount, <b>and</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{copper pipe}} quickly conducts heat {{away from a}} joint, great {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the joint is {{properly}} heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the <b>fitting.</b> When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This removes excess solder as well as flux residue before it cools down and hardens. With a solder ring joint, the joint is heated until a ring of molten solder is visible {{around the edge of the}} <b>fitting</b> <b>and</b> allowed to cool.|$|R
