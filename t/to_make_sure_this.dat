25|$|In an {{interview}} with Vice in June 2015, Sussman stated that the game would not ship with support for online play, as surveys taken prior to release, and their own tracking, showed that only about 10% of previous Rock Band players used the online feature, and thus focused on building out the local play features first for release. Sussman commented {{that it may be}} released as part of future patches to the title. The game at launch did support online leaderboards and score tracking at launch, and has added additional asynchronous features since. In April 2016, Harmonix announced that it will add in synchronous online play by the end of 2016. In December 2016, Harmonix delayed the online addition until January 25, 2017 <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> feature covered all edge cases that they had encountered in testing.|$|E

25|$|Baphomet {{also serves}} as the main {{antagonist}} in the PC game Tristania 3D, and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courbée Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France {{was the one who}} had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> secret will remain unearthed. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.|$|E

On March 12, WWL-TV in New Orleans reported that Payton and Benson met with Goodell in New York {{for much of the}} morning to reiterate that the Saints would continue to cooperate fully with the NFL's investigation. On March 22, U.S. Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois announced he would invite Goodell and the heads of the other major American sports leagues to a hearing on bounty systems. He also said that unless the leagues themselves [...] "come up with standards <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> isn't going to happen again," [...] he may consider drafting legislation that would extend federal sports bribery laws to cover bounties.|$|E

2500|$|By far {{the most}} criticized have been episodes four and five for their shift away from the {{realistic}} style of Rebirth and the first few episodes, to the [...] "traditional mythology well known to longtime Kombat fans". Tancharoen also acknowledged the audience split that the [...] "Kitana & Mileena" [...] episodes created, stating that theirs was a story {{that could not be}} told in a realistic environment, and that Warner Bros. [...] "wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> web series tied into some of the story lines of the Mortal Kombat canon." [...] Unlike episode four, IGN criticized the use of animation this time, stating it cost the episode its energy and created a glut of continuity errors. Cheaper make-up, costume effects, and set design due to budgetary constraints, and a short running time were among the other criticisms. Upon the release of the Raiden-themed episode six, Houston Press suggested that Tancharoen was forced to steer episodes four and five into the traditional Mortal Kombat mystique by Warner Bros. to test how fans would react. Episode six, according to the reviewer, was the studio allowing Tancharoen to return to his own style, finally delivering [...] "cinematic greatness" [...] and [...] "the best [...] he's done so far. Possibly even better than the original Mortal Kombat: Rebirth". Film School Rejects bemoaned the series' expectation that its viewers be knowledgeable about the franchise's history, explaining that without previous knowledge of the games, the viewer is left with too many questions that may never be answered.|$|E
