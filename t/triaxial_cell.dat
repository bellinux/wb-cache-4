This study reports on experiments where low and high pCO 2 (8 ~MPa) aqueous fluids where injected into natural rock samples. The experiments were performed in flow-through <b>triaxial</b> <b>cells,</b> where the vertical and confining stresses, temperature, and pressure and composition of the fluid were separately controlled and monitored. The axial vertical strains of two limestones and one sandstone were continuously measured during separate experiments for several months, with a strain rate resolution of 10 ^- 11 s- 1. Fluids exiting the <b>triaxial</b> <b>cells</b> where continuously collected and their compositions analysed. The high pCO 2 fluids induced an increase in strain rates of the limestones by up to a factor of 5, compared to the low pCO 2 fluids. Injection of high pCO 2 fluids into the sandstone resulted in deformation rates one order of magnitude smaller than the limestones. The creep accelerating effect of high pCO 2 fluids {{with respect to the}} limestones was mainly due to the acidification of the injected fluids, resulting in a significant increase in solubility and reaction kinetics of calcite. Compared to the limestones, the much weaker response of the sandstone was due to the much lower solubility and reactivity of quartz in high pCO 2 fluids. In general, all samples showed a positive correlation between fluid flow rate and strain rate. X-ray tomography results revealed significant increases in porosity at the inlet portion of each core; the porosity increases were dependent on the original lithological structure and composition.

40|$|Abstract- Permeability is {{the most}} crucial {{internal}} factor in concrete durability. The durability of a concrete {{is closely related to}} its permeability. The permeability dictates the rate at which aggressive agents can penetrate to attack the concrete and the steel reinforcement. Water penetrability is defined as {{the degree to which a}} material permits the transport gases, liquids or ionic species through it. Water can be harmful for concrete, because of its ability to leach calcium hydroxide from the cement paste, to carry harmful dissolved species such as chlorides or acids into the concrete, to form ice in large pores in the paste, and to cause leaching of compounds from the concrete. Water absorption, sorptivity and water permeability measurement are some methods to determine the water penetrability of concrete. A <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> permeability apparatus and method for determining water permeability of concrete are presented in this paper.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. The {{need for}} a more {{reliable}} testing procedure for the characterisation and Quality Assurance/ Control of Bitumen Stabilised Materials (BSMs), besides UCS and ITS testing, has long been recognised by the roads industry. In fact, at CAPSA 2004 and CAPSA 2007, discussions of improved test methods for granular materials, i. e. possible replacement tests for CBR procedures, were conducted in workshops. Triaxial testing {{for the evaluation of}} shear parameters is widely recognised as a reliable method of measuring these critical performance properties of granular and Bitumen Stabilised Materials (BSMs). However, the triaxial test in its current state as a research test has little chance of extensive use by practitioners and commercial laboratories, because of complexity, cost and time issues. Major adaptations to the research triaxial test are necessary, before this useful test can have a chance of being accepted by road practitioners. The main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate possibilities of developing a simple, affordable, reliable and robust test for characterizing granular and bitumen stabilized materials thus linking test outcome with in-situ performance. This is achieved through the innovative design and manufacture of a prototype <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> capable of accommodating 150 mm diameter by 300 mm deep specimens. The cell is simpler than the research (geotechnical) <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> and the operational protocols have been streamlined, thereby reducing the time and steps required in assembling specimens and testing them. In order to ensure the development of an appropriate <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> for industry, a survey was conducted aimed at investigating currently available facilities, testing capacity and resources within civil engineering laboratories in South Africa. Findings of the survey (Appendix 4) have provided guidance with regard to the nature and sophistication of any new tests to be developed. The survey highlighted some of the limitations and lack of sophistication of the current loading frames used for CBR and UCS testing such as lack of electronic LVDTs, limited overhead space, limited loading capacity and others. Most laboratories would need to invest in new loading facilities to carry out triaxial tests. A review of the test procedure for monotonic triaxial test showed that two main factors contribute to the complexity of the research (geotechnical) <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> namely, time taken to assemble the specimen accurately in the cell and secondly the inherent design of the cell which makes it water and/or air tight at relatively high pressures. The design of the Simple Triaxial Test, therefore, was aimed at overcoming the drawbacks of research triaxial test e. g. fitting a membrane to each specimen to be tested, through considerable simplification by means of a new structure design and procedure of assembly of specimen into the cell. The advantage of addressing these issues would be reduction in the number of steps required in the test procedure and therefore reduction in testing time. The design of the cell particularly was preceded by a conceptualization process that involved investigation of numerous options. Concepts such as the bottle, encapsulated-tube, bottle and sandwich concepts were considered and given reality checks. In addition, available triaxial procedures of a similar nature e. g. Texas Triaxial, were evaluated and analyzed. Ultimately, with some trials and innovation, a design was developed for a simple <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> comprising a steel casing with a latex tube which is then introduced around the specimen sitting on a base plate. It is based on the ‘tube concept’ in which the specimen acts like a ‘rim’ and the cell acts like a ‘tyre’ providing confinement to the triaxial specimens for testing, within the tube. This approach eliminates the use of O-rings and membranes for the specimen and tie-rods for the <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell,</b> thus reducing testing time considerably. The overall dimensions of the cell are 244 mm diameter by 372 mm height (Appendix 5). The cell was manufactured at Stellenbosch University Civil Engineering workshop and preliminary tests were conducted under this study. Parallel tests were also conducted with the Research Triaxial Test setup at Stellenbosch University in order to determine if preliminary results obtained with the Simple Triaxial Test setup were comparable therefore providing a means of validating the data. Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) show that variability between Simple Triaxial Test (STT) and Research Triaxial Test (RTT) results is less significant whilst that within samples of STT and RTT results is quite significant. Comparisons also show that good correlation were obtained from Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) Hornfels + 3. 3 % Emulsion + 0 % Cement mix and mixes with the G 2 base course aggregate whilst completely different correlation was obtained from RAP + 3. 3 % Emulsion + 1 % Cement. It is evident however that the differences observed stem from material variability i. e. random variability to one degree or the other and not to the STT apparatus. It is recommended for future research that more STT versus RTT testing be done especially on a mix with known mechanical properties when compacted to a specified dry density, e. g. graded crushed stone (G 1) compacted to 100 % mod. AASHTO. In summary, a locally made, low cost, relatively durable <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> with relatively easy and quick specimen assembly procedures has been developed. It is now possible to perform triaxial tests on 150 mm diameter by 300 mm high specimen relatively easily and quickly. However, the challenge of validating results obtained, as well as improving the manufacture process of its main component, the tube, still remains...|$|E

The water volume changes of the inner cell and the outer cell are measured and compared on the copper specimen under compression of the inner/outer cell pressure up to 400 kPa. It is found that the volume changes of the outer cell are significant, while the volume changes of the inner cell are negligible. On the saturated marine clay, volume changes of the clay specimen under isotropic consolidation and drained axial compression are measured using two methods: the conventional method (Method A) by measuring the volume of water coming out from inside the specimen and the method (Method B) by using the DCTS to measure the internal cell water volume changes. The volume changes using the two methods are compared. It is found that the differences of the volume changes using the two methods are within 5. 6 %. The calibration results using both the solid copper specimen and the saturated marine clay specimen show that the DCTS is accurate and reliable for continuously measuring the volume changes of unsaturated or saturated soil specimens during consolidation and compression.

40|$|The report {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of computer-controlled laboratory systems for simulating the genesis of petroleum and the migration in the bedrock of the petroleum components formed. The <b>triaxial</b> <b>cells</b> of the systems work on massive rock samples at elevated temperatures (up to 350 C) and at well-controlled pressures (up to around 40. 0 MPa) and pressure gradients. Periodical computer-controlled sampling is possible during an experiment. The systems are suited for realistic simulation of natural conditions. In addition, pyrolysis experiments {{can be carried out}} for the purpose of investigating interdependences between petroleum genesis and petroleum migration. (orig. /HS) Die vorliegende Arbeit beschreibt die Entwicklung und Anwendung rechnergesteuerter Laboranlagen zur Simulation der Genese von Erdoel sowie der Migration der gebildeten Erdoelkomponenten in Muttergesteinen. Die Triaxialzellen der Anlagen arbeiten mit massiven Gesteinsproben bei erhoehten Temperaturen (bis zu 350 C) und mit gut kontrollierten Druecken (bis ca. 40. 0 MPa) und Druckgradienten. Periodische rechnergesteuerte Probennahme waehrend eines Experimentes ist moeglich. Diese Anlagen lassen die weitgehende Simulation natuerlicher Bedingungen zu. Des weiteren sind auch Pyrolyseexperimente zur Untersuchung der Wechselbeziehungen zwischen Erdoelgenese und Erdoelmigration moeglich.
