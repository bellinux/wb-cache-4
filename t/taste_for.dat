5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: his <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E

30|$|If, on {{the other}} hand, <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> work are lower for the non-employed, then the utility loss of former {{employees}} of being out of work could be higher. Since we control for various measures of health and health care usage in the analysis, differences in <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> work cannot arise due to differences in, e.g., {{the severity of the}} disability across the two groups. We maintain therefore that welfare-loss reduction is greater if the disabled non-employed are hired via the wage subsidy scheme.|$|R

One day, he prepares to attack Amir with brass knuckles, but Hassan defends Amir, threatening to shoot out Assef's eye with his slingshot. Assef backs off but swears to get revenge.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{willingness}} to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were initially met with disapproval. However, as the public's <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> realist fiction grew, this subsided. Moore began to find success as an art critic {{with the publication of}} books such as Impressions and Opinions (1891) and Modern Painting (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his literary work.|$|E
5|$|Both {{families}} were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles {{already had a}} <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> natural history and collecting {{when he joined the}} day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.|$|E

5|$|Fleming endowed Bond {{with many}} of his own traits, {{including}} sharing the same golf handicap, the <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.|$|E
5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1920, Guinness {{export sales}} were mostly to ethnic Anglo Saxons and Celts.

5|$|The European immigrant-owned bookstores {{fueled the}} demand for detective fiction, {{historical}} reading, and periodicals from Germany and England. Steimatzky, which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in the Triangle in 1925, identified the growing <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> imported newspapers and magazines and bought the franchises for many of them. The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets. For many years, the Triangle was also {{the only place where}} Jerusalem residents could purchase clothing, shoes, furniture, and household goods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In the {{presence}} of local public goods differences in tastes are an important determinant {{of the way in}} which partnerships are formed. Heterogeneity in <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> private vs. public goods produces a tendency to positive assortment and partnerships of couples with similar tastes; heterogeneity in <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> different public goods brings about partnerships of couples with similar tastes only if there is a significant overlap in the distribution of tastes of the two groups to be matched. We show that with two public goods we may get negative assortment, pure positive assortment being only one of many possibilities...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "social preferences" [...] {{refers to}} the concern (or lack thereof) that people have for each other's well-being, and it {{encompasses}} altruism, spitefulness, <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> equality, and <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> reciprocity. Experiments on social preferences generally study economic games including the dictator game, the ultimatum game, the trust game, the public goods game, and modifications to these canonical settings.As one example of results, ultimatum game experiments have shown that people are generally willing to sacrifice monetary rewards when offered low allocations, thus behaving inconsistently with simple models of self-interest. Economic experiments have measured how this deviation varies across cultures.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present a model of {{occupational}} choice in which the agents are uncertain about their wage within the occupation. Agents are assumed to know their own stock of human capital {{and the distribution of}} wages per unit of human capital in the occupation at the time of initial labor market entry. The agents decide which occupation to select based on their expected utility from each occupation, given the <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> future consumption, the available stock of human capital, the <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> the occupation, the costs of entry into the occupation, the assets available <b>for</b> consumption, the <b>tastes</b> <b>for</b> risk, and the distribution of wages within each occupation. By specifying the form of the utility function, we can derive estimable equations relating the probability of choosing an occupation, i, to the moments of the distribution of wages and the past accumulations of human capital. By imposing appropriate restrictions on the parameters of the model, both within equations and across equations, all the parameters of the structural model underlying the occupational choice may be derived...|$|R
5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired a <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels were unhappy about the darker tone of later novels such as this one.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{tradition}} originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th-century, James's <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established {{the foundations of}} the English Civil War. James bequeathed Charles a fatal belief in the divine right of kings, combined with a disdain for Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles and the abolition of the monarchy. Over the last three hundred years, the king's reputation has suffered from the acid description of him by Sir Anthony Weldon, whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern, along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E

She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences.

5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums {{of his own money}} in doing so.|$|E
