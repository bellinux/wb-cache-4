And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Dying {{stands of}} B. coccinea were {{observed}} in 1989, and the fungus Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial canker, manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would die from the top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the outer bark, orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma, however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant. This immune response, coupled {{with the fact that}} it had not been observed in the wild, led them <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} there was either a schism of the Daughters or an attempt to revitalize the Mysterious Order Witches of Salem in New England.

25|$|An SAS Sergeant {{died when}} the {{specialist}} unit raided a terrorist cell in Basra in November 2006. It was later determined {{that although the}} bullet was a ricochet and not a direct shot, {{it could have been}} friendly fire from his colleagues. However, forensic analysis of the round determined it was issued in 1994 and led investigators <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a round that had disappeared along with five SA-80 rifles from the police station in Majar al-Kabir.|$|E
25|$|His {{intentions}} were obscure. He had immediately visited Algeria and declared, Je vous ai compris—'I have understood you', and each competing interest had wished <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{them that he}} had understood. The settlers assumed he supported them, and would be stunned when he did not. In Paris, the left wanted independence for Algeria. Although the military's near-coup had contributed to his return to power, de Gaulle soon ordered all officers to quit the rebellious Committees of Public Safety. Such actions greatly angered the pieds-noirs and their military supporters.|$|E
40|$|An epistemic duty {{would be}} a duty <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> disbelieve, or {{withhold}} judgment from a proposition, and <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> grounded in purely evidential or epistemic considerations.

If my evidence is so good that, in light of it alone, I ought <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> raining, then my duty <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> supposedly is epistemic. I offer a new argument for the claim {{that there are no}} epistemic duties. Though people do sometimes have duties <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> disbelieve, or withhold judgment from propositions, those duties are never grounded in purely epistemic consideration...|$|R

25|$|In 1775, Spaniard Bruno de Heceta (also spelled Hezeta) was {{exploring}} the northwest coast of North America with the vessels Santiago and Sonora under his command. On his return journey south, {{with only the}} Santiago and a reduced crew, Heceta discovered a large bay penetrating far inland. He tried to sail in but the strong currents prevented it, even under a full press of sails. His crew was so reduced {{that they could not}} handle the anchor so he could not easily wait for better conditions. He wrote that the seething currents led him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the mouth of a great river or a passage to another sea. He named the bay Bahia de la Asunciõn and produced a map of what he could discern from outside the Columbia bar. Later Spanish maps often showed the Columbia River's estuary with the name Entrada de Hezeta, Rio de San Roque, and similar variants.|$|E

500|$|There is {{disagreement}} among scholars as {{to whether}} the knife used in this fight was the same as what is now known as a Bowie knife, also called an Arkansas Toothpick. Multiple accounts exist of who designed and built the first Bowie knife. Some claim that Bowie designed it, while others attribute the design to noted knife makers of the time. In a letter to The Planter's Advocate, Rezin Bowie claimed to have invented the knife, however, and many Bowie family members as well as [...] "most authorities on the Bowie knife tend <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> invented by" [...] Rezin. Rezin Bowie's grandchildren, however, claimed that Rezin merely supervised his blacksmith, who was the creator of the knife.|$|E

500|$|... "I'll Be Your Lover, Too" [...] was {{inspired}} by Morrison and Planet's marriage. This acoustic ballad has a moderate 4/4 tempo, with one 5/8 bar before the vocal comes in. [...] "Blue Money", a pun-filled reference to Morrison's financial situation, is about a model, perhaps his wife. (Planet worked in the industry before meeting Morrison.) [...] "Sweet Jannie" [...] is the second twelve-bar blues on the album; written about young love, the song is another that reviewers speculated was about Planet. The lyrics, [...] "I've {{been in love with}} you baby / Ever since you were in Sunday school" [...] lead Clinton Heylin <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written about memories from Morrison's childhood when he attended Sunday school in Belfast; Planet is a California-raised Texan.|$|E
500|$|... "The Man Trap" [...] was {{the sixth}} episode produced. Although Rodenberry {{initially}} disagreed with NBC's decision, he and producer Herbert Franklin Solow came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the correct choice. Shatner also {{disagreed with the}} network, feeling that [...] "The Man Trap" [...] was the worst episode out of those available. The episode was the first episode of Star Trek broadcast in the United States, on NBC on September 8, 1966. [...] "The Man Trap" [...] formed part of NBC's [...] "Sneak a Peak Week", in which the network showed the premiere episodes of several new shows in prime time slots, ahead of the rival channels ABC and CBS, who were still showing repeats from the previous season. Leading into Star Trek was the first episode of Tarzan showing Ron Ely, and leading out was Richard Mulligan's The Hero.|$|E
500|$|Some of Alexander's strongest {{personality}} traits formed {{in response to}} his parents. His mother had huge ambitions, and encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire. Olympias' influence instilled a sense of destiny in him, and Plutarch tells how his ambition [...] "kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years". However, his father Philip was Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds. Alexander's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to out-do his father, illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle. While Alexander worried that his father would leave him [...] "no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world", he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions.|$|E

500|$|The Richard Riot {{has taken}} on a {{significance}} greater than a mere sports riot in the sixty years since it happened. The sight of French Quebecers rioting over the perceived slight to a Quebec cultural icon like Richard led many commentators <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a significant factor in Quebec's Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. Furthermore, the cause of the riot has been suggested not to be {{as a result of the}} severity of the suspension; what mattered was that the anglophone president of an anglophone league had suspended a Quebec player. French Canadians saw themselves as inherently disadvantaged within Canada and North America as a whole. Richard was seen as a hero by French Canadians, and almost a sort of a [...] "revenge" [...] against the anglophone establishment. The riot was a clear sign of rising ethnic tensions in Quebec. In an article published four days after the riot, journalist André Laurendeau was the first to suggest the riot was a sign of growing nationalism in Quebec. Entitled [...] "On a tué mon frère Richard" [...] (My brother Richard has been killed), Laurendeau suggested the riot [...] "betrayed what lay behind the apparent indifference and long-held passiveness of French Canadians".|$|E
500|$|Her {{marriage}} to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897, when Victoria {{returned home from}} a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst {{in bed with a}} male servant. She did not make her accusation public, but told a niece that [...] "no boy was safe, from the stable hands to the kitchen help. He slept quite openly with them all." [...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. If I had not loved her so, I would have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe. Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than [...] "the general disgrace of a divorce." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...]30 Carbine {{cartridge}} {{was developed}} by Winchester and is basically a rimless [...]30 caliber (7.62mm) version of the much older [...]32 Winchester Self-Loading cartridge of 1906 introduced for the Winchester Model 1905 rifle. The [...]30 Carbine uses a lighter bullet and more modern powder. As a result, it is approximately 600 feet per second faster and 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. The [...]30 Carbine's relatively straight case and the rounded nose of its bullet led some <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> designed for use in pistols.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Alternative Trading Organizations faced major challenges: {{the novelty of}} some fair trade {{products}} began to wear off, demand reached a plateau, and some handicrafts began to look [...] "tired and old fashioned" [...] in the marketplace. The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, several fair trade supporters during this period were worried by the contemporary effect on small farmers of structural reforms in the agricultural sector {{as well as the}} fall in commodity prices. Many of them came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the movement's responsibility to address the issue and remedies usable in the ongoing crisis in the industry.|$|E

He made this gesture of total subservience to politics after years as an anarchist despising and denouncing politics. But he could not transfer his genius from art to politics. The stirring drawings were replaced by boring and banal speeches. He had none of the gifts of the natural politician, his stock in trade was limited to platitudes and slogans. The wild man, tamed, became a political hack. If as an anarchist he had believed that politics was a filthy business, as a Communist he still seemed <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> — only now it was his business." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{material}} {{that made it}} onto the album proper was released as Falling Into Infinity, which received a mixed reception from fans who were {{more familiar with the}} band's earlier sound. While the album was moderately progressive-sounding, tracks such as [...] "Hollow Years" [...] and [...] "You Not Me" [...] prompted some <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the dawn of a new, mainstream-sounding Dream Theater. Overall, the album was both a critical and commercial disappointment. Although Portnoy did not speak out publicly at the time, he later revealed in the 2004 DVD commentary for 5 Years in a Livetime, that he had been so discouraged during this period that he had considered disbanding Dream Theater altogether.|$|E
