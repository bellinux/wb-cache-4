Turbocharging {{is used as}} a means to {{downsize}} petrol engines, thereby, producing more power for a lower engine size, when compared with a naturally aspirated engine. The introduction of a turbocharger means that a throttle body is included in the petrol engine downstream of the turbocharger compressor. Due to the presence of this throttle valve, flow is restricted through the outlet pipe of the turbocharger during low load engine operation. For example, during transient tip out – tip in maneuvers. Hence, there is a chance of the turbocharger operating in near surge or surge conditions. Surge noise generated during this stage is clearly audible and can also affect the durable life of the compressor and other rotor systems of the turbocharger. This paper describes an experimental method to predict and measure the turbocharger surge noise. An experimental <b>turbocharger</b> <b>noise</b> rig, designed and built for this purpose, is explained. Using a time and frequency analysis of the measured data the fundamental mechanism of noise generation is identified. Finally, a passive solution to reduce the surge noise is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Engine {{downsizing}} is {{undertaken in the}} automotive industry {{in order to reduce}} the emissions and the fuel consumption of the vehicle. Turbocharging is one of the important methods to enable downsizing of the engine; however, increased noise is the side-effect of this introduction. The noise generation is assumed to be due to the operation of turbocharger very close to the surge zone of the compressor map. For example, the compressor map is typically measured under static laboratory test conditions and may be different in the dynamic environment of the intake system during engine operation. The aim of this paper is to outline the methods used by the authors to predict and measure the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>noise</b> generation and also to understand its fundamental mechanism. A naturally aspirated car is chosen to measure the noise generated at the intake system as a starting point. Analysis methods such as STFT for the acquired data measured are explained. This will form a basis for further analysis on a turbocharged car. A simulation methodology is outlined in order to predict the noise generation mechanism. The static pressures predicted on various locations of intake system, such as upstream and downstream of compressor, are processed to obtain estimates of the sound pressure in both the frequency and the time domains. A modular turbocharger rig is designed to study the intake system dynamics during compressor surge operation and to further understand the noise generation mechanism. The paper is concluded by listing the future work planned...|$|E

Turbocharging {{is used as a}} means to downsize petrol engines, thereby, producing more power for a lower engine size, when compared with a naturally aspirated engine. Due to the presence of a throttle valve in the intake system in petrol engines, flow is restricted at the outlet pipe of the compressor during low load engine operation. For example, during transient tip out tip in maneuvers. Hence, there is a chance of the turbocharger operating in near surge or surge conditions and, thus, generating surge noise. This Thesis describes an experimental and simulation method to predict and measure the turbocharger surge noise. Initially, experimental transient tip-in and tip-out maneuver was performed on a non turbocharged car with a petrol engine. The measured noise level in the intake manifold, at a low frequency of up to 1200 Hz, was analysed and was shown not to represent surge noise. Next, a one dimensional simulation method was applied to simulate the noise of the engine and this demonstrated an increase in the acoustic pressure level in the intake manifold during the tip in and tip out maneuver. However, a surge noise pattern was not observed in the analysis of acoustic pressure signals in the intake system using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The simulation procedure was also used to inform the design of an experimental rig to recreate the surge noise under laboratory conditions. An experimental <b>turbocharger</b> <b>noise</b> rig, designed and built for this purpose, is explained in the Thesis. Important component parts likely {{to be involved in the}} surge noise generation such as the intake system, compressor, throttle body, compressor recirculation valve and measurement and control systems were integrated into the test rig. Background noise contributions from the electric motor, AC mains, supercharger pulley, throttle body, inverter fan, throttle body gearing and structural vibration of the supporting structure were identified from the analysed frequency components of the signals from surface microphone measurements taken at the intake system. This helped to clearly identify the surge noise frequency components (3250 Hz) in the STFT analysis. The fundamental mechanism of noise generation was identified using an analysis of the experimental results and a frequency calculation for vortex shedding and the radial acoustic resonances. One of the main conclusions of the Thesis is that the compressor recirculation valve (CRV) open or close position, the CRV delay time and the throttle position are major contributing factors to the cause of the surge noise. Another major conclusion is that the radial acoustic resonance may be a mechanism of surge noise generation. Finally, a passive solution to reduce the surge noise is proposed. A pipe with cross ribs is designed as a passive solution using the radial acoustic resonance calculation and the corresponding nodal patterns. This solution demonstrated a measured intake system noise reduction of up to 10 dB under compressor surge conditions...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} here quantifies the forces {{applied to the}} main bearings of three six-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines and reviews their exciting properties in both time and frequency domains. The engine structure response at the bearing supports and the outer surfaces are correlated. Vibration acceleration was measured, in the three different directions, at the engine main bearings and the outer surface. The liner vibrations were also measured. A theoretical model for calculating the bearing forces and estimating the bearing moment characteristics is proposed. The calculated bearing forces are investigated in both time and frequency domains. The characteristics of the forces driving the piston across the cylinder clearance are calculated. The characteristics of the forces acting on the liner by the piston are also calculated. Combining {{the results of the}} measurements with the theoretical model for force calculation, a technique for estimating the actual running clearance of the piston is presented. A technique for deriving the displacement from the measured acceleration is developed. By representing the engine response in terms of displacement it is possible to recognise the applied force time history and thus the identification of the specific parts of the engine structure primarily excited by moments and by direct force. It is shown that the engine structure response is a transient phenomenon and is maximum {{in the vicinity of the}} applied force. The displacement technique for quantifying engine response provides detailed information of the distortion of the running engine enabling the prediction of mechanical inputs which control the <b>turbocharged</b> engine <b>noise...</b>|$|R
40|$|Control of {{performance}} and transient emissions from turbocharged diesel engines is an important objective for automotive manufacturers, since stringent criteria for exhaust emissions must be met. In particular, (cold) starting is of exceptional importance owing to its {{significant contribution to the}} overall emissions during a transient test cycle. In the present work, experimental tests were conducted on a turbocharged and after-cooled bus-truck diesel engine in order to investigate the engine operating behaviour and the formation mechanisms of nitric oxide, smoke, and combustion noise during cold, warm, and hot starting. With this as a target, a fully instrumented test bed was set up, using ultra-fast response analysers capable of capturing the instantaneous development of emissions and various key engine and turbocharger parameters. The experimental test pattern included a variety of starting conditions, defined by the thermal status of the engine (i. e. the coolant temperature) and its idling speed. As expected, turbocharger lag was found to be the major contributor for the pollutant emissions spikes in all cases, with the thermal status of the engine and its idling speed playing important roles in the combustion (in) stability, <b>turbocharger</b> response, and <b>noise</b> radiation...|$|R
40|$|In {{search for}} quieter engines {{there is a}} need for a better {{understanding}} of the acoustic properties of engine intake and exhaust system components. Besides mufflers which have the purpose of reducing pressure pulses originating from the internal combustion (IC) engine, there are many components in a modern car exhaust and intake system, e. g., air-filters, coolers, catalytic converters, particulate filters - all having an effect on the pressure pulses or sound field in the system. In this work the focus is on the turbocharged IC-engine where both, sound scattering (reflection and transmission) and sound generation from automotive turbochargers are studied. In addition, sound reflection from an open ended pipe, such as the tailpipe of an IC-engine exhaust is investigated.             Accurate and efficient methods to fully characterize turbochargers by measuring the acoustic two-port have been developed.   Compared to earlier work, a number of modifications are suggested for improving the quality of the results. A study on three different automotive turbochargers is also presented, including data for sound scattering for both the compressor and turbine. The results for the transmission of sound, which is of interest for the ability of a <b>turbocharger</b> to reduce <b>noise</b> coming from the engine, is plotted for all tested cases against a dimensionless frequency scale (Helmholtz-number). This makes it possible to generalize the result in order to draw conclusions about the behavior for any turbocharger.               The sound generation was also studied and three different methods to estimate the sound power are suggested. The methods were used to investigate sound generation at different operating points and identify source mechanisms for a turbocharger compressor.             An accurate method for measuring the reflection of plane acoustic waves from a pipe termination in a duct with hot gas flow has been developed and tested. Representing the acoustical conditions at an exhaust tail-pipe, the data obtained is important for effective modeling of exhaust systems. The experimental results of the reflection coefficient were compared with Munt`s theory on flow duct openings. The measurements were carried out for air jet velocities up to Mach 0. 4 and for flow temperatures up to 100 °C in order to study temperature effects on the reflection properties. It was concluded, that the experimental results agree well with the Munt theory...|$|R
