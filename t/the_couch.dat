5|$|Georgia Tech {{also has}} a music scene that {{is made up of}} groups that operate {{independently}} from the Music Department. These groups include four student-led a cappella groups: Nothin' but Treble, Sympathetic Vibrations, Taal Tadka, and Infinite Harmony. Musician's Network, another student-led group, operates Under <b>the</b> <b>Couch,</b> a live music venue and recording facility that was formerly located beneath <b>the</b> <b>Couch</b> Building on West Campus and is now located in the Student Center.|$|E

5|$|Cavaliers {{are active}} and sporting. Cavaliers are {{successful}} in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> or taking long walks.|$|E
50|$|Many stratigraphic {{formations}} in {{the western}} Alps were first described by Trümpy. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de l’Aroley, <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> des Marmontains and <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de St Cristoph.|$|R
30|$|Both wells (GPK- 1 and GPK- 2) {{show the}} {{presence}} of fracture zones at the transition between <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> Intermédiaires and <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Karlstal, and in GPK- 1, another fracture zone is present in <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Trifels (Fig.  4).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Couches</b> des Marmontains are a {{sedimentary}} formation deposited {{during the middle}} Cretaceous (Albian to Cenomanian). It consists of sandstones and black shales. The formation is 5 to 30 m thick. <b>The</b> <b>Couches</b> des Marmontains overly <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de l’Aroley and underlie <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Saint Christophe. All three units together make up the post-rift sequence of the Valais ocean. Outcrops can be found north of Bourg-Saint-Maurice.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sugar and Spice, {{played by}} Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar, try out the Riddler's device during the montage {{when it goes}} on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. This scene appears in the comic {{adaptation}} {{but not in the}} final film.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{involving}} Chase Meridian on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> originally {{included a}} longer ending where the Riddler injects {{her with a}} green sleeping agent so he can easily place her in the small tube with the trap door.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Couches</b> de Saint Christophe are a {{sedimentary}} formation deposited between the Late Cretaceous and the Paleogene. It {{is a very}} monotonous sequence of calcitic sandstones and black schists. These are interpreted as a turbidite sequence. The average thickness of the unit is 500 m. <b>The</b> <b>Couches</b> de Saint Christophe are a post-rift sequence that overlies <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> des Marmontains.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>couching</b> threads may {{be either}} {{the same color}} as the laid threads or a {{contrasting}} color. When couching threads contrast with laid threads, patterns may be worked in <b>the</b> <b>couching</b> stitches.|$|R
30|$|The EPS- 1 drill-core {{analysis}} of the Buntsandstein was used to identify {{the boundaries of the}} Grès Vosgien. This unit is composed of <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Karlstal (poorly cemented aeolian facies), <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Rehberg (fluvial facies) and <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Trifels (fluvial facies). These pink to red-brown sandstone formations are very similar to each other and the proportion of feldspar is basically the same from the top to the base of these units. The GR log has an overall consistent value, except for the transition between <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Rehberg and Couches de Trifels, which is characterized by three well-developed (up to 20  cm thick) red clays that produce rightwards-directed peak in both GR logs and that are evident in the EPS- 1 cores.|$|R
5|$|While {{lying on}} <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> at home, Homer sees a {{recruitment}} advertisement on television for the Naval Reserve {{and decides to}} enlist. Moe, Barney, and Apu decide to join him. Meanwhile, Bart purchases an earring, which an outraged Homer confiscates.|$|E

Meanwhile, Tunny is deployed to a war zone, and is soon shot and wounded ("Give Me Novacaine").|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>couch</b> gag was {{suggested}} by Dan Castellaneta's niece. The film True Lies was {{the inspiration for}} the bus crashing against the bridge. To get the fisherman's Chinese correct, Cohen called his friend. When the Chinese actors came, the actors felt Cantonese would be more appropriate for the fisherman than Mandarin, so it was changed. Moe was picked to rescue the children, because the writers thought it was funny.|$|E

50|$|In Underside couching, a heavy couching thread (historically, a stout linen) {{is brought}} {{up from the}} wrong side of the work, looped over the laid thread, and {{returned}} to the wrong side. <b>The</b> <b>couching</b> thread is then given a sharp pull which draws a small loop of laid thread through to {{the wrong side of}} <b>the</b> fabric. Underside <b>couching</b> has <b>the</b> advantages that <b>the</b> <b>couching</b> thread is completely concealed from the front and is not subject to wear.|$|R
5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{finds out}} that Selma might have {{disappeared}} {{to get away from}} her husband. Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce that it is a date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl about the dead member, and she implies that others believe that something happened to her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten years would be beneficial to Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her with knowledge of a lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{said that}} he understands Mandarin, though he could use some help {{speaking}} it; he can also read and write a little. He took a few Mandarin classes while attending Harvard to try to improve. After joining the Knicks in 2012, Lin slept on a couch in his brother's one-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City. The night before his breakout game, he slept on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> of teammate Landry Fields.

5|$|Some of Bellerophons timber {{was bought}} at auction by George Bellamy, {{who had been}} Bellerophons surgeon at the Nile. Bellamy {{incorporated}} them into a cottage he was building at Plymstock. Captain Maitland bought part of her figurehead {{and some of her}} stern ornaments, later depositing them in the collections of what eventually became the Royal Naval Museum. The National Maritime Museum holds several relics relating to Bellerophon and the people connected with her, including Captain John Cooke's dirk, sword and pistol, and a trophy presented to Admiral Pasley by Lloyd's of London. Their collections also contain artefacts relating to her connection with Napoleon, including <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> from Maitland's cabin, and the skull of a goat which supplied milk for Napoleon and his suite.|$|E
5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> three crew <b>couches</b> were {{constructed}} from hollow steel tubing {{and covered in}} a heavy, fireproof cloth known as Armalon. The leg pans of <b>the</b> two outer <b>couches</b> could be folded {{in a variety of}} positions, while the hip pan of <b>the</b> center <b>couch</b> could be disconnected and laid on the aft bulkhead. One rotation and one translation hand controller was installed on the armrests of <b>the</b> left-hand <b>couch.</b> <b>The</b> translation controller was used by the crew member performing the LM docking maneuver, usually the CM Pilot. The center and right-hand couches had duplicate rotational controllers. <b>The</b> <b>couches</b> were supported by eight shock-attenuating struts, designed to ease the impact of touchdown on water or, {{in case of an emergency}} landing, on solid ground.|$|R

5|$|Homer trips over Bart's {{skateboard}} {{and falls}} down the stairs, hurting his back, and {{is confined to}} <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> for several days. Marge sends Bart to clean his room and while doing so, he discovers an old cherry bomb among his things. At school the next day, he decides to flush it down the toilet in the boys' restroom with friends, Milhouse, Richard and Lewis. On the same day, Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is visiting the school and Bart ends up pulling his prank the same time Agnes is using the facilities in an adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off of her seat and enrages Principal Skinner. In order to punish him, Principal Skinner proposes deportation to Homer and Marge, by having Bart participate in a foreign exchange program. They decide to send Bart to France, while the Simpsons host a student from the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, named Adil Hoxha. Bart is shown {{a picture of a}} lovely château in the heart of France and he immediately agrees to go, much to Homer and Skinner's delight.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{he began}} his comedy career by {{following}} up on a suggestion by David Lawrence (a disc jockey friend who had been paying Drew to write jokes for David's radio show in Cleveland) {{to go to the}} library and borrow books on how to write jokes. The following year, after winning an open-microphone contest, he became Master of Ceremonies at the Cleveland Comedy Club. He performed at comedy clubs {{over the next few years}} in Cleveland and Los Angeles. He first came to the national eye as a comedian when he competed in the 1988 Star Search. Carey was working as a stand-up comedian when he appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in November 1991. His performance that night impressed Carson, who invited Carey to <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> next to his desk; this was considered a rare honor for any comedian. In that same year, Carey joined the 14th Annual Young Comedians Special on HBO and made his first appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. In 1994, Carey wrote his own stand-up comedy special, Drew Carey: Human Cartoon, which aired on Showtime and won a CableACE Award for Best Writing.|$|E
5|$|Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids {{travel to}} Mos Eisley {{to find a}} pilot {{to take them to}} Alderaan. At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below.
