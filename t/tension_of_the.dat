5|$|At higher pressures, skin <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bubble nuclei reduces gas {{diffusion}} to a slower rate. The model assumes that bubble skins are stabilized by surfactants over calculable times scales, {{which results in}} variable persistence of the bubble nuclei in the tissues.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of his}} life, Yeats {{was a member of}} the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Due to the {{escalating}} <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the Easter Rising, even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is one of}} many {{substitutes}} for mercury in alkaline batteries to prevent the zinc from corroding and releasing hydrogen gas. Indium is added to some dental amalgam alloys to decrease the surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mercury and allow for less mercury and easier amalgamation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, social <b>tensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rapidly industrializing city {{absorbing}} waves {{of new immigrants}} and migrants broke out in riots between ethnic minorities. [...] The riots included extensive property damage and some deaths.|$|R
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night raid.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves {{control all}} intrinsic {{muscles of the}} larynx except for the cricothyroid muscle. These muscles act to open, close, and adjust the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vocal cords, and include the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscle to open the vocal cords. The nerves supply muscles {{on the same side}} of the body, with the exception of the interarytenoid muscle, which is innervated from both sides.|$|E
5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War, the cabaret {{split up}} amid <b>the</b> {{political}} <b>tensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War. While {{some of its}} members sided with the political left, those in opposition founded the Cabaret Fédéral in 1949.|$|R
50|$|From {{the middle}} 1980s, and {{especially}} during <b>the</b> 1990s, number <b>of</b> Catholics in <b>the</b> territory <b>of</b> this diocese decreased due to various reasons, including low birth rates among local Roman Catholics, economic emigration, and ethnic <b>tensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav wars.|$|R
50|$|For this launch, Cape Canaveral {{director}} Kurt Debus asked Marshall Space Flight Center director Wernher von Braun, who was {{overseeing the}} Saturn project, that no outside visitors be allowed on NASA grounds due to <b>the</b> ongoing <b>tensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cuban missile crisis.|$|R
5|$|Reports were sketchy {{initially}} – television pictures {{broadcast on}} ITV showed Stein, {{who appeared to}} be both conscious and alert, being carried down the tunnel by a number of police officers, with commentator Brian Moore speculating that he had been overcome with the emotion of the result. BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information from other people in the press box) also speculated that the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering the dressing room to tell them that Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E
30|$|The {{automatic}} system {{was used to}} monitor <b>the</b> horizontal displacements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canvas fibers during the tensioning tests. The experiments aimed to provide detailed information for <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residual elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fibers, so to optimally set <b>the</b> <b>tensioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canvas.|$|R
30|$|Suprapubic urinary {{drainage}} guarantees undisturbed miction despite intensive <b>tensioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> threads {{and makes}} postoperative {{introduction of a}} transurethral catheter during the tensioning phase unnecessary, as this could cause necrosis due to the urethra wall becoming trapped between transurethral catheter and pluggable segmented dummy.|$|R
50|$|Composed {{in early}} 1939, in Paris, amid <b>the</b> <b>tensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{impending}} war, {{it was the}} first work Rodrigo wrote for guitar and orchestra.

5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E
25|$|The terse Terem Scene of the 1869 {{version and}} the unrelieved <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two {{subsequent}} and final scenes make this version more dramatically effective to some critics (e.g., Boris Asafyev).|$|E
25|$|In navicular {{suspensory}} desmotomy, the ligaments {{supporting the}} navicular bone are severed. This makes the navicular bone more mobile, and thus reduces the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other ligaments. It is successful {{about half of}} the time.|$|E
50|$|Historian Roland Bainton saw {{the revolt}} as a {{struggle}} that {{began as an}} upheaval immersed in <b>the</b> rhetoric <b>of</b> Luther's Protestant Reformation against the Catholic Church but which really was impelled far beyond the narrow religious confines by <b>the</b> underlying economic <b>tensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|R

25|$|By far {{the most}} common type of timpani used today is the pedal timpani, which allows the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head to be {{adjusted}} using a pedal mechanism. Typically, the pedal is connected to the tension screws via an assembly of either cast metal or metal rods called the spider.|$|E
25|$|Surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid at the {{interface}} between the bubble and the surroundings. This is along {{the surface of the}} bubble, so the resultant acts towards the centre of curvature. This will tend to squeeze the bubble, and is more severe for small bubbles as it is an inverse function of the radius.|$|E
25|$|The fixed village loom is used {{mainly in}} Iran and {{consists}} of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two sidepieces. The correct <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.|$|E
25|$|In Germany Neue Sachlichkeit ("New Objectivity") {{emerged as}} Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz and others {{associated}} with the Berlin Secession politicized their paintings. <b>The</b> work <b>of</b> these artists grew out of expressionism, and {{was a response to}} <b>the</b> political <b>tensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Weimar Republic, and was often sharply satirical.|$|R
25|$|Modern tactics for knife combat were {{developed}} by two British members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shanghai Municipal Police <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Settlement in the 1920s.

25|$|Double-action {{triggers}} {{provide the}} ability to fire the gun whether the hammer is cocked or uncocked. This feature is desirable for military, police, or self-defense pistols. The primary disadvantage of any double-action trigger is the extra length the trigger must be pulled and the extra weight required to overcome the spring <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hammer or striker.|$|E
25|$|Anchorages are constructed, {{usually in}} tandem with the towers, to resist the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cables and form as the main anchor system for the entire structure. These are usually {{anchored}} in good quality rock, but may consist of massive reinforced concrete deadweights within an excavation. The anchorage structure will have multiple protruding open eyebolts enclosed within a secure space.|$|E
25|$|Steel truss {{cantilevers}} support loads by <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper {{members and}} compression {{of the lower}} ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore statically determinate with no members carrying mixed loads.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{considering}} <b>the</b> anatomy <b>of</b> native MPFL as a thin fascial band, hamstring tendons fail {{to reproduce}} basic anatomic features. Being thick, cord-like and much stronger, reconstruction with hamstring grafts {{can lead to}} medial patellar overload and excessive <b>tensioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graft, thus causing graft failure with <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> patellofemoral arthritis.|$|R
