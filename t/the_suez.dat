5|$|Euryalus and Bacchante were {{transferred}} to Egypt in late January 1915 to reinforce the defences of <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal, although the Turkish raid on <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal had already been repulsed {{by the time that}} they arrived in February. Upon arrival Rear-Admiral Richard Peirse, commander of the East Indies Station, hoisted his flag in Euryalus. By this time the preliminary bombardments of the Turkish defences of the Dardanelles had already occurred, and the sisters {{were transferred}} north in March as the Turks east of the Canal proved to be reasonably quiet.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Sir Archibald Murray, the Imperial Commander in Chief of Egypt, {{partially}} {{addressed the}} threat of von Kressenstein's forces to <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal by organising the defences into three sectors. No. 1 (Southern) sector, with its headquarters at Suez, covered the area from Suez to Kabrit, No. 2 (Central) sector, with its headquarters at Ismailia, covered the area from Kabrit to Ferdan, and No. 3 (Northern) sector, with its headquarters at Port Said, covered the area from Ferdan to Port Said. The No. 3 sector also had an advanced headquarters at Kantara. To support these forward defences, the British Empire improved their lines of communication by doubling the single railway line that ran from Cairo to <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal, and also pumped water from the River Nile along the Sweet Water Canal to supply the troops and the towns on <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal.|$|E

According to historian Gammal Hammad, Egypt's principal ports, Alexandria and Port Safaga, remained open to shipping throughout the war. Throughout the war, the Israeli Navy enjoyed complete command of the seas both in the Mediterranean approaches and in <b>the</b> Gulf of <b>Suez.</b>|$|R

5|$|The 1880s {{also saw}} the {{beginnings}} of the Asian oil trade. The idea that led to moving Russian oil to the Far East via <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal was the brainchild of two men: importer Marcus Samuel and shipowner/broker Fred Lane. Prior bids to move oil through the canal had been rejected by <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal Company as being too risky. Samuel approached the problem a different way: asking the company for the specifications of a tanker it would allow through the canal.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ismailia {{took place}} between the Egyptian Army and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) during the last stages of the Yom Kippur War during October 18–22, 1973, {{south of the city}} of Ismailia, on the west bank of <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal in Egypt. The battle itself took place as part of the larger IDF-launched Operation Abiray-Lev, in an attempt to seize Ismailia and thereby sever the {{logistical}} and supply lines of most of Egypt's Second Field Army across <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Katia, {{also known}} as the Affair of Qatia by the British, was an {{engagement}} fought east of <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal and north of El Ferdan Station, in the vicinity of Katia and Oghratina, on 23 April 1916 during the Defence of <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal Campaign of World War I. An Ottoman force led by the German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein made a surprise attack on three and a half squadrons of the British 5th Mounted Brigade, which was widely scattered to the east of Romani. The mounted brigade had been ordered to the area to protect the new railway and water pipeline being built from Kantara on <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal, as this infrastructure extended out past the Canal's zone of defences into the Sinai Peninsula towards Romani. Kress Von Kressenstein's attack was completely successful, decimating the equivalent of little more than a regiment. On the same day, an associated Ottoman attack on Duidar, very close to <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal, failed when it met with strong British opposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} an Ottoman attack towards <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal had been {{considered}} by Lawrence in consultation with his divisional commanders, and a second defensive area was developed to address their concerns. Their plans took into account {{the possibility of an}} Ottoman army at Katia moving to attack Romani or following the old caravan route to assault Hill 70 and Dueidar on their way to <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal. Any attempt to bypass Romani on the right flank would be open to attack from the garrison, which could send out infantry and mounted troops on the hard ground in the plain to the south-west. The New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade was stationed at Hill 70 at the end of June and the 5th Light Horse Regiment at Dueidar to prevent such an Ottoman force from reaching <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal.|$|E

Due to its natural harbour with relatively deep and well sheltered water, the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay. In 1883, Sabang quay was opened for ships to dock by the Atjeh Associate.

The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF).

However, Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from <b>the</b> <b>Suez</b> Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow.
