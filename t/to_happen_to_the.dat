5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds {{of all kinds}} are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they have {{to cut through the}} riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} edition, {{things have changed}} substantially. The game still runs on six-sided dice, but now each task is given a threshold. The player then rolls dice equal to their skill plus the {{relevant}} attribute modified by applicable modifiers. The number of fives and sixes {{is equal to the}} number of hits. Hits above the threshold indicate extraordinary performance. Furthermore, if more than half the dice rolled are ones, then the player has made a glitch. Glitches cause bad things <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player and game masters are encouraged to be inventive and funny.|$|E
25|$|No {{declaration}} of trust is the most straightforward form of resulting trust, and is created when a trust is created, but the settlor does not give the form in which the property is to be held. For example, the settlor might give property to the beneficiary to hold for life, but fail to explain what is <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> property when the holder dies. When this occurs, the property is held on resulting trust for the settlor, as in Vandervell v IRC. This also occurs where a trust is formed over property which requires formality, but is improperly created (for example, a land transfer that does not adhere to the Law of Property Act 1925).|$|E

25|$|In December 1936, Henry's brother Edward VIII abdicated {{the throne}} to marry divorcée Wallis Simpson. While the {{consequences}} of the abdication crisis weighed much more heavily on his brother Prince Albert, who became King George VI, Prince Henry also suffered from the outcome. Apart from the deep personal shock to the whole royal family, the abdication meant the end of Henry's military career. Although third in line to the throne, following his two nieces Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, he became the first adult in line, meaning he would act as regent if anything were <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King before Princess Elizabeth came of age on 21 April 1944, her 18th birthday. Because of this, Prince Henry could not leave England {{at the same time as}} the King. Furthermore, he and his younger brother, the Duke of Kent, had to increase their royal engagements considerably to support the new King.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} supernatural {{entities}} {{are believed to}} exist; they make themselves known by means of inexplicable sounds or happenings. Among these phenomena are khmaoc (ghosts), pret and besach (particularly nasty demons, the spirits {{of people who have}} died violent, untimely, or unnatural deaths), arak (evil spirits, usually female), neak ta (tutelary spirits residing in inanimate objects), mneang phteah (guardians of the house), meba (ancestral spirits), and mrenh kongveal (elf-like guardians of animals). All spirits must be shown proper respect, and, {{with the exception of the}} mneang phteah and mrenh kongveal, they can cause trouble ranging from mischief to serious life-threatening illnesses. An important way for living people to show respect for the spirits of the dead is to provide food for the spirits. If this food is not provided, the spirit can cause trouble for the offending person. For example, if a child does not provide food for the spirit of its dead mother, that spirit can cause misfortunes <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> child.|$|E
25|$|On 13 June de Gaulle {{attended}} another Anglo-French {{conference at}} Tours with Churchill, Lord Halifax, Lord Beaverbrook, Spears, Ismay and Alexander Cadogan. This time few other major French figures were present apart from Reynaud and Baudoin. He was an hour late, and his account is not reliable. Reynaud demanded that France {{be released from}} the agreement which he had made with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in March 1940, so that France could seek an armistice. De Gaulle wrote that Churchill was sympathetic to France seeking an armistice, provided that an agreement was reached about what was <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French fleet. This claim was later made by apologists for the Vichy Regime, e.g. General Georges, who claimed that Churchill had supported the armistice {{as a means of}} keeping the Germans out of French North Africa. However, is not supported by other eyewitnesses (Churchill himself, Roland de Margerie, Spears) who agree that Churchill said that he “understood” the French action but that he did not agree with it. He murmured at de Gaulle that he was “l’homme du destin (the man of destiny)”, although it is unclear whether de Gaulle actually heard him. At the Cabinet meeting that evening Pétain strongly supported Weygand’s demand for an armistice, and said that he himself would remain in France to share the suffering of the French people and to begin the national rebirth. De Gaulle was dissuaded from resigning by the Interior Minister Georges Mandel, who argued that the war was only just beginning, and that de Gaulle needed to keep his reputation unsullied.|$|E

500|$|The Mana {{series has}} been mostly well received, though each title has seen varied levels of success.

The game has appeared on several list of top games, including ranked number 97 on Famitsus top 100 games of all time. Seiken Densetsu 3 was called [...] "easily {{one of the best}} RPGs to come out of the 16-bit era" [...] by Nintendo Life. Famitsu rated Legend of Mana at 31/40 and Heroes of Mana at 32/40. [...] The NPD Group ranked Legend of Mana as the top seller the week of its release, and in 2006 was re-released as part of the Ultimate Hits series.|$|E

500|$|Just as the Save Our Children {{campaign}} was a motivational force for conservative Christians, {{it was also}} one for gay and lesbian politics. Fejes writes, [...] "While the Stonewall riots of 1969 may have {{marked the beginning of}} the modern lesbian and gay movement, the campaigns of 1977 and 1978 marked the emergence of a national politically self-conscious lesbian and gay community". The birth of a political life for gays and lesbians gave opportunities for national networking as Anita Bryant and those who followed her acted as a virtual lightning rod, attracting a collective anger. Thirty years after the campaign, the Stonewall Library & Archives sponsored an exhibition of the events surrounding the Save Our Children campaign and displayed it at the Broward County Public Library. According to the curator of the exhibit, Bryant is considered [...] "the best thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gay rights movement. She and her cohorts were so over the top that it just completely galvanized the gay rights movement".|$|E

GamesRadar described Leon's Resident Evil 4 design as [...] "David Bowie piloting the Memphis Belle", stating that, while it was appealing, the hairstyle required modifications for encounters in the games. In 2010, Game Informer chose Leon as one of the 20 Capcom characters they would like to see in a rumored crossover fighting game titled Namco Vs Capcom, his Namco equivalent being Nightmare from the Soul series: [...] "The only man with enough experience and courage to take out this mutated menace is none other than Leon S. Kennedy. We bet this fight ends with a rocket launcher." [...] In 2011, Ryan Woo of Complex ranked Leon among the fourth most stylish video game character, opining he the best dressed person in the Resident Evil series and [...] "Jill just looks goofy in comparison." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} highly positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called [...] "Broke" [...] a [...] "great, great" [...] episode, {{although he}} said he wished the Michael Scott Paper Company arc could have lasted longer. Sepinwall praised touches such as the Korean women who were constantly getting into the sales van, and Michael's moment of nervousness on the elevator, and said the ending when Michael came through was particularly satisfying. Will Leitch of New York magazine described [...] "Broke" [...] as [...] "a rousing, exuberant episode that continues one of The Offices best runs in history". Leitch said the negotiations during {{the latter half of}} the episode had genuine tension, and that all the storylines of the Michael Scott Paper Company arc were wrapped up perfectly. Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode was strong enough that it could have served as the season finale. He said the episode had lots of good throw-away moments, like Charles brown-nosing to David and realizing Dwight is eccentric, as well as several clever twists, like Jim's actions in tricking Dwight and helping the Michael Scott Paper Company get bought out. Eric Rezsnyak of the City Newspaper said the episode was a strong finale to the Michael Scott Paper Company arc, which was [...] "probably the best thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> show in the last two seasons". Rezsnyak praised Michael's impressive actions in the episode and said he was curious to see how Michael's relationship with several of the supporting characters would be recast as a result of this episode.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of Subterranean Jungle, Marky was fired from the band due to his alcoholism. He was {{replaced}} by Richard Reinhardt, who adopted the name Richie Ramone. Joey Ramone remarked that [...] " [...] saved the band as far as I'm concerned. He's the greatest thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ramones. He put the spirit back in the band." [...] Richie is the only Ramones drummer to sing lead vocals on Ramones songs, including [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice" [...] {{as well as the}} unreleased [...] "Elevator Operator". Joey Ramone commented, [...] "Richie's very talented and he's very diverse... He really strengthened the band a hundred percent because he sings backing tracks, he sings lead, and he sings with Dee Dee's stuff. In the past, it was always just me singing for the most part." [...] Richie was also the only drummer to be the sole composer of Ramones songs including their hit [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink" [...] as well as [...] "Smash You", [...] "Humankind", [...] "I'm Not Jesus", [...] "I Know Better Now" [...] and [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice". Joey Ramone supported Richie's songwriting contributions: [...] "I encouraged Richie to write songs. I figured it would make him feel more a part of the group, because we never let anybody else write our songs." [...] Richie's composition, [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink", remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits. The eightsong bonus disc, The Ramones Smash You: Live'85, is also named after Richie's composition [...] "Smash You".|$|E
2500|$|According to John Coppola, exhibit curator {{and former}} head of {{exhibits}} at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, [...] "In a completely unintended way, Anita Bryant was about the best thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gay rights movement ... She and her cohorts were so over the top that it just completely galvanized the gay rights movement". The 30th anniversary of Bryant's campaign against LGBT rights has been commemorated at the Stonewall Library & Archives, with executive director Jack Rutland dubbing her [...] "The Mother of Gay Rights". In November 2017, the campaign of Catherine Zhang and Nicholas Boucher for Harvard Undergraduate Council President and Vice President attracted the support of every single BGLTQ+ person ever, briefly turning the students into international gay icons.|$|E
2500|$|According to Athanasius, Saint Anthony {{heard a voice}} {{telling him}} [...] "Go out and see." [...] He went out and saw an angel who wore a girdle with a cross, one {{resembling}} the holy Eskiem (Tonsure or Schema), and on his head was a head cover (Kolansowa). He was sitting while braiding palm leaves, then he stood up to pray, and again he sat to weave. A voice came to him saying, [...] "Anthony, do this and you will rest." [...] Henceforth, he started to wear this tunic that he saw, and began to weave palm leaves, and never was bored again. Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution that was about <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church and {{the control of the}} heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its former glory, {{and the end of the}} age. When Saint Macarius visited Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb, and foretold him what would be of him. When the day drew near of the departure of Saint Paul the First Hermit in the desert, Saint Anthony went to him and buried him, after clothing him in a tunic which was a present from St Athanasius the Apostolic, the 20th Patriarch of Alexandria.|$|E

2500|$|Raymond E. Brown {{notes the}} {{apparent}} disagreements between the New Testament books in reporting {{the words of}} Jesus concerning his prediction {{of the destruction of}} the Temple. In Mark 13:2 it is reported as a direct statement: [...] "And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down." [...] However, in Mark 14:57-58, the event becomes words from people who [...] "bare false witness against him"; in Mark 15:29, Jesus' words are used to blaspheme him; and in Acts 6:13-14, similar words are again said to be from those bearing false witness. Furthermore, Matthew 26:60-61 and 27:39-40 has people accusing Jesus and blaspheming him as someone who had said such words, while John 2:19-21 reports Jesus saying directly that the sanctuary would be destroyed, but actually speaking [...] "of the sanctuary of his body". Brown suggests that the various accounts show that Jesus did not have God's detailed foreknowledge of what was <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Temple. In evidence for this lack of detailed prescience, he points out that there are many stones left upon other stones in the remains of Herod's temple, for instance in the Wailing Wall.|$|E
