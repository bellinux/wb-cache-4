5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitor</b> protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitor</b> is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{inherited}} form {{that results in}} the activation of trypsinogen within the pancreas, leading to autodigestion. Involved genes may include trypsin 1, which codes for trypsinogen, SPINK1, which codes for a <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.|$|E

2500|$|The {{seeds of}} many legumes, {{including}} the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), contain proteins called lectins {{which can cause}} gastric distress if the beans are eaten without cooking.

25|$|Most {{currently}} available genes used to engineer insect resistance {{come from the}} Bacillus thuringiensis bacterium. Most are {{in the form of}} delta endotoxin genes known as cry proteins, while a few use the genes that encode for vegetative insecticidal proteins. Insect resistant crops target various species of coleopteran (beetles) and lepidopteran (moths). The only gene commercially used to provide insect protection that does not originate from B. thuringiensis is the Cowpea <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CpTI).

40|$|ABSTRACT- Proteinase inhibitors are {{proteins}} {{widely distributed}} in plants.

Cysteine proteinase inhibitors, of which papain inhibitors are the most well known, have been recently associated, on the other hand, with the control of protein mobilization.

2500|$|The drug {{aprotinin}} (Trasylol, previously Bayer and now Nordic Group pharmaceuticals), is {{the small}} protein bovine pancreatic <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (BPTI), [...] or basic <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of bovine pancreas an antifibrinolytic molecule that inhibits trypsin and related proteolytic enzymes. Under the trade name Trasylol, aprotinin {{was used as a}} medication administered by injection to reduce bleeding during complex surgery, such as heart and liver surgery. Its main effect is the slowing down of fibrinolysis, the process that leads to the breakdown of blood clots. The aim in its use was to decrease the need for blood transfusions during surgery, as well as end-organ damage due to hypotension (low blood pressure) as a result of marked blood loss. The drug was temporarily withdrawn worldwide in 2007 after studies suggested that its use increased the risk of complications or death; this was confirmed by follow-up studies. Trasylol sales were suspended in May 2008, except for very restricted research use. In February 2012 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific committee reverted its previous standpoint regarding aprotinin, and has recommended that the suspension be lifted. Nordic became distributor of aprotinin in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Long continuous-trajectory {{simulations}} {{have been}} performed on Anton, a massively parallel supercomputer designed and built around custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and interconnects by D.

The longest published result of a simulation performed using Anton is a 1.112-millisecond simulation of NTL9 at 355 K; a second, independent 1.073-millisecond simulation of this configuration was also performed (and many other simulations of over 250 µs continuous chemical time). In How Fast-Folding Proteins Fold, researchers Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Stefano Piana, Ron O. Dror, and David E. Shaw discuss [...] "the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 μs and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins." [...] Examination of these diverse long trajectories, enabled by specialized, custom hardware, allow them to conclude that [...] "In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state." [...] In a separate study, Anton was used to conduct a 1.013-millisecond simulation of the native-state dynamics of bovine pancreatic <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (BPTI) at 300 K.|$|E

40|$|We have {{characterized}} {{in vitro}} and in vivo effects of <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitors</b> from Theobroma seeds on {{the activity of}} trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like proteins from Lepidopteran pest insects. The action of semipurified <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitors</b> from Theobroma was evaluated by the inhibition of bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin activities determined by the hydrolysis of N-Benzoyl-DL-Arginine-p-Nitroanilide (BAPA) and N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pho-Phe p-Nitroanilide (S-(Ala) 2 ProPhe-pNA). Proteinase inhibitor activities from Theobroma cacao and T. obovatum seeds were the most effective in inhibiting trypsin-like proteins, whereas those from T. obovatum and T. sylvestre were the most efficient against chymotrypsin-like proteins. All larvae midgut extracts showed trypsin-like proteolytic activities, and the putative <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitors</b> from Theobroma seeds significantly inhibited purified bovine trypsin.

40|$|The Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} invasive plants in introduced habitats with reduced herbivore pressure will evolve reduced levels of costly resistance traits. In {{light of this}} hypothesis, we examined the constitutive and inducible expression of five chemical defense traits in Alliaria petiolata from four invasive North American and seven native European populations. When grown under common conditions, significant variation among populations within continents was found for <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and peroxidase activity, and glucosinolates and <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitors</b> were significantly jasmonate-inducible across populations. Across populations, constitutive levels of glucosinolates and <b>trypsin</b> <b>inhibitors</b> were negatively correlated with their degree of induction, with three North American populations tending to have lower constitutive levels and higher inducibility of glucosinolates than the seven European populations. Alliarinoside and isovitexin 6 ″-O-β-d-glucopyranoside levels were both higher in North American plants than in European plants, but levels of these compounds were generally increased by jasmonate in European plants and decreased by the same treatment in North American plants.
