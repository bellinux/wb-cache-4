40|$|Background: Anti-D {{monoclonal}} antibody (MoAb) reagents have improved D typing in routine tests. However, they exhibit {{a wide range}} of <b>reactivity</b> <b>with</b> the weak D phenotype depending on the characteristics of the different MoAbs used. We analyzed the reactivity of immunoglobulin (IgM) anti-D by cluster analysis to characterize MoAb that have similar <b>reactivities</b> <b>with</b> the weak D phenotype. Study Design and Methods: We used 36 consecutive samples with weak D phenotype in routine testing and determined <b>their</b> <b>reactivity</b> <b>with</b> different IgM and IgG anti-D MoAbs. The samples were characterized as belonging to a weak D type or category using commercial molecular biology kits. Results: The various anti-D MoAbs showed a wide grade of <b>reactivity</b> <b>with</b> the weak D samples. Similarities and dissimilarities in the behavior of the anti-D MoAbs with the weak D phenotype samples were detected with cluster analysis and the multidimensional scaling analysis. These analyses indicated different families of MoAbs characterized as having a high degree of homogeneity in <b>their</b> <b>reactivity</b> <b>with</b> the weak D phenotype. Between these MoAb families, the most effective at reacting with the weak D phenotype were RUM- 1 and 175 - 2. CONCLUSIONS: The results show {{that it is possible to}} classify the anti-D MoAbs on the basis of <b>their</b> <b>reactivity</b> <b>with</b> the weak D phenotype. This provides information about different MoAbs' properties on the basis of their belonging to a given of anti-D family. © 2008 American Association of Blood Banks...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the structure and biological function of type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli was investigated using a set of monoclonal antibodies directed against conformation-specific antigenic determinants. Of three monoclonal antibodies tested, only one (clone CD 3) prevented adhesion of the vaccine strain to epithelial cells or guinea pig erythrocytes. The antibody produced by CD 3, but not that produced by the other two hybridoma clones (AA 8 and GG 1), precipitated isolated fimbriae by double diffusion in agar gel and was shown to bind in a highly discrete, periodic manner {{along the length of}} each of the fimbriae by immunoelectron microscopy. Immunoelectroblots of type 1 fimbrial subunits and polymers electrophoresed in SDS-gels indicated that the antibodies in AA 8 and GG 1 reacted only with fimbrial monomers (mol wt 17, 000), whereas the antibody in CD 3 reacted only with polymers of mol wt 102, 000 (hexamers) or higher. ELISA inhibition assays demonstrated that dissociated fimbrial subunits lost <b>their</b> <b>reactivity</b> <b>with</b> antibody CD 3 but gained <b>reactivity</b> <b>with</b> antibodies AA 8 and GG 1.
