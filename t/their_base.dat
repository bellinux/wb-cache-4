40|$|Five {{different}} poly(2 -methylaniline) salts {{were prepared}} by chemical polymerization of 2 -methylaniline using different protonic acids. The salts were converted into <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> by using aqueous $NH_ 4 OH$. EPR spectra were recorded for the solid samples of poly(2 -methylaniline) salts and <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> in the temperature range 40 - 200 °C at intervals of 40 °C. PMA salts and <b>their</b> <b>bases</b> consist of highly mobile radical cations or polarons. The salts show a thermally activated paramagnetism, i. e., polarons are antiferromagnetically coupled to each other, while the bases show temperature-independent or Pauli-type paramagnetism...|$|R
5|$|On 15 November, Carlson's {{battalion}} changed <b>their</b> <b>base</b> camp from Binu to Asamana. By this time, however, Shōji's {{units were}} {{no longer in the}} area, having continued their march deep into the interior of Guadalcanal en route to the Matanikau.

They received direct air support from ZNDH Dornier Do 17Ks, as well as supplies from light aircraft, but were unable to prevent the loss of <b>their</b> <b>base,</b> together with 20 men, all of their parachute equipment and their transport aircraft. The ZNDH also lost a Dornier Do 17K bomber and a Bücker Bü 131 biplane shot down during this period.|$|E

5|$|A third {{method is}} for {{authorities}} simply to talk down {{the value of}} their currency by hinting at future action to discourage speculators from betting on a future rise, though sometimes this has little discernible effect. Finally, a central bank can effect a devaluation by lowering its base rate of interest; however this sometimes has limited effect, and, since the end of World War II, most central banks have set <b>their</b> <b>base</b> rate according to the needs of their domestic economy.|$|E

With the large influx of Armenian refugees in the Levant, the ARF established a strong political structure in Lebanon {{and to a lesser}} extent, Syria. From 1921 to 1990, the Dashnaktsutiun established political structures in more than 200 states including the USA, where another large influx of Armenians settled.|$|E

The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Once the ships were interned, their breech blocks were removed, which disabled their guns.|$|E

5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting {{target for}} the Italians, who {{saw it as a}} refuge for British {{warships}} and allied merchant shipping. The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. <b>Their</b> <b>base</b> was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E
