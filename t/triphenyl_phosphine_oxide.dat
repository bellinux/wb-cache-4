Iridium atoms can also form a complex: cis-(dppe)2IrS2Cl with sodium periodate oxidises to (dppe)2IrS2O and then to (dppe)2IrS2O2, with dppe being 1,2-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane. This substance has the S2O2 in a cis position. The same conditions can make a trans complex, but this contains two separate SO radicals instead.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{outstanding}} properties, poly(arylene ethers) are useful as toughness modifiers in epoxy resins (EP). Furthermore, these polymers show rather low intrinsic fire risks. According to recent research {{it has been}} incorporated that poly(arylene ether <b>phosphine</b> <b>oxides)</b> [PAEPO’s] can further improve the fire behavior. Increasing phosphorous content of the PAEPO can influence the fire behavior too. Fire retardants containing phosphorus – regardless of whether an additive or reactive approach is used – show different mechanisms in the condensed and gas phase. In the present study PSU Control (BPA based polysulfone) with four different PAEPO’s and their corresponding blends with an EP were investigated. All poly(arylene ether <b>phosphine</b> <b>oxides)</b> were synthesized by nucleophilic aromatic polycondensation. The polymers obtained covered {{a wide range of}} weight average molar masses (6, 000 – 150, 000 g/mol) as determined by size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering detection (MALLS). FTIR, NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF revealed formation of the desired polymer structure of the linear poly(arylene ethers). All polymers were easily soluble in common organic solvents, thus enabling processing from solution. The pyrolysis and the fire retardancy mechanisms of the polymers and blends with epoxy resin (EP) were tackled by means of a comprehensive thermal analysis (thermogravimetry (TG), TG-evolved gas analysis) and fire tests [PCFC, limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL- 94, cone calorimeter].

40|$|Candidate {{reference}} materials (RM) {{for the analysis}} of phosphorus-based flame retardants in styrene-based polymers were prepared using a self-made mini-extruder. Due to legal requirements of the current restriction for the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, focus now is placed on phosphorus-based flame retardants instead of the brominated kind. Newly developed analytical methods for the first-mentioned substances also require RMs similar to industrial samples for validation and verification purposes. Hence, the prepared candidate RMs contained resorcinol-bis-(diphenyl phosphate), bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate), triphenyl phosphate and <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> as phosphorus-based flame retardants. Blends of polycarbonate and acrylonitrile-co-butadiene-co-styrene as well as blends of high-impact polystyrene and polyphenylene oxide were chosen as carrier polymers.

40|$|The plate-shaped clays {{enabled us}} to {{disperse}} water-insoluble conjugated polymers (CPs) into a colloidal form and an aqueous process for making CP films. Simple pulverization of poly [2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 '-ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) with silicate clays rendered the powder mixture an unusual dispersing behavior in water. The most effective clay was selected from screening several natural and synthetic clays including synthetic fluorinated mica (Mica), sodium montmorillonite (MMT), synthetic smectite (SWN), and cationic layered double hydroxide (LDH). A high aspect ratio and intensive charge density (2. 1 e nm(- 1)) of Mica were highly effective for promoting the CP dispersion. The enhancement for dispersing MEH-PPV is rated in the following trend: Mica > MMT > SWN > LDH. The result is rationalized by the influences of their geometric shape and ionic charge of clay on MEH-PPV in water. Two other representative CPs, sulfonated polyaniline (SPA) and <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> cored polyaniline (TPOPA), were used to generalize the CP/clay colloidal behavior.

40|$|Increase in the cytoplasmic Ca 2 + {{concentration}} ([Ca 2 +]i) in the β-cells triggers insulin exocytosis. Among the Ca 2 + channels {{present in}} the plasma membrane, the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels receptors are currently of great interest. The mechanisms by which the extracellular adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPr) increases the [Ca 2 +]i is unknown. Our aims were to study {{the roles of the}} TRP channels in the tolbutamide induced [Ca 2 +]i increase and to identify the surface receptor that is activated by ADPr. We used S 5 cells, a highly differentiated rat insulinoma cell line, as a model for β-cells. Single cell ratiometric microfluorometry was used to measure the [Ca 2 +]i changes in the Fura- 2 loaded cells. Tolbutamide increased [Ca 2 +]i in the form of oscillations. After tolbutamide increased [Ca 2 +]i,capsazepine, a potent blocker of the transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV 1) channel was added to the β-cells, which reduced the tolbutamide-induced [Ca 2 +]i increase. capsazepine, N-(p-Amylcinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (ACA),  TRPM 2 channel blocker, and <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> (TPPO), TRPM 5 channel blocker were tested for their effect on potassium chloride (KCl) induced [Ca 2 +]i response. These blockers did not inhibit the KCl induced [Ca 2 +]i increase.   Adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPr) increased [Ca 2 +]i in the form of initial transient peak followed by an elevated plateau. Application of ADPr shortly after a prior application and washout of Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) elicited only small [Ca 2 +]i increase  indicating desensitization of the receptor involved. 2 ´deoxy-N 6 -methyladenosine 3 ´ 5 ´bis-phosphate (MRS 2179), and chloro N 6 -methyl-(N) -methanocarba 2 ´deoxyadenosine 3 ´ 5 ´ bis-phosphate (MRS 2279), two selective inhibitors of P 2 Y 1 receptor, abolished the ADPr-induced [Ca 2 +]i increase. Tolbutamide closes ATP sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. Our results demonstrate that besides the closure of the KATP channels, inward cation currents carried by Ca 2 +through the TRPV 1 channel are necessary for depolarization to the threshold for the activation of the voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) to increase the [Ca 2 +]i.

40|$|Intra{{cellular}} Ca 2 + regulates diverse cellular {{functions in}} almost all the cells. In the pancreatic ß-cells, Ca 2 + signals are critical for insulin secretion. An increase in the cytoplasmic free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) triggers insulin secretion. Multiple mechanisms increase the [Ca 2 +]i in the ß-cells, and in this respect depolarization of the plasma membrane and consequent Ca 2 + entry through the voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels is particularly important. For depolarization of ß-cells the closure of KATP channels is essential. In addition, cation channels belonging to Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family are thought to play important roles in causing depolarization. Previous studies have reported that the Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin-like subtype 5 (TRPM 5) channel, a Ca 2 + activated monovalent cation channel, {{is involved in the}} stimulus-secretion coupling in the mouse ß-cells. We aimed to study the role of the TRPM 5 channel in regulating insulin secretion, and [Ca 2 +]i in the rat ß-cells. Another focus of this thesis was to evaluate a new human inluinoma cell line as a model for studying Ca 2 + signaling in the ß-cells. Recently a genetically engineered human insulinoma cell line (EndoC-BH 1) has been developed. We studied Ca 2 + signaling in the EndoC-BH 1 cells, in an attempt to assess whether these cells {{could be used as a}} model for this purpose. For inhibiting the TRPM 5 channels we used <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> (TPPO), a selective and potent pharmacological inhibitor of the channel. We measured insulin secretion from the islets from Sprague-Dawley rats in batch incubations. For measuring [Ca 2 +]i from single rat ß-cells and EndoC-BH 1 cells, we used fura- 2 based ratiometric microfluorometry. We found that TPPO did not inhibit insulin secretion triggered by KCl, or fructose but it significantly reduced insulin secretion in response to glucose, Larginine, and GLP- 1. It also significantly inhibited the KATP channel-independent insulin secretion by glucose. TPPO significantly inhibited the [Ca 2 +]i increase in response to L-arginine. It also inhibited the [Ca 2 +]i increase triggered by glucose in a KATP channel independent mechanism. However, TPPO did not alter the [Ca 2 +]i response triggered by KCl, fructose, glucose and GLP- 1. We stimulated the EndoC-BH 1 cells with gluocse, GLP- 1, KCl, carbachol, Larginine, and tolbutamide. These agents that are known to increase [Ca 2 +]i in the primary ß-cells also increased [Ca 2 +]i in the these human insulinoma cells. Moreover, we found that GLP- 1 was essential for eliciting Ca 2 + response in the EndoC-BH 1 cells upon stimulation by tolbutamide and glucose. We conclude that in the rat islets, TRPM 5 plays an important role in mediating insulin secretion by glucose, and L-arginine, and in potentiating the glucoseinduced insulin secretion by GLP- 1. We also conclude that the EndoC-BH 1 cells responds by [Ca 2 +]i increase upon stimulation by several well-known agonists...|$|E

As far as conjugated hydrocarbon species are concerned, the spin distribution is rather well established and follows the sign alternation principle.

This study concerns the involvement of a P-atom in the spin distribution and the intramolecular exchange interaction of nitronyl nitroxide radical-substituted <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphine</b> derivatives. The spin distribution of mono-, bi-, and tri-radical phosphine derivatives has been investigated by high-resolution fluid solution EPR and ^ 1 H and ^(31) P MAS NMR spectroscopy.

The AgBrO 3 /AsPh 3 (1 : 2) (2). 0. 7 "H 2 O" derivative (6) is binuclear L 2 Ag(mu-BrO 3) (2) AgL 2 with a four-membered ring core (L = AsPh 3) ...|$|R
40|$|The first {{catalytic}} enantioselective {{synthesis of}} ambiphilic phosphine boronate esters is presented. The asymmetric boration of,-unsaturated <b>phosphine</b> <b>oxides</b> catalyzed by a copper bisphosphine complex affords optically active organoboronate esters that bear a vicinal <b>phosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> group in good yields and high enantiomeric excess. The synthetic {{utility of the}} products is demonstrated through stereospecific transformations into multifunctional optically active compounds...|$|R
