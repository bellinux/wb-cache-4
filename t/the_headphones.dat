5|$|In {{connection}} with his {{background as a}} musician, Lee founded the record label Monster Music in 1999, signing Van Morrison's daughter Shana. Monster created numerous divisions as it diversified into other products, such as Monster Performance Car, Monster Game, Monster Photo and Monster Computer. By 2003, Monster produced more than 1,000 products, including power cords, gaming accessories and cooling products. According to a 2005 USA Today article, Lee and his company were developing furniture with high-end electronics built-in, wireless products to replace audio cords and a user interface to consolidate the consumer's control of their electronics. Lee and his son worked with Dr. Dre to collaborate on the Beats brand of headphones, which was later acquired by Apple for $3 billion in 2014. According to Business Insider, Beats Electronics denies that Monster {{had a role in}} the design of <b>the</b> <b>headphones.</b> Lee said Beats had no engineers on staff and it spent millions in research and development to get the product started, but that their contract was poorly constructed, giving all the intellectual property to Beats when it wasn't renewed.|$|E
25|$|DJs {{generally}} use {{higher quality}} headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate {{the sounds of}} <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen {{to one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>headphones,</b> while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.|$|E
25|$|Danish {{headphone}} manufacturer Aiaiai {{have recently}} released a model named the TMA-1 {{due to the}} matte black finish and design of <b>the</b> <b>headphones.</b> This company has attributed the naming of this model to the monolith from 2001.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Headphone</b> is <b>the</b> second {{hardware}} product {{introduced by}} Bragi on September 5, 2016. Users can connect <b>The</b> <b>Headphone</b> to any Bluetooth device and switch between music tracks, take phone calls, activate Audio Transparency and deliver voice commands. It comes {{with up to}} 6 hours of battery life per charge. Just like The Dash, {{the right and left}} earbuds of <b>The</b> <b>Headphone</b> communicate via NFMI techonology. They don't feature touch interface, they have physical buttons instead. Finally, unlike The Dash's charger, the charger of <b>The</b> <b>Headphone</b> does not charge the earbuds.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePure-tone {{audiometry}} (measurement {{of absolute}} thresholds using pure tones) {{is the main}} test for the diagnosis of hearing loss. It {{can be achieved by}} using either air conduction (with headphones or loudspeakers) or bone conduction (by placing a vibrator on the mastoid bone behind <b>the</b> ear). <b>The</b> <b>HeadPhone</b> Transfer Function (HPTF) describes both <b>the</b> <b>headphone</b> response and <b>the</b> coupling to a listener's ear. Recent papers indicated that modifications of headphone position can lead to changes in HPTF, and that these spectral modifications can be audible. The aim of the present study is to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>headphone</b> placement over a listener's ears has an influence on pure-tone audiometric tests. Audiograms were performed several times on normal-hearing subjects, for different headphone positions (obtained by placing/removing <b>the</b> <b>headphone</b> over <b>the</b> listener's ears), the absolute thresholds measurements being repeated for each <b>headphone</b> position. <b>The</b> dispersions of absolute thresholds with and without modification of <b>the</b> <b>headphone</b> position were compared in order to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>headphone</b> positioning is an issue for audiometric tests...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>headphone</b> {{jack and}} dock {{connector}} swapped locations so that <b>the</b> <b>headphone</b> jack {{was to the}} left of the dock connector. Therefore, the fifth generation iPod Nano used a different Apple Universal Dock insert than the fourth generation.|$|R
25|$|The {{impedance}} of headphones is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of <b>the</b> <b>headphones,</b> significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|E
25|$|In October 2014, the NFL fined player Colin Kaepernick {{for wearing}} pink-colored Beats {{headphones}} (in observance of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month) during a post-game press conference, violating rules that prohibit players from displaying the logos of non-sponsors during games, practices, and pre/post-game media appearances. His actions infringed the exclusive sponsorship rights of Bose Corporation, {{who had become}} an official sponsor of the NFL as of the 2014 season. In response to the fine, Kaepernick covered the Beats logo on <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> with athletic tape during a subsequent press conference.|$|E
25|$|Headphones are {{available}} with low or high impedance (typically measured at 1kHz). Low-impedance headphones {{are in the range}} 16 to 32ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered CMOS-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.|$|E
25|$|Open-back <b>headphones</b> have <b>the</b> {{back of the}} earcups open. This leaks more {{sound out}} of <b>the</b> <b>headphone</b> and also lets more ambient sounds into <b>the</b> <b>headphone,</b> but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound, due to {{including}} sounds from the environment.|$|R

25|$|Several items confiscated from Nilsen's Cranley Gardens address — some {{of which}} had been {{introduced}} as evidence at Nilsen's trial — now remain on display at New Scotland Yard's Black Museum. These exhibits include the stove upon which Nilsen had boiled the heads of his final three victims; the knives he had used to dissect several of his victims' bodies; <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> Nilsen had used to strangle Kenneth Ockenden; the ligature he had fashioned to strangle his last victim; and the bath from his Cranley Gardens address in which he had drowned John Howlett and retained the body of Graham Allen prior to dissection.|$|E
25|$|Another {{experiment}} {{involved an}} electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while {{the participant was}} led to believe they were entirely self-conducted. The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and {{it was found that}} if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> {{they were more likely to}} say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the {{attempted}} murder of Ho, on 3 December 1979, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old Canadian student named Kenneth Ockenden, {{who had been on}} a tour of England visiting relatives. Nilsen encountered Ockenden as they both drank in a West End pub. Upon learning the youth was a tourist, Nilsen offered to show Ockenden several notable London landmarks; an offer which Ockenden accepted. Nilsen then invited the youth to his house on the promise of a meal and further drinks. The pair stopped at an off licence en route to Nilsen's Melrose Avenue residence and purchased whisky, rum and beer, with Ockenden insisting on sharing the bill. Although Nilsen was adamant he could not recall the precise moment he strangled Ockenden, he recalled that he strangled the youth with the cord of his (Nilsen's) headphones as Ockenden listened to music; he also recalled dragging the youth across his floor with the wire wrapped around his neck as he strangled him, before pouring himself half a glass of rum and continuing to listen to music upon <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> with which he had strangled Ockenden.|$|E

500|$|Mitsuda and {{his team}} spent {{the first year of}} the game's {{development}} studying the DS hardware, which had notoriously bad sound quality and brought with it severe technical difficulties in creating a soundtrack of a similar caliber to Mitsuda's previous work: the main limitations were the speaker limits and limited memory capacity. Part of the difficulty in composing the music was creating different mixes for the soundtrack depending on whether the player selected the built-in speakers or <b>the</b> <b>headphones.</b> According to Mitsuda, the speakers and <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> had very different hertz outputs, meaning it was impossible to maintain the same quality for both settings. The end result was described by Mitsuda as [...] "a much better sound quality with a lesser amount of data". Two key people cited by Mitsuda in overcoming these barriers were sound programmer Hidenori Suzuki and synthesizer operator Junya Kuroda. Kuroda came up with multiple techniques for improving the sound quality, a task which had been so infuriating for Mitsuda that he came close to giving up multiple times. According to Kuroda, the main difficulty was not a lack of techniques for creating a clean sound for the DS, but applying them to the music of Soma Bringer, which was more ambitious than many other soundtracks for the platform. The result of using their own technology meant that, after adjustment and balancing, the tracks were very close to the original tracks prior to being incorporated into the game and DS sound environment. Suzuki worked on the dedicated sound driver, and Mitsuda appraised him with achieving a clean sound for the opening track.|$|E

[...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of several}} hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: [...] "To Johnny, this must have been like the Chinese water torture." [...] "I understood [...] attitude," [...] said Marky. [...] "He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn.

500|$|In the song's final bridge section, at 2:58, {{the spoken}} phrase [...] "Fucking hell!" [...] appears. Scott admits that {{although}} he was told about it, he could not hear the words originally. Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney, according to Emerick, who reports Lennon's comment in his autobiography: [...] "'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully crowed, 'but I insisted we leave it in , buried just low enough {{so that it can}} barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it ... but we'll know it's there.'" [...] Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by Lennon. Malcolm Toft, the mix engineer on the Trident recording, also attributes it to Lennon. In Toft's recollection, Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in reaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones, he first called out [...] "Whoa!" [...] then, two seconds later, swore as he pulled <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> off.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!'

[...] IGN was also very positive in their assessment of the record, writing, [...] "This album is like a post-millennial concept record that beckons to be listened to with the lights dimmed and <b>the</b> <b>headphones</b> clamped tightly around your aural receptors. [...] It may not be your cup of tea, but kudos to the quartet for not merely re-treading the blink market with more mature lyrics." [...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Leah Greenblatt gave the album a B- rating, commending its obvious influences while also criticizing DeLonge's vocals.
