5|$|A {{photograph}} of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> was {{to house the}} theater appeared in The Morning Oregonian newspaper in 1913. Known as the Kleist Building after its owner, Edward Kleist, it had a pressed brick front and walls with hollow tiles. The second floor was intended for residential rooms and apartments, and the ground floor was designed for business storerooms and a movie theater. According to a February 1915 newspaper advertisement, The Exploits of Elaine, {{the first in a}} continuing series of Craig Kennedy detective stories, was to show at The Clinton on March 1.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 2014, Waldroff and Simshaw {{listed the}} {{building}} and business for sale intermittently, and sold Starky's for $1.2 million in March 2015. The duo planned to retire and expressed a willingness to sell {{the rights to the}} name and business. The bar and restaurant closed on September 13, 2015, after operating for 28 years. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> housed Starky's was demolished during November–December 2015, and was replaced by a three-story apartment building.|$|E
5|$|By the 2010s the {{building}} was owned by Enterprise Inns, who own around 5,500 pubs in the UK. Despite advertising for a new lease of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst letting the property for a peppercorn rent, Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a freehold in March 2015. No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> was required.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of March 2004, 20 percent of the 306 units in The St. James had been leased. Construction was completed later that month, with finishing touches added later in the year. In March 2005, {{a year after the}} building was completed, P Associates and Clark Realty Capital, under the name of 700 Walnut LP, announced The St. James was for sale. At the time, 45 percent of its units were being rented. P Associates sold off its interest in <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> same year.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{suffering}} significant persecution {{from their}} peers and the state, Baptists erected their first chapel in Taunton in 1670, {{on or near the}} current site. This was replaced in 1712 with <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> still stands today. During the 18th century, probably during the ministry of Joseph Jeffries, the chapel's form of worship became Unitarian, although this was forbidden by Parliament until 1813. The Presbyterians of Taunton merged with the Unitarian church in 1814, and later that century the chapel underwent significant renovation.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s through the mid-1990s the {{laboratory}} was rededicated to medical and urban entomology, with Professor John Edman running projects on mosquitos as vectors and Professor Ron Prokopy focusing on orchard pest control.

5|$|In 1791, under Sheridan's management, the {{building}} was demolished {{to make way for}} a larger theatre which opened in 1794. This new Drury Lane survived for 15 years before burning down in 1809. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> stands today opened in 1812. It has been the residency of a number of well known actors including; Edmund Kean, comedian Dan Leno, and the musical composer and performer Ivor Novello. From the Second World War, the theatre has primarily hosted long runs of musicals, including Oklahoma! (1947–1953), My Fair Lady (1958–1963), 42nd Street (1984–1989) and Miss Saigon (1989–1999), the theatre's longest-running show. The theatre is owned by the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.|$|E
5|$|In late 2011 and {{throughout}} 2012-13, construction began on a several new buildings on campus. The construction included a new $20million Petroleum Engineering and Research building, {{a new building}} to house the Rawls College of Business, two new residence halls, a $3.5million chapel, and extensive remodeling of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> previously housed the Rawls College of Business.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} design the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was {{dominated}} by adjoining utility buildings, which were linked to it by high-level walkways. Tange refined this concept to place the museum prominently at the centre, separate from the utility buildings (only {{one of which was}} subsequently designed by him). In addition to architectural symbolism, he thought it important for the design to centre around <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> houses the information about the atomic explosion.|$|E
50|$|The second {{event was}} the 1952 earthquake. Similar {{to the great}} fire, {{a lot of the}} city was destroyed. When examined, most of <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>that</b> survived were {{reinforced}} structures (primarily reinforced concrete). Many of <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>that</b> fell were built with non-reinforced brick. When the city was rebuilt, it was required that large structures be constructed with reinforced materials.|$|R

5|$|The Michigan State Capitol is <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> {{houses the}} {{legislative}} branch {{of the government of}} the U.S. state of Michigan. It is in the portion of the state capital of Lansing which lies in Ingham County. The present structure, at the intersection of Capitol and Michigan Avenues, is a National Historic Landmark that houses the chambers and offices of the Michigan Legislature as well as the ceremonial offices of the Governor of Michigan and Lieutenant Governor. Historically, this is the third building to house the Michigan government.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} site {{has been the}} subject of several recent redevelopment proposals, including a 2008 plan to demolish <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> was halted after a U.S. District Court ruling. After ownership of the Federal Reserve Bank Building was transferred to the General Services Administration in 2013, it was auctioned to Martin Selig Real Estate in 2015 for $16 million; the firm later announced plans to build a 48-story mixed-use skyscraper atop the existing building, but scaled back the project to only seven floors.|$|E
5|$|A trial, {{in which}} the rebellious actors sued the {{management}} at the King's Bench over the management's occupation of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the actors, and {{they were to be}} granted control of the theatre building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against John Harper, one of the rebellious actors, for being a vagrant, and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison. This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the Daily Post of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of habeas corpus was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the Daily Courant announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious actors to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of the theatre. The actors took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|As {{the initial}} {{usage of the}} Cunard Building was mixed, {{there are a variety}} of {{features}} within <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> reflect the original purposes of different areas within. Initially, Cunard's administration facilities were located on the upper floors and due to the necessity for large amounts of light in the design facilities, these rooms where developed to include both toplights in the roof and also large windows to maximise the amount of natural light. Another feature are the high quality ornate fittings that are present in what would have been the former first class passenger lounge, which is located on the first floor. These fitting are also in the former board room, which is located in a 'commanding' position on the fifth floor, overlooking the river below.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> previously occupied the site.|$|E
5|$|English cathedrals {{maintain}} a traditional form of church service, of which canticles, the set psalm of the day, responses, and an anthem are sung by a choir traditionally composed of about thirty men and boys. (Many cathedrals now {{also have a}} girls choir, and a lay choir). Because of this tradition, that part of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>that</b> contains the stalls, usually {{to the east of}} the central tower but sometimes extending under it, is called the choir or quire. The choir is sometimes divided from the nave of the cathedral by a wide medieval screen constructed of stone and in some instances carrying a large pipe organ. This screen traditionally separated the quire from the nave and the clergy from the laity, who were expected to worship at parish churches, rather than at the cathedral. The nave of the cathedral, in medieval times, was used primarily for processions. At its western end it contains the font for the ritual washing service of Baptism, at which a person, most often an infant, is symbolically accepted into the church. The font is usually made of stone and is usually the oldest fitting in the cathedral, many of them being Norman.|$|E
