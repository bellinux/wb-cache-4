5000|$|Beginning about 1887 <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>generators</b> {{came into}} {{extensive}} operation and the commercial {{development of the}} transformer, by means of which currents of low voltage and high current strength are transformed to currents of high voltage and low current strength, and vice versa, in time revolutionized the transmission of electric power to long distances.

Lord Kelvin and Sebastian Ferranti also developed early alternators, producing frequencies between 100 and 300 hertz.

Later alternators were designed for varying alternating-current frequencies between sixteen and about one hundred hertz, for use with arc lighting, incandescent lighting and electric motors.|$|R

40|$|When an {{electric}} current {{higher than a}} certain intensity passes through a thermistor, the thermistor shows a negative differential resistance characteristic.

40|$|Abstract — The {{survival}} and sustainability of businesses, especially in volatile developing country markets, require that businesses frugally manage input cost {{such as the}} cost of electric power. However, Power Harmonics (PH) that cause excessive dissipation of energy as heat can raise the cost of electric power for companies and for the power suppliers as well. Unbeknownst to them, many businesses in Ghana may have been exposed to serious financial losses {{as a result of the}} presence of power harmonics in the distribution network. PH is essentially a negative externality caused by the users of PH producing gadgets and visited on other unsuspecting users of electric power who are essentially bystanders: a classic case of a negative externality.

Introduction: <b>Alternating</b> <b>current</b> will {{perhaps in}} time {{supplant}} direct current for traction purposes {{as it did}} in lighting, {{with the advent of the}} long distance high potential transmission, but as yet the direct current plays a very important part in both power and traction. It has however the disadvantage of being difficult to transmit long distances without great loss. This is due to the inherent limitations in the production of high voltages from the direct <b>current</b> <b>generator.</b> Commutation at voltages sufficiently high to warrant economical transmission over long distances, is extremely difficult. Sparking and other difficulties at once arise which place the voltage within the limitations mentioned. The <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>generator</b> has not only the advantage of higher voltage, but by means of suitable transformer devices the voltage may be raised to any desired value for economical transmission. It will be readily seen, therefore, that <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> machinery will supplant the direct current for traction purposes. In this thesis only direct current is treated. Direct current on a small scale and for local distribution fulfills more nearly the requirements demanded for traction purposes such as is needed on railways. The discussions are confined to the electrical equipment of the car only, the mechanical construction being referred to only as needed in line with the electrical connections...|$|R

Fell was one of the attending physicians at the electrocution, making sure there was proper contact with the electrodes. After {{what appeared to be a}} partially botched execution, with Kemmler found to be still breathing after the first jolt forcing a second application of electricity, Fell was one of the few observers who thought Kemmler didn't suffer, stating [...] "I am still a defender of electrical execution, but I do not entirely defend the manner in which Kemmler was executed".|$|R
50|$|Initially {{electricity}} {{was generated}} using {{a technique that}} produced direct current to DC. This type of current had the unfortunate property of being difficult to transmit long distances over wires. In 1897 Westinghouse established a manufacturing facility in Hamilton and began producing heavy <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> (AC) <b>generators</b> and AC motors (based on Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla's induction motor) for the Canadian market. AC had an advantage {{in that it was}} more amenable to transmission over long distances. The competitor of that company, General Electric of Canada (1892), with production facilities in Peterborough, Ontario eventually followed suit. AC technology has been used for electrical transmission since that time.|$|R
50|$|Single-phase {{generator}} (also {{known as}} single-phase alternator) is an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> electrical <b>generator</b> {{that produces a}} single, continuously alternating voltage. Single-phase generators {{can be used to}} generate power in single-phase electric power systems. However, polyphase generators are generally used to deliver power in three-phase distribution system and the current is converted to single-phase near the single-phase loads instead. Therefore, single-phase generators are found in applications that are most often used when the loads being driven are relatively light, and not connected to a three-phase distribution, for instance, portable engine-generators. Larger single-phase generators are also used in special applications such as single-phase traction power for railway electrification systems.|$|R

5000|$|Hippolyte Pixii (1808-1835) was an {{instrument}} maker from Paris, France. In 1832 he built an early form of <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> electrical <b>generator,</b> {{based on the}} principle of magnetic induction discovered by Michael Faraday. Pixii's device was a spinning magnet, operated by a hand crank, where the North and South poles passed over a coil with an iron core. A current pulse was experienced each time a pole passed over the coil. He also found that the current direction changed when the North Pole passed over the coil after the South pole. Later on acting on a suggestion by André-Marie Ampère other results were obtained by introducing a commutator, which produced a pulsating direct current which at this time was preferable to <b>alternating</b> <b>current.</b> Although Pixii at the time did not fully understand electromagnetic induction, his device led to more sophisticated devices.|$|R
