30|$|On June, 1 st, we celebrated {{five years}} {{experience}} since the European REACH Regulation [1] entered into force. The experience is mainly positive: In nearly 29, 000 <b>technical</b> <b>dossiers</b> for approximately 5, 900 substances, registrants submitted {{a huge amount}} of information on uses, properties, hazards, toxicological and ecotoxicological effects to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki. These registrations include all substances with a manufacturing or import volume of more than 1, 000 tons per year and registrant, all substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction which are intended to stay on the EU-market, and some more important chemicals.|$|R
30|$|By {{the first}} {{registration}} deadline in November 2010, nearly 4, 300 substances were registered in approximately 25, 000 <b>technical</b> <b>dossiers.</b> After five years REACH, the responsible manufacturers and importers submitted 28, 669 registrations for 5, 894 substances (16.08. 2012) [7]. Hence, for all substances with a manufacturing or import volume {{of more than}} 1, 000 tons/year and manufacturer/importer, information on substance identity, additives, impurities and constituents, manufacturing and use within the complete supply chain, data on physico-chemical properties, hazards and risks should be available. It is also requested that the submitted data set includes information on fate and behaviour in the environment, studies on toxic and ecotoxic effects, and the proposed risk management measures.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain a better {{understanding}} of non-agricultural pesticide use and to prepare the legislative and <b>technical</b> <b>dossiers</b> required under the Water Framework Directive, between October 2006 and March 2007, two surveys were conducted of 97 Walloon communes and 65 districts of the Walloon Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MET) (General Directorates for Motorways and Roads and for Waterway Infrastructure). The questionnaire (26 questions on six topics) was sent by e-mail or fax, with a response rate of 60 out of 97 communes and 33 out of 65 districts. This article describes the environmental aspects of the surveys (health-related aspects are the subject of separate article). The surveys have brought to light a number of good practices (including zero pesticides) and a growing awareness of environmental issues among non-agricultural users. However, bad habits, legislation infringements and a failure to follow good plant protection practice are still a problem and pose major environmental risks (in the form of water pollution from pesticides). Information, awareness-raising and training therefore remain a priority for nonagricultural users. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In their dossier, the organisation laid out an integrated control system that combines the involvement of local structures and state authorities such as {{the police and the}} Afghan National Army in order to limit diversion. They argued that by making the medicines locally, value is added to the finished product, the proceeds of which will go towards the economic diversification necessary to break ties with the illegal opium industry and eventually phase out opium production.|$|E

40|$|Fundierte Nachweise über Wirksamkeit, Sicherheit und Qualität eines Präparates sind die Voraussetzung für dessen Vermarktung. Diese Nachweise sind in einem Zulassungsdossier konsolidiert. Sämtliche Änderungen im Dossier müssen in Zulassungsverfahren beantragt werden, welche wiederum in einer regulatorischen Datenbank dokumentiert werden müssen. Seit Anfang 2010 reguliert die Variation Regulation derartige Änderungsanzeigen für europäisch harmonisierte Zulassungsverfahren. Im Rahmen einer Fallstudie wurden die regulatorischen und dokumentarischen Prozesse in der Regulatory Affairs Abteilung der Abbott Products GmbH analysiert. Im Fokus stand hierbei die Erfassung von Änderungsanzeigen innerhalb des Verfahrens der gegenseitigen Anerkennung in die Datenbank IRIS und in welcher Form sich die neue Verordnung auf diese Prozesse auswirken würde. Hierzu wurde in öffentlichen Publikationen und internen Dokumenten recherchiert. Interviews generierten empirische Daten zu Prozessabläufen, Konflikten und Optimierungspotentialen. Durch das ARIS-Konzept wurde ein umfangreiches Ist-Modell modelliert, das neben Geschäftsprozessen auch Informationswege, Kommunikationsflüsse und Beteiligte darstellt. In einer Risikoanalyse wurden allgemeine Kriterien für die Gefährdung einer benötigten Dokumentationsqualität in den gegenwärtigen Abläufen aufgestellt. In Verbindung mit den Resultaten der Interviews wurden detaillierte Schwachstellen benannt und im Ist-Modell kenntlich gemacht. Es zeigten sich vor allem Risiken in den Bereichen Standardisierung, Kommunikation, Fachwissen und Systemschwächen, welche hauptsächlich durch die Mitarbeiter erzeugt werden. Dies wurde durch eine {{quantitative}} Auswertung bestätigt. Optimierungsvorschläge wurden unterbreitet und teilweise bewertet. Die Verodnung (EG) Nr. 1234 / 2008 wurde ausführlich beschrieben, deren Neuerungen hervorgehoben und Auswirkungen auf die regulatorischen und dokumentarischen Aspekte erörtert. Eine ausführlichere Evaluierung des Einflusses der Variation Regulation ist jedoch empfehlenswert, da hier nur allgemeine Aspekte aufgegriffen wurden. Diese Arbeit stellt die Grundlagen, Methoden und Ergebnisse dieses Projektes vor und mündet in einer Reflektion und Bewertung. Das Ist-Modell wird weiterhin als Übersicht der Prozesse genutzt. Andere Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit werden für weiterführende Evaluationen und Projekte verwendet. A marketing authorisation requires significant {{evidence about}} efficacy, safety {{and quality of}} a pharmaceutical product. The documentation of a marketing authorisation is consolidated within the common <b>technical</b> document (registration <b>dossier).</b> All changes related to the registration dossier have to pass through an approval process {{and have to be}} documented in a regulatory database. Such a variation within a European harmonized procedure should be applied in accordance with the variation regulation which was adopted in the beginning of 2010. Regulatory and documentation processes should be analyzed during a case study within the regulatory affairs department from Abbott Products GmbH. The subject matters were variations being approved by mutual recognition procedure. Their tracking within the regulatory database IRIS and the evaluation of the influence of the variation regulation to procedures and processes were focused. Therefore it was searched within publications and internal documents. Empirical data about processes, their conflicts and opportunities could be created by the use of interview sessions. A developed process model of current processes via ARIS method represents a network of business processes, information and communication flows as well as all participants. General criteria for insufficient documentation quality regarding current processes were developed by a risk analysis. Detailed weakness was exposed by criteria in interaction with the results of the interview sessions. The weakness was visualized on the process model. Risk analysis of current processes mainly exposed certain risks in standardization, communication, know-how and weakness of the database system. Most of them are caused by regulatory affairs employees. These facts rely on quantitative analysis. Opportunities and proposals for improvements were developed and partially assessed. The content of the variation regulation were described in detail. Its innovations were highlighted and the effects to regulatory and documentation processes were explained. A more detailed evaluation of the variation regulation’s influence is recommended due to the simplified universal validity of the statements handled within the bachelor thesis. This bachelor thesis includes basics, applied methods and results of the project and ends with a reflection and assessment. The developed process model will be used as overview in the future. All other results of the process analysis will be reused for further evaluations and assessments...|$|R

3000|$|... ‘The ideal REACH world’ {{required}} that all harmful substances existing at the workplace would be fully registered. Each of these substances {{would have a}} corresponding <b>technical</b> <b>dossier</b> complemented by a chemical safety report (CSR) in which adequate and conclusive exposure scenarios (ES) describing the safe use of substances in their whole life cycle would be included. This would be underpinned by a full, valid and unambiguous physicochemical and toxicological assessment of the hazardous properties of a substance including limit values for these harmful effects. Relevant SVHCs would be replaced by less hazardous, alternative substances or processes. All information would be communicated clearly and concisely, meeting the needs and knowledge of all user groups along the whole supply chain. The recommended measures would be applied by the downstream users. If these ideals were met {{and all of those}} managing processes complied accordingly, chemical hazards would be adequately controlled in the workplace.|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the recent}} experience, reasons for {{non-compliance}} can be various. One example of non-compliance with legal provisions is that the exemptions from the registration requirements are not correctly understood. A very common {{problem is that the}} identity of the substance under consideration is often not clear or even incorrect [10]. Furthermore, the definition of intermediates and the term ‘strictly controlled conditions’ (SCC) is interpreted differently between the authorities and some companies [11]. To avoid unjustified toxicological tests, read-across approaches are made or certain toxicological tests are waived for unjustified reasons. Furthermore, the compilation of registration dossiers is performed very differently by each SIEF and different registrants may comply differently in a way not readily understandable for competent authorities or the downstream users. Non-compliance with the legal framework will occur when these assumptions, and estimations are not disclosed and/or not justified and when the <b>technical</b> <b>dossier</b> and the CSR are inconsistent. A non-exhaustive summary of these discrepancies is summarised in column 3 of Additional file 1.|$|E
30|$|In 2013, the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation {{commissioned}} the project ‘Limits of Concern for the Risk Assessment of GM plants’. The {{aim of this}} project is the critical evaluation {{of the concept of}} Limits of Concern introduced by EFSA for the practical implementation in GMO risk assessment. The project is comprised of several work packages, amongst others the evaluation of environmental harm thresholds applied for regulated products other than GMOs, the realisation of stakeholder interviews and expert workshops for feedback and critical discussions on the concept. Within this project, selected GMO applications according to Regulation (EC) No. 1829 / 2003 were scrutinised with the focus on the consideration of the LoC concept. This could be expected because all applications were submitted in 2010 and later and therefore should follow EFSA’s revised ERA guidance. Since no applications for cultivation were available from this period, the focus was put on applications for import and processing only. The GMO dossiers were examined for the application of the LoC concept for environmentally relevant compounds assessed in the comparative safety assessment. Specifically, the application of GM soybean DAS 44406 - 6 was selected {{due to the fact that}} the lectin content in this event, as compared to the non-GM soybean, was significantly different and non-equivalent (notification EFSA-GMO-NL- 2012 - 106, <b>technical</b> <b>dossier,</b> pp 130).|$|E

40|$|Making an {{accurate}} diagnosis of occupational asthma (OA) is, generally, important. The condition {{has not only}} significant health consequences for affected workers, but also substantial socio-economic impacts for workers, their employers and wider society. Missing a diagnosis of OA may lead to continued exposure to a causative agent and progressive worsening of disease; conversely, diagnosing OA {{when it is not}} present may lead to inappropriate removal from exposure and unnecessary financial and social consequences. While the most accurate investigation is specific inhalation challenge in an experienced centre, this is a scarce resource, and in many cases, reliance is on other tests. This review provides a <b>technical</b> <b>dossier</b> of the diagnostic value of the available methods which include an appropriate clinical history, the use of specific immunology and measurement of inflammatory markers, and various methods of relating functional changes in airway calibre to periods at work. It is recommended that these approaches are used iteratively and in judicious combination, in cognizance of the individual patient's circumstances and requirements. Based on available evidence, a working diagnostic algorithm is proposed that can be adapted to the suspected agent, purpose of diagnosis and available resources. For better or worse, many of the techniques - and their interpretation - are available only in specialized centres and where there is room for doubt, referral to such a centre is probably wise. Accordingly, the implementation or development of such specialized centres with appropriate equipment and expertise should greatly improve the diagnostic evaluation of work-related asthma...|$|E
