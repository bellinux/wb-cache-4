5|$|August 29–31, 1999- The {{combination}} of swells from Hurricane Dennis and strong northeasterly winds produce strong rip currents along the Delaware coastline. <b>The</b> <b>currents</b> result in nearly 100 rescues and four injuries, and also forces beach closures and restrictions.

5|$|August 28, 1998- Strong {{waves and}} rip {{currents}} {{are caused by}} Hurricane Bonnie over the western Atlantic Ocean. <b>The</b> <b>currents</b> drown one person and result in bathing restrictions and over 14 lifeguard rescues at Rehoboth Beach. Coastal Delaware experiences the fringe effects of the storm, including minor beach erosion, wind gusts of up to 46mph (74km/h), and light rainfall peaking at 1.77inches (45mm) in Greenwood.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is {{a complex}} structure comprising a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, magnetotail, magnetodisk, and other components. The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates {{from a number of}} different sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the solar wind, which carries the interplanetary magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} {{is traditionally}} {{divided into three}} parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10RJ from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) and outer (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).|$|E

3000|$|Figure 7 a shows <b>the</b> <b>current</b> flow in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> {{transformer}} {{under normal}} system operation.

5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} preceding {{the development of}} Bertha produced rough surf and rip currents along the Florida coastline. In Perdido Key State Recreation Area, two children were swimming in an unguarded area when they swept away by <b>the</b> <b>currents.</b> Their grandfather attempted to rescue them, but drowned in the rough waters. Another family rescued the two children. The large circulation of Bertha produced light rainfall across Florida, with Pensacola and Destin reporting 2.75inches. Extreme southern portions of Alabama received over 3inches (75mm) of rain from the storm, while western Dauphin Island reported over 5inches (125mm).|$|E
5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures.

5|$|Powerful surf {{affected}} the northern coastlines {{of the islands}} in the Greater Antilles. Strong swells also lashed the Bahamas. During most hurricanes, {{the location of the}} Bahamas prevents powerful swells of Atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast Florida. However, the combination of the location, forward speed, and strength of Isabel produced strong swells through the Providence Channel onto a narrow 10mile (16km) stretch of the southeastern Florida coastline; wave heights peaked at 14feet (4.3m) at Delray Beach. The swells capsized a watercraft and injured its twopassengers at Boynton Beach, and a swimmer required assistance to be rescued near Juno Beach. Minor beach erosion was reported in Palm Beach County. In the northern portion of the state, waves reached up to 15feet (4.5m) in height at Flagler Beach, causing the Flagler Beach Pier to be closed due to damaged boards from the waves. Rip currents from Isabel killed a surfer at an unguarded beach in Nassau County, with an additional six people requiring rescue from <b>the</b> <b>currents.</b> The beaches were later closed during the worst of the rough surf.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction is {{by either}} asexual or sexual means. Parts of the coral may get {{detached}} from the colony by a storm or other means, {{and some of these}} fragments may end up in suitable locations to grow into new colonies which will be genetically identical to the parent colony. This fragmentation is probably the most frequent method of reproduction. Alternatively, certain pores called ampullae contain polyps that bud off short-lived, jellyfish-like medusae, which separate from the colony. They produce gametes which, after fertilisation, develop into planula larvae. These drift with <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> as part of the zooplankton before settling out and developing into new colonies.|$|E
5|$|The Arcturus did not {{encounter}} the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe {{was hoping to}} study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the border between the two. He sailed along the border between <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> for several days to document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.|$|E

5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} {{that global warming is}} unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there.

5|$|The {{pelagic zone}} {{contains}} macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with <b>the</b> <b>currents.</b> Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to {{other regions of the}} ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels.|$|E

5|$|The storm, {{combined}} with a high pressure system, produced a strong pressure gradient, resulting in strong rip currents {{off the coast of}} Florida. <b>The</b> <b>currents</b> prompted sirens, which are normally used for storm warnings, to be activated in Pensacola Beach. The rip currents killed 5 off the coast of Florida. Outer rain bands from the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the Florida Panhandle of over 11inches (280mm) in one day. The Tallahassee Regional Airport recorded 10.13inches (257mm) in 24hours, breaking the old 24‑hour record set in 1969. Throughout the state, Allison destroyed 10homes and damaged 599, 196 severely, primarily in Leon County. Including the deaths from rip currents, Allison killed eight people in Florida and caused $20million (2001USD, $26million 2012USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|With longitudinal, {{transverse}} and radial muscles, polyps {{are able}} to elongate and shorten, bend and twist, inflate and deflate, and extend and contract their tentacles. Most polyps extend to feed and contract when disturbed, often invaginating their oral discs and tentacles into the column.

Most anthozoans adhere to the substrate with their pedal discs but some {{are able to}} detach themselves and move about, while others burrow into the sediment.
