5|$|Chaplin {{spent five}} months {{on his next}} film, the two-reeler The Idle Class. Following its September 1921 release, he chose to return to England {{for the first time}} in almost a decade. He then worked to fulfil his First National contract, {{releasing}} Pay Day in February 1922. The Pilgrim – his final short film – was delayed by distribution disagreements with <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> <b>and</b> released a year later.|$|E
5|$|Delayed {{half a year}} by the {{defection}} of the Bluth group, The Fox and the Hound {{was released}} in 1981 after four years in production.

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in August 1945, {{a number}} of native Indonesian employees of Nippon Eigasha formed Berita Film Indonesia, which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly proclaimed Indonesian government. During the ensuing revolution, allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> <b>and</b> production of newsreels at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce fictional films. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised {{in part by the}} Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young boy}} in India, Mercury {{received}} formal piano training up {{to the age of}} nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time were The Who, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted Fred Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John and Supertramp) for his first solo project, and from 1985 onward collaborated with Mike Moran (in <b>the</b> <b>studio)</b> <b>and</b> Spike Edney (in concert).|$|E

5|$|Baker {{has been}} married three times; she first married Louie Ritter in 1953, but the {{marriage}} ended within a year, after which she enrolled at the Actors Studio in New York City. Baker alleged that Ritter had raped {{her when she was}} still a virgin {{in the early stages of}} their relationship. Her second was to director Jack Garfein, a Holocaust survivor she met at <b>the</b> <b>Studio</b> <b>and</b> for whom she converted to Judaism (having been raised a Catholic). They had one daughter, Blanche Baker (born 1956), also an actress; and a son, Herschel Garfein (born 1958), who is a composer and faculty member at the Steinhardt School of Music at New York University. Garfein and Baker divorced in 1969. Baker also has six grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|Billie Burke {{objected to}} her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) {{since she was}} also an actress under {{contract}} to <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point {{she was not a}} big enough star to play herself in The Great Ziegfeld. However, according to Emily W. Leider, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and says that Billie Burke's biographer stated that Miriam Hopkins would have been her first choice to play her part, not Loy. Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller walking away from the film.|$|E
5|$|Black Eye is {{the only}} {{full-length}} studio album by the English punk rock band Fluffy, released on September 17, 1996 by The Enclave. It was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> the music was not arranged by the producer {{in order to achieve}} a rough, live sound. The record contains loud punk songs that explore social issues such as sex and abuse.|$|E

5|$|Cagney {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> made Hard to Handle in 1933. This {{was followed by}} a steady stream of films, including the highly regarded Footlight Parade, which gave Cagney the chance to return to his song-and-dance roots. The film includes show-stopping scenes with Busby Berkeley-choreographed routines. His next notable film was 1934's Here Comes the Navy, which paired him with Pat O'Brien for the first time. The two would have an enduring friendship.|$|E
5|$|Citizen Kane was {{the only}} film made under Welles's {{original}} contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control. Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse. In July 1941, Welles reluctantly signed a new and less favorable deal with RKO under which he produced and directed The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), produced Journey into Fear (1943), and began It's All True, a film he agreed to do without payment. In the new contract Welles was an employee of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> lost the right to final cut, which later allowed RKO to modify and re-cut The Magnificent Ambersons over his objections. In June 1942 Schaefer resigned the presidency of RKO Pictures and Welles's contract was terminated by his successor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the end of}} 2011, {{the band}} played several secret shows (under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs) whose setlists {{consisted}} almost entirely of previously unheard songs.

5|$|Early in the game's development, {{the music}} team were shown an early build before {{starting}} {{work on the}} score. Their work was mostly complete later in development but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. Edgar Froese, Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music. He recorded with Tangerine Dream in Austria but further work was conducted at Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist and Oh No used as well.|$|E
5|$|Following Rai's {{death in}} 1940, Devika Rani {{took control of}} <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>and</b> {{produced}} some more films in partnership with her late husband's associates, namely Sashadhar Mukherjee and Ashok Kumar. As she was to recollect in her old age, the films which she supervised tended to flop, while the films supervised by the partners tended to be hits. In 1945, she retired from films, married the Russian painter Svetoslav Roerich and moved to his estate {{on the outskirts of}} Bangalore, thereafter leading a very reclusive life for the next five decades. Her persona, no less than her film roles, were considered socially unconventional. Her awards include the Padmashri (1958), Dadasaheb Phalke Award (1970) and the Soviet Land Nehru Award (1990).|$|E
5|$|Following the 1967 adaptation, {{the rights}} to the film {{remained}} with Columbia Films until 1989 when <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> <b>and</b> {{the rights to}} their intellectual property portfolio was acquired by the Japanese company Sony. In 1999, following legal action between Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM/UA, Sony traded the rights to Casino Royale for MGM's partial-rights to Spider-Man. This led to Eon Productions making the 2006 film Casino Royale. The film stars Daniel Craig as Bond, supported by Eva Green as Vesper Lynd and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre; Judi Dench returned for her fifth Bond film as Bond's superior, M. Casino Royale is a reboot, showing Bond {{at the beginning of his}} career as a 00-agent and overall stays true to the original novel.|$|E
