40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide an {{optimized}} method to reconstruct the structure of <b>the</b> upper airway (<b>UA)</b> based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that can faithfully show the anatomical structure with a smooth surface without artificial modifications. Methods MRI was performed on the head and neck of a healthy young male participant in the axial, coronal and sagittal planes to acquire images of <b>the</b> <b>UA.</b> <b>The</b> level set method was used to segment the boundary of <b>the</b> <b>UA.</b> <b>The</b> boundaries in the three scanning planes were regis-tered according to the positions of crossing points and anatomical characteristics using a Matlab program. Finally, the three-dimensional (3 D) NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surface of <b>the</b> <b>UA</b> was constructed using the registered boundaries in all three different planes. Results A smooth 3 D structure of <b>the</b> <b>UA</b> was constructed, which captured the anatomical features from the three anatomical planes, particularly the location of the anterior wall of the naso-pharynx. The volume and area of every cross section of <b>the</b> <b>UA</b> can be calculated from the constructed 3 D model of UA.
