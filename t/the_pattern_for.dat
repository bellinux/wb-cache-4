5|$|Bruce led the Australian {{delegation}} to the 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements would set <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the European Common Market in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern that}} the line-ending words follow is often {{explained}} if the numbers 1 to 6 {{are allowed to}} stand for the end-words of the first stanza. Each successive stanza takes its pattern based upon a bottom-up pairing of {{the lines of the}} preceding stanza (i.e., last and first, then second-from-last and second, then third-from-last and third). Given that <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> the first stanza is 123456, this produces 615243 in the second stanza.|$|E

5|$|This set <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> the six-year {{conflict}} between the Ottomans and Venice over control of Thessalonica. While the Ottomans blockaded and attacked Thessalonica from land, trying to starve it into surrender, the Republic sent repeated embassies to secure recognition of her possession of Thessalonica in exchange for an annual tribute. To back up their diplomatic efforts, the Venetians tried {{to put pressure on}} the Sultan, by stirring up trouble along the Ottomans' periphery, sponsoring efforts for an anti-Ottoman Crusade, and sending their fleet to attack Gallipoli. The Ottomans likewise tried to distract Venice by launching raids of their own on Venetian possessions in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Two of David's best-known books {{focus on}} the cuisine of France: French Country Cooking (1951) and French Provincial Cooking (1960); France {{features}} prominently, though not exclusively, in another two: A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950) and Summer Cooking (1955). She set <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>for</b> her books by grouping recipes by category, with sections linked by her chosen passages from relevant literature. In her first book, Mediterranean Food, David presented chapters on soups; eggs and luncheon dishes; fish; meat; substantial dishes; poultry and game; vegetables; cold food and salads; sweets; jams, chutneys and preserves; and sauces. She broadly followed this pattern in her next four books.|$|E

40|$|This work investigates mosaic <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{one-dimensional}} cellular {{neural networks}} with various boundary conditions. These patterns can be formed by combining <b>the</b> basic <b>patterns.</b> <b>The</b> parameter space is partitioned {{so that the}} existence of basic patterns can be determined for each parameter region. <b>The</b> mosaic <b>patterns</b> can then be completely characterized through formulating suitable transition matrices and boundary-pattern matrices. These matrices gener-ate <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> interior cells from <b>the</b> basic <b>patterns</b> and indicate <b>the</b> feasible <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> boundary cells. As an illustration, we elaborate on the cellular neural networks with a general 1 3 template. The exact number of mosaic patterns will be computed for the system with the Dirichlet, Neumann and periodic boundary conditions respectively. The idea in this study can be extended to other one-dimensional lattice systems with nite-range interaction. 1...|$|R
40|$|Signals of {{anthropogenic}} warming over Europe are {{searched for}} in <b>the</b> spatial trend <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> variance and skewness (expressed by the 10 th and 90 th percentiles) {{of the distribution}} of daily mean temperature. Comparisons are made between these <b>patterns</b> in <b>the</b> station records of the European Climate Assessment dataset for the 1976 – 99 period, <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> associated with natural variability in the observations (which were empirically derived from the observations in the 1946 – 75 period), and <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> of future warming and natural variability as simulated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model in the Challenge ensemble experiment. The results indicate that, on the basis of <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> variance, a distinction can be made between temperature change due to natural variability and temperature change due to changes in external forcing. The observed variance trend <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> spring (March–May) and summer (June–August) warming 1976 – 99 are clearly different from <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> change in variance associated with a warming due to natural variability in the observations. This led us to conclude that a change in an external forcing has to be invoked to explain the observed spring and summer warming. From the evaluation of the greenhouse and natural variability <b>patterns</b> in <b>the</b> climate model simulations, we infer that the observed spring and summer variance trend patterns contain imprints consistent with anthropogenic warming.
