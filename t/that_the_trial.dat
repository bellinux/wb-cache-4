5|$|The court {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> {{judge had}} erred in not exercising his discretion to bar {{the evidence from}} being admitted, {{although it was not}} necessary to decide the point.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich {{was able to}} provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E
5|$|Gambira faced a {{total of}} sixteen charges {{for his role in}} the protests, {{including}} membership in an unlawful association and illegal movement across borders. In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying that the military government would not allow him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> of a forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E
5000|$|Following the [...] "Trial of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center" [...] in 1937 (the {{second of}} <b>the</b> Moscow <b>Trials),</b> Collard {{published}} a book through the Left Book Club entitled Soviet Justice and <b>the</b> <b>Trial</b> of Radek and Others which argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> had been conducted fairly. Most historians now conclude <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Moscow <b>Trials</b> were show trials.|$|R

50|$|Woetzel’s {{doctoral}} dissertation, on {{the legality}} of <b>the</b> Nuremberg <b>trials,</b> was published as <b>The</b> Nuremberg <b>Trials</b> in International Law. His main purpose in <b>The</b> Nuremberg <b>Trials</b> was to defend the basis of <b>the</b> Nuremberg <b>trials</b> in international law, opposing legal scholars who had argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> were ex post facto and illegal. However, he also expressed <b>the</b> hope <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Nuremberg <b>trials</b> would eventually lead {{to the establishment of}} an international criminal court.|$|R
5|$|Taw {{appealed to}} the High Court against his {{conviction}} on two main grounds. The first involved the admissibility of evidence for his corruption, and, additionally, inconsistencies of such evidence. The second concerned constitutional issues. With regard to the evidential issue, the Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> judge made an error in accepting GIC's statements as admissible, and thus ordered Taw's convictions to be set aside.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} argued: (1) {{that the}} indictment {{should have been}} quashed because {{of the absence of}} women from the grand jury; (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court; (3) that the indictment was duplicitous, inconsistent, and vague; (4) that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; (5) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> judge should have granted a continuance, rather than appoint Stewart to represent Kretske; (6) that Roth should have been severed from the other defendants; (7) that the reports of the Alcohol Tax Unit were hearsay; (7) that the two government exhibits not admitted into evidence were sent to the jury during its deliberations; (8) that Glasser had been cross-examined on matters not pertinent to the charge and not within the scope of his direct examination; (9) that the cross-examination of U.S. Attorney Campbell had been unduly restricted; (10) that evidence beyond the scope of the bill of particulars had been introduced; (11) that there was insufficient corroboration of the accomplice testimony against Kretske; (12) that certain testimony of Alexander Campbell was erroneously admitted; (13) that the admission of various prejudicial evidence had the cumulative effect of denying the defendants a fair trial; (14) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> judge's cross-examination of witnesses and other comments crossed the line into advocacy; and (15) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> judge should have granted a new trial because of the exclusion of women from the jury pool.|$|E
5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of the top-ranking Nazis, such as Göring, Hess, von Ribbentrop, Streicher, and Speer, the initial {{proposal}} by the British was to simply arrest them and shoot them, but that course of action was replaced by putting them on trial for war crimes at <b>the</b> Nuremberg <b>Trials</b> in order to publicize their crimes while demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> and <b>the</b> sentences were just, especially to the German people. However, the legal foundations of <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> were questioned, and the German people were not convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> were anything more than [...] "victors' justice".|$|R

5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 2015, the ORR {{announced}} that WCRC {{and the driver}} of the train were to be prosecuted for offences contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. An initial hearing was scheduled to be heard at Swindon Magistrates Court on 11 January 2016, but postponed until 20 January. When the case opened, neither the driver Melvyn Cox nor WCRC entered pleas. The case was committed to Swindon Crown Court, where it was scheduled to be heard on 19 February; unconditional bail was granted to Cox. The case was subsequently postponed until 18 March, and then further postponed to an undisclosed date in May 2016. In late May, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> would begin on 27 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court because the notation indicating that the indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) that the indictment was insufficiently definite; (4) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross-examination were prejudicial.|$|E
50|$|The Finns {{initially}} thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> {{would be}} for conventional war crimes. However, as the Moscow Declaration of October 30, 1943 made clear, the Allied powers intended to prosecute for other actions as well.|$|R

5000|$|The {{historian}} Richard Kieckhefer suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{late medieval}} <b>trials</b> [...] "paved <b>the</b> way for more dramatic prosecutions to come". There {{had been a}} {{growth in the number}} of sorcery trials in Europe during the fourteenth century. Kieckhefer noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> of <b>the</b> fifteenth century were [...] "different in kind from most of the preceding cases."

5|$|With the WDL, Murray became {{active in}} the case of Odell Waller, a black Virginia {{sharecropper}} sentenced to death for killing his white landlord, Oscar Davis, during an argument. The WDL argued that Davis had cheated Waller in a settlement and as their argument grew more heated, Waller had shot Davis in legitimate fear of his life. Murray toured the country raising funds for Waller's appeal. She wrote to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on Waller's behalf. Roosevelt in turn wrote to Virginia Governor James Hubert Price, asking him to guarantee <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> was fair; she later persuaded the president to privately request Price to commute the death sentence. Through this correspondence, Murray and Eleanor Roosevelt began a friendship that would last until the latter's death two decades later. Despite the efforts of the WDL and the Roosevelts, however, the governor did not commute Waller's sentence. Waller was executed on July 2, 1942.|$|E
5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Unlike English common law, Chinese law {{held the}} community, {{rather than the}} individual, {{responsible}} for transgressions. Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu demanded {{the death of the}} culprit and was prepared to accept any sailor, whether innocent or guilty, to settle the matter. On 12 August, under an Act of Parliament of 1833, Elliot began a Court of Criminal and Admiralty Jurisdiction on board the Fort William in Hong Kong harbour, with himself as judge and a group of merchants as the jury. Two men were found guilty of rioting, fined £15 each, and sentenced to three months hard labour to be served in England while a further three men were found guilty of assault and rioting, fined £25 each, and sentenced to six months imprisonment in similar conditions. However, the Act was under review and after arriving in England, they were set free on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> held no jurisdiction. Elliot invited Lin to send observers to the trial, but none came. Without the handover of a man to the Chinese, Lin was not satisfied with the proceedings. He viewed the extraterritorial court as an infringement of China's sovereignty.|$|E
50|$|On April 15, 1987, {{military}} personnel headed by Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Rico staged {{a series of}} barrack uprisings demanding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> of those not exempted under the law be aborted. The mutineers were all seized, but only two arrested.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Worksites, {{including}} those that employ multiethnic, low-wage workforces, represent a strategic venue for reaching populations at risk for developing cancer. Methods We surveyed 197 small manufacturing worksites prior to an effort to recruit their workforces into a randomized clinical trial designed to test {{the effectiveness of a}} cancer prevention intervention among multiethnic, low-wage manufacturing workers. This paper assesses the external validity of <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> based on three factors: the percentage of potential trial sites excluded from consideration, the percentage of eligible worksites <b>that</b> adopted <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> and worksite characteristics associated with adoption. Results We found no statistically significant differences between worksites <b>that</b> adopted <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and worksites <b>that</b> declined <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> with regard to employee demographics, anticipated changes in workforce size, and perceived importance and history of offering health promotion and occupational health and safety activities. Conclusion Small manufacturing worksites present a viable venue for reaching multiethnic, low-wage populations with cancer prevention programs, although program adoption rates may be low in this sector. Worksites <b>that</b> adopted <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> are likely to represent worksites deemed eligible for <b>the</b> <b>trial...</b>|$|R
25|$|On Dec. 17, 2012, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the two felony {{convictions}} of Warren {{and two of}} the convictions related to McRae, ordering new trials on those charges.

25|$|Initial jury {{selection}} began on March 21, {{and saw a}} total of 204 prospective jurors subjected {{to the process of}} Voir dire selection before, in June, 16 jurors considered satisfactory by both counsels had been selected. Upon completion of {{jury selection}} process, Bonin's attorney renewed his motion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> should be moved to a jurisdiction outside of Orange County due to pretrial publicity tainting the jury pool; this motion was again rejected by Judge Lae, who again ruled that the 16 members of the jury selected from Orange County by this date and considered satisfactory by both counsels would serve as jurors throughout the trial, as no likelihood existed of Bonin receiving an unfair trial. Judge Lae ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> would begin on June 14.|$|E
