It is an essential <b>trace</b> <b>nutrient,</b> with the body containing approximately 10 milligrams at any given time, being mainly in the liver and kidneys.

50|$|Some {{vitamins}} and other <b>trace</b> <b>nutrients</b> are lost, particularly from vegetables, partially by enzyme action during cooking and partially due to heat degradation. When vegetables are cooked at higher temperatures these enzymes are rapidly denatured and have {{less time to}} act during cooking. Since slow cookers work at temperatures well below boiling point and do not rapidly denature enzymes, vegetables tend to lose <b>trace</b> <b>nutrients.</b> Blanched vegetables, having been exposed to very hot water, have already had these enzymes rendered largely ineffective, so a blanching or sauteing pre-cook stage leaves more vitamins intact. This is often a smaller nutrient loss than over-boiling and can be lessened to an extent by not removing the lid until the food is done.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{intent of}} the present study was to examine the {{nutritional}} characteristics of a contemporary diet based upon Paleolithic food groups and to determine how these characteristics may impact the risk of chronic disease. Methods: Nutritional software was employed to ascertain the macro and <b>trace</b> <b>nutrient</b> characteristics of a diet composed of commonly available modern foods, but devoid of processed foods, dairy products and cereal grains. The rel-ative contribution of plant and animal foods to the experi-mental diet was based upon average values previously determined in 229 hunter gatherer societies. Results: The analysis revealed that except for vitamin D, which would have been supplied by endogenous synthesis in hunter gatherers, it is entirely possible to consume a nutri-tionally balanced diet from contemporary foods that mimic the food groups and types available during the Paleolithic. Despite the elimination of two major food groups, the <b>trace</b> <b>nutrient</b> density of the experimental diet remained excep-tionally high.

40|$|This study reports daily {{activity}} pattern, {{home range}} size, daily travel distances and feeding behaviour for {{a troop of}} chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) inhabiting a pine plantation in Eastern Highlands, Zimbabwe. The {{amount of time spent}} foraging is similar to other baboons, Papio hamadryas in particular. The minimum home range size and daily travel distance for this troop are smaller than those reported for other troops of chacma, yellow, olive and hamadryas baboons in South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Saudi Arabia. Erin forest baboon densities, however, are much larger than those reported elsewhere for baboons. The high densities {{may be related to the}} high concentration of food resources within the pine plantation. The study also examined the possible underlying causes of bark stripping by chacma baboons. Bark stripping does not appear to be linked to critical limitations in resources such as food, sleeping sites or water. Instead, bark stripping may be a prophylactic or <b>trace</b> <b>nutrient</b> augmentation measure as suggested by a high correlation between coughing by baboons and bark stripping. This possible link between baboon health (as reflected by coughing), parasite loads and <b>trace</b> <b>nutrient</b> requirements and bark stripping merits further investigation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trace</b> <b>nutrients</b> (metals) supplementation {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to have a beneficial effect on the welfare of anaerobic digesters {{but there was a}} lack of information on the chemistry controlling their fate. The aim of this research was to determine the reactions governing the chemical behaviour of metals in anaerobically digested sludge and predict the fate of those metals when supplemented as MeEDTA. After the assessment of a wide range of analytical techniques, a suite of suitable analytical techniques 1 were used to determine the metals behaviour in two case studies of metals supplementation: iron dosing and MeEDTA supplementation. The behaviour of the metals was controlled by the solid phase throughout a primary reaction (sulphide precipitation) and secondary reactions (phosphate precipitation, adsorption and organic complexation). The competition between the strength of metal's binding and EDTA complexation controlled the fate of the supplemented metals in anaerobic digesters. Transfer of CoEDTA in the solid phase was found to be divided into two reactions, where the second has a slow kinetic depending on the availability of the counter-ion reacting with EDTA. A key conclusion was that the presence of weaker metal-bound compounds mixed with strong sulphide precipitates changed the understanding of metals speciation, especially concerning their potential availability and consequently their behaviour as <b>trace</b> <b>nutrients...</b>|$|R

At the end of the experiment, the concentrations of the added <b>trace</b> <b>nutrients</b> and NaHCO 3 were 0 and 400  mg/L, respectively.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} by SERDP to quantify processes {{and determine the}} effectiveness of abiotic/biotic mineralization of energetics (RDX, HMX, TNT) in aquifer sediments by combinations of biostimulation (carbon, <b>trace</b> <b>nutrient</b> additions) and chemical reduction of sediment to create a reducing environment. Initially {{it was hypothesized that}} a balance of chemical reduction of sediment and biostimulation would increase the RDX, HMX, and TNT mineralization rate significantly (by a combination of abiotic and biotic processes) so that this abiotic/biotic treatment may be a more efficient for remediation than biotic treatment alone in some cases. Because both abiotic and biotic processes are involved in energetic mineralization in sediments, it was further hypothesized that consideration for both abiotic reduction and microbial growth was need to optimize the sediment system for the most rapid mineralization rate. Results show that there are separate optimal abiotic/biostimulation aquifer sediment treatments for RDX/HMX and for TNT. Optimal sediment treatment for RDX and HMX (which have chemical similarities and similar degradation pathways) is mainly chemical reduction of sediment, which increased the RDX/HMX mineralization rate 100 to 150 times (relative to untreated sediment), with additional carbon or <b>trace</b> <b>nutrient</b> addition, which increased the RDX/HMX mineralization rate an additional 3 to 4 times. In contrast, the optimal aquifer sediment treatment for TNT involves mainly biostimulation (glucose addition), which stimulates a TNT/glucose cometabolic degradation pathway (6. 8 times more rapid than untreated sediment), degrading TNT to amino-intermediates that irreversibly sorb (i. e., end product is not CO 2). The TNT mass migration risk is minimized by these transformation reactions, as the triaminotoluene and 2, 4 - and 2, 6 -diaminonitrotoluene products that irreversibly sorb are no longer mobile in the subsurface environment. These transformation rates are increased 13 times further by chemical reduction of sediment. Dithionite reduction alone is not an effective treatment for TNT (intermediates that irreversibly sorb are not produced), even though the TNT degradation rate (to 2 - or 4 -aminodinitrotoluene) increases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Soil pH {{has a major}} {{effect on}} plant {{nutrient}} availability by controlling the chemical structure of the nutrient.

In addition to macronutrients, plants also need trace nutrients and both macro and <b>trace</b> <b>nutrient</b> availability is controlled by soil pH. Understanding of spatial variability of soil properties is important in site-specific management. Analysis of spatial variation of soil properties is fundamental to sustainable agricultural and rural development. The special variability of soil property is often measured using various interpolation methods resulting in map generation. Selecting a proper spatial interpolation method is crucial in surface analysis, since different methods of interpolation can lead to different surface results.
