500|$|... "Glass Onion" [...] was {{the first}} backing track {{recorded}} as a full band since Starr's brief departure. MacDonald claimed Lennon deliberately wrote the lyrics to mock fans who claimed to find [...] "hidden messages" [...] in songs, and referenced other songs in the Beatles catalogueâ€“ [...] "The Walrus was Paul" [...] refers back to [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] (which itself refers to [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"). McCartney, in turn, overdubbed a recorder part after the line [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Fool on the Hill", as a deliberate parody of the earlier song. A string section {{was added to the}} track in October.|$|E
2500|$|My father, after I had {{finished}} saying what I have repeated above, {{looked at me}} a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: [...] "My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> origin of [...] is true. Your mother and sister, Mrs. Athalia Robinson, were present when that book was handed to me in Mentor, Ohio, and all I ever knew {{about the origin of}} [...] was what Parley P. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith and the witnesses who claimed they saw the plates have told me, and in all of my intimacy with Joseph Smith he never told me but one story." ...|$|E
2500|$|This theory {{contradicts the}} {{testimony}} of Rigdon to his son John, just prior to his death and long after he had ceased an affiliation {{with any of the}} sects of Mormonism: [...] "My father, after I had finished saying what I have repeated above, looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: 'My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> origin of [...] is true. Your mother and sister, Mrs. Athalia Robinson, were present when that book was handed to me in Mentor, Ohio, and all I ever knew about the origin of [...] was what Parley P.

6000|$|... 'What {{are only}} sick fancies?' he retorted. 'What do <b>you</b> know <b>about</b> fancies? Who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> fancies? <b>The</b> old story! Fancies!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{they know}} all about this thing. Haven't they <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{we can go}} in to the others. Remember what I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> omitting <b>the</b> {{first seven}} pages. The society won't stand {{introductory}} remarks in a thesis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to do}} you justice, Geoffrey--if {{you will}} help me, by meeting me half-way. Our mother has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{assure you}} {{you are very}} much mistaken, or else very modest. Has no one <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effect your book {{produced}} here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you suppose, then, {{that is why}} I stop at Rooi Krantz, just {{to breed}} horses? Has not your father <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> great {{treasure}} hidden away up there among the Makalanga?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{names of}} the Chiefs in the fight were Crazy Horse, Lame Deer, Spotted Eagle and Two Moon. Two Moon led the Cheyennes. Gall and some other Chiefs were there but <b>the</b> ones I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> were <b>the</b> leaders.|$|R
6000|$|... "It took {{me back to}} the old scenes," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Bowman, dreamily. [...] "I {{have never}} kept anything back from <b>you,</b> Nathaniel. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>the</b> first man I ever thought anything of--Charlie Tucker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This isn't real old Worcester. I s'pose Jolyon's <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> young man. From all I can learn, he's got no business, no income, and {{no connection}} worth speaking of; but then, I know nothing--nobody tells me anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a very}} {{harmless}} kind of boyishness at all events," [...] replied Wallace. [...] "It is {{not like}} some other kinds of boyishness, such as I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{man from}} Sadler's," [...] said Matlack, turning to Mrs. Perkenpine, [...] "and I must be {{off to see}} him. Remember what I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> supper." [...] And so saying, he walked rapidly away.|$|E
6000|$|... "But Nanny," [...] {{the doctor}} said, [...] "you must {{remember}} what I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> poo--, {{about the place}} you are going to. It is a fine house, {{and you will be}} very happy in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> 'em: <b>the</b> {{only ones}} he's got: his half-sista's children. He neva saw 'em, and he neva wanted to; but they're his kin, {{and it was}} his money. It don't seem right to pass 'em ova. Do you think it would yourself, Clementina?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But Laufer fell at {{his feet}} and begged for mercy. It was her mother's fault, she said: 'It was she, and not I, who passed me off as the Princess Lineik. The only lie I have ever <b>told</b> <b>you</b> was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> robes, and I do not deserve death for that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was a trick!' he cried. 'Remember what Sherriff {{said that}} night when I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> finding <b>the</b> man looking in at the window? He said that the fellow was spying round as a {{preliminary}} move. To-day he trumps up an obviously false excuse for getting into the house. Was he left alone in the rooms at all?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One of them hasn't {{much effect}} on him. I don't know whether I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bag the two sports who were round here last fall nearly made. I got the tale from Webster {{on the next}} ranch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{was very}} curious. I don't know what made me say it. Some whim, I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am sorry they <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man. It is a hideous subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps not. And {{you never}} will {{understand}} me. Oh, goodness they're all going, {{and we must}} {{get out of the}} way. Is that Prince Frederic, who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> hay? He is handsome; isn't he? And who is that in the violet dress with all the pearls?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want them}} mitigated; state them clearly. Include what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{trouble with the}} natives, and the {{poisoned}} arrows." ...|$|R
6000|$|And at this tea Captain Cormorant said, {{among other}} things, [...] "Did he kick up rough {{at all when}} <b>you</b> <b>told</b> him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bess, here's the bad place, <b>the</b> place I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> with <b>the</b> cut steps. You start down, leading your burro. Take {{your time}} and hold on to him if you slip. I've got a rope on him and a half-hitch on this point of rock, so I can let him down safely. Coming up here was a killing job. But it'll be easy going down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Deer family," [...] began Old Mother Nature, [...] "is {{divided into}} two branches--the round-horned and the flat-horned. I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> round-horned Deer with the {{exception}} of the largest and noblest, Bugler the Elk. He is commonly called Elk, but his right name is Wapiti.|$|E
6000|$|ANDERSON. Thank you-- (He takes a {{chair from}} beside the fireplace, {{and turns it}} {{so that he can}} sit comfortably at the fire. When he is seated he adds, in the tone of a man who knows that he is opening a {{difficult}} subject.) Has Christy <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> new will? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But this is {{not good}} news of his friend; it is only {{uncertain}} news," [...] interrupted the old gentleman quickly. [...] "Now I think of it, Mrs Bland, Mr Leather is to call here by appointment this very morning, so you must be particularly careful not to say a word to him about this telegram, or Captain Stride, or anything I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lost ship--you understand, Mrs Bland?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is always}} the girl," [...] Mr. Waddington reflected. [...] "The girl with the blue eyes, I suppose, whom <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me <b>about?</b> <b>The</b> girl of the garden?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{realised}} {{there was}} a problem almost as soon as I took over the channel BBC2. It was obvious that the logo TWOmade absolutely no impact. In fact, it was something anyone could have <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> It was singularly unmemorable, and <b>told</b> <b>you</b> nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> personality of the channel. So we decided to commission a corporate design company to do some research. Alan Yentob ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Betsy Bobbin, <b>the</b> {{little girl}} who was shipwrecked--in {{much the same way}} you once were--and has since been {{following}} the Shaggy Man in his search for his lost brother. You remember her, do you not?" ...|$|R
60|$|What {{he meant}} by the chalk {{sweetening}} the land you would not understand yet, and I can hardly tell you; for chemists are not yet agreed how it happens. But he was right; and right, too, what he <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> water inside the chalk, which {{is more important to}} us just now; for, if we follow it out, we shall surely come to a cave at last.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such is {{the place}} indeed, {{and there are no}} trees like to those you speak of to be found {{anywhere}} else. The maidens use the flowers of them to adorn their hair, and from the leaves is made a salve that is very good for wounds. But, say, Swallow, who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mountain Umpondwana that is so far away, since I never described it to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Three {{ships were}} sent here, {{on the report}} that a Moorish pirate had been {{cruising}} in these waters, and that several vessels were missing. When the story first came I did not credit it. The captain of the ship who brought the news {{told me he had}} met you about halfway across, and had <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> supposed pirate. A vessel arrived four days later, and brought letters from my agent, but he said no word about your boat having arrived.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{remember}} if I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> last night <b>about</b> <b>the</b> party. We are giving a little supper-dance {{to the company}} of Otie's play after the performance this evening. Of course you will come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Malinche; {{but that}} is why I {{wanted to see you}} first alone. You {{remember}} that I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Spaniards, and how they owned the islands, and would some day surely come to Mexico; but that I belong to another white people, who are forbidden by the Spaniards, under pain of death, to come to these parts. They must not know that I am not of their nation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] I added, as I {{paid the}} bill, [...] "I {{have really been}} profoundly {{interested}} in what <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me <b>about</b> <b>the</b> New Shaving. Have {{you ever heard of}} a thing called the New theology?" ...|$|R
