5|$|The Hachisuka scroll {{contains}} paintings {{which are}} not associated with any text sections of <b>the</b> <b>scroll.</b> The fifth painting of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> corresponds to a scene described in the second text section of the Hinohara scroll, where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed tsumado (hinged plank door) and shitomido (latticed shutters). Next to her is an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick {{on top of it}} (tōdai).|$|E
5|$|Ready, Aim, Tomatoes! is a {{spin-off}} of {{the original}} ToeJam & Earl where the player (as ToeJam) fires tomatoes at ToeJam & Earl series enemies for points as the screen scrolls. <b>The</b> <b>scroll</b> speed increases with game duration. The enemies—dentists, devils, and cupids—return fire throughout the ten levels. The game also features power-ups and lock-on targeting, to aid in player accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The Gotoh edition {{corresponds}} to scenes 1, 2 and 4 of the Matsudaira clan scroll {{and had been}} partitioned off from <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> in 1932 and 1933 by Masuda Donō. It consists of 3 paintings and 3 associated captions each framed individually (six items in total). This set has been designated as National Treasure on June 28, 1956 and {{is located at the}} Gotoh Museum.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> {{were first}} {{completed}} and kept at the Kasuga shrine, <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> were carefully protected—with no shrine priest or Kōfukuji monk less than 40 {{years of age}} able to view <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b> Moreover, if <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> were required at Kōfukuji, {{it was only the}} Tōbokuin sanctuary that was permitted to receive <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b> However, for a while, during the late 18th Century, <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> became less carefully looked after. <b>The</b> <b>scrolls</b> were most likely treated more casually because of the decline suffered by Kasuga and Kōfukuji at the time.|$|R

50|$|Fine {{scrolling}} requires setup {{to define}} <b>the</b> <b>scrolling</b> region. This {{is done by}} setting <b>the</b> Vertical <b>Scroll</b> (VS) modifier bit in sequential Display List instructions. The first Mode line instruction without the VS bit set becomes the end of <b>the</b> <b>scrolling</b> region and {{is used as a}} buffer line to supply the new scan lines to <b>scroll</b> up into <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>scrolling</b> region.|$|R
5|$|The Tale of Genji was copied and {{illustrated}} {{in various forms}} as early as a century after Murasaki's death. The Genji Monogatari Emaki, is a late Heian era 12th-century handscroll, consisting of four scrolls, 19 paintings, and 20 sheets of calligraphy. The illustrations, definitively dated to between 1110 and 1120, have been tentatively attributed to Fujiwara no Takachika and the calligraphy to various well-known contemporary calligraphers. <b>The</b> <b>scroll</b> is housed at the Gotoh Museum and the Tokugawa Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the initials of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, the Torah and yad Rosenberg {{left with}} King Kalākaua were {{included}} in an exhibition of royal possessions at a bazaar held by King Kalākaua's wife, Queen Kapiolani. After King Kalākaua's death in 1891, his stepson David Kawānanakoa inherited the items. When Kawānanakoa's wife, Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa, inherited them after David's death, she loaned them {{to members of the}} Hawaiian Jewish community on religious holidays. Her granddaughter, Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa, later acquired the items. The yad was bequeathed to Temple Emanu-El in 1959, and formally dedicated for use in Torah readings the next year. The Torah was lost in the 1940s, but was recovered in 1972 when a Honolulu attorney found <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> in the possessions of a recently deceased client and donated it to the temple. The Torah had been damaged and could not be used in services, but the temple later installed a plaque describing Rosenberg below a glass display case housing the Torah and yad.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> were <b>the</b> product of Jews living in Jerusalem, who hid <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> in <b>the</b> caves near Qumran while fleeing from the Romans during the destruction of Jerusalem in 70CE. Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed that <b>the</b> Dead Sea <b>Scrolls</b> originated at <b>the</b> library of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. Later, Norman Golb suggested that <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> were <b>the</b> product of multiple libraries in Jerusalem, and not necessarily the Jerusalem Temple library. Proponents of the Jerusalem Origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> as evidence against a Qumran origin of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b> Several archaeologists have also accepted an origin of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> other than Qumran, including Yizhar Hirschfeld and most recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg, who all understand the remains of Qumran to be those of a Hasmonean fort that was reused during later periods.|$|R

5|$|Mandalas became {{predominant}} in {{the paintings}} of the early Heian period as esoteric Buddhism emerged with the Shingon and Tendai sects in the 8th and 9th centuries. The evolution of Pure Land Buddhism caused raigō-zu to be developed as a genre, characterised by depictions of the Amida welcoming {{the souls of the}} faithful to his Western Paradise as seen in a 1053 painting in the Phoenix-Hall of Byōdō-in. By the mid-Heian period, Chinese style kara-e painting was replaced with the classical Japanese yamato-e style, in which the images were painted primarily on sliding screens and byōbu folding screens. At the close of the Heian period around 1185, the practice of adorning emakimono hand scrolls with yamato-e paintings flourished. Examples of illustrated hand scrolls include novels such as Genji Monogatari Emaki, historical writings like The Tale of Great Minister Ban, or religious works such as <b>the</b> <b>Scroll</b> of Hungry Ghosts. These genres continued to be produced into the Kamakura period from 1185 to 1333. As during the Nara period, sculpture remained the preferred art form of the period.|$|E
5|$|Boy Scouting uses {{a series}} of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank {{consists}} of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank. Life has a First Class emblem on a red heart, and initially symbolized the first-aid and health-related merit badges that the rank required. Now it signifies that the ideals of Scouting have {{become a part of the}} Scout's life and character.|$|E
5|$|The Great Seal: The Great Seal of Fordham University was {{designed}} to acknowledge {{the presence of the}} Society of Jesus on campus, hence the order's coat of arms in the seal's center. The coat of arms bears the Greek letters of the lapidary form of Jesus Christ (IHS), with the Cross resting on the center of the H and the three nails of the Crucifixion beneath the epigraph. These figures, dressed in gold, lay in a field framed in maroon, the color of the university, with silver fleur-de-lis at the edge. The fleur-de-lis symbolize the French Jesuits who arrived at Fordham in 1846. Immediately above the central shield rests the laurel crown, enclosing the university's pedagogical disciplines: arts, science, philosophy, medicine, and law. Below the shield is a blue scroll with the university's motto, Sapientia et Doctrina. <b>The</b> <b>scroll</b> rests on a gold field emblematic of learning (doctrina) and is surrounded by the fiery tongues of the Holy Spirit, a symbol of wisdom (sapientia). In a circular maroon field embroidered with beads is Fordham's official title, Universitas Fordhamensis; at the field's lower edge is the date of the university's founding, 1841. Finally, surrounding the entire seal is a heraldic belt, which is employed as a stylistic decoration. The University of Oxford, the only other tertiary institution in the world that uses a belt in its seal, however, maintains that without the belt, the seal is not official.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scrolls</b> {{and traditions}} {{are still alive}} today, and passed along from {{generation}} to generation. The Midewiwin are a traditional group that still keeps <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> and their teachings alive. There is some secrecy involved to keep <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> safe, to interpret them correctly, and to wait until there is more respect for this ancient language system. Scrolls are passed along and the oral teachings that go with them. Complex stories are represented and memorized {{with the use of}} the pictures on <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Often, one of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> is fixed, {{while the}} other orbits {{eccentrically}} without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b> Another method for producing the compression motion is co-rotating <b>the</b> <b>scrolls,</b> in synchronous motion, but with offset centers of rotation. The relative motion {{is the same as}} if one were orbiting.|$|R

25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to wrap <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text at the end of <b>the</b> <b>scroll,</b> the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> not being read can remain wound. This still leaves <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E

5000|$|Strugnell {{had come}} {{increasingly}} under controversy for his slow progress in publishing <b>the</b> <b>scrolls,</b> and {{his refusal to}} give scholars free access to <b>the</b> unpublished <b>scrolls.</b> Some argue <b>the</b> removal of Strugnell from his editorial post ended the more than three-decade blockade that he and other Harvard-educated scholars, such as Notre Dame's Eugene Ulrich, had maintained to keep other scholars from accessing <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b> [...] <b>The</b> blockade on the publication of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> effected by Strugnell {{and other members of}} Harvard's academic community was broken by the combined efforts of Hershel Shanks of the Biblical Archaeology Review (who had personally waged a 15-year campaign to release <b>the</b> <b>scrolls)</b> and Ben Zion Wacholder of Hebrew Union College, along with his student, Martin Abegg, who published the first facsimile of <b>the</b> suppressed <b>scrolls</b> in 1991.

50|$|Information about <b>The</b> Elder <b>Scrolls</b> is sparse, {{and often}} contradictory. They {{are thought to}} be relics from the {{creation}} of the Aurbis and the Mundus by the Aedric et'Ada (legendary beings similar to Daedra that sacrificed their immortality to create <b>the</b> world). <b>The</b> <b>Scrolls</b> themselves usually cannot be translated nor transcribed; however, there exist a sect of monks—the Order of the Ancestor Moths—who devote their lives to the reading and interpreting of <b>the</b> Elder <b>Scrolls.</b> Reading <b>the</b> <b>Scrolls,</b> however, takes a huge toll on the monks' vision. Senior members who read <b>the</b> <b>Scrolls</b> wear blindfolds at all times when they are not divining the Scrolls' content and retired Moth Priests are always completely blind. Attempting to read <b>the</b> Elder <b>Scrolls</b> without training always results in failure and immediate blindness. However, cosmically important individuals, or individuals that are the subject of prophecy, have been able to see the unencrypted writing on <b>the</b> Elder <b>Scrolls</b> without <b>the</b> associated rituals or resulting blindness. A book entitled Lost Histories of Tamriel provides further insight on <b>the</b> Elder <b>Scrolls,</b> stating that when any event has actually occurred, it sets itself unchangeably into <b>the</b> <b>Scrolls,</b> and no action, magical or otherwise, can alter this.|$|R
