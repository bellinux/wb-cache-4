2500|$|Jackal (sometimes spelled [...] "Jackall" [...] or [...] "Jack Hall"), {{had been}} {{launched}} in America in 1782. The one contemporary {{picture of her}} appears to show a lapstrake sloop with <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> and a removable bowsprit and lightly stayed mast such as were commonly found on longboats and cutters intended to be carried on deck or towed astern of larger vessels. She [...] "showed a tier of ports fore and aft. The greatest part of them were false or only painted, yet they made such a good appearance that for some time we concluded she was a King's cutter or a tender to some man-of-war".|$|E
60|$|He {{came back}} to where his {{companion}} stood at the <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> and he felt proud of him and of himself; and when he read the unspoken praise in 'Frisco Kid's eyes he blushed like a girl at her first compliment. But the next instant the thought flashed across him that this boy was a thief, a common thief; and he instinctively recoiled. His whole life had been sheltered from the harsher things of the world. His reading, which had been of the best, had laid a premium upon honesty and uprightness, and {{he had learned to}} look with abhorrence upon the criminal classes. So he drew a little away from 'Frisco Kid and remained silent. But 'Frisco Kid, devoting all his energies to the handling of the sloop, had no time in which to remark this sudden change of feeling on the part of his companion.|$|E

50|$|The first {{automobiles}} were steered with a <b>tiller.</b> The <b>steering</b> wheel {{was first}} used when Alfred Vacheron competed in the 1894 Paris-Rouen motor race in a Panhard et Levassor. In 1898, steering wheels became a standard feature of Panhard et Levassor cars. They were introduced in the U.S. by Packard in 1899.|$|R

5000|$|The new {{directors}} {{recommended that}} Benz should create {{a less expensive}} automobile suitable for mass production. In 1893, Karl Benz created the Victoria, a two-passenger automobile with a [...] engine, which could reach the top speed of 18 km/h and had a pivotal front axle operated by a roller-chained <b>tiller</b> for <b>steering.</b> The model was successful with 85 units sold in 1893.|$|R
50|$|The {{claim was}} also disputed by Hichens's great granddaughter on Channel 4 News. Sally Nilsson {{explained}} that Hichens was a well trained Quartermaster {{with years of}} experience steering large vessels. He had been responsible on his watch for steering the Titanic for four days before the collision and would not have made such a glaring error. As to the steering orders, in 1912 they were as follows: There was only one way of giving steering orders. The order was always given with reference to the tiller. To go to port the Officer ordered starboard. The Quartermaster turned the wheel to port, tiller went to starboard and the ship turned to port. This was a hangover from the old days when ships were steered with <b>tillers,</b> <b>steering</b> oars etc. The change in steering orders did not occur until the 1930s. Sally Nilsson's biography on the life of Robert Hichens was published in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Small {{outboard}} motors are frequently used as trolling motors on boats with much larger engines {{that do not}} operate as efficiently or quietly at trolling speeds. These typically are designed with a manual pull start system, throttle and gearshift controls {{mounted on the body}} of the motor, and a <b>tiller</b> for <b>steering,</b> but in a trolling application, will be connected to the steering mechanism at the helm.|$|R
50|$|The Hobbie Accessible was an American {{automobile}} {{manufactured in}} Hampton, Iowa from 1908 until 1909. One of many High wheeler cars produced at the time, it featured a twin-cylinder air-cooled engine, <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> and solid tires.|$|E
50|$|Some vehicle {{were driven}} by a driver riding or {{standing}} on-board with direct <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> others were pedestrian controlled by walking alongside.

50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{require that}} the pilot steer by using rudder pedals; others allow steering with the yoke or control stick. Some allow both. Still others have a separate control, called a <b>tiller,</b> used for <b>steering</b> on the ground exclusively.|$|R
5000|$|Small {{outboard}} motors, up to 15 horsepower or so {{are easily}} portable. They are {{affixed to the}} boat via clamps, and thus easily moved from boat to boat. These motors typically use a manual start system, with throttle and gearshift controls {{mounted on the body}} of the motor, and a <b>tiller</b> for <b>steering.</b> The smallest of these weigh as little as 12 kg, have integral fuel tanks, and provide sufficient power to move a small dinghy at around 8 knThis type of motor is typically used: ...|$|R
5000|$|The Science Museum has an {{engraving}} by Josiah Allen [...] {{which shows}} it {{as a large}} three-wheeled vehicle with passenger compartments front and rear similar to conventional stagecoach bodies, with seating on top, and the driver mounted high at the front operating a <b>tiller</b> for <b>steering.</b> The central part contained the mechanism. It would seem however {{that this was not}} the vehicle which was eventually built. Although some accounts suggest that it operated on a daily basis between London and Birmingham, Prosser [...] suggests that it never in fact completed a journey, and the company was wound up.|$|R
50|$|The Hudson was an {{automobile}} built in Hudson, Michigan by the Bean-Chamberlain Manufacturing Company from 1901-02. It had no {{relationship to the}} Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan. The Hudson was a light steamer, with a vertical two-cylinder engine, single chain drive, and <b>tiller</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{this system}} seems {{confusing}} and contradictory today, to generations of sailors trained on sailing vessels with <b>tiller</b> <b>steering</b> it seemed perfectly logical and was understood by all seafarers. Only when new generations of sailors trained on ships with wheel-and-tiller steering {{came into the}} industry was the system replaced.|$|E
50|$|The first {{production}} model evolved in 1898; {{it was a}} gasoline-fuel buggy-style automobile with a one-cylinder engine (horizontal under the floor), <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> wire wheels, planetary transmission, and chain drive. In the same year, F. B. Stearns & Company was organized with his partners, brothers Raymond M. and Ralph L. Owen.|$|E
50|$|A {{bowsprit}} is stayed by rigging. In {{the stern}} of the caïque the predominant form is the <b>tiller.</b> These wooden <b>steering</b> arms are sometimes carved {{in the face of a}} dog or animal. The caïque often has a horizontal windlass mounted over the bow. The bow is also known in Greek as the proura or plowri, similar to the English prow.|$|R
5000|$|Karl Benz {{patented}} the world's first stationary, static Internal combustion engine. His patent {{created a}} great demand for his vehicles, forcing Benz {{to move his}} operations in 1886 to a new factory on Waldhofstrasse in Mannheim (operating until 1908). Benz had appointed a Board of Management to help aid his growing company. These appointees suggested to Benz that he should create a less-expensive automobile suitable for mass-production. In response, Benz engineered a two-passenger automobile with a 3-horsepower engine, which he called the Victoria. This preceding model could reach {{a top speed of}} 11 mph, and utilized a pivotal front-axle operated by a roller-chained <b>tiller</b> for <b>steering.</b> 85 units of the Victoria were produced. Improving on these designs, Benz created his Benz Velo.|$|R
50|$|The first {{automobiles}} were steered with a <b>tiller,</b> but a <b>steering</b> wheel {{was first}} used in Europe in 1894 and became standard on French Panhard cars in 1898. In the USA Packard introduced a steering wheel on the second car they built, in 1899. By early in the next century, the steering wheel had nearly replaced the tiller in automobiles. However, some automobiles still used tillers into the teens, such as Rauch & Lang Carriage Co. of Cleveland, Ohio. It manufactured electric automobiles.|$|R
50|$|Puckridge {{took the}} three-wheeler apart {{and built a}} four-wheel vehicle, using the {{original}} 2.75 hp single cylinder De Dion engine. He added a two-speed belt-drive transmission, <b>tiller</b> <b>steering,</b> gas lighting, and fan cooling. An unusual feature was the starter system, which involved pulling a chain {{through a hole in}} the floorboards to rotate the engine.|$|E
50|$|Lottie Blossom II {{followed}} {{early the}} next year, using the same design of hull, but with aft cockpit and <b>tiller</b> <b>steering.</b> They had two very happy seasons in her, sailing her comfortably on their own, including two voyages to Cherbourg. The second voyage, in 1954, {{at the age of}} 70, was to be Ransome’s last long passage.|$|E
50|$|The winning 8 hp Panhard et Levassor of Mayade {{had been}} {{extensively}} upgraded for 1896, using their first four-cylinder engine, doubling the horsepower from the 1895 model. It {{was equipped with}} <b>tiller</b> <b>steering</b> and candle lamps. The brakes were a spoon-lever pressing on the solid rubber back tyre plus a belt that tightened onto a drum on the transmission.|$|E
5000|$|James' son Montague, born 1870, {{inherited}} {{the business in}} 1895, along with his father's engineering talents. Montague was a hobby racing cyclist, and at the Bath Road Club, he met [...] "ebullient Australian" [...] S. F. Edge (then a manager at Dunlop Rubber and colleague of H. J. Lawson in London, and amateur racer of motor tricycles.) Edge persuaded Napier to improve his Panhard ("Old Number 8", which had won the 1896 Paris-Marseille-Paris), converting from a <b>tiller</b> to a <b>steering</b> wheel and improving the oiling.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the sophistication}} of the control unit (e.g. <b>tiller</b> pilot, <b>steering</b> wheel {{attached}} Chartplotter, ...), electronic self-steering gear can be programmed to hold a certain compass course, to maintain a certain angle to the wind (so that sailing boats need not change their sail trim), to steer towards a certain position, or any other function which can reasonably be defined. However, the amount of power required by electrical actuators, especially if constantly in action because of sea and weather conditions, is a serious consideration. Long-distance cruisers, which have no external source of electricity and often do not run their engines for propulsion, typically have relatively strict power budgets and do not use electrical steering {{for any length of}} time. As the electronic autopilot systems require electricity to operate, many vessels also make use of PV solar panels or small wind turbines on the boat. This eliminates extra pollution and cuts costs.|$|R
50|$|The Duryea {{was used}} as the basis of the Davidson-Duryea car of 1898, which has the {{distinction}} of being the first American armored car. The car, which was photographed by the Chicago Tribune, was adapted from the commercial passenger model by installing a forward-firing M1895 Colt-Browning machine gun with armoured shield between the front wheel and <b>steering</b> <b>tiller,</b> operated by the front passenger, the conversion was devised by inventor Major (later Colonel) R.P. Davidson, of the Illinois National Guard, then commandant of the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy, Highland Park, Illinois.|$|R
