As such The American Legion states that it [...] "is leading a nationwide effort to combat the secular cleansing of our American heritage", stating that the phrase [...] "separation of church and state" [...] is nowhere mentioned in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution The American Legion released a document titled [...] "In the Footsteps of the Founders - A Guide to Defending American Values" [...] {{to be available to}} the citizens of the United States of America.

50|$|Kennedy's {{attempts}} {{to end the}} Freedom Rides early were tied to an upcoming summit with Nikita Khrushchev and Charles de Gaulle. He believed the continued international publicity of race riots would tarnish the president heading into international negotiations. <b>This</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> the Freedom Rides alienated many {{of the civil rights}} leaders who, at the time, perceived him as intolerant and narrow-minded. In an attempt to better understand and improve race relations, Kennedy held a private meeting in New York City in May 1963 with a black delegation coordinated by prominent author James Baldwin.|$|R
5|$|In December 1964, Baxter played brilliantly {{to set up}} a 2–0 win for Rangers in an away {{game against}} Rapid Vienna in the European Cup. With the game won, rather than play out time Baxter's {{confidence}} over-extended into arrogance to make fun of his opponents with the ball.

50|$|The park at Portorož, in the Slovenian Littoral region, {{sits atop}} the small {{peninsula}} of Seča. It has beautiful views over the Adriatic Sea. It {{was the first}} to be founded, in 1961, by the two Slovenian sculptors, although the park at Kostanjevica na Krki was inaugurated the same year.

5000|$|The first {{substantial}} critique {{was posted}} by PLOS cofounder Michael Eisen on his blog. [...] "To suggest - as Science (though not Bohannon) {{are trying to}} do - that the problem with scientific publishing is that open access enables internet scamming is like saying that the problem with the international finance system is that it enables Nigerian wire transfer scams. There are deep problems with science publishing. But the way <b>to</b> fix <b>this</b> is not <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> open-access publishing. It is to fix peer review." [...] Eisen pointed out the irony of a subscription-based journal like Science publishing this report when its own peer review has failed so badly before, as in the 2010 publication of the arsenic DNA paper.|$|R
5|$|Hitler {{intentionally}} played top {{party members}} off {{against one another}} and the NSDAP against the civil service. In this way, he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. He typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated them verbally or had them conveyed through Bormann. Falling out of favour with Bormann meant that access to Hitler was cut off. Bormann {{proved to be a}} master of intricate political infighting. Along with his ability to control access <b>to</b> Hitler, <b>this</b> enabled him <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> the power of Joseph Goebbels, Göring, Himmler, Alfred Rosenberg, Robert Ley, Hans Frank, Speer, and other high-ranking officials, many of whom became his enemies. This ruthless and continuous intriguing for power, influence, and Hitler's favour came to characterise {{the inner workings of the}} Third Reich.|$|R
40|$|Obesity {{refers to}} {{abnormal}} or excessive fat accumulation {{in the human}} body which results in health risk. Obesity leads to several risk factors for a number of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and osteoarthritis. Curcumin, the major polyphenol of turmeric spice, {{is a member of the}} ginger family (Zingiberaceae). Growth of adipose tissue is enhanced by the process of angiogenesis. Curcumin, by its antiangiogenic activity may suppress the growth of adipose tissue. <b>This</b> study attempts <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> the action of fat mass and obesity protein (FTO) by docking with Curcumin. Curcumin acts as an inhibitor and suppresses the action of obesity protein and hence may contribute to lower body fat and body weight gain. Some of the commonly used drugs to treat obesity includes Orlistat, Sibutramine and Rimonabant. These drugs were subjected to docking analysis for comparative studies...|$|R
50|$|Onyx Grand Prix began life as Onyx Race Engineering in late 1978 as a {{partnership}} between old colleagues Mike Earle and Greg Field. Prior to approaching Field and asking him {{to join him in}} a new venture, Earle had had extensive experience in open-wheel racing, running the successful Church Farm Racing team in F3, F2 and Formula 5000 as well as previously working with Field and driver David Purley in the LEC racing team in Formula Atlantic, F2, European Formula 5000 and occasional Formula One races. In their first foray into team ownership, the duo intended to enter their own chassis in Formula 2 for the 1979 season {{but it turned out to}} be a largely unsuccessful campaign. They returned in 1980 & 1981 running a semi-works March for Johnny Cecotto and Riccardo Paletti. After a competitive 1981 season, Paletti's sponsors took him to Formula One with Osella. Not wanting to be left behind, Onyx tried their hand at F1 by entering a private March in 5 rounds for Spaniard Emilio de Villota, with de Villota only failing to qualify once. Inspired by <b>this,</b> Onyx planned <b>to</b> enter their own car once again, but this time taking a step-up into the world of Formula One with a returning Paletti. But disaster struck as Paletti was killed at the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix and <b>this</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> Onyx's progression forward.|$|R

50|$|There {{were three}} types of grants in the Chenab Colony, namely peasant, yeoman and {{capitalist}} grants. Peasants had to remain as tenants {{of the government and}} could not acquire proprietary rights. <b>This</b> was designed <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> the powers of alienation of peasant grantees. Yeoman and capitalist grantees were allowed to acquire proprietary rights after a five-year qualification period. Upon acquiring the grants, the yeoman and capitalist grantees were required to pay a fee to the government in lieu of the size of their holdings. Peasant and yeoman grantees were required to be resident on the land. 78.3 per cent of the total land in the colony was allotted to peasant grantees. The Yeomen could belong only to the landholding agricultural classes, and they were to be drawn from small and middle level landlords. The capitalist grants were intended for men whom the government wished to reward for rendering political, administrative or military services. They were also intended for individuals with capital, who would invest in improved farming and thereby raise the standard of agriculture in the colony.|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we study}} {{the relationship between}} income inequality and economic freedom for a panel of 100 countries for the 1971 - 2010 period. From a panel causality study we find that income inequality has a negative causal effect on economic freedom, while causation does not run in the opposite direction. We argue that the negative effect of inequality on economic liberty {{is due to the}} elite 2 ̆ 019 s political power stemming from its disproportionate control over a country 2 ̆ 019 s economic resources. The elite uses <b>this</b> power <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> economic freedom <b>to</b> defend its economic interests by discouraging innovation, competition and protecting its rents. Running a series of dynamic panel estimations, we show that the negative effect of income inequality on economic freedom is robust to different sets of controls and estimation techniques. Finally, we show that the dynamics of the inequality-freedom nexus are to some extent conditional upon a country 2 ̆ 019 s political regime. When inequality is low, democracies enjoy comparatively higher levels of economic liberty, in line with the interests of a large middle-class. By contrast, economic freedom is lower in democracies (compared to strongly autocratic regimes with the same income distribution) when inequality is high. We argue that the latter finding corresponds to a system of political capitalism or captured democracy, where a powerful economic elite cooperates with politicians and bureaucrats for their mutual benefit...|$|R

40|$|There are now {{numerous}} reports (1 - 5) {{showing that}} mAbs {{can be effective}} as therapeutic agents {{in a variety of}} diseases. A major complication encountered in many of these studies has been the antiglobulin response that such xenogeneic Igs elicit (6 - 10). <b>This</b> acts both <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> the prospect of long-term therapy and to risk potentially harmful hypersensitivity reactions. Two strategies have been suggested that might be used to mitigate such unwanted responses. The first involves induction of tolerance to the xenogeneic mAb before commencing therapy. The second requires the use of either human mAbs or chimeric mAbs constructed by combining human constant gene segments with mouse or rat variable gene segments (1 !- 13). Natural tolerance to human determinants would be expected to reduce the immune response to such mAbs when used as therapeutic agents in clinical practice. Both strategies have a common problem. Simply put, it is whether tolerance can ever be attained to the unique variable region (i. e., idiotype) of a given therapeutic mAb, and if not, will tolerance to constant region epitopes be sufficient to prevent the response to the whol...|$|R
