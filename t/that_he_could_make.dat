5|$|After {{receiving}} his {{law degree}} from Cincinnati, Huggins realized <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> even more money playing baseball, and as such William Howard Taft, one of Huggins' law professors, advised him to play baseball. He {{was admitted to the}} bar, but never practiced law.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 193637 season, Miller was {{selected}} for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level. At the end of the 1936 school year, Miller completed year 10 by passing five of his eight subjects. Disinclined towards university studies, he left school without finishing his leaving year and began working as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt confident <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a career out of sport and therefore felt that further education was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Josephson {{travelled}} to California to meet {{two leading}} {{members of the}} group, laser physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, authors of Mind Reach (1977). Targ and Puthoff {{had set up a}} parapsychology ("psi") lab at SRI and had had papers published about their work – which included testing later-discredited claims by Uri Geller <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> objects move using psychokinesis – in Nature and other peer-reviewed journals. The San Francisco Chronicle covered Josephson's visit.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur {{expressed}} {{the hope that}} the Eighth Army could withdraw to Japan {{by the end of the}} year. When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe, MacArthur replied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> one available in January. In fact, Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea, and by November 180,000 had done so.|$|E
5|$|Merrick {{concluded}} that his only {{escape from the}} workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions. He knew of a Leicester music hall comedian and proprietor named Sam Torr. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, {{he would have to}} be a travelling exhibit. To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.|$|E
5|$|As Zwingli {{was working}} on {{establishing}} these political alliances, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a verdict {{on the issue of}} faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau produced the Tetrapolitan Confession. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the Burgrecht cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, Fidei ratio (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the Apostles' Creed. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, Johann Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E
25|$|Aiken {{started at}} an early age to believe in a life of service. In 1995, Clay started working at the YMCA. Still in high school, Clay learned quickly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a {{difference}} in the lives of young people.|$|E
25|$|As a teenager, {{his passion}} and desire for art grew, {{especially}} when he was paid $15 for three sketched cartoons he submitted to The Alabama Sunday Weekly. Convinced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a living as an artist, he took his first job as a painter in the commercial display industry.|$|E
60|$|And oddly enough, {{at about}} the same moment, Mr. Fyshe was calculating <b>that</b> {{provided}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> the Duke drink a second glass of the Mausoleum champagne, that glass would cost the Duke about five million dollars.|$|R

60|$|And so, {{for forty}} years afterward, we find Jacob {{illuminated}} with the sudden thought <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> restitution of this sum of money to the heirs or assigns of the unlucky miner, respite and Nepenthe might be his.|$|R
25|$|On 17 February 2007, Harrison {{was knocked}} out by Michael Sprott for the European Union title. This third {{professional}} loss left Harrison's future uncertain. Harrison claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a comeback, but Warren suggested that any return to the ring would be for a reduced purse, since the public would have no great interest.|$|E
25|$|Blacks {{were not}} given a chance at the title {{allegedly}} because Johnson felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> more money fighting white boxers. In August 1913, as Johnson neared {{the end of his}} troubled reign as world heavyweight champ, there were rumors that he had agreed to fight Langford in Paris for the title, but it came to nought. Johnson said that Langford was unable to raise $30,000 for his guarantee.|$|E
25|$|A {{workshop}} note {{records that}} the first specimen of hard, white and vitrified European porcelain was produced in 1708. At the time, the research was still being supervised by Tschirnhaus; however, he died in October of that year. It was left to Böttger to report to Augustus in March 1709 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> porcelain. For this reason, credit for the European discovery of porcelain is traditionally ascribed to him rather than Tschirnhaus.|$|E
50|$|Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford): Nate {{finds out}} that it was Tripp that messed with the car he was {{supposed}} to ride in and confronts him. After Tripp leaves, his grandfather tells him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never <b>make</b> it on his own.|$|R
25|$|William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton with Jon Pertwee in The Three Doctors. Originally Hartnell's role {{had been}} {{intended}} to be more extensive, but his health had deteriorated to the extent <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>make</b> a limited appearance which {{would be his last}} television role.|$|R
5000|$|Faisal Rehman portrays Zafar Mehmood, who is {{a police}} officer and looks after 8 {{orphaned}} children. Zafar couldn't marry his girl friend because she didn't want to have kids, whereas Zafar loved kids so much <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> happily <b>make</b> his home an orphanage for kids.|$|R
25|$|After his recuperation, Welsh {{moved back}} to Washington, D.C. While working as a {{bookkeeper}} at a local gas company, Welsh {{wrote a letter to}} the Wright brothers after seeing a flight demonstration in Virginia, but did not receive a job offer with the company. He traveled to Dayton, Ohio, convinced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a positive impression in person. The brothers gave him a job in the Wright Company's new flying exhibition division, even though he did not have the experience they were looking for.|$|E
25|$|Basquiat {{starred in}} Downtown 81, a vérité movie written by Glenn O'Brien and shot by Edo Bertoglio in 1981, but not {{released}} until 1998. In 1996, {{eight years after}} the artist's death, a biographical film titled Basquiat was released, directed by Julian Schnabel, with actor Jeffrey Wright playing Basquiat. David Bowie played the part of Andy Warhol. Schnabel was interviewed during the film's script development as a personal acquaintance of Basquiat. Schnabel then purchased {{the rights to the}} project, believing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a better film.|$|E
25|$|Kravitz {{made his}} feature film acting debut in Precious which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2009. During the Italian leg of his 53 date Let Love Rule (20)09 European tour, Kravitz had been {{instructed}} to cancel some shows due to a bad bout of bronchitis. Under strict orders from his doctor, the singer was told to rest so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> a quick recovery {{and return to the}} stage {{for the rest of his}} tour. Shows scheduled for Rome on June 5 and Brescia on June 6 were postponed to late July.|$|E

50|$|In June 2015, John entered Australian Goldfields Open, {{defeating}} {{world number}} 44 Alfie Burden {{in the first}} qualifying round 5-1. Although he was ultimately defeated by Peter Lines by the same score in the following round, this performance encouraged John <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>make</b> a full-time return to the game at a professional level.|$|R
5000|$|Roche was {{eventually}} found in London and imprisoned in Newgate. Tried for piracy, {{he was found}} guilty and hung in August 1723. The public was disappointed at the execution: Roche [...] "was so ill at the time <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> any public declaration of his abhorrence of the crime for which he suffered." ...|$|R
25|$|On July 2, 1812, he had {{produced}} about thirty pencils {{and sold them}} to a Benjamin Andrews, a hardware dealer on Union Street in downtown Boston. These were the first wooden-cased graphite lead pencils manufactured in the United States. Andrews was a previous customer of Munroe’s, to whom he had sold cabinetmaker’s squares. He ordered more immediately, which Munroe proceeded to grind out. Munroe showed up at Andrew’s hardware store with over four hundred pencils {{less than two weeks}} later. Andrews then wrote up a contract with Munroe to take for a price all the pencils <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> in a certain time frame.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of papers from 1881 to 1886, Langley {{reported}} measurements of the spectrum of heat radiation, using diffraction gratings and prisms, and the most sensitive detectors <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make.</b> He reported {{that there was a}} peak intensity that increased with temperature, that the shape of the spectrum was not symmetrical about the peak, that there was a strong fall-off of intensity when the wavelength was shorter than an approximate cut-off value for each temperature, that the approximate cut-off wavelength decreased with increasing temperature, and that the wavelength of the peak intensity decreased with temperature, so that the intensity increased strongly with temperature for short wavelengths that were longer than the approximate cut-off for the temperature.|$|E
25|$|After {{ordering}} his {{engineers to}} begin rebuilding the bridge, Jackson directed Col. Thomas T. Munford's 2nd Virginia Cavalry {{to cross the}} swamp and capture some of the Union guns abandoned during the bombardment. As the men and horses waded through water that was belly deep and fouled with debris, Jackson and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill crossed the river to perform a personal reconnaissance. A Union artillery shell exploded {{only a few feet}} away from the generals mounted on horseback, although neither was injured. Jackson saw that Union artillery and infantry was reinforcing the position, and that Federal sharpshooters would play havoc with his engineers on the bridge. He realized that this was not a place <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> an opposed crossing.|$|E
5000|$|Persuaded by {{his father}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> {{a living as a}} mathematician, he entered the University of Buenos Aires, where he studied {{engineering}}.

60|$|When he awoke, neither wood nor {{fire was}} to be seen, {{and he did not}} know where he was.
