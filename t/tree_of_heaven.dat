5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{descriptions of}} the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> were made shortly after it was introduced to Europe by the French Jesuit Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville. D'Incarville had sent seeds from Peking via Siberia to his botanist friend Bernard de Jussieu in the 1740s. The seeds sent by d'Incarville {{were thought to be}} from the economically important and similar looking Chinese varnish tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum), which he had observed in the lower Yangtze region, rather than the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven.</b> D'Incarville attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in France and sent others on to Philip Miller, the superintendent at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in Busbridge, England.|$|E
5|$|In North America, A. altissima {{is present}} from Massachusetts in the east, west to {{southern}} Ontario, southwest to Iowa, south to Texas, and {{east to the}} north of Florida. On the west coast it is found from New Mexico west to California and north to Washington. In the east of its range it grows most extensively in disturbed areas of cities, where it was long ago present as a planted street tree. It also grows along roads and railways. For example, a 2003 study in North Carolina found the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> was present on 1.7% of all highway and railroad edges in the state and had been expanding its range at the rate of 4.76% counties per year. Similarly, another study conducted in southwestern Virginia determined that the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> is thriving along approximately 30% of the state's interstate highway system length or mileage. It sometimes enters undisturbed areas as well and competes with native plants. In western North America it is most common in mountainous areas around old dwellings and abandoned mining operations.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} Europe the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> was {{not considered}} naturalised in cities until after the Second World War. This {{has been attributed to}} the tree's ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow. In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas (it is thought that the tree requires a mean annual temperature of 8 degrees Celsius to grow well, which limits its spread to more northern and higher altitude areas). For example, one study in Germany found the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> growing in 92% of densely populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether. In other areas of Europe {{this is not the case}} as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in Hungary, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that country's Aggtelek National Park.|$|E

5|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> is a {{very rapidly}} growing tree, {{possibly}} the fastest growing tree in North America. Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) per {{year for the first}} four years is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. Studies found that Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.|$|E
5|$|In China, the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> has a {{long and}} rich history. It was {{mentioned}} in the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to baldness. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the ailanthus silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production. Ailanthus has {{become a part of}} western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and subject matter of the best-selling American novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith.|$|E

5|$|The tree prefers {{moist and}} loamy soils, but is {{adaptable}} {{to a very}} wide range of soil conditions and pH values. It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of flooding. It also does not tolerate deep shade. In China it is often found in limestone-rich areas. The <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> is found within {{a wide range of}} climatic conditions. In its native range it is found at high altitudes in Taiwan as well as lower ones in mainland China. In the U.S. it is found in arid regions bordering the Great Plains, very wet regions in the southern Appalachians, cold areas of the lower Rocky Mountains and throughout much of the California Central Valley. Prolonged cold and snow cover cause dieback, though the trees re-sprout from the roots.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> is {{a popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions. It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odor was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results. Michael Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive {{as it is in}} America. In the United Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It is also rare in Ireland. In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens. The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.|$|E
25|$|As with coppicing, only {{species with}} {{vigorous}} epicormic growth {{may be made}} into pollards. In these species (which include many broadleaved trees but few conifers), removal of the main apical stems releases the growth of many dormant buds under the bark on {{the lower part of}} the tree. Trees without this growth will, of course, die without their leaves and branches. Some smaller tree species do not readily form pollards, because cutting the main stem stimulates growth from the base, effectively forming a coppice stool instead. Examples of trees that do well as pollards include broadleaves such as beeches (Fagus), oaks (Quercus), maples (Acer), black locust or false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), hornbeams (Carpinus), lindens and limes (Tilia), planes (Platanus), horse chestnuts (Aesculus), mulberries (Morus), redbud (Cercis canadensis), <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> (Ailanthus altissima), willows (Salix), and a few conifers, such as yews (Taxus).|$|E

500|$|Ailanthus altissima , {{commonly}} known as <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven,</b> ailanthus, or in Standard Chinese as chouchun (...) , is a deciduous tree in the Simaroubaceae family.

The tree grows rapidly and is capable of reaching heights of [...] in 25years. However, the species is also short lived and rarely lives more than 50years, though its remarkable suckering ability makes it possible for this tree to clone itself indefinitely and live considerably longer [...] (since they are linked to the mother tree and thus partly fed by it, the suckers are less vulnerable than the seedlings and can grow faster).|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the tree of heaven's various uses, {{it has also been}} a part of Chinese culture for many centuries and has more recently attained a similar status in the west. Within the oldest extant Chinese dictionary, the Erya, written in the 3rd century BC, the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> is mentioned second among a list of trees. It was mentioned again in a materia medica compiled during the Tang dynasty in 656 AD.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} subject <b>of</b> <b>Heaven</b> or Paradise in the De Fide Orthodoxa of St. John of Damascus (c. 675 - c. 749), a Greek Father and theologian {{who gave the}} Church a {{definitive}} heritage of the Greek Fathers' teaching. After a preliminary consideration of the meanings of "Heaven" and Paradise as a state or a place, {{a substantial part of}} this thesis is then given to a detailed treatment of the Greek Fathers' teaching on the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> the knowledge of good and evil and the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> life in Paradise. The questions of the indispensability <b>of</b> the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> life to the final bliss of the saints, and the doubtful place <b>of</b> the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> knowledge also receive attention. The meaning <b>of</b> the <b>trees</b> for St. John of Damascus is expounded in order to show his use of the ideas of Greek Fathers prior to him, for example, Gregory Naziazenus and Maximus the Confessor. After this, the questions of entry into Paradise and the Greek teaching of the intermediate state of the departed are raised. The descent of Christ to Hades precedes discussion of whether St. John of Damascus taught a doctrine of Purgatory or not. The practice of prayer for the departed is examined with respect to its effect on the intermediate state of the faithful departed. Lastly, this thesis explores the necessity of the resurrection for the final bliss of the faithful, and establishes the relevance of this teaching for modern thought on the preservation of integral personality. In conclusion, the writer suggests that St. John of Damascus bequeathed to the Church rich insights into the Greek Fathers' doctrine <b>of</b> <b>Heaven...</b>|$|R

500|$|The dried bark, however, {{is still}} an {{officinal}} drug and is listed in the modern Chinese materia medica as chun bai pi (...) , meaning [...] "white bark of spring". Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion, which is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally cut into strips. The bark {{is said to have}} cooling and astringent properties and is primarily used to treat dysentery, intestinal hemorrhage, menorrhagia and spermatorrhea. It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10grams, so as not to poison the patients. Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical use as it contains a long list of active chemicals that include quassin and saponin, while ailanthone, the allelopathic chemical in the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven,</b> is a known antimalarial agent. It is available in most shops dealing in Chinese traditional medicine. A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in treating cardiac palpitation, asthma and epilepsy.|$|E

The mulberry was looked on as a shade, not a fruit tree, and the other two most important shade trees, in number, were the acacia blanca, or false acacia, and the paradise tree or pride of China. Besides these there was a row of eight or ten ailanthus trees, or <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven</b> as it is sometimes called, with tall white smooth trunk crowned with a cluster of palm-like foliage.
