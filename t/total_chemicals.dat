40|$|The Mudgeeraba {{drinking}} water treatment plant, in South-East Queensland, Australia, can withdraw raw water {{from two different}} reservoirs: the smaller Little Nerang dam by gravity, and the larger Advancetown Lake, {{through the use of}} pumps. Selecting the optimal intake is based on water quality and operators’ experience; however, there is potential to optimise this process. In this study, a comprehensive hybrid (data-driven, chemical, and mathematical) intake optimisation model was developed, which firstly predicts the chemicals dosages, and then the <b>total</b> (<b>chemicals</b> and pumping) costs based on the water quality at different depths of the two reservoirs, thus identifying the cheapest option. A second data-driven, probabilistic model then forecasts the volume of the smaller Little Nerang dam six weeks ahead in order to minimise the depletion and spill risks. This is important in case the first model identifies this reservoir as the optimal intake solution, but this could lead in the long term to depletion and full reliance on the electricity-dependent Advancetown Lake. Both models were validated and proved to be accurate, and with the potential for substantial monetary savings for the water utility.

In this study the crude extracts from specimens of P. brasiliensecollected in two distinct places, Enseada do Forno and Praia Rasa, Búzios, Estado do Rio de Janeiro, were evaluated as defense against the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus and the crab Acanthonyx scutiformis. These specimens produce a similar amount of crude extract and also halogenated monoterpene compound-types, but individuals of P. brasiliense from Praia Rasa exhibit a major compound representing about 59 % of the <b>total</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Natural concentrations of the crude extracts obtained from both specimens of P. brasiliense significantly inhibited the herbivory by the sea urchin L. variegatus, but had no {{significant effect on the}} feeding by A. scutiformis, a crab commonly associated to chemically defended host.

These two studied population live under different environmental conditions, but they are only about 30 Km apart. However, it is impossible to affirm that environmental characteristics (abiotic or biotic) would be responsible for the difference of defensive potential found in the two populations of P. brasiliense studied here.

In the present study, the leaching potential of four NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and diclofenac sodium) in three U. S. cropland soils was evaluated, {{and the effect}} of CaCl 2 solution (as an index of salinity), dissolved organic matter (DOM), and polyacrylamide (PAM) amendment was investigated. The soils were spiked with selected NSAIDs, incubated for 24 h followed by 7 -d storage in glass flasks, and then packed into stainless steel columns and leached with deionized water (DIW), 10 mM CaCl 2, DOM (DOC 34 mg/L), and PAM solution (1. 0 mg/L) by gravity. Initial concentrations of ibuprofen, naproxen; ketoprofen, and diclofenac sodium in the three packed soils were 1. 93 to 2. 07. 1. 74 to 2. 27, 1. 79 to 2. 16, and 1. 99 to 2. 13 mg/kg, respectively. Maximum concentrations of the above NSAIDs in column effluents were 1. 23, 0. 92, 0. 69, and 1. 12 mg/L. respectively, when the soil was leached with 10 pore volumes of water, which occupied 17. 4, 11. 1, 9. 6, and 15. 2 % of the <b>total</b> <b>chemicals</b> in each soil column. Dissolved organic matter or PAM solution did not facilitate the NSAIDs release from soils. The CaCl 2 solution, however, reduced the amounts of NSAIDs leached from all three soils. Leaching of NSAIDs differed among the three tested soils. The results suggest that the leaching of NSAIDs through soil to water is significant, and the mobility of NSAIDs in soil is related to their chemicals' characteristics (such as pK(a) values) and soil properties (such as soil organic matter and clay content). Amending soil with DOM or PAM does not significantly affect the leaching behavior of NSAIDs in soil, whereas increasing the salinity of the irrigation water may decrease the extent of contamination of groundwater posed by NSAIDs.

40|$|Abstract Bleaching is an {{essential}} process in chemical pulp production for better pulp brightness and longer life expectancy. However, it causes costs such as chemicals, energy, equipment, and loss of yield. Non-linear reactions and several process variables, with interactions, make large plants complicated to model and optimize. As an expensive process bleaching has been a natural target of optimization, {{but there is still}} the need to either improve these methods or consider the optimization problem from a new point of view. The aim of this thesis was to develop production optimization methods for pulp bleaching, so that they are practical, usable on-line, easy to tune, and transferable. According to our assumption, neural networks could provide a practical optimization method by combining analytical knowledge with real data. In this kind of problem, the load sharing concept, recognizing interactions in chemical usage and the serial multi-stage nature of the process can simplify the task. The related work in bleaching optimization was studied as well as multi-stage serial process solving in principle, related optimization methods and especially neural networks in optimization. The data were collected during normal mill operation and modeled using neural networks. Optimization was performed based on visualizing the neural network models. The results showed that backpropagation neural networks are capable of modeling parts of the bleach plant and also the entire bleaching operation {{to such an extent that}} they are useful in the optimization. The modeling and the tuning can be performed without a profound knowledge of the system, but the process is slower and less reliable. Moving a trained neural network to another mill is inadvisable. It is more reasonable just to transfer the knowledge of variables and network structure. The important factor in on-line production optimization is the stabilization of the disturbances and a well-controlled operation towards a more economical state. Generally, more than half of the <b>total</b> <b>chemicals</b> should be used in the first bleaching stage D 0 and the remaining load should be divided so that the dosage at the D 1 is about 30 % higher than in the D 2 stage...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that the urban sludge {{resulted}} from clearing of the waste waters has a complex and variouscomposition due to several factors. The utilization of sludge as fertilizer in agriculture has to prevent thepollution of environment which is primarily caused by some pathogens infestation or by the increasedcontent in chemicals beyond the maximum limits admitted by the legislation. To determine the effects ofsuch sludge on the chemical compounds in soil and plant some investigations were carried out at the RIFGPitesti in 2006. The experiment involved Idared apple grown in large pots (0. 785 m 3). The followingexperimental scheme was organized: A factor = depth of planting substrate for applying the organic matteron it, with two graduations: a 1 = 0 - 30 cm; a 2 = 0 - 60 cm; B factor = type and amount of organic matterapplied (g/l substrate), with the following graduations: b 1 = 0; b 2 = manure 340 g/l; b 3 = sludge 170 g/l; b 4 =sludge 340 g/l; b 5 = sludge 510 g/l; b 6 = sludge 680 g/l; C factor = soil sampling depth with two graduations:c 1 = 0 - 30 cm; c 2 = 30 – 60 cm. The soil samples were collected from pots in about 5 months after treeplanting to determine the contents of organic matter and of major macro and microelements. The same macroand microelements {{as well as some}} heavy metals were found in the water samples drained at the pot bottom. From the leaves collected from the middle of annual shoots, the macro and microelements were alsodetermined. The chemical compounds, except the total soluble salts from the soil samples showed nosignificant differences. In the case of a 2 = (0 - 60 cm - planting substrate), the total soluble salts weresignificantly higher by 126 % vs. a 1 = (0 - 30 cm - planting substrate. The manure application (340 g/l) did notshow a significant increase in total salts versus the unfertilized control, but the sludge rates (b 4 -b 6) led to asignificant raise by 172 - 238 % vs. unfertilized control (b 1). In case of waters drained at the pots bottom andalso of leaves, the chemical compounds did not significantly vary. Of the <b>total</b> <b>chemicals</b> from the wastewaters (Fe, Ca, N, B, Zn, Cd, Cr) only the Zn content of 4 samples had higher values than those stipulated inNTPA 001 regulation.

A total of 20 carcasses were selected from three packing plants across the United States, and round and loin subprimals from these carcasses were collected and transported to Texas A&M University. These subprimals were fabricated 14 to 21 d postmortem, dissected either raw or cooked, and divided to determine the amount of separable lean, separable fat, and refuse amounts per cut. Separable lean from these cuts was homogenized and proximate analyses were conducted in order to determine percent <b>total</b> <b>chemical</b> fat, protein, moisture, and ash. Cooking yields and fat retention values were determined for the cuts that were grilled and roasted. Cuts with external fat had higher cooking yields than cuts with external fat removed. Cuts with external fat had higher fat retention values than the cuts with no external fat. Dissection data indicated that cuts trimmed to lower levels of external fat had the highest values for percent lean and the lowest values for percent seam and external fat and bone-in cuts had the lowest values for percent lean and the highest values for percent refuse. Proximate analyses indicated a decrease in percent moisture as the percentage of <b>total</b> <b>chemical</b> fat increased.

Two large peptides covering the two halves of the protein sequence were synthesized and structurally characterized by means of circular dichroism, and their immunogenicity was proved by means of immunoblot, using antibodies against Pru p 3, and immunoCAP inhibition tests.
