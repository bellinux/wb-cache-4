5|$|Cec Linder as Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA liaison in the United States. Linder was {{the only}} actor {{actually}} on location in Miami. Linder's interpretation of Leiter {{was that of a}} somewhat older man <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the character was played by Jack Lord in Dr. No; in reality, Linder was a year younger than Lord. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the Felix Leiter role in Goldfinger that led the producers to recast the role. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Austin Willis who played cards with Goldfinger.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} first {{published}} on June1, 2003 in the US as a hardcover. Since then, Fire and Ice has been released in paperback and e-book format in other languages. The main theme {{of the book is}} that the type of person one is inside is more important <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> one seems from the outside. The book received mixed reviews: the negative reviews criticized the flat characters, and how troublesome it was to flip back to the characters list due to the large number of cats; positive reviews praised the suspense and rising tensions in the book.|$|E
25|$|Bund also {{states that}} nothing {{that had taken}} place in the war {{produced}} more controversy <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which Rupert treated Birmingham, and that it was certainly harsh, but by the laws of war as understood on the Continent, in the school in which Rupert had been brought up, there was nothing illegal or improper in it. If the owners of a house allowed firing from that house on the soldiers of the other side, the soldiers fired on were justified in destroying that house. Burning has always been one of the recognised means of destruction. Bund says that if Birmingham had been a Continental town nothing would ever have been heard of it; but because the Continental laws of war were applied to an English town the outcry was terrible.|$|E

500|$|In April 2016, {{during the}} week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its {{ambassador}} for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had {{played a part in}} {{the amount of time that}} it had taken to write and record the album. [...] "The way we do things now is very different <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning.

[...] "We knew we were making this movie for a contemporary audience and we wanted Rapunzel to be a real role model in a way. We wanted all this girl power and to really drive this story, so she doesn't wait around for anything ... she's a smart girl, she has these hopes and dreams and she's going to get what she wants out of life."

500|$|The album {{impacted}} hip hop stylistically {{and laid}} the groundwork for a new wave of hip hop artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including B.o.B, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, and Drake. Jake Paine of HipHopDX dubbed the album as [...] "our Chronic", noting West's effect on hip hop with 808s & Heartbreak as [...] "a sound, no different <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Dr. Dre's synthesizer challenged the boom-bap of the early '90s." [...] Fact described the record as an [...] "art-pop masterpiece [...] broke the shackles of generations of one-upmanship [...]" [...] Rolling Stone journalist Matthew Trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article, [...] "Now that popular music has finally caught up to it, 808s & Heartbreak has revealed itself to be Kanye’s most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{possibility}} {{to eradicate the}} HSV-1 variant is being pursued by a team at Duke University. By {{figuring out how to}} switch all copies of the virus in the host from latency to their active stage at the same time, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the virus copies normally stagger their activity stage, leaving some dormant somewhere at all times, [...] conventional antiviral drugs might kill the entire virus population, since they can no longer hide in the nerve cells. One class of drugs called antagomir could serve this purpose. These are chemically engineered oligonucleotides or short segments of RNA that can be made to mirror their target genetic material, namely herpes microRNAs. They could be engineered to attach and thus 'silence' the microRNA, thus rendering the virus incapable of remaining latent in its host. Professor Cullen believes a drug could be developed to block the microRNA {{whose job it is to}} suppress HSV-1 into latency.|$|E
500|$|During the 1978 NFL season, Volk {{appeared}} in all 16 {{games for the}} Dolphins, 13 {{of them as a}} starter. [...] Volk started the season strong, intercepting a pass in the season opener against the New York Jets. [...] In the second game of the season, the Dolphins played the Colts in Baltimore.

[...] After the game, Volk told reporters, [...] "I wanted to have a good game in Baltimore, and I couldn't have asked for anything better <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it turned out." [...] While Volk began the 1978 season as a starter, he was replaced by Charlie Babb for the final four games. [...] After the Dolphins lost the AFC wildcard game to the Oilers, Volk announced his retirement. Volk told reporters he had wanted to end his career with a championship team and added, [...] "When the game's over, you can't worry about it. [...] For most of the guys, there'll be another season.

500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] <b>than</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> I See It and [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, heavy on the Sly Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), {{to say nothing of}} the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, sort of like the Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E
500|$|Reception for {{the song}} was mostly positive. Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times said that the song {{was the one that}} [...] "showed her {{impressive}} range to best advantage." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer said that she had a [...] "strong voice" [...] in the song. However, another Philadelphia Inquirer review said that the song was [...] "a not terribly good version of Jules Shear's terribly good [...]" [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post believed that it was her most reflective song. Kevin East of Sensible Sound said that the song was [...] "a heavy, melancholy tune." [...] Leslie Gray Streeter of the Palm Beach Post said that the song was [...] "lovely" [...] and [...] "delicate." [...] Even Shear himself was a fan of Lauper's version, saying [...] "The Cyndi Lauper thing where she did 'All Through the Night,' that was great because she did it so differently <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I did. I liked that, too." [...] However, the St. Petersburg Times did not like the song, saying that it was a [...] "pedestrian filler number" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|In Interstellar, Nolan {{explored}} {{the laws of}} physics as represented in Einstein's theory of general relativity, identifying time as the film's antagonist. Reality is often an abstract and fragile concept in Nolan's work. Alec Price and M. Dawson of Left Field Cinema noted that the existential crisis of conflicted male figures [...] "struggling with the slippery nature of identity" [...] is a prevalent theme in Nolan's work. The actual (or objective) world is of less importance <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which we absorb and remember, and it is this created (or subjective) reality that truly matters. [...] "It is solely in the mind and the heart where any sense of permanency or equilibrium can ever be found." [...] According to film theorist Todd McGowan, these [...] "created realities" [...] also reveal the ethical and political importance of creating fictions and falsehoods. Nolan's films typically deceive spectators about the events that occur and the motivations of the characters, but they do not abandon the idea of truth altogether. Instead, [...] "They show us how truth must emerge out of the lie if it is not to lead us entirely astray." [...] McGowan further argues that Nolan is the first filmmaker to devote himself entirely to the illusion of the medium, calling him a Hegelian filmmaker. He has also noted that retroactive causality populates many of Nolan's films.|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson {{wrote that}} [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] {{sounds like a}} [...] "Tumblr-meme version" [...] of the singer's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". He added that the release [...] "may not be the nadir of Madonna's career so far, but I can think of few moments that feel as much a {{betrayal}} of her legacy <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she deadpans 'It's so erotic' right before chirping 'This feeling can't be beat'." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt the production credits for MDNA had fueled [...] "over-inflated expectations" [...] for the single. Copsey found it was not [...] "forward-thinking" [...] like Madonna's past records and cited the lyrics [...] "Girls they just wanna have some fun/ Get fired up like a smoking gun" [...] {{as an example of}} this, although he concluded his review writing [...] "we defy anyone who isn't singing this back to themselves immediately after." [...] The New York Observer journalist Daniel D'Addario compared it to [...] "Music", but added that [...] "Madonna was twelve years younger at that time and thus perhaps a more convincing 'bad girl', so too was our culture... maybe it's time for her to try something totally different?" [...] In another article for The Guardian, Gareth Grundy proclaimed [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] to be a [...] "clumsy rave-pop", while Amanda Dobbins from New York panned it as a [...] "paint-by-numbers, 808- and Tanqueray-referencing dance track that falls even flatter when compared to its source material". Malone from NME found no innovation in the track, writing, [...] "combined with earlier single 'Give Me All Your Luvin' it points to an uneasy mix for album MDNA." [...] Margaret Wappler from Los Angeles Times felt that Madonna would have been better re-releasing [...] "Music" [...] again as a single, instead of [...] "Girl Gone Wild". She added that [...] "There's something very attractive about a song this militaristic and precise, but in Madge's too-capable hands it's also suffocatingly professional." ...|$|E

2500|$|In human social affairs, {{discrimination}} is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction {{in favor of}} or against, a person based on the group, class, or category to which the person is perceived to belong rather than on individual attributes. This includes treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, [...] "in {{a way that is}} worse <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> people are usually treated". It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on logical or irrational decision making.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2007 {{article in}} Reason magazine, Hirsi Ali said that Islam, the religion, must be {{defeated}} and that [...] "we {{are at war}} with Islam. And there's no middle ground in wars."

Max Rodenbeck, writing in The New York Review of Books, notes that Ali's view of Islam has shifted and [...] "mellowed," [...] as she no longer completely rejects Islam. She now narrowly criticizes what she calls [...] "Medina Muslims", meaning the fundamentalists who envision a regime based on sharia, and who ignore the more inclusive passages of Muhammad's Meccan period, a small minority of Muslims, who are, nevertheless, quite influential among young Muslims, according to Hirsi Ali: [...] "These men, I find them to be far more influential in inspiring and mobilising young men to see the religion of Islam the way they see it, <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> either Imam Faisal says he sees it, or Maajid Nawaz says he sees it." [...] Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, [...] "The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and hurt people, they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries is that the people who feel they should be governed under the Sharia Law, are not a fringe. (..) Islam can become a religion of peace, if politics is divorced from religion", and she stated that: [...] "The individual that wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam, is inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam, the example of the prophet Mohammed, the clergy that preached to him, and the reward that he will get in the hereafter." ...|$|E
