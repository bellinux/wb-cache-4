40|$|Speakers often overspecify their <b>target</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{and include}} more {{information}} than necessary for unique identification of the target referent. In the current paper, we study the production of definite <b>target</b> <b>descriptions,</b> and explore several factors that might influence {{the amount of information}} that is included in these descriptions. First, we present the results of a large-scale experiment investigating referential overspecification {{as a function of the}} properties of a target referent and the communicative setting. The results show that speakers (both in written and oral conditions) tend to provide more information when a target is plural rather than singular, and in domains where the speaker has more referential possibilities to describe the target. However, written and spoken referring expressions do not differ in terms of semantic redundancy. We conclude our paper by discussing the implications of our empirical findings for pragmatic theory and for language production models. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Analogical {{reasoning}} {{has been}} implicated in many important cognitive processes, such as learning, categorization, planning, and understanding natural language. Therefore, to obtain {{a full understanding of}} these processes, we must come {{to a better understanding of}} how people reason by analogy. Analogical reasoning is thought to occur in at least three stages: retrieval of a source description from memory upon presentation of a <b>target</b> <b>description,</b> mapping of the source description to the <b>target</b> <b>description,</b> and transfer of relationships from source description to <b>target</b> <b>description.</b> Here we examine the first stage, the retrieval of relevant sources from long-term memory for their use in analogical reasoning. Specifically we ask: what can people retrieve from long-term memory, and how do they do it? Psychological experiments show that subjects display two sorts of retrieval patterns when reasoning by analogy: a novice pattern and an expert pattern. Novice-like subjects are more likely to recall superficiallysimilar descriptions that are not helpful for reasoning by analogy. Conversely, expert-like subjects are more likely to recall structurally-related descriptions that are useful for further analogical reasoning. Previous computational models of the retrieval stage have only attempted to model novice-like retrieval. We introduce a computational model that can demonstrate both novice-like and expert-like retrieval with the same mechanism. The parameter of the model that is varied to produce these two types of retrieval is the averag...|$|E

We present verbal protocols and interviews on their strategies, reconceptualize mapping as problem-solving activity, and sketch a tentative model of mobile map interaction.

40|$|When {{referring}} to a target object in a visual scene, speakers are assumed to consider certain distractor objects that are visible to be more relevant than others. However, previous research that has tested this assumption has mainly applied offline measures of visual attention, such as the occurrence of overspecification in speakers’ <b>target</b> <b>descriptions.</b> Therefore, in the current study, we take both online (eyetracking) and offline (overspecification) measures of attention, to study how perceptual grouping affects scene perception, and reference production. We manipulated three grouping principles: region of space, type similarity, and color similarity. For all three factors, we found effects, either on eye movements (region of space), overspecification (color similarity), or both (type similarity). The results for type similarity provide direct evidence for the close link between scene perception and reference production...|$|R

On {{the basis of a}} pretest, we de-rived a <b>target</b> <b>description</b> that was ambiguous on independence–dependence (i. e., the target, Chris, was rated as equally likely to be independent or dependent). Participants classified as independence-schematics, dependence-schematics, or aschematics read the description, predicted Chris ’ behavior, and indicated their impression of Chris. Consistent with the hypothesis, self-schemas had an assimila-tive effect on social perception: Relative to aschematics, independence-schematics rated Chris as more independent and more likely to behave independently, whereas dependence-schematics rated Chris as less independent and less likely to behave independently. By assimilating {{a substantial portion of the}} social world (the por-tion that is ambiguous), self-schemas serve a motivational function: They foster the stability, validation, and perpetuation of the self-system.
