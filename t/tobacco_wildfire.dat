50|$|Tabtoxin, {{also known}} as {{wildfire}} toxin, is a simple monobactam biotoxin produced by Pseudomonas syringae. It is the precursor to the antibiotic tabtoxinine β-lactam. Tabtoxin is a monocyclic β-lactam produced by P. syringae pv. tabaci, coronafaciens, and garcae. Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, the causal agent of the wildfire of tobacco, produces the phytotoxin tabtoxin. tabtoxin-producing bacterium, P. syringae BR2, causes a disease of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) similar to <b>tobacco</b> <b>wildfire.</b> This organism {{is closely related to}} P. syringae pv. tabaci but cannot be classified in the pathovar tabaci because it is not pathogenic on tobacco. Tabtoxin {{has been shown to be}} a dipeptide precursor that must undergo hydrolysis by a peptidase to yield the biologically active form, tabtoxinine-p-lactam (TβL). Tabtoxin is required by BR2(R) for both chlorosis and lesion formation on bean. All mutations that affected tabtoxin production, whether spon- taneous deletion or transposon induced, also affected lesion formation, and in all cases, restoration of tabtoxin production also restored pathogenic symptoms. Other factors may be required for BR2 to be pathogenic on bean, but apparently these are in addition to tabtoxin production.|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci (Pst) is a hemibiotrophic {{bacterial}} pathogen responsible for <b>tobacco</b> <b>wildfire</b> disease. Although considerable {{research has been}} conducted on the tobacco plant’s tolerance to Pst, the role of light in the responses of the photosystems to Pst infection is poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the reduced photosystem damage in tobacco leaves due to Pst infection under light conditions. Compared to dark conditions, Pst infection under light conditions resulted in less chlorophyll degradation and a smaller decline in photosynthetic function. Although the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) and the activity of the photosystem I (PSI) complex decreased as Pst infection progressed, damage to PSI and PSII after infection was reduced under light conditions compared to dark conditions. Pst was 17 -fold more abundant in tobacco leaves under dark compared to light conditions at 3 days post-inoculation (dpi). Additionally, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) accumulated to a high level in tobacco leaves after Pst infection under light conditions; although to a lesser extent, H 2 O 2 accumulation was also significant under dark conditions. Pretreatment with H 2 O 2 alleviated chlorotic lesions and decreased Pst abundance in tobacco leaves at 3 dpi under dark conditions. Methyl viologen (MV) pretreatment had the same effects under light conditions, whereas 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (DCMU) pretreatment aggravated chlorotic lesions and increased the Pst population. These results indicate that chlorotic symptoms {{and the size of the}} bacterial population are each negatively correlated with H 2 O 2 accumulation. In other words, light appears to suppress the Pst population in tobacco leaves through the accumulation of H 2 O 2 during infection...|$|E
40|$|The model {{pathogen}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 causes bacterial speck in {{tomato and}} Arabidopsis, but Nicotiana benthamiana, an important model plant, {{is considered to}} be a non-host. Strain DC 3000 injects approximately 28 effector proteins into plant cells via the type III secretion system (T 3 SS). These proteins were individually delivered into N. benthamiana leaf cells via T 3 SS-proficient Pseudomonas fluorescens, and eight, including HopQ 1 - 1, showed some capacity to cause cell death in this test. Four gene clusters encoding 13 effectors were deleted from DC 3000 : cluster II (hopH 1, hopC 1), IV (hopD 1, hopQ 1 - 1, hopR 1), IX (hopAA 1 - 2, hopV 1, hopAO 1, hopG 1), and native plasmid pDC 3000 A (hopAM 1 - 2, hopX 1, hopO 1 - 1, hopT 1 - 1). DC 3000 mutants deleted for cluster IV or just hopQ 1 - 1 acquired the ability to grow to high levels and produce bacterial speck lesions in N. benthamiana. HopQ 1 - 1 showed other hallmarks of an avirulence determinant in N. benthamiana: expression in the <b>tobacco</b> <b>wildfire</b> pathogen P. syringae pv. tabaci 11528 rendered this strain avirulent in N. benthamiana, and elicitation of the hypersensitive response in N. benthamiana by HopQ 1 - 1 was dependent on SGT 1. DC 3000 polymutants involving other effector gene clusters in a hopQ 1 - 1 -deficient background revealed that clusters II and IX contributed to the severity of lesion symptoms in N. benthamiana, as well as in Arabidopsis and tomato. The results support the hypothesis that the host ranges of P. syringae pathovars are limited by the complex interactions of effector repertoires with plant anti-effector surveillance systems, and they demonstrate that N. benthamiana can be a useful model host for DC 3000...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} laser photoacoustic detection (LPAD) as a highly sensitive method to detect in planta nitric oxide (. NO) production from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). LPAD calibration against. NO gas demonstrated a linear relationship over 2 orders of magnitude with a detection threshold of < 20 pmol h− 1 (1 part per billion volume [ppbv]). The specificity of the photoacoustic signal for. NO when adding gas or the. NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, on injection into plant leaves, was demonstrated by its abolition with O 3 (. NO + O 3 → NO 2 + O 2). The utility of the LPAD method was shown by examination of a nonhost hypersensitive response and a disease induced by Pseudomonas syringae (P. s.) pv phaseolicola and P. s. pv tabaci in tobacco.. NO was detected within 40 min of challenge with P. s. pv phaseolicola, some 5 h before the initiation of visible tissue collapse. The <b>wildfire</b> <b>tobacco</b> pathogen P. s. pv tabaci initiated. NO generation at 2 h postinfection. The use of. NO donors, the scavenger CPTIO ([4 -carboxyphenyl]- 4, 5 -dihydro- 4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramethyl- 3 -oxide), and the mammalian nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l-NMMA (NG-monomethyl-l-arginine) indicated that. NO influenced the kinetics of cell death and resistance to both avirulent and virulent bacteria in tobacco. These observations suggest that. NO is integral to the elicitation of cell death associated with these two bacterial pathogens in tobacco...|$|R
