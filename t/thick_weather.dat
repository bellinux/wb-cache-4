40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} challenges in the study of slope stability, foundation, and excavation in rocks is understanding the weathering states. This issue is more important in tropical climates, where severe <b>weathering</b> produces <b>thick</b> <b>weathering</b> profiles. <b>Thick</b> <b>weathering</b> profiles are normally classified or graded differently based on some field observations, geological studies, and material properties of rock. This paper considers the relationship between joint characterization and the state of weathering of granitic rock as an important factor to describe the mass weathering. A total of 24 panels of rock exposures was studied in two active granite quarries located in Johor, Malaysia. This region has a tropical climate condition. A typical profile was proposed for granitic rock, mainly based on joint characterization, topography, and geological condition. This profile includes a common weathering ranging from fresh rock to residual soil. Based on the presence of corestones, two additional subgrades were introduced in completely and highly weathered zones. It is believed that the proposed weathering profile may contribute to engineering design and classification of weathered granitic rock in tropical region...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSr {{isotopes}} {{have been}} measured in laterite sequences and in associated waters {{from the region}} of Ribeirao Preto (Parana basin, Brasil), in order to characterize the water-rock interactions corresponding to the successive stages of weathering of these continental flood basalts, We analyzed detailed sections of concentric rims of alteration in ball-shaped spheroids developed around cores of fresh basalts. Waters were also analyzed on {{the different types of}} facies in this region: unaltered basalts, <b>thick</b> <b>weathered</b> profiles of lateritic material, and surrounding sandstones, The results show that {{a major part of the}} initial Sr is removed from the basalt during the earliest stages of weathering, within the narrow grey rims surrounding the unweathered core. Radiogenic Sr is also leached from hydrothermal minerals located in basalt fractures or disseminated in the basalt groundmass at this early stage. Very high water/rock ratios (of at least 100, 000) are calculated for this process, from the Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 in the related waters. A general trend of increasing Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratios is observed in the increasingly weathered facies (inner yellow cortexes, red kaolinitic soils and matrices) and in their related waters. The very high Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratios of the red kaolinitic horizons probably result from isotopic exchange with radiogenic rainwaters or sandstone waters, and also from the presence of residual or neoformed radiogenic minerals. Budget calculations, as well as experimental leaching of kaolinite samples, suggest that significant amounts of radiogenic Sr can be leached from these facies during weathering, Thus, the kaolinitic facies of tropical laterite profiles are able first to trap strontium from surficial waters, then to provide radiogenic Sr to the waters that weather the fresh basalts at the weathering front. Therefore, the <b>thick</b> <b>weathered</b> horizons must be considered as a natural cation-exchange layer, that play an active role in the weathering process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{fine-grained}} and a medium-grained {{oolitic limestone}} of Miocene age were studied on ashlars of monuments in Budapest. The studied buildings {{are located in}} a polluted urban environment. The surface alteration {{is characterized by the}} presence of white (thin and thick) and black (laminar and framboidal) weathering crusts. Flaking, scaling and blistering are common crust detachment forms. Crust detachment is followed by rapid surface loss in the form of granular disintegration or of secondary crusts stabilizing the stone surface. Non-destructive in situ mechanical tests such as Schmidt hammer rebound and Duroscope clearly document the presence of thin and <b>thick</b> <b>weathering</b> crusts, and the degradation of underlying fine-and medium-grained limestone. Crust formation is associated with a textural change, since precipitation of pore-occluding calcite and gypsum and reduction of porosity in the crust zone has been recorded. Crust detachment is attributed to the crystallization pressure of air pollution-related gypsum, to freeze/thaw cycles, and to differences in mechanical properties of crust and host rock...|$|R
