5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>many</b> praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E

Many of these long-lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals, including sea turtles, and black-footed albatross.|$|E

25|$|The Cornell University Library is the 11th largest {{academic}} {{library in}} the United States, ranked by {{number of volumes}} held.

It was the first among all U.S. colleges and universities to allow undergraduates to borrow books from its libraries. In 2006, The Princeton Review ranked it as the 11th best college library, and it climbed to 6th best in 2009.

25|$|The {{anticipated}} success {{failed to}} materialise, partly because Richmond allowed the coaching position to again become unstable. With {{over a year}} still to run on his contract, John Northey demanded a contract extension that the club refused. This was because of a rumour that some people with an association with the club were pursuing Essendon coach and former Richmond premiership player Kevin Sheedy. So Northey walked out on Richmond and accepted a longer-term contract to coach the Brisbane Bears. Richmond, caught short, appointed the Bears' ex-coach Robert Walls for 1996. After several humiliating thrashings in 1997, Robert Walls became the first Richmond coach to be sacked mid-season. After two-and-a-half seasons under Jeff Gieschen, the club appointed ex-St Kilda captain Danny Frawley. After a Preliminary Final appearance in Frawley's second season, Richmond overestimated {{the strength of the}} list and settled for trading for established players rather than drafting youth. Over the next three seasons, the team managed just 18 wins. The administration continued to support Frawley and ensured that he would see out his contract, a far cry from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>many</b> of his predecessors were treated. However, midway through the 2004 season (a season in which Richmond only managed 4 wins, and lost their last 14 H matches), Frawley announced he would be relinquishing his role as Richmond coach at seasons' end.|$|E

25|$|Any kind {{of animal}} that often visits or {{encounters}} flowers {{is likely to}} be a pollen vector to some extent. For example, a crab spider that stops at one flower for a time and then moves on, might carry pollen incidentally, but most pollen vectors of significant interest are those that routinely visit the flowers for some functional activity. They might feed on pollen, or plant organs, or on plant secretions such as nectar, and carry out acts of pollination on <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>Many</b> plants bear flowers that favour certain types of pollinator over all others. This need not always be an effective strategy, because some flowers that are of such a shape that they favor pollinators that pass by their anthers and stigmata on the way to the nectar, may get robbed by ants that are small enough to bypass the normal channels, or by short-tongued bees that bite through the bases of deep corolla tubes to extract nectar at the end opposite to the anthers and stigma. Some flowers have specialized mechanisms to trap pollinators to increase effectiveness. Other flowers will attract pollinators by odor. For example, bee species such as Euglossa cordata are attracted to orchids this way, and it has been suggested that the bees will become intoxicated during these visits to the orchid flowers, which last up to 90 minutes. However, in general, plants that rely on pollen vectors tend to be adapted to their particular type of vector, for example day-pollinated species tend to be brightly coloured, but if they are pollinated largely by birds or specialist mammals, they tend to be larger and have larger nectar rewards than species that are strictly insect-pollinated. They also tend to spread their rewards over longer periods, having long flowering seasons; their specialist pollinators would be likely to starve if the pollination season were too short.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{have been}} parodied {{numerous}} times since their first publication. These were generally intended to ridicule the simplification of textual complexities and deliberate ambiguities in poetry. They also questioned <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>many</b> 19th-century critics sought to establish definitive readings. According to Jones, such parodies commented in a [...] "meta-critical" [...] manner and themselves present an alternative mode of criticism. Among the more notable {{is the one}} by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's son Hartley Coleridge (1796–1849), called [...] "On William Wordsworth" [...] or simply [...] "Imitation", as in the 1827 version published for The Inspector magazine ("He lived amidst th' untrodden ways / To Rydal Lake that lead; / A Bard whom there were none to praise / And very few to read" [...] lines 1–4). Parody also appears in the 1888 murder-mystery reading of the poem by Victorian author Samuel Butler (1835–1902). Butler believed Wordsworth's use of the phrase [...] "the difference to me!" [...] was overly terse, and remarked that the poet was [...] "most careful not to explain {{the nature of the}} difference which the death of Lucy will occasion him to be ... The superficial reader takes it that he is very sorry she was dead... but he has not said this." [...] Not every work referring to the [...] "Lucy poems" [...] is intended to mock, however; the novelist and essayist Mary Shelley (1797–1851) drew upon the poems to comment on and re-imagine the Romantic portrayal of femininity.|$|E
