5|$|It was {{too dark}} to see anything, so we carried our <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> baggage near the only house on the island, and began to cook our suppers, in order to be {{prepared}} for the earliest dawn, and to enjoy that which, from the conversation of the gentlemen we had, now raised the highest expectations of.|$|E
5|$|Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily {{offered his}} {{services}} at the roundabout {{on the evening of}} 16February, shortly after he had returned from Houston. According to Human rights watch, Alekry along with other staff were wearing special medical jackets showing the Red Crescent. During the raid, riot police attacked his <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> cut through it; despite telling them he was a physician, police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on his head {{and other parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Experience of Antarctic or Arctic waters {{was almost}} entirely lacking within the 50-strong party {{and there was}} very little special {{training}} in equipment or techniques before the ship set sail. Dogs were taken, as were skis, but the dogs succumbed to disease in the first season. Nevertheless, the dogs' performance impressed Scott, and, despite moral qualms, he implemented the principle of slaughtering dogs for dog-food to increase their range. During an early attempt at ice travel, a blizzard trapped expedition members in their <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> their decision to leave it resulted in the death of George Vince, who slipped over a precipice on 11 March 1902.|$|E

50|$|The camp {{consisted}} of two hospital tents (used as dining tent), ten wall <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> <b>tents</b> for servants <b>and</b> soldiers. Three wall <b>tents</b> were floored <b>and</b> the Alexei's was carpeted with oriental rugs. Box stoves and Sibley stoves were provided for the tents.|$|R

5|$|In {{recent years}} the site has been {{organised}} around a restricted backstage compound, with the Pyramid stage on the north, and Other stage on {{the south of the}} compound. Attractions on the east of the site include the acoustic tent, comedy <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> circus. To the south are the green fields, which include displays of traditional and environmentally friendly crafts. In King's Meadow, the hill at the far south of the site, is a modern small megalith circle which, like Stonehenge, is coordinated with the summer solstice, and since 1990 represents a stone circle.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Light Horse Brigade {{casualties}} were one other rank killed, one officer and nine other ranks wounded. These wounded soldiers were probably {{treated by the}} 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance {{which was in the}} field a couple of miles past Al-Faluja. The ambulance had itself suffered two casualties when subjected to artillery fire from the hills. But they halted and put up a <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> after dark took in eight more patients all hit by high-explosive shells from the 4th Light Horse Regiment. They were busy until midnight; two seriously wounded soldiers being evacuated to a Casualty Clearing Station and the rest were kept till morning.|$|E
5|$|Contemplating {{advocacy}} {{work and}} a run for city council in Newark after graduation from law school, Booker {{lived in the city}} during his final year at Yale. After graduation, he served as staff attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and program coordinator of the Newark Youth Project. In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Newark City Council, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in a <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and order, and the efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted by all of his fellow councilors.|$|E

Early next morning, city workers arrive to clear <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> other items and are called [...] "Nazis in city hall uniforms" [...] by activists. There were also violent demonstrations at the Tel Aviv city hall against the evacuation of the <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> over 30 activists were arrested.|$|R
50|$|Each king {{tried to}} outshine the other, with {{dazzling}} <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> clothes, huge feasts, music, jousting <b>and</b> games.

25|$|Tent cities: Ad hoc campsites of <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> improvised shelters {{consisting}} of tarpaulins and blankets often near industrial and institutionally zoned real estate such as rail yards, highways and high transportation veins. A few more elaborate tent cities, such as Dignity Village, are actually hybrids of <b>tent</b> cities <b>and</b> shantytowns. <b>Tent</b> cities frequently consist only of <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> fabric improvised structures, with no semi-permanent wood structures at all.|$|R
5|$|During the La Course by Le Tour de France {{the rain}} poured down {{and made the}} course and cobbles slippery. Van Dijk was {{involved}} {{by one of the}} many crashes. She broke het collarbone and had to abandon the race. At home she had installed a high-altitiude <b>tent,</b> <b>and</b> with a speedy recovery she went with Iris Slappendel to Switzerland to train at high altitude. Six weeks after her crash she could race again and started in the 2015 Boels Rental Ladies Tour on 1 September. She rode in the stage race stronger every day and finished second in the time trial, two seconds behind of Lisa Brennauer. She moved to the third place in the general classification and was able to keep this position.|$|E
5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a <b>tent,</b> <b>and</b> Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, {{and they decided to}} abandon it. The {{remaining}} supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.|$|E

5|$|The fort at Castleshaw, {{constructed}} from turf and timber, was built around 79 and guarded the York to Chester Roman road. Due to the site's protected {{status as a}} Scheduled Ancient Monument {{it has not been}} possible to excavate the fort, however previous trenches have demonstrated that the fort had two phases to its construction. The location of the fort's granary, stables, the principia (headquarters), the praetorium (commander's <b>tent),</b> <b>and</b> six long narrow buildings which are possibly workshops or storerooms are all known. The fort was small, would probably have been home to around 500 soldiers of an auxiliary cohort, and fell out of use during the mid AD90s. Rather than allow the defences to fall into potentially hostile hands or be used against Rome, the fort was slighted.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into the <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope {{around her neck and}} while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage to the realm of the dead.|$|E
5|$|When Grace (Debra Messing) and {{her boyfriend}} Leo (Harry Connick Jr.) take a walk around Central Park, they notice a <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> a van parked nearby, after a bride and groom ran past them. Eager {{to know what is}} happening, Grace stops by the van, sees Katie Couric, and asks her what is going on. Katie tells Grace that The Today Show is having massive {{televised}} weddings in the park for ratings sweeps week. When Katie asks Grace and Leo if they would like to get married, Leo says yes, but Grace believes he is being sarcastic, only later realizing that he is serious. Leo explains to Grace that because they originally met in a park, they should also get married in a park. Leo proposes and Grace accepts, despite that the two have only known each other for two months.|$|E

5|$|Carol quarrels with Lilac and storms off. Lilac sends Milla to {{find her}} and then goes to save Torque from Brevon's nearby base, but she is {{captured}} and tortured by Brevon. Meanwhile, Carol and Milla ally with Spade to storm the base, where they rescue Torque and Lilac. However, they are all separated in the ensuing conflict. Neera finds Lilac, arrests her, and brings her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister determines that she is innocent and reveals that Zao is challenging Shuigang for the Stone. Lilac rejoins her friends and convinces Shang Mu and Shang Tu to unite against Dail and Brevon's army. During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, Lilac and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone. The three kingdoms resolve to harness the Stone's power and share it equally, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} war. Torque says goodbye to Lilac, Carol, and Milla and returns to space.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E
5|$|The porters {{abandon the}} group in fear when mysterious tracks are found, while Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey go on and {{eventually}} reach the crash site. Tintin sets off with Snowy to trace Chang's steps, and finds a cave where Chang has carved his name on a rock. On leaving the cave, he encounters a snowstorm and glimpses {{what seems to be}} a human silhouette. Tharkey believes that Tintin saw the Yeti and convinces him to abandon his friend and return with him to Nepal, since the area is too large to search. Tintin spots a scarf on a cliff face, concludes Chang is nearby, and continues with only the Captain. While attempting to scale a cliff face, Haddock slips and hangs out of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him. He tells Tintin to cut the rope to save himself, but Tintin refuses. Haddock tries to cut it himself, but drops his knife, alerting Tharkey, who has returned in time to rescue them. They try to camp for the night but lose their <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> must trek onwards, unable to sleep lest they freeze, arriving within sight of the Buddhist monastery of Khor-Biyong before being caught in an avalanche.|$|E
