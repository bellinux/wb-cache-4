5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole.

However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E

5|$|Disney {{settled on}} the film's concept as work neared {{completion}} on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity.

The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound.|$|E

5|$|Lyrical poets {{often took}} their {{subjects}} from myth, but their treatment became gradually less narrative and more allusive. Greek lyric poets, including Pindar, Bacchylides and Simonides, and bucolic poets such as Theocritus and Bion, relate individual mythological incidents. Additionally, myth was central <b>to</b> <b>classical</b> Athenian drama. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides took {{most of their}} plots from myths {{of the age of}} heroes and the Trojan War. Many of the great tragic stories (e.g. Agamemnon and his children, Oedipus, Jason, Medea, etc.) took on their classic form in these tragedies. The comic playwright Aristophanes also used myths, in The Birds and The Frogs.|$|E
