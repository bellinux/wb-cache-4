5|$|Returning to {{differential}} equations, Hamming studied {{means of}} numerically integrating them. A popular approach {{at the time}} was Milne's Method, attributed to Arthur Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).|$|E
25|$|A {{workshop}} on {{the limitations of}} size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than {{the interior of a}} sphere of diameter 250 ± 50nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. They cite the example of RNA based life, with ribozymes (catalytic RNA) taking the place of the much larger ribosomes as enzymes for cell replication. The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> cells as small as a sphere 50nm in diameter. These RNA World cells are one of the suggestions made {{to bridge the gap between}} abiotic chemistry and modern cells.|$|E
25|$|Next (or in {{the opinion}} of some, first) in {{importance}} stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes, Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique, both published in the Journal of the École Polytechnique (1809); Sur la libration de la lune, in Connaissance des temps (1821), etc.; and , in Mémoires de l'Académie (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites. So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.|$|E

2500|$|Under {{category}} (a) in Ex parte Coughlan, {{in order}} to act lawfully the decision-maker must merely have treated the applicant's legitimate expectation as a relevant consideration. However, David Pievsky notes that when coupled with the court's refusal to determine the weight that {{should be given to}} the promise as a relevant consideration, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> that [...] "in practice a legitimate expectation could well have no effect". Should the decision-maker attach little weight to the promise, thereby ultimately choosing not to honour it, [...] "the decision can only be attacked on Wednesbury grounds. The legitimate expectation appears to have added very little." [...] Steele argues against this, stating that the [...] "very status of an expectation as 'legitimate' necessarily entails that it should be accorded a more than minimal weight".|$|E
2500|$|While {{continuing}} to choose her subjects from her immediate urban environment, Fish changed her approach roughly {{at the turn}} of the century. Closely observed objects such as sections of floor tile and asphalt siding gave way to abstractly rendered thresholds, stairs and stair landings, a light fixture, and floor plans of rooms in her home. Like her earlier work, these paintings, she said, were impressed on the surface of the canvas in a way that approximated the experience of seeing the same things over and over, day after day. She came to see transitions as the subject of her work, the sense of walking across a threshold, moving from room to room; or the sense of light moving through a room during the day and into it from a wall fixture at night. She understood such transitions to be both actual and metaphorical. The visual elements she put on her canvases were meant to convey physical objects but also her own motion through the spaces they represented and the light that came from fixtures in the rooms and through the windows. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> seen, as one reviewer said, [...] "as a thoughtful meditation on the nature of occupancy within a domestic environment, exactingly rendered in multiple paint layers." ...|$|E

2500|$|With The Oval {{and many}} other venues {{unusable}} during the war, Lord's Cricket Ground acquired a special status and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) took on great responsibility {{to set up a}} meaningful programme of matches each season and so, as Pelham Warner put it, [...] "(enable) cricket to provide a healthy and restful antidote to war strain". Warner {{played a major role in}} organising cricket during the war as, with other MCC staff joining the services, he took on the Secretary's duties under the title of [...] "Deputy Assistant Secretary". His first priority was to work with the Royal Air Force (RAF) who occupied most of the Lord's estate including the practice ground and all buildings. The playing area was unaffected and the pavilion and the stands were always available for cricket; Warner paid tribute to the RAF authorities for their considerable help in enabling him to organise matches. Numerous ad hoc clubs and teams were formed, mostly based on the services. Until 1945, the majority of matches were one-day only, owing to time constraints imposed by the needs of the services, with a single innings each, but they were not limited overs and so <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a draw.|$|E
