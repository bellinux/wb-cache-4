40|$|Abstract ‚Äî Emerging {{distributed}} wireless microsensor networks {{will enable}} the reliable and fault tolerant monitoring of the environment. Such microsensors are required to operate for years from a small energy source, while maintaining reliable communication link to the basestation. The design of energy-aware communication protocols can have a dramatic impact on the network lifetime for such applications. A detailed communication energy model, obtained from measurements, is introduced that incorporates the non-ideal behavior of the physical layer electronics. This includes the start-up energy cost of the RF <b>tranceiver,</b> which dominates energy dissipation for short packet sizes. Using this model, various communication layer protocols are explored for asymmetrical sensor networks such as machine monitoring. The paper also proposes {{the use of a}} variable bandwidth allocation scheme, that exploits spatial distribution of sensors. I...|$|E

It started out in 1997 as a homebrew device, but more recently, kits have been available from time to time. It connects to a TNC which is in turn connected to a radio.

SmartBeaconing was developed for the HamHUD by Tony Arnerich and Steve Bragg. Since it uses GPS data, it varies the beacon rate based on speed, and adds corner pegging. This reduces unnecessary traffic on the frequency. SmartBeaconing has been adopted by the TinyTrak and OpenTracker series of trackers, in a software update for the Kenwood TM-D710, and in the TH-D72 from its release.

40|$|In {{order to}} exploit the nonuniformly {{distributed}} channel capacity over the cell area, the intelligent 7. 3 -kB programmable videophone transceiver of Table I is proposed, which is capable of exploiting the higher channel capacity of uninterfered, high-channel-quality cell areas, while supporting more robust, but lower bit-rate operation in more interfered areas. The system employed an enhanced H. 263 -compatible video codec. Since most existing wireless systems exhibit a constant bit-rate, the video codec's bit-rate fluctuation was smoothed by a novel adaptive packetization algorithm, which is capable of supporting automatic repeat request (ARQ) -assisted operation in wireless distributive video transmissions, although in the proposed lowlatency interactive videophone transceiver, we refrained from using ARQ. Instead, corrupted packets are dropped by both the local and remote decoders {{in order to prevent}} error propagation.
