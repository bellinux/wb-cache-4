40|$|We analyse {{the effect}} due {{of the next}} FTA between Morocco and the EU on {{bilateral}} Moroccan imports. As our main contribution to the existing literature, we include in our gravity equation tariff data at the industry level. This allows to better estimate trade determinants and also makes possible to perform simulations of the <b>tariff</b> <b>dismantling</b> taking into account its different path for each industry and year. A complete <b>tariff</b> <b>dismantling</b> will double the average yearly trade growth observed in the years just before the transition period to the FTA begun. The average effect follows the tariff reduction schedule being greater {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the transition period. The effect is positive for all EU Member States but exports growth to Morocco is greater for Portugal, Greece, Slovakia, Lithuania and Spain and lower for Germany, Denmark, Finland, France and Sweden. By industries, the faster growth are predicted for Leather and leather products, Wood and wood products, Textiles and textile products, Rubber and plastic products and Pulp, paper an paper products and publishing and printing. Finally, we also find a positive effect of Moroccan immigration in the EU on bilateral trade. Liberalisation; EU; Morocco; Free Trade Area; Tariff; Immigration; gravity equation...|$|E
40|$|The Spanish {{automobile}} {{market of}} the nineties experienced a perfectly foreseeable <b>tariff</b> <b>dismantling</b> {{and a strong}} demand downturn, with the observed result of an apparently sharpened producer competition in products and perhaps in prices. This paper is aimed at testing {{whether or not there}} really was a change in pricing behavior, using a structural model of competition. To answer that question, we specify, estimate and test semiparametric pricing equations with panel data for 164 models belonging to the 31 firms which competed in the market. The specification includes several equilibriums as alternative estimating models, considering prominently tacit coalitions by which a group of firms sets prices, taking into account the cross effects on their demands. The statistical test selects as the best model given the data an unbroken coalition of domestic and European producers. Comparative results using tight demand side specifications show that an inadequate specification of the demand side may induce wrong inferences...|$|E
30|$|On this point, {{it is very}} {{interesting}} to check how just the APEC variable displays a positive and significant result in the liberalization of markets among developing countries. These effects are not found for previous RTAs such as Mercosur, Andean Pact (Andean), Asean or, later, GSTP. It could be considered that this result is unsurprising. Regional trade agreements for developing countries were aimed more at the creation of integrated markets for industrial products which would facilitate the success of import substitution industrialization policies than at the integration of their agri-food markets. The Latin American case is paradigmatic, since the pessimism which existed concerning the possibilities of exporting manufactures, led for example the Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL) to recommend regional integration as an alternative, thereby broadening the internal market {{for this type of}} products (Bulmer-Thomas 1998 : 345 – 357). In the European case, <b>tariff</b> <b>dismantling</b> was not only complete and relatively rapid for all product types, but instead the Common Agricultural Policy was in fact the first European policy, which greatly strengthened the integration of its market of agri-food products.|$|E

This paper assesses the delicate balance required, based {{on the case of}} agricultural trade protection in Europe and Japan, two countries where <b>tariff</b> <b>dismantling</b> in the agricultural sector is a particularly sensitive issue. Since agricultural border protection is heterogeneous, we avoid aggregation bias by extending a multi-country computable general equilibrium model to the product level. This allows us to combine the assets from general equilibrium and partial equilibrium modeling, and to take explicit account of interdependencies and trade policies. The results suggest that consideration of sensitive products strongly limits the potential gains from a possible agriculture agreement at Doha. Moreover, there is no aggregate trade-off between decreasing tariffs and increasing/opening quotas. To achieve “substantial” market access improvements in the agricultural sector, the objective should be most favored nation tariff reduction.

40|$|A recent {{briefing}} by the European Research Office {{reviews the}} outcome of the Phase 1 negotiations in the six priority areas identified by the ACP: market-access issues; agriculture and fisheries issues; development issues; trade in services; trade-related areas; legal issues. It considers the areas discussed, the areas of convergence and the areas of divergence. It then reviews the overall outcome of Phase 1 and the Commission's proposals for the conduct of Phase 2 negotiations. On market-access issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: the need for a non-punitive alternative for non-LDC ACP members, so that no ACP state is worse off 'whether or not ACP countries participate in EPAs'; the need for a five-year moratorium on the commencement of <b>tariff</b> <b>dismantling</b> by ACP countries; the linking of the implementation of tariff dismantlement to the attainment of certain development indicators by ACP countries; revision of the rules of origin. On agriculture and fisheries issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: on the need for effective programmes of support for processing, marketing, distribution and transport prior to the implementation of EPAs; the need for a standstill on EU SPS measures for five to ten years and the establishment of a detailed dialogue on how genuine EU health concerns can be addressed; the need to comprehensively address CAP distortions linked to the new systems of farm support that the EU is creating; addressing the impact of CAP reform on the value of existing preferences; the need for an ACP-EU framework for fisheries agreements. On development issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: the need for additional resources to support necessary economic restructuring; the need to improve the deployment and effectiveness of EU aid instruments. the sequencing of regional integration and market opening towards the EU; issues in EU assistance to fiscal and economic restructuring. On trade in services it identifies the following areas of divergence: the need for additional funds to support service-sector development in ACP countries; the opening up of the free movement of persons within any agreement on trade in services; the scope of trade in services negotiations. On trade-related areas it identifies the following areas of divergence: the scope of negotiations on trade-related areas; the centrality of capacity building in ACP countries around these issues prior to the launch of any negotiations. On legal issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: {{the outcome of}} Phase 1; the need for additional resources; the need for a modification of WTO rules on free-trade areas; dispute settlement; the need for a non-execution clause in a trade agreement.

40|$|We {{estimate}} a {{model of}} importers in Hungarian micro data and conduct counterfactual policy analysis to investigate the effect of imports on productivity. We find that importing all foreign varieties would increase firm productivity by 12 percent, almost two-fifths of {{which is due to}} imperfect substitution between foreign and domestic goods. The effectiveness of import use is higher for foreign firms and increases when a firm becomes foreign-owned. Our estimates imply that during 1993 - 2002 one-third of the productivity growth in Hungary was due to imported inputs.

40|$|Mestrado em Economia Internacional e Estudos EuropeusNos últimos anos, tem vindo a ser reforçado o relacionamento institucional entre a União Europeia e a Argélia, sobretudo com base no Acordo Euro-Mediterrânico de Associação celebrado entre aqueles dois actores que, entre outros objectivos, visa a constituição de uma Área de Comércio Livre até 2017. Este estudo pretende verificar, com recurso aos dados relativos ao comércio e investimento estrangeiro bilaterais se, e de que forma, aquele reforço das relações União Europeia/Argélia no plano institucional se traduziu num fortalecimento do relacionamento económico e {{comercial}} nos primeiro quinquénio de vigência do dito Acordo, i. e. entre 2005 e 2010, tendo presente que a Argélia solicitou em 2010 a revisão do calendário de desmantelamento tarifário visando a criação da dita Área de Comércio Livre. Os resultados apurados revelam, no período em apreço, um menor aumento do volume comercial do que em quinquénios precedentes, devido a um conjunto de factores, e evidenciam uma redução substancial do superávite no saldo comercial a favor da Argélia, devido a um maior crescimento do valor das importações argelinas da União Europeia do que das exportações. Tal parece dever-se mais a factores internos argelinos, como um aumento da procura interna, por um lado, e à existência de fragilidades estruturais da economia, como a elevada dependência das exportações do sector dos hidrocarbonetos, por outro, do que constituir um resultado directo do mencionado desmantelamento tarifário. No que respeita ao Investimento Directo Estrangeiro, verificou-se entre 2005 - 2010 um crescimento significativo da entrada de fluxos europeus na Argélia. In {{the last}} years, the institutional {{relationship between the}} European Union and Algeria has been strengthened, particularly based on the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement signed between those two interlocutors which, among other objectives, aims at the creation until 2017 of a Free Trade Area. This study intends to verify, using data on bilateral trade and foreign investment, if and in what extent, that reinforcement of European Union/Algeria institutional relations resulted in a strengthening {{of the economic and}} trade relations in {{the first five years of}} enforcement of the said agreement, that is between 2005 and 2010, especially having present that Algeria has requested in 2010 the review of the calendar of <b>tariff</b> <b>dismantling</b> envisaging the creation of the above mentioned Free Trade Area. The results obtained reveal, within the period under review, a smaller increase of trade volume comparing to precedent homologue periods and show a substantial reduction in Algerian surplus in the trade balance, due to a higher growth in the value of Algerian imports from the European Union than that of the exports. This appears to be due more to Algerian internal factors, such as an increase in domestic demand, on the one hand, and the existence of structural weaknesses in the economy, like the high dependency of exports from the hydrocarbon sector, on the other, than being a direct result of the referred tariff elimination. As regards Foreign Direct Investment, there has been between 2005 - 2010 significant growth in inward flows to Algeria from European Union...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The textiles, clothing, and {{footwear}} (TCF) {{industry has}} struggled in Australia {{since the government}} commenced <b>dismantling</b> <b>tariffs.</b> By sourcing from Asia, middlemen undercut established suppliers, and retail chains set benchmark low prices with their imported “house” labels. The policy-makers predicted that local producers would become more efficient, and export {{to make up for}} lost sales, but the media paints a picture of rising imports, retrenchments, and factory closures. The research objective was to discover what strategies the survivors (actually) employ in adapting to the pressures of globalisation. Design/methodology/approach – More than 30 companies were involved in the study, ranging from small family businesses to subsidiaries of big multinationals. Each case study was based on an interview with a senior executive, normally followed by a plant tour. This methodology suits a fresh topic, as it avoids preconceptions and imposes no bounds. Findings – Results show that the policy change was based on “pie in the sky” forecasts. Increasingly, TCF production is transferred to cheap offshore locations, generally via subcontracting plus the “badging” of foreign designs. To survive, local factories should focus on quality and customer service, preferably in niche markets (like uniforms), or for specific customer groups, and develop technologically advanced products. A move down the supply chain into retailing can also assist. Large multinational corporations that engage in foreign direct investment dominate the management literature. Originality/value – This paper presents a different perspective, neglected in international operations management, whereby domestically oriented businesses attempt to defend themselves against the adverse consequences of globalisation. <br /...|$|R
50|$|Hayden {{increased}} the Labor vote at the 1980 election, but {{was replaced by}} Bob Hawke in 1983, who led Labor back to office at the 1983 election. Hawke was defeated as Labor leader in a 1991 spill against Paul Keating who had been Treasurer of Australia since 1983. Hawke is Labor's longest-serving Prime Minister and Australia's third-longest-serving Prime Minister. Hawke and Keating led Labor to victory at five consecutive federal elections: 1983, 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993. The Hawke and Keating Labor governments radically transformed the Australian economy, departing from a historical bipartisan Keynesian approach to the Australian economy, with the change of the Australian dollar from a government-fixed exchange rate to a floating exchange rate. Extensive deregulation of financial and banking systems occurred, both of which made Australia significantly more integrated with the global economy. Privatisation of state sector industries occurred, including Qantas and Commonwealth Bank. The <b>tariff</b> system was <b>dismantled,</b> and the subsidisation of some loss-making industries ended. Low-income centralised wage fixing was introduced through the Prices and Incomes Accord, and enterprise bargaining was introduced. The tax system was changed, including the introduction of fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax. Superannuation in Australia was implemented with a 9% employer contribution. Tertiary education fees in Australia saw a HECS payment system introduced {{as a replacement for}} fee-free tertiary education which had been removed after Whitlam. Medicare was introduced as a replacement for Medibank which had also been removed after Whitlam. Dental insurance through the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was introduced, but was removed after Labor lost government. Funding for schools was considerably increased, financial assistance was provided for students to enable them to stay at school longer, native title in Australia was recognised, and progress was made in directing assistance to the most disadvantaged recipients over a whole range of welfare benefits. The Parliament of Australia itself was reformed in several ways. The duration of the 13-year Labor government saw thousands of Acts passed by the Australian Parliament, though Labor did not have a Senate majority.|$|R
40|$|Background: Using {{the partial}} {{equilibrium}} WITS-SMART Simulation model {{to assess the}} impact of liberalisation under the Trade Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) of a free trade area between the European Union and South Africa. The identification of the impact of such agreement allows for trade policy negotiation adjustment that can be beneficial for South Africa. Aim: The aim of the study is to estimate and discuss the impact of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union and South Africa. More specifically, the study intends to estimate the impact of revenue, welfare, imports, exports, trade creation and to come up with policies options for South Africa that can be used in negotiations and policy formulations. Setting: The study used international trade data (2012) available in the WITS-SMART model to assess bilateral trade agreement between the European Union and South Africa. Methods: To identify the impact on revenue, welfare, imports, exports and trade creation, the study simulated an FTA (0 % tariff rate) for all goods exchanged between the European Union and South Africa. Also, the elasticity of substitution used for the simulation model was 99 %. Results: The findings of the study reveal that total trade effects in South Africa are likely to surge by US$ 1. 036 billion with a total welfare valued at US$ 134 million. <b>Dismantling</b> <b>tariffs</b> on all European Union (EU) goods would be beneficial to consumers through net trade creation.
