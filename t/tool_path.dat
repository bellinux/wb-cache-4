40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an integrated method to determine optimal cutting parameters for milling pocket based on minimum cutting time. The main constraints entailed in real cutting, such as chatter free, uncut free <b>tool</b> <b>paths,</b> cutter and machine tool limitations, are included into the optimal model. The optimal parameters (depth of cut, width of cut, spindle speed) are {{inserted into the}} <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> generation directly for four kinds of conventional cutting modes (Zig and Zig-Zag parallel cutting mode, inwards and outwards spiral pattern modes). According {{to the fact that}} the first cut in every cut level is slotting milling, the milling areas are divided into slotting milling area and general milling area. This dynamically corrected <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> generation method changes the order of conventional <b>tool</b> <b>paths,</b> so different cutting parameters are used in slotting milling and general milling areas.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} developing algorithms that generate <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> for free-form surfaces based on accuracy of desired manufactured part. A manufacturing part {{is represented by}} mathematical curves and surfaces. Using the mathematical representation of the manufacturing part, we generate reliable and near optimal <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> as well as cutter location (CL) data file for postprocessing. This algorithm includes two components. First is the forward-step function which determines maximum distance called forward- step between two cutter contact (CC) points with given tolerance. This function is independent of the surface type and is applicable to all continuous parametric surfaces that are twice differentiable. The second component is the side-step function which determines maximum distance called side-step between two adjacent <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> with a given scallop height. This algorithm reduces manufacturing and computing {{time as well as}} the CC points while keeping the given tolerance and scallop height in the <b>tool</b> <b>paths.</b> Several parts, for which the CC points are generated using the proposed algorithm, are machined using a three axes milling machine. As part of the validation process, the <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> generated during machining are analyzed to compare the machined part and the desired part...|$|R

The industries which most often manufactures free-form surfaces are basically aerospace, automotive, die mold industries, bio medical and power sector for turbine blades manufacturing.

Finally, flaws at a smaller geometric scale are removed, using a curve shortening algorithm. Experimental results are given to illustrate our algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Micromachining {{applications}} {{have received}} increased emphasis {{in recent years}} {{with the advent of}} new precision manufacturing applications which have stringent requirements for surface and edge finish. One of the main concerns in mi- cromachining is burr formation which can incur high production costs due to time-consuming deburring operations. Although deburring operations are commonly carried out in macroscale milling, in micro machining they can be difficult to use. De- burring processes can destroy delicate microfeatures and are usually unfeasible at the micro scale. For this reason, the utiliza- tion of burr minimizing machining <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> is desirable. Optimum <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> minimize burr formation while satisfying sur- face quality requirements, dimensional tolerances, and cycle time constraints. A new concept for micro end milling <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> is developed. An integrated performance index using the Taguchi method is introduced to optimize the main microscale end milling process outputs: surface quality, edge accuracy, burr formation, and time constraints. In addition, the concept is ap- plied to macroscale milling and its scalability down to the micromilling scale is studied...|$|R

40|$|A {{system of}} {{algorithms}} is presented for material removal simulation, automatic dimensional verification and integrated error correction of numerically controlled (NC) milling <b>tool</b> <b>paths.</b> Several {{different approaches to}} these problems have been proposed including direct solid modeling, discrete vector intersection, and spatial partitioning. However, each of these methods suffer inherent restrictions that limit their practical application. This dissertation presents a discrete dexel NC verification algorithm based on a spatial partitioning technique (dexel representation) which incorporates {{the advantages of the}} discrete vector intersection approach. Hence, real-time animated five-axis milling simulation is supported by efficient regularized Boolean set operations, and dimensional milling errors are verified simultaneously with the simulation process. Based on intermediate dimensional verification results, a reduction of intersection volume algorithm is developed to eliminate detected gouges on the part surface. In addition, a technique for detection and elimination of unexpected collisions between the tool assembly and the workpiece is developed. These combined algorithms automatically correct <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> to avoid gouges and collisions resulting in <b>tool</b> <b>paths</b> that are ready for immediate industrial application. A major disadvantage of dexel-based spatial partitioning, as originally proposed, is view dependency, i. e., dexels are constructed along a specific viewing vector so reconstruction of dexels is required for each new viewing direction. To overcome this problem, a contour display method is developed to transform dexel-based objects into a set of parallel planar contours thus enabling dynamic viewing transformations. In summary, this dissertation describes a unique hybrid approach to NC milling verification which provides for efficient, accurate and automatic assessment and correction of five-axis milling <b>tool</b> <b>paths...</b>|$|R
