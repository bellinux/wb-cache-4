5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose top {{is dead and}} mostly above the water line, but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive. Average <b>tide</b> <b>level</b> limits their height. By analyzing the various growth morphologies, microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change. Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using Radiocarbon dating. Such methods can help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E
5|$|Once the Act of Parliament was obtained, Edwards {{became the}} {{engineer}} for the project, and drew up the detailed plans, which Grundy and Smeaton checked and altered slightly, {{after which they}} had no further involvement with the scheme. Construction was started in April 1763, and the drainage element of the project, which included the sluice, was finished in 1768, having cost £42,000. Work on three locks and other work connected with navigation cost £6,000 and continued until 1771. The locks were located at Stamp End, Kirkstead and Barlings. The Grand Sluice was a major construction which maintained the height of water above Boston to near normal high <b>tide</b> <b>level</b> and had massive flood gates to cope with any tides above this. It was completed in 1766 and was effective in scouring the Haven below it and increasing silting of the river above it.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{scientific}} {{surveys in}} situ, {{taken into account}} present <b>tide</b> <b>levels</b> and estimated <b>tide</b> <b>levels</b> in 1333, confirm that Nitta's army could have entered Kamakura through Inamuragasaki exploiting a low tide. Since Nitta had {{spent a long time}} in Kamakura as a vassal of the Hōjō, he could have been familiar enough with its tides to be conceivably {{able to take advantage of}} them.|$|R
25|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems, providing complex and varied marine habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms.Fringing reefs just below low <b>tide</b> <b>level</b> have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high <b>tide</b> <b>level</b> and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and sea grass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This level of variety in the environment benefits many coral reef animals, which, for example, may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the {{littoral}} zone covers the region between {{low and high}} tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It {{is also known as}} the intertidal zone because it is the area where <b>tide</b> <b>level</b> affects the conditions of the region.|$|E
25|$|In Quảng Ninh, {{there are}} {{numerous}} rivers and springs, but most are short and small, and feature currents that differ between seasons. In winter, most rivers run dry; in summer, waterfalls pick up fast currents. The water current reaches 1.45 m3/s in dry season, but up to 1,500 m3/s in the rainy season. Quảng Ninh's sea borders upon the Gulf of Bắc Bộ. It is large and protected by the ranks of islands, so the wind is quieter and the water smoother. The gulf's current runs from north to south. It is Vietnam's coldest sea, with the temperature sometimes dipping below 13°C. The average <b>tide</b> <b>level</b> recorded is 2.5 m.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the task of}} pointing ships into the channel, the lighthouse also signaled ships {{about the state of the}} tide. During the day this was performed using two day signals installed on two corners of the structure, while during the night two 6th order dioptric lights showing different colors coded the state of the tide. The different colours were changed manually, by lowering glass cylinders over the lanterns, which could be done from inside the structure. Records of the tide were also kept automatically by floats in tubes which graphed the <b>tide</b> <b>level.</b> The graphs were replaced every month and were sent to Greenwich where they were kept.|$|E
25|$|The M4 {{relief road}} {{skirting}} {{the southern edge}} of the urban area of Newport is proposed as a means of reducing the congestion on the existing M4 motorway (presently squeezed through the Brynglas Tunnels) and making Newport and the surrounding areas more accessible. There have also been calls for a barrage across the River Usk to be incorporated with the M4 bypass, so that the level of the river would stay permanently at high <b>tide</b> <b>level,</b> although possible plans for a Severn barrage across the River Severn would reduce the need for a River Usk barrage. The relief road scheme was cancelled in July 2009 but relaunched in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The town {{formerly}} had excellent beaches, {{which were}} supplied by longshore drift constantly moving sand {{along the coast}} from west to east. However, in the early 20th century a large breakwater was constructed at Newhaven Harbour and the harbour entrance was regularly dredged. These works cut off the supply of fresh sand to the beach. By the 1980s the beach at Seaford had all but vanished, the shoreline becoming steep, narrow and largely composed of small boulders. This made Seaford attractive to watersports enthusiasts (since water visibility was good {{and there was a}} rapid drop-off into deep water) but it discouraged more general seaside visitors. So in 1987 a massive beach replenishment operation was carried out, in which around 1 million tonnes of material was dredged from sandbanks out to sea and deposited on the shore. During a severe storm in October of the same year a substantial amount of the deposited material on {{the upper part of the}} beach was washed out past low <b>tide</b> <b>level,</b> leading to questions in the House of Commons. The beach has been topped up several times since then, giving the town a broad beach of sand and shingle.|$|E

500|$|Water is {{essential}} to a thermal power station, to create the steam to turn the steam turbines and generate electricity. Water used in the power station at Blyth was extracted from the Blyth Harbour tidal basin at the ash dock. Once used in the station, the hot water had to be cooled {{before it could be}} discharged. Condensers were used to convert steam from the turbines back into water. The stations' condensers were of twin two-pass design and had a total cooling surface of [...] Condensed water was then extracted by two duty pumps. The water then passed through a drains cooler. The cooled waste water was discharged into the sea off Cambois beach below low <b>tide</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
500|$|The River Rother flows for [...] {{through the}} English {{counties}} of East Sussex and Kent. Its source is near Rotherfield in East Sussex, and its mouth is on Rye Bay, {{part of the}} English Channel. Prior to 1287, its mouth was further to the east at New Romney, but it changed its course after a great storm blocked its exit to the sea. It {{was known as the}} Limen until the sixteenth century. For the final , the river bed is below the high <b>tide</b> <b>level,</b> and Scots Float sluice is used to control levels.

500|$|In 1960, {{there was}} {{extensive}} flooding of the Rother Valley, with some [...] inundated, {{and in some}} areas the water did not recede for several months. In 1962 the Kent River Board introduced a bill to Parliament, which would authorise improvements to the river banks, {{with the construction of}} a sluice and associated lock below Rye, to prevent tidal flooding. At the time, the river was used by a fishing fleet of at least ten trawlers, and a freighter of 250 tons used the river for a trade in timber. There was some concern in the House of Lords that the lock would not be large enough to accommodate the freighter, although {{it would be possible to}} open both sets of lock gates when the <b>tide</b> <b>level</b> was suitable. The bill did not become an Act of Parliament, due to lack of parliamentary time, and so the sluice was not constructed. However, the Rother Area Drainage Improvement Scheme began in 1966, and was completed in 1980. This involved raising the level of the floodbanks along much of the river. Those in the Wet Level, an area of [...] between the junction with the Maytham Sewer and Blackwall Bridge, were not raised as much, so that during periods of high flow when the river is tide-locked, the levels can be used for flood storage. The scheme included the installation of 20 pumping stations, which raise water from the low-lying marshes into the embanked river using Archimedes' screw pumps. Some of the drainage ditches in the marshland had to be reconfigured to deliver the water to the pumping stations.|$|E
