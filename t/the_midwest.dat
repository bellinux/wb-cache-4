5|$|During the {{conflict}} over the Toledo Strip, the Erie Canal was built, linking New York City and the Eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes at Buffalo.

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in <b>the</b> <b>Midwest</b> United States.

This starved the Great Plains and other areas of <b>the</b> <b>Midwest</b> of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
