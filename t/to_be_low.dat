5|$|The more neutron-rich {{darmstadtium}} isotopes are {{the most}} stable and are thus more promising for chemical studies; however, they can only be produced indirectly from the alpha decay of heavier elements, and indirect synthesis methods are not favourable for chemical studies.

5|$|In August 2012, oxygen {{levels in}} the river were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>low,</b> {{following}} the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem. This was thought to result from naturally occurring algae, which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend, and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide, which is used to improve oxygen {{levels in the}} water, and traces of detergent. The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous. The Winsford and District Angling Association, who use the river for fishing, believe it will take many years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident.|$|E

5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>low</b> enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Age of Trucking Museum is a defunct {{trucking}} {{museum in}} Middlebury, Connecticut, United States. Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, it was non-profit {{organization dedicated to}} trucking that focused on trucks of the 1950s. The museum was dedicated on September 23, 2002 and housed in a 32,000 square foot building. It featured a collection of historic and antique vehicles including the first registered car in Connecticut, a 1928 Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company dump truck. Among the trucks in the museum were Mack Trucks, GMC and Autocar Company trucks, including a 1963 Mack B61 motivated Guerrera to found the museum. The Golden Age of Trucking Museum also featured a collection of toy trucks, hats, state license plates and images relating to trucking. Throughout its entire operation, the museum ran a deficit and it closed after a 2009 fund raising campaign failed. The museum's final day of operation was on July 20, 2010. The {{economic impact of the}} museums closure was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>low,</b> but according to Steven Frischling of the Boston Globe. the Golden Age of Trucking Museum made its mark on the auto world.|$|E
5|$|The {{solubility}} {{is highest}} in polar solvents (such as water) or ionic liquids, but tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>low</b> in nonpolar solvents (such as petrol/gasoline). This is principally because the resulting ion–dipole interactions are significantly stronger than ion-induced dipole interactions, so {{the heat of}} solution is higher. When the oppositely charged ions in the solid ionic lattice are surrounded by the opposite pole of a polar molecule, the solid ions are {{pulled out of the}} lattice and into the liquid. If the solvation energy exceeds the lattice energy, the negative net enthalpy change of solution provides a thermodynamic drive to remove ions from their positions in the crystal and dissolve in the liquid. In addition, the entropy change of solution is usually positive for most solid solutes like ionic compounds, which means that their solubility increases when the temperature increases. There are some unusual ionic compounds such as cerium(III) sulfate, where this entropy change is negative, due to extra order induced in the water upon solution, and the solubility decreases with temperature.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Blanca {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on June19. Traveling westward, the wave existed {{in a region}} of strong wind shear, preventing convective activity from developing. By June29, the wave had crossed Central America and moved into the eastern Pacific basin. Several days later, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring {{the system as a}} disorganized area of shower and thunderstorm activity off the southwest coast of Mexico. Early the next day, a trough of low pressure developed within the system; wind shear {{in the path of the}} storm were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>low</b> enough to allow tropical cyclone development. On July4, curved banding-features developed along the periphery of the wave, indicating that an area of low pressure had developed. Gradual organization took place over the follow days. Early on July6, the low had become sufficiently organized to attain tropical depression strength roughly 435miles (700kilometres) south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, the system was not operationally declared a depression; instead, the first advisory by the NHC was issued several hours later and immediately declared the cyclone as Tropical Storm Blanca.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region One, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand, and deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region Two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in Region Two than Region One. Region Three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to Region Two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, and tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>low</b> in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region Four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E
