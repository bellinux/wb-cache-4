50|$|Positional {{adjustments}} {{are attained}} by careful poising (ensuring even weight distribution) of the balance-hairspring {{system as well}} as careful control of the shape and polish on the balance pivots. All of this achieves an equalization {{of the effect of}} gravity on the watch in various positions. Positional adjustments are achieved through careful adjustment of each of these factors, provided by repeated trials on a timing machine. Thus, adjusting a watch to position requires many hours of labor, increasing the cost of the watch. Medium grade watches were commonly adjusted <b>to</b> 3 positions (<b>dial</b> <b>up,</b> <b>dial</b> down, pendant <b>up)</b> while high grade watches were commonly adjusted <b>to</b> 5 positions (<b>dial</b> <b>up,</b> <b>dial</b> down, stem <b>up,</b> stem left, stem right) or even all 6 positions. Railroad watches were required, after 1908, to be adjusted to 5 positions. 3 positions were the general requirement before that time.|$|R
50|$|HSCSD is also {{an option}} in Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) systems where packet data {{transmission}} rates are much higher. In the UMTS system, the advantages of HSCSD over packet data are even lower since the UMTS radio interface has been specifically designed to support high bandwidth, low latency packet connections.

50|$|Broadband Internet {{is readily}} {{available}} in most cities and towns, and now are expanding to many smaller villages and in the countryside. As the statistics have shown, the majority of Internet users in Thailand still rely on dial-up access. TOT operates a nationwide local rate number, 1222, allowing dialing to most Internet service providers. Dial-up prepaid Internet packs can be readily bought in convenience stores and other places. Subscribers of fixed telephone lines by True Corporation have access <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> <b>up</b> Internet by dialing a certain number and then being billed on their normal telephone bill.|$|E

The PAD service could {{be connected to}} via a dedicated four-wire telephone circuit using a PSS analog modem and later on via a Kilostream digital access circuit. However most customers, for cost reasons, chose <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> <b>up</b> via an analog modem over the then UK analog telephony network to their nearest public PAD, via published phone numbers, using an ID/password provided as a subscription service.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Telecom {{established}} {{a presence in}} Australia, buying 78% of AAPT, Australia's third-largest telecommunications company. Telecom upgraded its nationwide payphone network to smart card technology. Telecom's broadband Internet service based on ADSL technology, called JetStream, was launched and rolled-out progressively in local exchanges. Also at this time, Telecom began charging customers who connected to the Internet using a local <b>dial</b> <b>up</b> number, forcing all ISPs in New Zealand to change <b>to</b> an 0867 <b>dial</b> <b>up</b> number. This resulted in complaints that this was in breach of Telecom's Kiwishare Agreement where residential customers are allowed free local calling. The decade was rounded off with Theresa Gattung being appointed new CEO of Telecom, with Rod Deane moving {{to the position of}} chairman.|$|R
50|$|Dialers are {{necessary}} to connect to the internet (at least for non-broadband connections), but some dialers are designed to connect to premium-rate numbers. The providers of such dialers often search for security holes in the operating system installed on the user's computer {{and use them to}} set the computer up <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> <b>up</b> through their number, so as to make money from the calls. Alternatively, some dialers inform the user what it is that they are doing, with the promise of special content, accessible only via the special number. Examples of this content include software for download, (usually illegal) trojans posing as MP3s, trojans posing as pornography, or 'underground' programs such as cracks and keygens.|$|E
50|$|As Peter, Joe, and Quagmire {{hang out}} at The Drunken Clam, they decide to do {{something}} to shake up their boring lives. They take Peter up on his suggestion to take up skydiving. Peter is invigorated by their jump and keeps up skydiving despite Lois' concern, even as his jumps usually result in accidents like falling on Meg at dinner, falling on a ninja that killed a woman, and falling on the castle of the Pig King from Angry Birds with only one pig left alive. An accident at the Eiffel Tower replica in Las Vegas lands Peter in the hospital where he meets Mahmoud, a Muslim. He finds he gets along great with Mahmoud. Back at the Drunken Clam, Peter has Mahmoud stop by to introduce him to Quagmire, Joe, and Brian. They find he has nothing in common with them when he refuses to drink or look at other women. Mahmoud introduces Peter to Islamic culture and he becomes interested in becoming a Muslim. Lois has reservations as Peter starts studying Islam in-depth although she decides to let it pass. Joe and Quagmire also voice their suspicions about Mahmoud as Peter tries <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> <b>up</b> Mahmoud twice only to cause some explosions off-screen. Mahmoud later invites Peter to a Muslim get-together but finds himself unwittingly involved with terrorists intent on blowing up the Quahog Bridge.|$|E

50|$|Because of its location, Internet in Kiribati is {{much more}} {{expensive}} than in other regions. 500MB can be downloaded for A$30 a month at a burst speed of 128kbit/s. Once the 500 MB is exceeded, speed will be reduced <b>to</b> that of <b>dial</b> <b>up.</b> Three additional tiers exist each with more speed, included usage, and of course cost. A modem needs to be purchased or rented. TSKL sells modems for $399 for an indoor modem, and $759 for an out of doors version. A modem may also be rented for $25 a month.|$|R
50|$|Released in August 2000, Smoothwall GPL was {{developed}} by Lawrence Manning and Richard Morrell to provide a quick and easy-to-use {{solution to the problem}} of sharing their ISDN connections with the rest of their LAN. Created using Red Hat Linux, Smoothwall GPL originally had two simple functions: control the modem <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> and hang <b>up,</b> and to route TCP/IP packets from the LAN to the Internet connection, and back again. The LAN was hidden from the public network by NAT, applied using ipchains.|$|R
50|$|A {{tourbillon}} has {{no effect}} on the change in rate that accompanies a change in attitude from <b>dial</b> horizontal (<b>dial</b> <b>up</b> or down) <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> vertical (pendant <b>up,</b> down, left or right). This change in rate between horizontal and vertical is much greater than rate changes between different vertical positions. Breguet designed the tourbillon for pocket watches that are kept in a vertical position in the waistcoat pocket, and can be maintained in this vertical position overnight by hanging on a suitable stand, and in this vertical attitude a tourbillon is effective. However, the attitude of a wrist watch changes frequently from vertical to horizontal depending on what its wearer is doing. The effect of a tourbillon is small compared to the change in rate resulting from changes from vertical to horizontal, and vice versa. Inclined tourbillons such as those made by Greubel Forsey are an improvement in this regard.|$|R
40|$|Distance {{learners}} in traditional online exercise and tutoring systems often get stuck with questions {{for which they}} need {{the help of a}} tutor or colleague. Learning alone can also be frustrating. In our Communication And Tutoring System CATS we have integrated the possibility <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> <b>up</b> a tutor and/or to setup an immediate group communication with other distance learners using Internet videoconferencing technology. To find the appropriate partner, we have implemented a measurement algorithm that keeps track of the performance level of a learner by measuring the percentage of correct answers at the current level, the reliability with which the learner answers the questions and the time he/she takes. From these measures we derive a unified performance parameter that controls the presentation of the next set of questions. These are then generated dynamically by the exercise applet. The CATS system automatically selects the most appropriate communica-tion partner(s) bas! ed on the exercises the learners are currently working on, and on their skill levels. We motivate this approach from a pedagogical point of view and present the architecture and implementation of the CATS system...|$|E

40|$|In 1985 a {{new type}} of {{technical}} project launched for members of the QuantumLink online service. Participants in the project used their computers <b>to</b> <b>dial</b> <b>up</b> to the Internet with 300 -baud modems. They met in a virtual space and communicated with each other in a cartoon-like environment where each attendee was visually represented by a picture on the screen called an avatar. 1 It was a place called Habitat 2 and it was the world's first large-scale, multi-user, graphical virtual world. A decade later, an entire wave of virtual worlds launched, including 2 -dimensional (2 D) environments like The Palace 3, Virtual Places 4, and Microsoft Comic Chat 5, and 3 -dimensional (3 D) environments like Active Worlds 6, Cybertown 7, Traveler 8, and WorldsChat 9. The original Habitat was re-launched by Fujitsu with the new name WorldsAway 10. This first wave of virtual worlds was influenced by a variety of cultural and technical sources, including cyberpunk science fiction, video games and text-based Internet chat rooms. 11 While most of the early virtual worlds survived the "dotcom crash " of 2001 (so far), many of them experienced major changes in ownership, management, and pricing structures. Several companies abandoned their virtual world projects in 2001, at which point they either disappeared or were taken over by small groups of loyal devotees. After a brief lull in new virtual world launches, a second wave is now emerging with the recent launch of projects like The Sims Online, There, Habbo Hotel, Second Life, and Coke Music. The second generation of virtual worlds is a collection of groundbreaking, immersive 3 D spaces with high-end graphics, influenced as much by their online and video game counterparts as by their first-wave predecessors. 12 This paper will demonstrate how several first-wave and second-wave virtual worlds are presented and experienced as exotic trave...|$|E

50|$|The biggest {{obstacle}} for a watchmaker regulating a watch, even today, {{is getting a}} similar result from the escapement no matter the position it is kept in. This has been made infinitely easier with accurate timing machines which give instantaneous timing results, whereas in Breguet's time all that watchmakers had was another watch to regulate from. So, results were not very exact and it could take weeks to get them. Effects of gravity on an escapement can have quite significant effects with slight variations of position. Even if a pocket watch was kept {{most of the time}} in a breast pocket, the exact position could still vary over 45°. Watchmakers can regulate a watch in <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 8 positions: <b>dial</b> <b>up,</b> crown down, <b>dial</b> down, crown left, crown up, crown right, half-way position crown up, and half-way position crown down. A tourbillon quite neatly reduces this problem; it only needs to be regulated for 3 positions; the two horizontal positions, <b>dial</b> <b>up</b> & down, and one vertical position.|$|R
