25|$|In reality, {{there was}} no scope to make an {{economic}} <b>Teletext</b> <b>system</b> with 1971 technology. However, as low cost was essential to the project's long term success, this obstacle had to be overcome.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{where the}} SECAM {{standard}} {{is used in}} television broadcasting, a <b>teletext</b> <b>system</b> {{was developed in the}} late 1970s under the name Antiope. It had a higher data rate and was capable of dynamic page sizes, allowing more sophisticated graphics. It was phased out in favour of standard teletext in 1991.|$|E

40|$|There is {{worldwide}} {{interest in}} the prospect for information access in the home using the television receiver for display of textual and graphical information. Viewdata systems use a large, central, computerized databank utility to store the information. <b>Teletext</b> <b>systems</b> transmit all the information over the air in a round-robin fashion, and users select the desired frame of information. These systems are examined {{in terms of the}} various communications applications that they may fulfil. Technological, marketing, and transmission implications are explored. ...|$|R
50|$|The BBC Micro used {{a variant}} of ASCII that {{replaced}} the backtick ("`", character 96, hex 60) with the pound sign (ISO/IEC 8859 {{had not yet been}} standardised, and it was advantageous to have commonly used characters available in the lower, 7-bit ASCII table), denoted as CHR$96 or (hex) CHR$&60. Since the BBC Micro used a Teletext mode as standard, this means that the pound sign is in the 7-bit ASCII variant used on <b>Teletext</b> <b>systems</b> such as Ceefax, ORACLE and Teletext Ltd as well.|$|R
25|$|NABTS was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} protocol by the Canadian Department of Communications, with their industry partner Norpak, for the Telidon system. It {{was similar to the}} European World System Teletext (WST, aka CCIR <b>Teletext</b> <b>System</b> B), but differences between the European and North American television standards and the greater flexibility of the Telidon standard {{led to the creation of}} a new delivery mechanism that was tuned for speed.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 1974, a <b>teletext</b> <b>system</b> {{which was}} {{launched}} to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched. Engineers originally began developing {{such a system}} to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The Ceefax service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, flight times and film reviews.|$|E
25|$|BBC News is {{responsible}} for the news programmes and some documentary content on the BBC's general television channels, as well as the news coverage on the BBC News Channel in the UK and 22 hours of programming for the corporation's BBC World News channel internationally. Coverage for BBC Parliament is carried out on behalf on the BBC at Millbank Studios though BBC News provides editorial and journalistic content. BBC News content is also output onto the BBC's digital interactive television services under the BBC Red Button brand, and until 2012, on the Ceefax <b>teletext</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Videotex and <b>teletext</b> <b>systems</b> used a 2×3 matrix and one {{foreground}} ("ink"), and one background color, normally {{out of a}} set {{of eight}} colors (including black and white). Many systems used [...] "Videotex graphics". One of the best known examples is the Acorn BBC Micro's default graphics mode (mode 7). Other systems which used [...] "Videotex"-like graphics are: the ABC 80, the Grundy NewBrain, many of the Acorn Eurocard systems, and the Philips P2000T, which actually used a Teletext chip designed for their TV's.|$|R
25|$|It {{is closely}} linked to the PAL {{broadcast}} system used in Europe. Other <b>teletext</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed to work with the SECAM and NTSC <b>systems,</b> but <b>teletext</b> failed to gain widespread acceptance in North America and other areas where NTSC is used. In contrast, teletext is nearly ubiquitous across Europe as well as some other regions, with most major broadcasters providing a teletext service. Common teletext services include TV schedules, regularly updated current affairs and sport news, simple games (such as quizzes) and subtitles (or closed captioning).|$|R
2500|$|The EBU Ceefax-based <b>teletext</b> <b>systems</b> are {{the source}} for closed {{captioning}} signals, thus when teletext is embedded into DVB-T or DVB-S the closed captioning signal is included. However, for DVB-T and DVB-S, {{it is not necessary}} for a teletext page signal to also be present (ITV1, for example, does not carry analogue teletext signals on Sky Digital, but does carry the embedded version, accessible from the [...] "Services" [...] menu of the receiver, or more recently by turning them off/on from a mini menu accessible from the [...] "help" [...] button).|$|R
25|$|In New Zealand, {{captions}} use an EBU Ceefax-based <b>teletext</b> <b>system</b> on DVB broadcasts {{via satellite}} and cable television {{with the exception}} of MediaWorks New Zealand channels who completely switched to DVB RLE subtitles in 2012 on both Freeview satellite and UHF broadcasts, this decision was made based on the TVNZ practice of using this format on only DVB UHF broadcasts (aka Freeview HD). This made composite video connected TVs incapable of decoding the captions on their own. Also, these pre-rendered subtitles use classic caption style opaque backgrounds with an overly large font size and obscure the picture more than the more modern, partially transparent backgrounds.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Broadcast Teletext Specification" [...] was {{published}} in September 1976 jointly by the IBA, the BBC and the British Radio Equipment Manufacturers' Association. The new standard also made the term [...] "teletext" [...] generic, describing any such system. [...] The standard was internationalised as World System Teletext (WST), formalised as an international standard by CCIR in 1986 as CCIR <b>Teletext</b> <b>System</b> B.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Martin Nisenholtz invited Fekner, Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and John Matos/Crash to {{experiment}} {{on the early}} interactive <b>teletext</b> <b>system</b> Telidon at NYU’s Alternate Media Center, the predecessor of its Interactive Telecommunications Program. Fekner received his first international award at Toronto's Video Culture Festival in the Videotex category for Toxic Wastes From A to Z, an 8-bit computer graphics [...] animation created at AMC which featured a rap by k-8 students from a South Bronx school. In the New York Times, Matthew Mirapaul said, [...] "Fekner's work incorporates jagged, pixilated computer-generated imagery because 'its characteristic of the medium....it's almost like the drip in a Jackson Pollock,' Mr. Fekner stated." ...|$|E

5000|$|During this period, {{a number}} of {{companies}} were developing the first <b>teletext</b> <b>systems,</b> notably the BBC's Ceefax system. Ceefax encoded character data into the lines in the vertical blanking interval of normal television signals where they could not be seen on-screen, and then used a buffer and decoder in the user's television to convert these into [...] "pages" [...] of text on the display. The Independent Broadcasting Authority quickly introduced their own ORACLE system, and the two organizations subsequently agreed to use a single standard, the [...] "Broadcast Teletext Specification".|$|R

5000|$|Test {{deployments}} {{demonstrated the}} problems that most other <b>teletext</b> <b>systems</b> also discovered: without {{an enormous amount of}} content, viewer interest is difficult to maintain. While large Telidon deployments might hold tens of thousands of pages, users were able to quickly exhaust the content in their particular areas of interest, suggesting that systems would have to contain hundreds of thousands of pages in order to remain interesting for longer periods. As Gordon Thompson of Bell-Northern Research put it, [...] "all of the excitement is in the expectation; the reality is really quite disappointing." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} U.S. {{companies}} also expressed an interest, and started plans {{for their own}} Telidon-based <b>teletext</b> <b>systems.</b> As early as 1978, AT&T Corporation and CBS had been experimenting {{with the idea of}} a videotex service, and were drawn towards the Telidon efforts. In 1982 they introduced an experimental system known as [...] "Venture One" [...] in Ridgewood, New Jersey, equipping some homes with stand-alone terminals from AT&T, and others with set-top boxes. The test ran for seven months from 1982 to 83, and was considered a success, so much so that AT&T publicly announced plans to introduce a commercial system in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, groups {{including}} TVOntario, Athabasca University, the University of Victoria, and the University of Waterloo {{participated in}} Telidon experiments {{during the late}} 70s and early 80s. Telidon, an alphageometric videotex information system used set-top boxes with TV sets, or subsequently software decoders running on PCs (Apple II, MAC, and PC decoders were available) to display text and graphics. The intent was to demonstrate and develop educational applications for videotex and <b>teletext</b> <b>systems.</b> This work continued until 1983, when the Telidon coding structure became a North American standard - ANSI T500 - NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax).|$|R

Aertel {{was provided by}} the site from 1996, originally to provide the text news service, and is digitised by screen scraping the off-air broadcasts. The content from both RTÉ One (Aertel) and RTÉ Two (Aertel Plus) is available.|$|E
50|$|A flight {{information}} display system (FIDS) {{is a computer}} system used in airports to display {{flight information}} to passengers, in which a computer system controls mechanical or electronic display boards or TV screens in order to display arrivals and departures flight information in real-time. The displays are located inside or around an airport terminal. A virtual version of a FIDS {{can also be found}} on most airport websites and <b>teletext</b> <b>systems.</b> In large airports, there are different sets of FIDS for each terminal or even each major airline. FIDS are used to assist passengers during air travel and people who want to pick up passengers after the flight.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>teletext</b> <b>systems,</b> Telidon included, {{were created}} {{in the context of}} the {{broadcast}} model, where the content would be provided by large vendors and then pushed one-way to the user in a fashion similar to television or newspapers. Interactivity was generally limited to menu selections or providing information on forms (like online banking). This placed the entire burden of creating the content on the service providers and their partners, an expensive and time-consuming process. Since much of the content in question was already available on different media controlled by the same companies, teletext services also had the problem of competing with incumbent mediums that were less expensive and better developed.|$|R

40|$|Teletext is a one way {{broadcast}} system {{which provides a}} variety of services to its users. A one way {{broadcast system}} is attractive because a single transmission {{of a piece of}} information satisfies all potential users of that information. The main drawback of these types of systems is that a user must wait until the required information arrives. Therefore, the access time is an important consideration in the design of broadcast <b>teletext</b> <b>systems.</b> In addition, another important factor, information update delay, is very significant in real time broadcast teletext. The shortening of this delay is important. for real time applications especially for systems broadcasting financial information. In this paper, we propose to use the ghost rows together with the storage capabilities of modern terminals to shorten both the access time and the update delay. A queueing model is developed to analyse the performance of this new system. © 1997 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
