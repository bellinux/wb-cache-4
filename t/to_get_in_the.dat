5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed and wrist shot, {{the latter of}} which has improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot blocker, using his body <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and strength to maintain position {{in front of the}} opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} another {{standard}} match involving Shelton Benjamin and Kerwin White. White tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring, but Benjamin slid out and tripped him. Benjamin threw White {{into the ring}} barricade, which led him to throw {{him back in the}} ring as the bell rang to officially start the match. In the ring, Benjamin body slammed White, which was followed by a running forearm. White retaliated with a dropkick to Benjamin's knee. The match concluded after White grabbed a golf club that he hid in the steel steps and tried to assault Benjamin with it. Benjamin, however, countered with a T-Bone Suplex and covered White and got the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} series its own {{distinctive}} musical identity, according to Djawadi, the producers asked {{him not to}} use musical elements such as flutes or solo vocals {{that had already been}} successfully used by other major fantasy productions. He mentioned that a challenge in scoring the series was its reliance on dialogue and its sprawling cast: on several occasions already-scored music had to be omitted so as not <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of dialogue.|$|E

5|$|As the Flames sank in the standings, their {{attendance}} also sagged. For most {{of their}} first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHL. However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum: buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City in leaving for the United States. The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the 1999–2000 season. The Flames issued another appeal for more season tickets {{in the summer of}} 2000. The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful. The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5million between 2001 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, after {{wrapping}} up the production and recording of their debut album, Into the Rush, Aly & AJ began recording their first Christmas album. Antonina Armato and Tim James {{who worked on the}} duo's debut album and several other Disney-related acts, were recruited to executive produce the effort. They anticipated finishing the album {{by the end of the}} summer, in order for it to be released for the holiday season. Aly & AJ thought it ironic that they were prepping a Christmas album during the hottest days of the year. Alyson Michalka told the Saginaw News that producers Armato and James filled the studio with Christmas decorations, Christmas cookies, and a tree with gifts to open after they were done, in order for them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Christmas spirit.|$|E
5|$|In {{professional}} wrestling, some wrestlers use {{the soccer}} kick is as a finishing move. A number of professional wrestlers {{prior to the}} 1980s professional wrestling boom were taught to use wrestling moves and strikes legitimately. This {{was due to the}} likelihood of attacks on the wrestlers from fans. This included the soccer kick, which former pro-wrestler, CM Punk stated was the easiest tactic to use when a fan tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring to confront a wrestler. High profile users of soccer kicks as a finishing move includes Katsuyori Shibata, and Randy Orton. In Japan within a 1977 puroresu match between Antonio Inoki and Great Antonio, Inoki started to shoot on Great Antonio after Great Antonio refused to sell Inoki's offence. Inoki used a takedown on Great Antonio and then used soccer kicks and head stomps to legitimately knock out Great Antonio.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E

In late December 2005, Japanese whaling fleets experienced heavy opposition from Greenpeace, who protested that the Japanese were continuing their commercial whaling under the guise of research, and even worse, they were doing so in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. They sent volunteer workers in inflatable boats <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of fire in order to stop the whaling.|$|E

25|$|Musashi's {{late arrival}} is controversial. Sasaki's outraged {{supporters}} {{thought it was}} dishonorable and disrespectful, while Musashi's supporters {{thought it was a}} fair way to unnerve his opponent. Another theory is that Musashi timed the hour of his arrival to match the turning of the tide. The tide carried him to the island. After his victory, Musashi immediately jumped back in his boat and his flight from Sasaki's vengeful allies was helped by the turning of the tide. Another theory states he waited for the sun <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right position. After he dodged a blow, Sasaki was blinded by the sun.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Many-minds theory {{holds that}} a {{conscious}} being who observes {{the outcome of}} a random zero-sum experiment will evolve into two successors in different observer states, each of whom observes one of the possible outcomes. Moreover, the theory advises you to favour choices in such situations in proportion to the probability that they will bring good results to your various successors. But in a life-or-death case like getting into the box with Schrödinger's cat, you will only have one successor, since one of the outcomes will ensure your death. So it seems that the Many-minds Interpretation advises you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> box with the cat, since it is certain that your only successor will emerge unharmed.

25|$|The {{preceding}} Belaúnde {{administration had}} started Peru {{on the path}} of protection to promote industry, and in this respect the Velasco government reinforced rather than reversed the existing strategy. Beyond the usual recourse to high tariffs, Velasco's government adopted the Industrial Community Law of 1970 that gave any industrialist on the register of manufacturers the right to demand prohibition of any imports competing with his products. No questions of exceptionally high costs of production, poor product quality, or monopolistic positions fostered by excluding import competition were allowed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way. Before the succeeding government of General Francisco Morales Bermúdez Cerrutti (1975–80) began to clean up the battery of protective exclusions in 1978, the average tariff rate reached 66 percent, accompanied by quantitative restrictions on 2,890 specific tariff positions.|$|E
