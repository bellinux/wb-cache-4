O estudo aborda o histórico do transporte de carga no Brasil e o comportamento da cabotagem dentro deste cenário, com o objetivo de destacar os pontos que afetam o desenvolvimento da cabotagem ao longo da costa brasileira. Além do levantamento bibliográfico foi desenvolvida uma metodologia de avaliação dos principais entraves da cabotagem, dividida em 3 etapas: definição do plano de pesquisa ou proposta da pesquisa; escolha do método a ser utilizado com definição dos grupos de variáveis e atores; aplicação e análise do estudo de caso. Esta metodologia propõe a utilização de um Método de Auxílio à Tomada de Decisão por Múltiplos Critérios, o Analytic Hierarchy Process- AHP. A avaliação dos entraves foi feita a partir da comparação paritária desses gargalos pelos principais atores que compõem o cenário da cabotagem: armadores, donos de carga, representantes de operadores portuários e a Agência Nacional de Transporte Aquaviário (ANTAQ), segundo o conhecimento e sensibilidade de cada um desses grupos em relação à legislação e às questões portuárias, logísticas e operacionais. Esta avaliação possibilitou analisar a visão de cada um desses grupos em relação ao sistema de cabotagem no Brasil, encontrando pontos comuns e divergentes entre eles. Desta forma, tem-se uma visão geral da importância do tema proposto e a necessidade de reavaliação do sistema de forma que atenda às necessidades de todos os envolvidos no contexto. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis work {{considers}} {{an evaluation}} of the scene of <b>the</b> <b>cabotage,</b> through a hierarchic analysis of its impediments on the route between Santos port and Manaus port, by the vision of the involved actors in this scene. The considered study approaches the history of the freight transportation in Brazil and the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>cabotage</b> on this scene, with the objective to emphasize the points that affect the development of <b>the</b> <b>cabotage</b> throughout <b>the</b> Brazilian coast. In addition to the bibliographical survey, an evaluation methodology of <b>the</b> <b>cabotage</b> main impediments was proposed, which is divided in 3 stages: definition of the research plan or proposal of the research; choice of the method to be used with definition of the groups of variables and actors; application and analysis of the case study. This methodology considers the use of a multiple criteria decision making method, the Analytic Hierarchy Process- AHP. The evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>cabotage</b> impediments was done from the parity comparison of these impediments by the main actors who compose the scene of the cabotage: load ship owners, load owners, representatives of port operators and the Brazilian regulator agency (ANTAQ), according to knowledge and sensitivity of each one of these groups about the laws and the portuary, operational and logistic questions. This evaluation made possible to analyze the vision of each one of these groups in relation to <b>the</b> <b>cabotage</b> system in Brazil, finding common and divergent points between them. In such a way, it’s a general vision {{about the importance of the}} considered subject and the need of a system reevaluation to meet the necessities of all the involved ones in the context...|$|R

40|$|An open European {{market for}} goods and services, {{including}} transport services, stimulates trade, global competitiveness and economic growth. At the same time, concerns about domestic job security, regulation compliance {{and the environment}} have sparked a debate. This report should be {{considered one of the}} first modest contributions to the mainly unexplored area of European freight deregulation. Our contribution is a review of previous research, a snapshot of the movement patterns of the foreign trucks on Scandinavian roads, statistical analyses and case investigations. Parts of the data collection presented in this report are based on an innovative smartphone app for counting trucks that registers vehicle movements with the assistance of 8 000 volunteers. Given the novelty of the methods employed one must keep in mind the underlying assumptions stated in the report when interpreting the results. Our study offers the following indications: 1) Denmark, Norway and Sweden are three different markets, with significant differences in terms of how cabotage and combined transportation are carried out. 2) The actors in the market are very flexible and are adapting their businesses according to the possibilities the current road freight regulations offer. <b>The</b> <b>Cabotage</b> Directive may have been introduced as a way to increase fill rate, but is in practice viewed as a tool for gaining access to low-cost drivers on Scandinavian roads. 3) The data for Sweden indicate that there are legal infringements of <b>the</b> <b>cabotage</b> rules, which means that trucks make more than 3 trips and/or stay longer than 7 days. There are also indications of frequent violations of tax rules regarding posted workers. 4) The data collected can be used to complement <b>the</b> Eurostat <b>cabotage</b> statistics, particularly since many of the most frequently occurring truck nationalities are not represented in Eurostat. In addition to the indications outlined, our data also provide a rich picture of Bulgarian hauliers in Scandinavia...|$|R

30|$|The study {{conducted}} by the Ministry of the crisis and competition within the European road haulage industry in 2008 provides us with some partial answers in this area. This analysis concluded that “the French road haulage industry carries half a percentage point less of all European freight” and road haulage activity in Metropolitan France has fallen by 5  % “much more than the average for national carriers (1.9  %).” According to the Comité National Routier, in 2010, French carriers are “the least active as regards cabotage activities in Western Europe. <b>The</b> volume of <b>cabotage</b> has significantly fallen {{in the last five years}} for Belgian and French hauliers, while those from Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Italy have increased their cabotage activities” [10]. It is true that in the last ten years, the competitiveness of the French haulage industry seems to be falling compared with the rest of Europe [1] but the global economic crisis can hardly be blamed for this state of affairs. “In 2003, cabotage activities conducted by French hauliers amounted to 14.4  % of <b>the</b> <b>cabotage</b> activities conducted by foreign hauliers in France. In 2008, this level had fallen to 7.6  %” ([10]). The French road haulage sector seems to have been weak for many years [9].|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to discuss recent trends in false (bogus) {{self-employment}} in east-west labour migration in Sweden after the enlargement of the EU into the former Eastern Bloc. The study explores the reasons for using “self-employed” migrant workers in the construction and road haulage industries, how the workers are recruited and how the organised parties in the labour market have recognised and responded to this practice. The emphasis is on the intertwined relationships between self-employment as a mode of exploitation and as a strategy for survival in the labour market, which always has made false self-employment a complex matter for the trade unions to address. The analysis also relates to the current scholarly debate on dual labour markets. The study shows that the practice of false self-employment has increased in recent years in both industries. Yet there are other ways to avoid Swedish collective agreements and labour standards, for example by concluding “false collective agreements”. The study analyses the reasons behind this increase in a Swedish and international context. The discussion includes, among other things, how false self-employment is related to the use of long subcontracting chains, the infringement of the EU regulations on <b>the</b> <b>cabotage</b> traffic and <b>the</b> evasion of taxes and social fees in the host countries. It also includes why combating false self-employment has become a matter of converging interests and organised cooperation between the social partners in the road haulage industry, but as yet not in the construction industr...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyThe {{liberalization}} of Maritime Transport is one important element {{to increase the}} export competitiveness of a country. In fact, studies remark that, for some countries, the effective rate of protection by the costs of transport {{is much higher than}} that of tariffs. One of the most relevant elements in the determination of the costs of maritime transport refers to the efficient management of ports. The global trend towards trade liberalization and integration and economic interdependence led Latin American countries to opt for programs of economic reforms that incorporated the participation of domestic and foreign private agents in sectors of the economy that were previously reserved to the state. Among the most significant of these was the reform of ports. In this area, the most vital seems to be to secure that the competition potential among operators is maximized. In the case of Latin American countries one should consider three factors which concur to the successful implementation of a public/private financing for the ports: a) seeking capital is very important for the financing of investments, since many governments have restricted budgets due to the debt service payments; b) the rapid economic growth has generated new traffic that demands new facilities and more efficient services and, finally, c) the strong competition makes indispensable the improvement of port facilities because otherwise the ports can be displaced by their rivals. Another problem that affects maritime transport efficiency refers to the regulation of <b>the</b> <b>cabotage</b> traffic. Restrictions to cargo and passenger transport inside the national territory are part of the maritime legislation of nations on a worldwide scale. Several countries still restrict this type of transport to the ships with national flags, and they establish minimum percentages for crews of national origin. Nonetheless, some countries have liberalized <b>cabotage</b> completely. <b>The</b> {{liberalization of}} <b>cabotage</b> traffic brings advantages in terms of: smaller freight costs, better use of idle capacity, higher frequency, higher competition, needlessness of the waivers and more maritime cargo transportation. Although Chile has {{been at the forefront of}} the process of trade liberalization this process has not been without difficulties. In the case of maritime transport Chilean law and regulations have been extensively modified and liberalized. The objective has been the increase of efficiency and the attraction of foreign direct investment. However, there are limits to this process that refer specially to questions of sovereignty, security and simple protectionism. In <b>the</b> area of <b>cabotage</b> and pilotage <b>the</b> evolution of maritime trade liberalization has been an example of the challenges that still face the liberalization process in Chile. The present document will briefly review the modifications implemented in the Chilean maritime legislation and the difficulties that remain for a more efficient public sector management. Taking into consideration the transformations that happened on a global scale, it discusses some aspects of the maritime transport sector and suggests areas of policy action that may assist the construction of a common regional maritime integration regime...|$|R
