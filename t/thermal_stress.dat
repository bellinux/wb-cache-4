5|$|The {{nucleus of}} some comets may be fragile, a {{conclusion}} {{supported by the}} observation of comets splitting apart. A significant cometary disruption was that of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9, which was discovered in 1993. A close encounter in July 1992 had broken it into pieces, and {{over a period of}} six days in July 1994, these pieces fell into Jupiter's atmosphere—the first time astronomers had observed a collision between two objects in the Solar System. Other splitting comets include 3D/Biela in 1846 and 73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann from 1995 to 2006. Greek historian Ephorus reported that a comet split apart {{as far back as the}} winter of 372–373 BC.

Uniform heating of the spar in an oven resulted in <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> arising {{from the effects of}} dissimilar materials and anisotropy of the metal matrix composite. <b>Thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> were calculated from a finite element structural model using anisotropic material properties deduced from constituent properties and rules of mixtures.

40|$|A {{percentage}} of insulating glass (IG) units break each year due to thermally induced perimeter stresses. The glass industry has {{known about this}} problem {{for many years and}} an ASTM standard has recently been developed for the design of monolithic glass plates for <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> induced by solar irradiance. It is believed that a similar standard can be developed for IG units if a proper understanding of IG <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> can be developed. The objective of this research is to improve understandings of IG <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> and compare the IG <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> with those that develop in monolithic glass plates given similar environmental conditions. The major difference between the analysis of a monolithic glass plate and an IG unit is energy exchange due to conduction, natural convection, and long wave radiation through the gas space cavity. In IG units, conduction, natural convection, and long wave radiation combine in a nonlinear fashion that frequently requires iterative numerical analyses for determining <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> in certain situations. To simplify the gas space energy exchange, a numerical propagation procedure was developed. The numerical propagation procedure combines the nonlinear effects of conduction, natural convection, and long wave radiation into a single value. Use of this single value closely approximates the nonlinear nature of the gas space energy exchange and simplifies the numerical analysis. The numerical propagation procedure was then coupled with finite element analysis to estimate <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> for both monolithic glass plates and IG units. It is shown that the maximum <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> that develop in IG units increase linearly with input solar irradiance during the transient phase. It is shown that an initial preload stress develops under equilibrium conditions due to the thermal bridge effects of the spacer. It is shown that IG units develop larger <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> than monolithic glass plates under similar environmental conditions. Finally, it is shown that the use of low-e coatings increase IG <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> and that the location of low-e coating as well as environmental conditions affect which glass plate develops larger <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses...</b>|$|R

The polymer gel electrolyte is quasi-solid at room temperature, and becomes a viscous liquid (viscosity: 4.34 mPa·s) at 80°C compared with the traditional liquid electrolyte (viscosity: 0.91 mPa·s).

Crown received a patent for the invention in 1974. After proving itself in the field, the topology was used to design the Microtech MT-1000 in 1984. Further development of the grounded bridge yielded the Macrotech line which set a new standard for touring sound reinforcement in 1992 with the MA-5000VZ.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{comparative}} study on factors effecting temperature rise {{and the state}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>stresses</b> inside a thick concrete section were investigated analytically. A finite-difference model was adopted to solve diffusion of internal heat generated by chemical reaction between cement and water.

25|$|Daily extreme {{temperature}} variations create fractures by repeated expansion and contraction {{of the rock}} in a process called <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> weathering. The thermal stresses can cause deep cracks that split the rock into separate pieces in an erosional process called thermal exfoliation. Precipitation causes dissolution of the fine crystalline grains that bind the larger particles together, which is known as chemical weathering. Freezing water expands in fractures making them wider and deeper in a process called frost weathering. Gravity exerts a constant downward force that creates new fractures and separates the formations along existing fractures in a process called stress relief exfoliation. High speed winds remove any loose grains from the formations and wind-borne particulates sandblast the surfaces making them smoother.|$|E
