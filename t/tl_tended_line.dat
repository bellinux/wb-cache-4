40|$|Pterygoplichthys pardalis {{is a type}} of {{freshwater}} fish that live in the Air Hitam River, one of polluted river in Riau. Eventhough the river is polluted, but this species well developed in that river. To understand the stomach content of that fish and its relationship with size, sex and level of maturity, a study has been conducted from February to May 2015. There were 169 fishes captured, however only 91 fishes were used for stomach content study as the other had empty stomach. The stomach content was analyzed and was used as a basis to calculate the Preponderance Index (PI). Results shown that the main food of P. pardalis is Bacillariophyceae (PI 41. 19 %), small fishes (91 - 124 mm <b>TL)</b> <b>tend</b> to consume Cyanophyceae (PI 53. 54 %), while the big fish (more than 295 mm <b>TL)</b> <b>tend</b> to consume Bacillariophyceae (PI 45, 48 %) and rest of crustacea (PI 46, 66 %). Male eat more Cyanophyceae (PI 46, 69 %), the female consume Bacillariophyceae (PI 39, 05 %). Fish with low maturity level (2 nd and 3 rd maturity level) tend to eat Chlorophyceae (PI 48. 81 %) and Bacillariophyceae (PI 34. 19 %), while the mature fish prefer to consume Chlorophyceae (PI 37. 14 %). Based on data obtained, it can be concluded that the main food of P. pardalis was various and it is related to body size, sex and gonad maturity level...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} international soccer games of three major soccer clubs of Turkey (Besiktas, Fenerbahce, and Galatasaray), {{as well as the}} Turkish national team on Turkish Lira (TL) against the U. S. dollar and TL against Euro during the period between 2003 and 2010. We find that draws and losses do not affect the exchange rates. However, when the effect of wins for each team is analyzed, it is found that a win effect exists only for the Turkish national team. Early studies found that <b>TL</b> <b>tends</b> to depreciate after a Turkish soccer club win over foreign rivals. However, a depressing effect after a win is rare in the literature. This study provides evidence that local currency actually appreciates after a win...|$|R
40|$|Training {{undergraduate}} agricultural {{students to}} be strong, positive leaders will have a large impact on the industries they work within and therefore should be of utmost importance to agricultural educators. Transformational leaders (<b>TL)</b> <b>tend</b> to have higher performing, more satisfied teams; consequently, development of TL characteristics should result in a more productive future workforce. The personality trait of agreeableness {{has been associated with}} the interpersonal aspects of leadership; however, the literature is unclear whether agreeableness is a significant predictor of TL. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationships between the personality trait agreeableness and TL in undergraduate agricultural leadership students. The findings indicated the facets of agreeableness had more predictive power on TL than the broader trait of overall agreeableness. Recommendations include framing TL development in a personality context. When discussing personality, a review of the facets of agreeableness should result in more meaningful learning for participants...|$|R
40|$|Foraging {{ecology of}} a large {{opportunistic}} predator (adult Lateolabrax latus) was investigated through intensive, targeted sampling of the species on an exposed shallow rocky shore of south-western Japan. The abundance of L. latus increased in autumn and spring, whilst no individual occurred in summer when water temperatures were > 24 °C. In spring larger sized individuals (> 70 cm <b>TL)</b> <b>tended</b> to occur, resulting {{in a wide range}} of body sizes. L. latus consumed a wide variety of organisms, of which fishes and benthic crustaceans were particularly important. Overall, the relative importance of invertebrates as food increased in spring, which may be related to seasonal fluctuations of macro-algae and algae-associated faunas. The fact that a large number of adult fish was collected at high tide in intertidal areas and their guts contained intertidal organisms suggests that L. latus relies on the rocky intertidal habitat as a major foraging ground. This in turn points to the potential importance of large, highly mobile predators such as adult L. latus in the food web dynamics of shallow-water (including the intertidal) assemblages...|$|R

A study aims to understand the stomach contentand its relation with size, sex and level of maturity of gonads has been done onJanuary to April 2014. There were three stations, namely the Naborsahan River(Station I), river mouth of the Naborsahan River (Station II), and the Toba Lake(Stasiun III). There were 515 fishes captured, however only 52 fishes were used forstomach content analysis study as the other having almost empty stomach (stomachfullness index less than 50 %. Parameters measured were Index of Preponderance(IP), type of food based on Total Length, sex, and maturity level. Results shown thatthe main food of this fish is Rotifera (IP 41. 78 %). Small fishes (less than 81 mm <b>TL)</b> <b>tend</b> consume Bacilliariophyceae (76. 17 %), medium sized (80 – 93 mm TL) fish tendto consume Cyanophyceae (39. 87 %), while the big fish (more than 139 mm TL) prefer to consume Rotifera 38. 27 - 58. 38 %) and Xanthophyceae (52. 51 %). Based onsex, the male eat more Cyanophyceae (35. 60 %), while that of the female Rotifera(39. 86 %). Fish with relatively low maturity level (2 nd and 3 rd maturity levels) tend toeat Cyanophyceae (82. 56 %) and Bacilliariophyceae (76. 29 %) respectively, whilemature fish prefer Rotifers (81. 58 %).

Our perspective is that software-flexibility is, perhaps, better exploited by a family of lighter, if less precise speculative models that can be combined together in an effective configuration, which takes advantage of the application’s code-patterns. This paper reports on two main contributions. First, it introduces splsc: a software tls model that trades the potential for false-positive violations for a small memory overhead and efficient implementation. Second, it presents PolyLibTLS: a library that encapsulates several lightweight models and enables their composition. In this context, we report on the template meta-programming techniques that we used to achieve performance and safety, while preserving library’s modularity, extensibility and usability properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the user-framework interaction is straightforward and present parallelization timing results that validate our high-level perspective...|$|R
