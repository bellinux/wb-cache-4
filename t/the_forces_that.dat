5|$|If {{the bike}} and rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are due to gravity, inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The internal forces are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|E

5|$|Schwalbe and Sperber {{spent their}} active careers abroad, usually in Germany's African colonies {{or in the}} Pacific. The two cruisers {{assisted}} in {{the suppression of the}} Abushiri Revolt in German East Africa in 18891890. By the end of the 1890s, both ships had been overhauled and decommissioned in Germany. They returned to service {{at the turn of the}} century for another tour overseas; Schwalbe joined <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> battled the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 before being decommissioned a second time in 1902. Sperber remained in Africa until 1911, when she too was decommissioned. Schwalbe was used as a training ship after 1912 and Sperber was used as a target ship during World War I. Both vessels were sold in 1920 and broken up in 1922.|$|E

After spending {{the rest of the year}} in reserve, receiving new supplies and equipment, the corps was transferred to the southern front in southwestern Russia to fight in the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive during January 1943, in which it played a key role by forming part of <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> encircled thousands of Axis troops on the Middle Don River.|$|E

5|$|Alan and Barry {{start to}} learn about the past of Cauldron Lake from other townsfolk. They believe an entity called the Dark Presence is trapped within the lake and is trying to escape by using its powers to turn fiction into reality. It has {{previously}} tried this with a writer known as Thomas Zane—the figure in the diving suit—but Zane was able to resist its will and died during the eruption that sank the island. The Dark Presence has grown strong enough to start to influence the townspeople and create <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> have chased Alan. That night, as Alan and Barry take shelter, they get drunk on moonshine, and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write Departure during the prior week, and realizes that the Dark Presence is now trying to use his writings to escape.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion {{began moving}} forward from Waigani to {{enable it to}} join the {{fighting}} later as a counterattacking force. They, along with the 2/9th, were subsequently tasked to carry out an attack from No. 3 Airstrip to KB Mission. Meanwhile, the Japanese also sought to reconfigure their forces and Mikawa decided to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> were already ashore. These reinforcements, consisting of 567 men from the 3rd Kure SNLF and 200 from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF, left Rabaul on 28 August. At around 4:30pm an RAAF patrol spotted the Japanese convoy– consisting of one cruiser and nine destroyers– and subsequently reported this to the Allied headquarters. Believing that further landings were about to occur, Clowes cancelled his plans to begin a counterattack with the troops from the 18th Brigade. Orders were also passed for the 30 Kittyhawks at Gili Gili to be flown off to Port Moresby in case the Japanese succeeded in breaking through to the airfield. The attack did not take place, though, and consequently {{early in the morning}} on 29 August they returned, albeit minus two aircraft which had crashed during the move.|$|E
5|$|General Trưởng was {{recalled}} to Saigon on 19 March {{to brief}} Thiệu on his withdrawal plan. The general developed two contingency plans: The first was predicated on government control of Highway 1, {{which would be}} utilized for two simultaneous withdrawals from Huế and Chu Lai to Da Nang; The second course presupposed PAVN interdiction of the highway {{and called for a}} withdrawal into three enclaves: Huế, Da Nang, and Chu Lai. This was to be only an interim measure, however, since <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> withdrew to Huế and Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then stunned the general by announcing he misinterpreted his previous orders: The old imperial capital of Huế was not to be abandoned. Making matters worse, Trưởng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Marine Division.|$|E

5|$|Giorgio de Santillana, {{professor}} of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with Hertha von Dechend {{believed that the}} old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial cosmology clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths are representative of <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate astronomy that became lost {{with the rise of}} the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the precession of the equinoxes. Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1798, {{during the}} Battle of the Nile, a British fleet under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson {{destroyed}} the French Mediterranean Fleet at Aboukir Bay on the Egyptian coast. The battle completely reversed the strategic {{situation in the}} Mediterranean: British forces had evacuated the region in 1796 after the Treaty of San Ildefonso brought Spain into the war on the French side, but they were now able to return in large numbers. As French maritime lines of communication were cut, the French Armée d'Orient under General Napoleon Bonaparte became trapped in Egypt. Unable to return to Europe by sea, the army attempted and failed to pass overland through Palestine and was subsequently abandoned by Bonaparte, who returned to France with his closest advisors in the frigates Muiron and Carrère in November 1799, promising to send reinforcements to <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> remained in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The HV {{operational}} plan was {{set out in}} four separate parts, designated Storm-1 through4, which were allocated to various corps based upon their individual areas of responsibility (AORs). Each plan was scheduled to take between four and five days. <b>The</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> the HV allocated to attack the RSK were organised into five army corps: Split, Gospić, Karlovac, Zagreb and Bjelovar Corps. A sixth zone {{was assigned to the}} Croatian special police inside the Split Corps AOR, near the boundary with the Gospić Corps. The HV Split Corps, located in the far south of the theatre of operations and commanded by Lieutenant General Ante Gotovina, was assigned the Storm-4 plan, which was the primary component of Operation Storm. The Split Corps issued orders for the battle using the name Kozjak-95 instead, which was not an unusual practice. The 30,000-strong Split Corps was opposed by the 10,000-strong ARSK 7th North Dalmatia Corps, headquartered in Knin and commanded by Major General Slobodan Kovačević. The 3,100-strong special police, deployed to the Velebit Mountain on the left flank of the Split Corps, were directly subordinated to the HV General Staff commanded by the Lieutenant General Mladen Markač.|$|E

5|$|The heating {{mechanism}} {{required for}} the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. <b>The</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1–6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.|$|E
5|$|With the 19th Brigade and the 2/7th Commando Squadron {{leading off}} {{along the coast}} route in December and the 17th Brigade with the 2/10th moving into the Torricellis, a series of {{small-scale}} actions followed. In mid-January the 19th Brigade was relieved by the 16th and the 2/9th Commando Squadron, which continued the drive along the coast, while in the Torricellis, the 17th Brigade's infantry battalions took turns leading the way with the commandos. The closed terrain hindered the movement of supplies from the rear areas and consequently the Australians made slow progress. The dense jungle also limited the size of <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> could be deployed, with the largest formations being sent out by the division being limited to company size at this time. Isolated pockets of Japanese offered significant resistance in places, {{which had to be}} overcome with artillery, air and tank support, while daily patrols risked ambush and attacks from snipers. The elements also posed a significant threat to the Australians, with many men drowning when they attempted to cross the flood-swollen rivers. Nevertheless, Maprik was taken on 23 April, as was Wewak, which fell on 10 May. Operations in the area continued through {{to the end of the}} war as the Australians exploited south from Maprik towards Nungagua, and east towards Kiarivu; after taking Wewak, the coastal route was expanded east towards the Brandi Plantation, while patrols ranged inland towards Sauri and Mount Shiburangu.|$|E
25|$|Coulomb's law holds {{even within}} atoms, {{correctly}} describing the force between the positively charged atomic nucleus {{and each of}} the negatively charged electrons. This simple law also correctly accounts for <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> bind atoms together to form molecules and for <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> bind atoms and molecules together to form solids and liquids. Generally, as the distance between ions increases, the force of attraction, and binding energy, approach zero and ionic bonding is less favorable. As the magnitude of opposing charges increases, energy increases and ionic bonding is more favorable.|$|E
