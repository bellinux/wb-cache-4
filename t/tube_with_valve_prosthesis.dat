40|$|Abstract. We {{have studied}} the {{clinical}} and morphological implications of renal siderosis, reviewing the autopsy protocols of 33 patients <b>with</b> <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> in the heart. Seventeen patients had variable amounts of iron in the proximal tubules of the kidney. Renal siderosis was more frequent in women, in patients with longest time of evol-ution from the surgical procedure, and in patients <b>with</b> two <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Histologically three degrees of renal siderosis may be defined: mild and moderate degrees of iron overload do not alter the kidney architecture, but kidneys with severe siderosis show tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Episodes of acute renal failure (ARF) were more frequent in patients with more pronounced iron deposits, especially in the premortem stages. We conclude that renal siderosis may damage the proximal tubular epithelium of patients <b>with</b> <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> in the heart; patients with renal overload of iron {{are more susceptible to}} episodes of ARF...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundMechanical {{heart valves}} carry {{significant}} risk during pregnancy. AimTo {{assess the risk}} of pregnancy and delivery for mother and child in women <b>with</b> mechanical heart <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> MethodsMulticenter retrospective observational study of women <b>with</b> mechanical heart <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> The regimen <b>with</b> low molecular weight heparin throughout pregnancy (LMWH) was compared to warfarin since the second trimester (W). ResultsOut of 419 pregnant women with cardiovascular diseases we assessed 14 women <b>with</b> mechanical heart <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis</b> (3. 3 %) who experienced 23 pregnancies. There were 13 pregnancies <b>with</b> aortic <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> 8 <b>with</b> <b>prosthesis</b> of atrio-ventricular <b>valves</b> and 2 pregnancies with both aortic and mitral <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> LMWH regimen was used in 18 pregnancies, W in 5 pregnancies. Major maternal complications occurred in 65 % of pregnancies, including 3 strokes and 3 urgent cardio-surgical procedures, all in women with LMWH regimen. Prosthetic valve thrombosis occurred in 26 %, all in the LMWH group; no thrombosis was found in W group, (p= 0. 166). Major bleeding occurred in 30 % with no difference between LMWH and W groups (p= 0. 596). Fetal loss represented 26 % of all pregnancies with no difference between LMWH and W group (p= 1). The birth weight was not significantly different between LMWH and W groups (2496 ± 327 g vs. 3132 ± 592 g, p= 0. 12). ConclusionThe rate of maternal and fetal complications in pregnant women <b>with</b> mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is still high. The anticoagulation regimen using warfarin since the second trimester {{appears to be the}} safest one. The best prevention of complications is to avoid the implantation of mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis</b> in girls and women in fertile age...|$|R
40|$|THe aims of our {{research}} were to investigate the TfR levels in patients <b>with</b> heart <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis</b> (mechanical or biological); in order a) to compare TfR values with the other well-known indexes of haemolysis -hemoglobn concentration (Hb), reticulocyte count (retics), serum bilirubin, serum lactate dehydrogenanse activity (sLDH), haptoglobin-, and b) to evaluate in such patients the utility of TfR determination as a good index of the erythropoietic response to traumatic haemolysis. On {{the basis of our}} preliminary results, we suggest that in patients <b>with</b> heart <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> the study of TfR, in association with previously reported indexes, would be useful to estimate if traumatic red cell destruction is completely compensated, as well as to identify underlying desorders of erythropoiesis mostly related to hypoproliferative bone-marrow condition...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether patients <b>with</b> heart <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> and similar International Normalized Ratios (INR) {{have the same}} level of protection against thromboembolic events, that is, whether the anticoagulation intensity is related to the intensity of hypercoagulability supression. METHODS: INR and plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2) were assessed in blood samples of 27 patients (7 <b>with</b> mechanical heart <b>valves</b> and 20 <b>with</b> biological heart <b>valves)</b> and 27 blood samples from healthy donors that were not taking any medication. RESULTS: Increased levels of F 1 + 2 were observed in blood samples of 5 patients <b>with</b> heart <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> taking warfarin. These findings reinforce the idea that even though patients may have INRs, within the therapeutic spectrum, they are not free from new thromboembolic events. CONCLUSION: Determination of the hypercoagulability marker F 1 + 2 might result in greater efficacy and safety for the use of oral anticoagulants, resulting in improved quality of life for patients...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGradient echo nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) imaging and transesophageal two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography are flow-sensitive techniques {{that have been used}} in the diagnosis and grading of valvular regurgitation. To define the diagnostic value of gradient echo NMR imaging in the detection of regurgitant flow in cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> and the differentiation of physiologic leakage flow from pathologic transvalvular or paravalvular leakage flow, 47 patients <b>with</b> 55 <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> were examined. Color Doppler transesophageal echocardiography was used for comparison. Surgical confirmation of findings was obtained in 11 patients <b>with</b> 13 <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Gradient echo NMR imaging showed reguraitant flow in 37 of 43 <b>valves</b> <b>with</b> a jet seen on transesophageal echocardiography and it detected physiologic leakage flow in 4 additional valves. There was 96 % agreement between the two methods in distinguishing between physiologic and pathologic leakage flow. The methods differed on jet origin of pathologic leakage flow in six prostheses. The degree of regurgitation was graded by both NMR imaging and transesophageal echocardiography, according to the area of the regurgitant jet visualized; gradings were identical for 75 % of <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Quantification of jet length and area showed a good correlation between the two methods (r = 0. 85 and r = 0. 91, respectively). Gradient echo NMR imaging is a useful noninvgsive technique for the detection, localization and estimation of regurgitant flow in cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses.</b> However, because transesophageal echocardiography is less time-consuming and less expensive, gradient echo NMR imaging is unlikely to displace transesophageal echocardiography and should be used only in the occasional patient who cannot be adequately imaged by echocardiography...|$|R
40|$|This is {{believed}} to be the 58 th reported case of Listeria monocytogenes infective endocarditis. Published reports worldwide were reviewed as to treatment, outcome, and prognostic features. There is controversy over whether all patients with this condition should have surgery. Moreover the best antibiotic treatment is not known, which accounts for the heterogeneity of regimens used. Listeria endocarditis has a high mortality rate (37 %). This was higher in men (41 % v 32 %) and in patients <b>with</b> <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> (41 % v 31 %), though neither observation reached statistical significance. There was no significant difference in mortality between surgical and non-surgical treatment, but untreated listeria endocarditis proved universally fatal. From the data, treatment with ampicillin is recommended, with resort to surgery in cases where the infection cannot be eradicated or where haemodynamic compromise has occurred...|$|R
40|$|Doppler echocardiographic {{evaluation}} of the prosthetic valve function is usually performed at rest, although this situation is not representative for patients' daily activities. Therefore, a symptom-limited Master 2 -step test was performed in 61 asymptomatic patients with normal left ventricular function. No adequate Doppler signals were obtained in 5 of 61 patients (8 %) within 60 second after termination of exercise. In patients <b>with</b> aortic <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> (n = 24), heart rate increased from 74 +/- 10 to 105 +/- 18 beats/min, the maximal instantaneous gradient from 44 (range 22 to 90) to 68 (range 28 to 165) mm Hg (r = 0. 89) and the mean gradient from 24 (range 12 to 50) to 39 (range 18 to 100) mm Hg (r = 0. 90). In 6 of 11 patients with a maximal flow velocity ratio between the left ventricular outflow tract and the aortic <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis</b> {{less than or equal}} to 0. 25, the mean gradient increased to a value greater than or equal to 50 mm Hg after exercise, whereas in patients with a ratio of greater than or equal to 0. 25, this never occurred. In patients <b>with</b> mitral <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> (n = 39), heart rate increased from 80 +/- 12 to 116 +/- 14 beats/min and mean gradient from 6 (range 3 to 10) to 14 (range 6 to 25) mm Hg (r = 0. 59). The correlation of the mean diastolic pressure gradient after exercise with pressure half-time was 0. 66. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure at rest and after exercise could be determined in 22 of 39 patients (56 %) and increased from 34 (range 20 to 70) to 57 (range 35 to 110) mm Hg. It is concluded that the response to exercise can, to a large extent, be inferred from Doppler parameters at rest, particularly in patients <b>with</b> aortic <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The clinical implication of the high gradients found in some asymptomatic patients in the present study should be elucidated by follow-up studie...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{evaluation}} of prosthetic valves {{is very difficult}} with two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography alone. Doppler and color flow imaging as well as transesophageal echocardiography are more reliable to detect prosthetic valve dysfunction. However, Doppler study sometimes tends to be misleading due to the load-depending characteristics of peak and mean pressure gradients. The peak-to-mean pressure decrease ratio is a load-independent measure, which was previously used for the detecting and grading of aortic valve stenosis. We assessed the usefulness of this method for the {{evaluation of}} aortic <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis</b> obstruction. Methods: One hundred fifty-four patients <b>with</b> aortic <b>valve</b> <b>prostheses</b> were included in this study. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic examinations were performed in all the patients. Peak velocity and velocity time integral of the aortic valve and left ventricular outflow tract, peak and mean aortic valve pressure gradients, peak-to-mean pressure gradient ratio, and time velocity integral (TVI) index were measured. Results: There was a significant relation between the TVI index (p value < 0. 001) and aortic prosthesis obstruction. A TVI index < 0. 2 had a sensitivity of 71 % and specificity of 100 % for the detection of aortic <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis</b> obstruction. However, no significant relation was found between the peak-to-mean pressure ratio and aortic <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis</b> obstruction (p value = 0. 09). Conclusion: Although the peak-to-mean pressure gradient (PG/MG) ratio is a simple, quick, and load-independent method which may be useful for the grading of aortic valve stenosis, it is poorly associated <b>with</b> aortic <b>valve</b> <b>prosthesis</b> obstruction.
