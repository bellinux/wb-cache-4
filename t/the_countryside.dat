5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning the ways of <b>the</b> <b>countryside,</b> and trying to help as best he could.

Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd â€” first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld.
