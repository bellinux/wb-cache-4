40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a class of}} new easy-to-fabricate ferrite–sphere-based waveguide Y-junction circulators for po-tentially low-cost millimeter-wave applications. A new three-dimensional modeling strategy using a self-inconsistent mixed-coordinates-based modal field-matching procedure is developed to characterize electrical performance of the proposed circulator. It is found that the circulating mechanism of the ferrite–sphere post is different from its full-height ferrite counterpart in that the new structure operates in a turnstile fashion with reso-nant characteristics, while the conventional device operates on a <b>transmission</b> <b>cavity</b> model. Extensive comparable studies between the new and conventional circulators are made {{to show that the}} electrical behaviors of the new structure are also distinct and radial power-density profiles are not stationary, {{as in the case of}} the full-height ferrite post circulator for different geo-metrical parameters. Results obtained by the analysis technique are compared with the available results for a full/partial-height ferrite circulator, showing an excellent agreement. Our calculated and measured results are also presented for W-band circu-lators with the proposed ferrite–sphere technique, indicating some interesting characteristics such as the frequency offset behavior of the isolation and reflection curves. In addition, radial power-density profiles are plotted inside and outside the ferrite sphere to illustrate its intrinsic circulating mechanism, as well as its difference, as compared to its full-height ferrite structure.

The aim of this work {{is to find out}} the conditions under which the best ENDOR signal can be obtained. A reflection cavity was used for all the results described, since the original <b>transmission</b> <b>cavity</b> developed faults. The samples used were crystals of magnesium oxide containing small amounts of cobalt impurity, present as Co++ ions. Co++ ions in MgO are known to be in surroundings of accurately cubic symmetry.

The basic spectrometer is similar in principle to that used by Feher 15 for electron paramagnetic resonance measurements except that the necessary additional equipment was added for double resonance. The dependence of ENDOR signal on amount or F. M., A. M. and v 2 - voltage was linear, as expected, with however evidence of departures from linearity {{in the case of the}} v 2 -graph. The variation of ENDOR signal with microwave power showed a fairly sharp maximum, at a power dependent on the concentration of Co++ ions in the sample.

Light scattering in normal eyes is reviewed and its influence on vision is discussed in some detail. It is noted that artists usually take intraocularly scattered light into account when depicting scenes, and a photographic method to achieve similar effects is demonstrated. A new method for in vivo light scattering measurements in living rabbit eyes is presented and preliminary results are reported. Using both theoretical models and clinical measurements the importance of increased light scattering for retinal image quality is studied in cataractous eyes. In the analysis an assumed neural contrast sensitivity function is used, derived from results from previous investigations. The analysis shows that visual acuity is quite insensitive even to substantial diffusive scattering provided that glare sources are not present {{in the field of}} view. Different glare test methods are studied. A versatile and simple apparatus for clinical glare testing is constructed. It utilizes a flickering glare source and is optimized for maximum accuracy. A diffractive, bifocal intraocular lens is studied through computer simulation, optical bench measurements, and visual acuity testing. This lens combines a traditional intraocular lens with a blazed Fresnel lens structure on one of its surfaces, supposedly allowing the patient good distant as well as near vision. It is found that a pupil displacement of the order of 1 mm considerably reduces the lens' resolution. A possible side-effect of new headlights for cars, which utilize ultraviolet radiation, is intraocular stray-light increase, a study of which is reported.

High [delta]n waveguide systems offer compact device sizes that enable highly dense integrated optics suitable for silicon microphotonics. Scattering loss {{due to the}} roughness at the core/cladding interfaces is identified as {{a major source of}} loss in a high M system. Using both experimental and theoretical approaches, the interdependence of scattering loss, waveguide dimension, and roughness is investigated. We developed a 3 dimensional model that successfully explains the scattering loss dependence on the waveguide dimension. Using this model, a loss contour map is constructed to better understand the scattering loss from interface roughness. This map provides an effective methodology to reduce roughness scattering, which we used to develop two fabrication technologies. Loss reduction from 32 dB/cm to 0. 8 dB/cm is achieved for [delta]n = 2. 0. This is the lowest loss ever achieved for a single-mode, high An system. PolySi/Si 02 waveguide systems are investigated due to the compatibility of multi-level processing. Our best PolySi/Si 02 waveguide shows additional 10 dB/cm loss, coming mainly from the top surface roughness due to grain boundary grooving. compared to a Si/Si 02 waveguide. Compact high An routing devices such as round bends, Y-splitters, and Multi-Mode Interference (MMI) splitters are fabricated and tested. We show that single-mode waveguide bends exhibit μm size bending with low loss and single-mode splitters show splitting with good uniformity. MMis show advantages over equivalent Y-splitter based structures in terms of size and loss. Our MMI design led to the fabrication of the smallest optical 1 x 16 fanout ever built.

40|$|Introduction The {{techniques}} of {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (E. P. R.) {{have been used to}} investigate the interaction of rare earth ions with (a) their crystalline environment, by measuring their effective g tensor, and, (b) each other, by observing their pair spectra. The experiments have been carried out in host lattices which, when magnetically concentrated, show interesting ordering properties. The Apparatus Measurements have been made at both X and K Band frequencies. The X Band spectrometer, originally constructed by Drs. A. H. Cooke and J. G. Park, was modified by the addition of a 115 Ke/s, and 50 c/s, phase sensitive detection system to give greater sensitivity. The K Band spectrometer was designed with a tuneable cylindrical H 011 <b>transmission</b> <b>cavity,</b> and incorporated an improved system of cryogenics. E. P. R. of rare earth ions in diamagnetic garnets The investigation of the properties or rare earth ions la diamagnetic garnets is of importance in connection with their profound influence on the ferrimagnetism of the iron garnets (for example see Dillon et al. 1960). The results of Ryan (1960) on the E. P. R. of rare earth lone in yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) and yttrium gallium garnet (YGG) have shown a considerable difference of their g tensor in the two lattices, particularly for the case of Kr 3 +. In order to investigate further this variation, in particular the dependence on the host ion in the rare earth site, measurements have been made of the g tensors in the lutetium garnets LAG and LGG. The results, obtained mainly at X Band and 4. 2 °K, are given in Table 1 together with that for Dy 3 + in YAG where no resonance had previously been observed. They indicate that the variation between lutetium and yttrium lattices it not so great as that between the aluminium and gallium lattices. Table 1.

However, in two cases they have been used successfully. Dysprosium aluminium garnet orders antiferromagnetically at 2. 5 °K (Ball et al. 1962). The highly anisotropic g values found for Dy 3 + in YAG suggest that the ions in DyAG, which has a similar lattice constant, may be treated to a first approximation a Ising spins with g z = 18. 0, g x = g y = 0. Assuming only dipolar interaction a possible ordered state for such ions has been proposed, and the model allows an explanation of the main features of the susceptibility curve to be made. As the g values of Yb 3 + show relatively little variation with lattice, it la possible to use those found in the gallium garnets with some confidence for a discussion of YbIG. From the theory of Wolf (1962), canting of the rare earth sublattices at 20 ° to the Fe 3 + sublattice has been predicted, and the order of magnitude of the spontaneous moment at 0 Â°K accounted for. Discussion of the garnet g values, cubic approximation In order to make theoretical predictions of the g values other magnetically concentrated gamete a thorough understanding of the resonance results In terms of the local crystal field is required. As a first approximation this crystal field has been considered to arise mainly from the nearest eight oxygen neighbours, which are arranged {{in the form of a}} distorted cube about the rare earth site. Using the general cubic field calculations of Lea et al. (1962) it has been found that the gross features of the g values can be accounted for on such a model. But only in the case of Yb 3 + can the values be quantitatively explained to within a few percent. The trends in the observed g values for Nd 3 + and Yb 3 + have been found to follow closely those in the structure parameters describing the positions of the oxygen neighbours. From the Kr 3 + results an estimate has been made of the ratio of the parameters describing the crystal field, A 0 4 /A 0 6, and this has been compared with other estimates. The extremely anisotropic g values found for Dy 3 + in YAG suggest a ground state wavefunction of nearly pure |J Z = 15 / 2 >. (Where Z is the [001] crystal direction). Point charge calculations of the garnet crystal field A general account of the method of derivation of the crystal field parameters from a point charge model of the crystal lattice has been written. In conjunction with D. K. Ray, the validity of an ionic model of the crystal lattice has been tested by considering the case of PrCl 3. This indicated the inadequacies of the model, even when accents on neighbouring lane were considered, but suggested that calculated ratios of parameters may be a good approximation to the true values. Attaining a model of point charges only, a computer has been used to calculate the contributions from (a) nearest neighbours only, and (b) all the ions in the lattice, to the crystal field parameters A m n at the rare earth site in YAG, YGG, LAG, LGG and YIG. The results of these calculations have been discussed. They indicate quite large distortions from a cubic field, and that the parameters for YGG are likely to lie closest to those in YIG. A possible set of crystal field parameters for Yb 3 + in YGG The case of Yb 3 + in the garnets is best suited to a more detailed theoretical analysis. As there are insufficient experimental data available to enable all the parameters to be found from experiment alone, ratios calculated on the point charge model have been used to reduce the number of parameters to be fitted. Treating first the J = 5 / 2 multiplet by itself, and then the whole 2 F term, a set of parameters which give a fair agreement with experiment have been found using a computer programme. The discrepancies, which should be small, indicate the inadequacies of the approximations made. The wavefunction found for the lowest J = 5 / 2 doublet is similar to that found from perturbation theory, and in general the fit to the data for the J = 5 / 2 state alone is better than that to the whole 2 F term. E. P. R. of rare earth ions in weakly paramagnetic garnets. Interaction shift It has been shown that the resonance from Kramers ions in a lattice containing host ions in a singlet ground state should be shifted but not broadened by th&e interactions. This shift may be expressed in the same form as the magnetic g tensor. The effective principal g values of Yb 3 + and Er 3 + have been measured at X Band frequencies and 4. 2 °K in such lattices, end the results are given in Table 2. The case of Yb 3 + in TmAG is believed to allow unambiguously such an interaction shift. Table 2.

(1957). E. P. R. from pairs of Gd 3 + ions in LaCl 3 In order to obtain information on the interactions of a pair of Gd 3 + ions in LaCl 3 which is of interest in connection with the properties of the isostructural ionic ferromagnet GdCl 3, their pair spectrum has been investigated at X and K Band frequencies and at 20 °K. In such a case of weak isotropic exchange interaction it is possible to obtain measurements of the exchange constants directly from the resonance line position. The nearest neighbour (n. n.) pair spectrum, with the magnetic field H parallel to the c axis, is symmetric about the central main line and extends over ~ ± 2, 600 gauss. It consists of four outer groups of lines, of overall width ~ 130 gauss and separation ~ 370 gauss, and three apparently well resolved inner lines. The spectrum due to next nearest neighbour (n. n. n. } pairs, with H along their symmetry axis, shows no such grouping. There are very many lines within 600 gauss of the central main line, due to more distant neighbours. The theoretical analysis of the spectrum has been undertaken from the start using a computer. It has not been possible to identify any of the pair transitions with certainty, and because of the large variation of line position with the values of all five parameters in the pair Hamiltonian the interpretation has proved difficult. However if the crystal field parameters for a member of the n. n. pair are assumed not to differ considerably from those of the isolated ions, the grouping of the outer n. n. lines can be explained. It indicates a value of J ox = 0. 011 (± 0. 005) cm - 1 and α = g 2 μ 2 B /r 3 nn = 0. 022 (± 0. 002) cm - 1 (where &#x 210 b; ox = J ox s (1) ⋅ s (2)). E. P. R. of rare earth atoms in YCl 3 and LuCl 3 The principal g values of rare earth lone in YCl 3 and LuCl 3 have been measured at X Band frequencies and 4. 2 °K. The results are listed in Table 4. The cases of Py 3 +, Er 3 +, and Yb 3 + show little relative variation with host lattice, and it should be possible to use the values directly for the interpretation of the bulk magnetic properties of the isostructural concentrated compounds. It has been shown that as a first approximation, the crystal field at the rare earth site may be considered to be sixfold cubic, as expected from the location of th nearest Cl - ions. Table 4.

30|$|The FSR is {{inversely}} proportional to {{the thickness of the}} resonator, and thus the FWHM in a nominal finesse. In addition, any change in refractive index translates into a wavelength shift from the cavity resonance according to Eq. (2). Thus, <b>transmission</b> in <b>cavities</b> with wider FWHM will have weaker dependence on refractive index changes. This is seen in the literature when higher temperature is needed to induce same phase shift in thinner slabs, through the TOE. Thus, any change in the refractive index due to TOE and PDE is supposed to have weaker effect in thinner slabs. However, our simulation results (see Fig.  3) show that the relative change in phase in slabs with different thicknesses is the same.|$|R

The coherent {{interaction between the}} distant ensembles is directly detected in the <b>cavity</b> <b>transmission</b> spectrum by observing bright and dark collective multiensemble states and an increase of the coupling strength to the cavity mode. Additionally, in the dispersive limit we show transverse ensemble-ensemble coupling via virtual photons. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{probabilistic}} scheme {{to prepare a}} maximally entangled state between a pair of two-level atoms inside a leaking cavity, without requiring precise time-controlling of the system evolution and initial atomic state. We show that the steady state of this dissipative system {{is a mixture of}} two parts: either the atoms being in their ground state or in a maximally entangled one. Then, by applying a weak probe field on the cavity mode we are able to distinguish those states without disturbing the atomic system, i. e., performing a quantum non-demolition measurement via the <b>cavity</b> <b>transmission.</b> In this scheme, one has nonzero <b>cavity</b> <b>transmission</b> only when the atomic system is in an entangled state so that a single click in the detector is enough to ensure that the atoms are in an maximally entangled state. Our scheme relies on an interference effect as it happens in electromagnetically induced transparency phenomenon so that it works out even in the limit of decay rate of the cavity mode much stronger than the atom-field coupling...|$|R
50|$|The transmon {{achieves}} its reduced {{sensitivity to}} charge noise by significantly increasing {{the ratio of}} the Josephson energy to the charging energy. This is accomplished {{through the use of a}} large shunting capacitor. The result is energy level spacings that are approximately independent of offset charge. Planar on-chip transmon qubits have T1 coherence times ~ 30 μs to 40 μs. By replacing the superconducting <b>transmission</b> line <b>cavity</b> with a three-dimensional superconducting cavity, recent work on transmon qubits has shown significantly improved T1 times, as long as 95 μs. These results demonstrate that previous T1 times were not limited by Josephson junction losses. Understanding the fundamental limits on the coherence time in superconducting qubits such as the transmon is an active area of research.|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} investigate charge transport through electronic {{bands of}} a mesoscopic one-dimensional system, where inter-band transitions are coupled to a confined cavity mode, initially prepared {{close to its}} vacuum. This coupling leads to light-matter hybridization where the dressed fermionic bands interact via absorption and emission of dressed cavity-photons. Using a self-consistent non-equilibrium Green's function method, we compute electronic <b>transmissions</b> and <b>cavity</b> photon spectra and demonstrate how light-matter coupling can lead to an enhancement of charge conductivity in the steady-state. We find that depending on cavity loss rate, electronic bandwidth, and coupling strength, the dynamics involves either an individual or a collective response of Bloch states, and explain how this affects the current enhancement. We show that the charge conductivity enhancement can reach orders of magnitudes under experimentally relevant conditions...|$|R
40|$|In the cavity-QED architecture, photon number {{fluctuations}} from residual cavity photons cause qubit dephasing {{due to the}} AC Stark effect. These unwanted photons {{originate from}} a variety of sources, such as thermal radiation, leftover measurement photons, and crosstalk. Using a capacitively-shunted flux qubit coupled to a <b>transmission</b> line <b>cavity,</b> we demonstrate a method that identifies and distinguishes coherent and thermal photons based on noise-spectral reconstruction from time-domain spin-locking relaxometry. Using these measurements, we attribute the limiting dephasing source in our system to thermal photons, rather than coherent photons. By improving the cryogenic attenuation on lines leading to the cavity, we successfully suppress residual thermal photons and achieve $T_ 1 $-limited spin-echo decay time. The spin-locking noise spectroscopy technique can readily be applied to other qubit modalities for identifying general asymmetric non-classical noise spectra...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStatistical modal energy {{distribution}} analysis (SmEdA) extends classical statistical energy analysis (SEA) to the mid frequency range by establishing power balance equations between modes in different subsystems. This circumvents the SEA requirement of modal energy equipartition and enables applying SmEdA to {{the cases of}} low modal overlap, locally excited subsystems {{and to deal with}} complex heterogeneous subsystems as well. Yet, widening the range of application of SEA is done at a price with large models because the number of modes per subsystem can become considerable when the frequency increases. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to have at one's disposal tools for a quick identification and ranking of the resonant and non-resonant paths involved in modal energy transmission between subsystems. It will be shown that previously developed graph theory algorithms for transmission path analysis (TPA) in SEA can be adapted to SmEdA and prove useful for that purpose. The case of airborne <b>transmission</b> between two <b>cavities</b> separated apart by homogeneous and ribbed plates will be first addressed to illustrate the potential of the graph approach. A more complex case representing <b>transmission</b> between non-contiguous <b>cavities</b> in a shipbuilding structure will be also presented...|$|R
