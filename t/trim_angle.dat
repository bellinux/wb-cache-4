40|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of thin, flat-plate {{wings of}} various planforms (rectangular, elliptical and Zimmerman) {{have been studied}} in free-to-roll experiments in a wind tunnel. Non-zero <b>trim</b> <b>angles</b> at low angles of attack, self-induced roll oscillations with increasing angle of attack and even autorotation in some cases were observed. The rectangular wings with round leading-edge had non-zero <b>trim</b> <b>angles</b> at low incidences due to the asymmetric development of the three-dimensional separation bubble at these low Reynolds numbers. With increasing angle of attack, the bubble increases in length and once reattachment is lost, large amplitude roll oscillations develop. The Strouhal number of the roll oscillations is {{of the order of}} 10 (- 2), which is in the same range as those expected for small aircraft experiencing atmospheric gusts. Velocity measurements revealed that variations in the strength of the vortices drove the rolling motion.

The ideal <b>trim</b> <b>angle</b> is the one in which the boat rides level, with most of the hull on the surface instead of plowing through the water.If the motor is trimmed out too far, the bow will ride too high in the water. With too little trim, the bow rides too low. The optimal trim setting will vary depending on many factors including speed, hull design, weight and balance, and conditions on the water (wind and waves). Many large outboards are equipped with power trim, an electric motor on the mounting bracket, with a switch at the helm that enables the operator to adjust the <b>trim</b> <b>angle</b> on the fly. In this case, the motor should be trimmed fully in to start, and trimmed out (with an eye on the tachometer) as the boat gains momentum, until it reaches the point just before ventilation begins or further trim adjustment results in an RPM increase with no increase in speed.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{friction}} drag of the hulls of high-speed craft, seaplanes, and hydrofoil boats, steps {{are made on}} their undersurfaces. The effect is achieved due {{to the formation of}} a gas cavity aft of the step, which reduces the wetted area. The wetted area can also be reduced by striking a compromise between the cavity size and the wetted lengths of the planning surfaces by changing the center-of-mass position of the planning boat and the geometry of the stepped hull. The proper choice of the shape of the stepped bottom and the design parameters may also offer other useful effects, for example, the effect of surface wave energy regeneration on the system of planing surfaces. This paper presents a method of solution of the twodimensional mathematical problem on the cavity planing of the stepped hull of a high-speed craft, which allows one to predict and quantify the abovementioned effects. The key feature of the proposed approach is that the problem is solved in natural physical formulation. All the required characteristics the cavity shape and length, the free boundary shape, the wetted lengths of the planing surfaces, and the <b>trim</b> <b>angles</b> are determined from a specified cavitation number, Froude number, and center-of-mass position. The Froude number is determined from the displacement. When, in addition, the center-of-mass position is specified, additional unknowns appear in the problem the wetted lengths and the <b>trim</b> <b>angles.</b> In this case, to the singular integral equation of planing must be added the force and the moment balance equations. As a result, a logically closed system of integral equations is obtained. However, the system features parametric nonlinearity {{in the form of the}} unknown limits of integration the cavity length and the wetted lengths. The nonlinear problem is solved by sequential minimization of the residual of the system using nonlinear-programming techniques. The calculations have shown that the wave amplitude in the wake of the planing boat depends of the cavitation number and the design factors of the step and the planing boat. At negative cavitation numbers, an additional lift develops due to artificial air injection into the cavity under the bottom, which changes the draft and the <b>trim</b> <b>angles.</b> This lowers the wave amplitude in the wake. The calculated data suggest that the wake amplitude can be minimized by optimizing the cavitation number and the design and setting angles of the steps...|$|R
40|$|As the Laser Olympic dinghy {{is one of}} {{the highest}} level sail racing classes in the world, there is an {{interest}} in obtaining scientific facts around the tons of experience that already exist. For this reason, a numerical investigation was carried out to find the optimum heel and <b>trim</b> <b>angles</b> for upwind sailing. Flat water was assumed. Systematic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Simulations were carried out to find the optimum trim versus heel at speeds of two, three, four and five knots. During these computations the leeway was fixed for each speed. The leeway angles were estimated using the resistance results obtained from the tank tests and foil theory. A special purpose VPP was developed accepting CFD results at the given speeds as input for the hydrodynamic forces, while the aerodynamic forces were obtained using Hazen’s empirical model. The output from the program was the true wind speed required to achieve the target speed at 45 degrees true wind angle. By systematic variation of the sailor’s position the optimum heel (and the corresponding trim) was obtained at the minimum required wind speed. The reason for developing this unconventional VPP was to avoid interpolation between the speeds computed by CFD. Since the resistance/speed relation is very non-linear interpolation would have been too approximate for finding the rather flat heel/trim optima. The computational techniques and the optimum heel and <b>trim</b> <b>angles</b> of the dinghy will be reported in this thesis.
