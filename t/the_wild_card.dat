5|$|MLB {{expanded}} its postseason {{to include the}} League Championship Series (LCS) in 1969, the League Division Series (LDS) in 1995, and <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> round in 2012. <b>The</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> round is a one-game playoff, the LDS follows a best-of-five playoff format, and the LCS and World Series follow a best-of-seven playoff format. The most recent World Series champions are the Chicago Cubs, who won in the 2016 World Series. Jon Lester is the most recent recipient of the Babe Ruth Award.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2012 season, MLB altered its rules to double the number of wild card teams {{admitted}} into the playoffs to two per league. The playoff expansion resulted in the addition of annual one-game playoffs between <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> teams in each league.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{finished}} the 1999 season tied with the Cincinnati Reds for the National League wild card playoff berth. In a one-game tie-breaker, the Mets defeated the Reds 5–0 to win <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the First Round, {{the eight}} teams are {{split into two}} {{separate}} brackets by division. Each bracket consists {{of the top three}} divisional qualifiers and one of <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b> <b>The</b> lower seeded <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> plays against <b>the</b> division winner with the best record while <b>the</b> other <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> plays against <b>the</b> other division winner, and both <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> are de facto #4 seeds. The other two series match the second and third place teams from the divisions.|$|R
5|$|If {{there is}} a tie for the final wild card position, the non-winner that {{advances}} {{will be based on}} the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> {{round of}} the playoffs, the Ravens faced the {{division}} rival Steelers.

In the divisional round, the Raven's lost 31-35 to the eventual Super Bowl XLIX champions, the New England Patriots.|$|E
5|$|The Red Sox won the {{division}} by two games, forcing the Yankees into <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card.</b> This {{marked the first}} time both the Red Sox and Yankees made the playoffs since 2009.

5|$|The Yankees {{returned}} to the playoffs the following season, as <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>card.</b> They lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 ALCS; which included an 8-0 shutout in Yankee Stadium by former Phillie ace Cliff Lee; it was Lee's seventh straight postseason win which included three victories against the Yankees (two as a Phillie in the 2009 World Series, and in 2010 during the ALCS).|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). <b>The</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card,</b> which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it does take away <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card,</b> individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.|$|E

5|$|Until the 2014 season, every season's postseason had {{featured}} {{one or both}} of the AL East rivals {{since the}} inception of <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> format and the resultant additional Division Series; they have faced each other in the AL Championship Series three times. The Yankees won twice, in 1999 and 2003; while the Red Sox won in 2004. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won).|$|E
5|$|In Major League Baseball the {{two teams}} with {{the best record in}} each league who do not win a {{division}} play in <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game. A number of teams were in competition for these Wild Card spots, along with their divisional competition. The Rangers spent over 80 days leading the American League West and shared the lead as late as September 4. The Rays spent only a few days leading the American League East, but held a share of the lead as late as August 24. The Cleveland Indians did not lead the American League Central after July 2 but remained close throughout the season and ultimately finished just a single game back of the Central champion Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|In the 2014–15 season, the Carolina Panthers won the NFC South with a 7–8–1 record. By week 16, no team in that {{division}} {{could finish}} {{with more than}} seven wins.

50|$|Eight {{teams in}} each conference {{qualify for the}} playoffs. In the playoff series format instituted in 2014, the first, second, and third place team {{in each of the}} four {{divisions}} qualify for the playoffs automatically. Two additional teams from each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, also qualify for the playoffs by having the highest point totals out of the remaining teams in the conference. These teams are referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards.</b> Since there is no attention paid to divisional alignment with <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cards,</b> it is possible for a single division to produce both <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Round, the sixth-seeded Jets {{beat the}} AFC South {{champion}} and third-seeded Colts 17–16 on January 8, 2011, at the Colts' home field, Lucas Oil Stadium, {{to qualify for}} the Divisional Playoffs. The following week, on January 16, they defeated the AFC East champion and first-seeded Patriots 28–21, ending New England's eight-game winning streak. The victory made the Jets the first team to win back-to-back road playoff games in consecutive seasons, and qualified them to advance to the AFC Championship Game for the second consecutive season, where they lost {{on the road to the}} AFC North champion Pittsburgh Steelers 24–19.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> {{game against}} Denver, Manning passed for 458yards and fourtouchdowns.

It was Manning's seventh consecutive loss to the Patriots in Foxborough and the Colts' three points were their lowest single game point total since their opening game of the 2003 season. Manning was named a Pro Bowl starter; in the Pro Bowl, he threw three touchdowns in a 38–27 victory and was named the game's MVP. Manning was also a unanimous first-team All-Pro selection.|$|E
5|$|On October 5 at Citi Field, in a 3-0 {{win over}} the {{defending}} National League Champion New York Mets in the NL Wild Card Game, Bumgarner pitched his third career postseason complete game four-hit shutout {{to give him the}} most career complete game shutouts in the history of <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Era with two. In other words, he set the Major League record for most career complete game shutout wins in winner-take-all-games, the first and only pitcher to have more than one. Bumgarner's third career postseason shutout ties him for second all-time behind Christy Mathewson's four. He also tied Tom Glavine's Major League record with six career scoreless postseason starts and lowered his Major League career postseason road record to a microscopic 0.50 ERA.|$|E

5|$|Pittsburgh {{hosted the}} San Diego Chargers at Heinz Field {{due to the}} Chargers' {{overtime}} victory over the Indianapolis Colts during <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> round. The Chargers scored on the game's first drive with a 41-yard pass from Philip Rivers to Vincent Jackson for a touchdown. After the Steelers defense stopped the Chargers on their next drive, Pittsburgh's Santonio Holmes returned a punt 67yards {{to tie the game}} at seven. With two minutes remaining in the first half Nate Kaeding converted a 42-yard field goal to reclaim the lead for the Chargers. Pittsburgh's offense responded with a 7play, 66yard drive in 1:33 to take their first lead of the game after a 3-yard touchdown run from Willie Parker.|$|E

Mitsuru asks him to join SEES and he is later elected the team's leader in combat. The protagonist is unique among his cohorts in that he has <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> ability which enables him to wield multiple Personas and switch between them during battle. Over the course of the game, he also gains Messiah of the Judgement Arcana and Orpheus Telos of the Fool Arcana in Persona 3 FES. With the power of <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> he has access to over 150 different Personas. He is also the only character with access to the Velvet Room, in which the player is able to fuse together multiple Personas together to create a new and more powerful one. Over the course of the game, the player is challenged to manage the protagonist's day-to-day schedule as he attends school, takes part in extracurricular activities, and spends time with classmates and other characters. Igor, the proprietor of the Velvet Room, encourages the protagonist to form Social Links with people, as they will determine his potential in combat. Social Links with characters in-game are represented by one of the Major Arcana and grants various bonuses during Persona fusion, increasing the player's proficiency in battle.|$|E
