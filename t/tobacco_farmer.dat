500|$|Despite the {{warnings}} of their intelligence officers, the security chiefs were caught completely by surprise. The RLI headquarters {{and all three}} Commandos were deployed in the Zambezi valley on routine border-control duty, and Support Group was at Cranborne Barracks. A troop of Support Group men under Second Lieutenant Ian Buttenshaw was despatched to Centenary the next day along with a troop of SAS, led by Bert Sachse. In their preliminary sweep around Altena Farm they discovered a land mine planted in the road, but no insurgents. While the security forces were patrolling around Altena, Nhongo's men approached Whistlefield Farm in the late evening of 22 December and, as at Altena, attacked the farm house with rifle fire, grenades and an RPG-7 rocket launcher, which was aimed into the bedroom in which de Borchgrave was sleeping. The rocket hit the window frame and lightly wounded the <b>tobacco</b> <b>farmer</b> and his nine-year-old daughter Anne. The ZANLA cadres then retreated and hid themselves. News of the second attack reached Buttenshaw and Sachse around midnight, and they deployed immediately, but having discovered a mine near Altena they disembarked from the vehicles [...] from Whistlefield and made the final approach on foot. Anne was evacuated by helicopter as the RLI and SAS men secured the area for the night.|$|E

Data was collected in Sumenep and Pamekasan regencies, as the centre production of Madurese tobacco, during August - September 2009 using survey method. The results showed, that the funding program to the <b>tobacco</b> <b>farmers</b> group in Sumenep regency in 2009 was aimed for the arid and hilly land. This program was released as equipment assistance, capital assistance and guidance to the <b>tobacco</b> <b>farmers</b> group, while in Pamekasan regency, such program was implemented for organizing tobacco nursery. Problem faced in the implementation of this funding program in Sumenep and Pamekasan regencies was too late in disbursing of the funds. In Sumenep regency, this problem caused the late of the coming of pump water aid, whereas the tobacco plants needed to be watered. In Pamekasan regency, too late in disbursing of the funds resulted the implementation of the program such as preparation of the seed was delayed. Problem solving alternatives of the late in disbursing funds aid in the two regencies were collecting the capital from the group members or by borrowing the capital from the another fundsources.

Green tobacco sickness (GTS) {{is known as a}} disease of acute nicotine intoxication among <b>tobacco</b> <b>farmers.</b> Until now, GTS has been recognized globally as a disease that results from nicotine absorption through the skin. However, we assumed that GTS might also result from nicotine inhalation as well as absorption. We aimed to measure the airborne nicotine concentrations in various work environments of Korean <b>tobacco</b> <b>farmers.</b> MethodsWe measured the nicotine concentrations in the tobacco fields, private curing barns, and joint curing barns of farmers from July to October 2010. All sampling and analyses of airborne nicotine were conducted according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health manual of analytic methods. ResultsThe airborne nicotine concentrations (geometric mean [geometric standard deviation]) in the tobacco field were 83. 4 mg/m 3 (1. 2) in the upper region and 93. 3 mg/m 3 (1. 2) in the lower region. In addition, the nicotine concentration by personal sampling was 150. 1 mg/m 3. Similarly, the nicotine concentrations in the private curing barn, workers in curing barns, the front yard of the curing barn, and in the joint curing barn were 323. 7 mg/m 3 (2. 0), 121. 0 mg/m 3 (1. 5), 73. 7 mg/m 3 (1. 7), and 610. 3 mg/m 3 (1. 0), respectively.
