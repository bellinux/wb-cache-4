5|$|Doomsday is a 2008 {{science fiction}} action horror film written and {{directed}} by Neil Marshall. The film takes place in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>in</b> Scotland, which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in London, political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including Mad Max, Escape from New York and 28 Days Later.|$|E
5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>in</b> collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E

Toulouse metropolis is presented as an attractive ecosystem, able to build the future and highlights its visibility internationally. The Air-Cobot demonstrator was chosen to illustrate the robotics research of this metropolis. Located at Laboratoire d'analyse et d'architecture des systèmes during development, researchers or engineers working on the project regularly present a demonstration to visitors (external researchers, industrial partners, or students); it was also demonstrated {{to the general public}} during the 2015 Feast of Science.

He was instrumental in the founding of Golders Green Crematorium and designed the gardens there, which replaced the traditional Victorian mourning graveyard with open lawn, flowerbeds, and woodland gardens.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} Mortal Kombat II, {{along with the}} first Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat 3 (including its expansions), were later retold in the 2011 {{fighting}} game Mortal Kombat, which was as an effective reboot of the series. In it, Raiden uses time travel to revisit the tournaments from the original games in the series in order to change <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of Armageddon. The ladder/arcade mode of this game can follow the same order of bosses as in MKII (with Shang Tsung, Kintaro and Shao Kahn as the final three opponents, although Goro will often be the ninth opponent instead of Kintaro) and its controls and Fatality system are most reminiscent of MKII. Classic costumes from MKII were also brought back as alternate outfits for female ninja characters in the PlayStation Vita version.|$|E

5|$|Vasey slowly recovered. In October 1944, Blamey {{set up a}} Post-War Army Planning Committee {{headed by}} Vasey {{to report on the}} future of the Royal Military College and the {{training}} and education of Staff Corps officers. Vasey called for a greatly expanded regular army of 20,000 men. His report recommended that the course at Duntroon be deepened professionally and academically to the level of an undergraduate university degree. The report's recommendations were not accepted or welcomed by the government but pointed the way to <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>in</b> which the Army would become increasingly professional. In February 1945, Frank Forde pressed for Vasey to be given another active command. Blamey, who still had doubts about Vasey's physical fitness despite Vasey being given an A by an Army medical board, reluctantly appointed him to command the 6th Division, then in action in the Aitape-Wewak campaign.|$|E
