5|$|After the storm, the Nicaraguan {{government}} {{declared a}} state of disaster in the North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions, as well as Tisma in the Masaya Department. The government sheltered those made homeless in Bluefields along the Atlantic coast. Relief efforts were coordinated by the Comité Nacional de Emergencia to provide aid to the affected storm victims. Officials sent medical crews to the hardest hit areas. This was due to an increased potential for the spread of water-born diseases, the result of ongoing floods and damaged sanitation facilities. Meanwhile, planes flew overhead <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of damage. On August18, the government requested international assistance to cope from the disaster. In response, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UNDP sent US$70,000 in emergency aid, some of which to be used for fuel to transport medicine and food. The World Food Programme sent 72tons of food and milk. The countries of Japan and the United States were the first to respond; the former provided $100,000, and the latter sent a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to distribute food. Switzerland later sent US$81,000 as a cash donation, while the European Economic Community sent US$227,000 worth of food and medicine.

25|$|To {{definitively}} diagnose ovarian cancer, {{a surgical}} procedure {{to inspect the}} abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure (laparotomy, incision through the abdominal wall) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). During this procedure, suspicious tissue is removed and sent for microscopic analysis. Usually, this includes a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous cells. If cancer is found, this procedure {{can also be used}} <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of its spread (which is a form of tumor staging).|$|E
