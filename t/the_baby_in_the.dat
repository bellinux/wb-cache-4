5|$|The police, who suspect {{an illegal}} abortion, find {{the remains of}} <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden furnace. Wayne quickly confesses to {{destroying}} the evidence. He asserts {{that his wife had}} aborted the child while in a trance-like state and attempts to convince her of this. Laura takes the blame for the abortion and goes to jail. While visiting Laura in her cell, Wayne attempts to steal her soul, but the EMT is able to save her life, much to Wayne's surprise. Meanwhile, Wayne has another wife, Betsy Monroe, who is also pregnant.|$|E
25|$|Wong shot {{footage of}} the bombed-out South Station with his Eyemo {{newsreel}} camera, and he took several still photographs with his Leica. The famous still image, taken from the Leica, is not often referred to by nameâ€”rather, its visual elements are described. It has also been called Motherless Chinese Baby, Chinese Baby, and <b>The</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shanghai Railroad Station. The photograph was denounced by Japanese nationalists who {{argued that it was}} staged.|$|E

5000|$|According to news reports, {{a mother}} who {{purchased}} the game for her child reported that <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game say something that sounds like [...] "Islam is the light" [...] under certain circumstances. <b>The</b> <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game generally {{do not have any}} spoken dialog. However, according to a representative from the game's publisher, Crave Entertainment, the sound bit came from [...] "a recording of a 5-month-old baby babbling non-intelligible phrases." [...] He pointed out that [...] "the baby being recorded was too young to pronounce these words let alone a whole grammatically correct phrase." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Boyd, Harrison's {{mother was}} {{particularly}} supportive: [...] "All she wanted {{for her children}} is {{that they should be}} happy, and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music." [...] An enthusiastic music fan, she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows. While pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India. Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, [...] "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> womb." ...|$|E
500|$|Several guest {{stars who}} had {{appeared}} in [...] "Demons" [...] continued in their roles in [...] "Terra Prime"; Harry Groener, Peter Mensah, Adam Clark along with Weller and Watts. A reference to Weller's former show Odyssey 5 {{is included in the}} episode, when his character is diagnosed with [...] "Taggart's Syndrome", where Taggart was the name of his character on Odyssey 5. They were joined in this episode by several actors playing recurring roles, including Gary Graham who had played Ambassador Soval since the series pilot and Derek Magyar and Eric Pierpoint, who had played Commander Kelby and Harris respectively earlier in the season in [...] "". Joel Swetow also appeared in [...] "Terra Prime" [...] as an Andorian Ambassador, who had previously appeared in the [...] of [...] and [...] episode [...] "" [...] as well as performing voice roles for several Star Trek video games. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode was played by a pair of twins, whilst the pointed Vulcan ears were applied to the child in post production.|$|E
500|$|As {{was common}} with Pixar features, the {{production}} became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, Toy Story 2, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying. While {{hard work and}} long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running flat-out on Toy Story 2 for month after month began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators, and repetitive strain injuries for others. Catmull would later disclose that [...] "a full third of the staff" [...] ended up with some form of RSI {{by the time the}} film was finished. Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees' self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees. In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and, in a mental haze, forgot <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back seat of his car in the parking lot. [...] "Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard," [...] wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.|$|E

2500|$|Vasa praevia {{occurs in}} about 0.6 per 1000 pregnancies.

[...] Txamsem, who could transform into anything, and often took the form of a human or bird, turned himself into a pine needle and was consumed by the daughter of the Chief who guarded daylight. [...] She then gave birth to him as a baby and the baby cried incessantly to play with daylight. [...] As soon as it was given to <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a playful ball, he transformed back into Raven and flew away with it. [...] He traveled back up the Nass River with daylight and released it; immediately lighting up the river and allowing it to spread all over the world.|$|E
2500|$|In early November 2012, Israeli activists {{reported}} that several journalists with cameras followed a Palestinian girl as she repeatedly tried without success {{to provoke a}} violent reaction from Israeli soldiers. On November 18, Alarab Net, an Arab news site, released a photo of three bloodied children and their mother with the caption [...] "martyred massacred family in Gaza". This image {{turned out to be}} of Syrian children. Pro-Palestinian activists published a photograph on Twitter of an injured infant held by a rescue worker, writing [...] "even this young injured Palestinian child doesn't seem surprised or scared, used to Israeli terrorism." [...] <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> picture was quickly identified as an Israeli injured in a Hamas rocket attack, which also killed her mother. The Washington Post reported at the time on the tendency of both sides in the conflict to politicize photos of injured and dead children.|$|E
2500|$|Other writers mocked the complainers as grumblers depriving the [...] "juvenile community" [...] of {{a healthy}} and {{harmless}} pastime that had been practised {{for hundreds of years}} [...] "without any apparent inconvenience to the public at large." [...] The passion for passing laws was ridiculed: [...] "Enact, say our modern philosophers, enact. Pass statute after statute. Regulate with exquisite minuteness the cries of <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cradle, the laughter of the hoop-trundling boy, the murmurrings of the toothless old man." [...] In the 1860s, the anti-trundling campaign was taken up by Charles Babbage, who blamed the boys for driving iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg. Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for [...] "commencing a crusade against the popular game of tip-cat and the trundling of hoops." ...|$|E
