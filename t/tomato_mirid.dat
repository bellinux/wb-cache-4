40|$|Tuta absoluta Meyrick quickly {{developed}} into a significant pest of tomatoes worldwide. While the mirid bugs Macrolophus basicornis (Stal), Engytatus varians (Distant) and Campyloneuropsis infumatus (Carvalho) prey on this tomato borer, their biology have not been well characterized. Using a mixture of T. absoluta eggs and larvae as food on <b>tomato,</b> <b>mirid</b> life histories were studied. Nymphs and adults successfully used T. absoluta as prey, although significant differences in biology of the species were observed. Campyloneuropsis infumatus and M. basicornis were quickest and slowest to become adult at 16 and 19 days, respectively. Nymphal survival was high and varied from 70 to 75 %. Female biased sex ratios were observed for C. infumatus (0. 80) and M. basicornis (0. 71), but not for E. varians (0. 56). Intrinsic rates of increase for C. infumatus, E. varians and M. basicornis were 0. 11, 0. 10 and 0. 11 respectively. Our results indicate rapid development and population increase of these three mirids, making them interesting candidates for biological control of T. absoluta on tomato. </p...|$|E
40|$|Macrolophus caliginosus (Wagner) is {{currently}} commercialized in Europe {{for the control}} of whiteflies in <b>tomato</b> greenhouses. Another <b>mirid</b> predator, Dicyphus tamaninii Wagner, spontaneously colonizes Mediterranean greenhouses. The impact {{of the presence of}} D. tamaninii on predation of the greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood) by M. caliginosus was investigated in the laboratory on tomato plants during four days. No significant interspecific competition was recorded between mirid nymphs and no significant intraguild predation was observed. Higher level of predation of the whitefly populations was achieved by D. tamaninii alone, than by M. caliginosus alone. Predation by the heterospecific combination (M. caliginosus+ D. tamaninii) was similar to the results obtained by conspecific treatments. No intraspecific competition was recorded with D. tamaninii, nor withM. caliginosus. Finally, the distribution of whitefly predation on the plant by the mirids changed according to the predator treatment. The heterospecific combination of both mirids had a higher predation rate on lower leaves of the plant than monospecific combinations. Overall, the presence of D. tamaninii did not disrupt whitefly predation by M. caliginosus and coul...|$|R
40|$|Enhancing {{insect pest}} control by their natural enemies is {{considered}} as a promising crop protection strategy in organic vegetable production systems. In Mediterranean areas, native natural enemies such as mirid bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae) settle spontaneously in protected vegetable crops and {{can play an important}} rolefor pest regulation, which remains however very heterogeneous from field to field and hardly predictable. The present study is part of the project REGABRI, which aims at identifying key factors of colonization of organic and conventional protected <b>tomato</b> crops by <b>mirid</b> bugs in Roussillon area. A first survey in 2010 - 2011 on 34 crops showed that mirids abundances in crops vary according to management practices and landscape features in the crops surroundings (100 m to 200 m). A second survey in 2012 made it possible to identify uncultivated or cultivated elements in the crops surroundings, that might enhance (source habitats) or on the contrary reduce (dilution and sink effects) tomato crops colonization by mirids. These results showed that a systemic approach, considering the field, the cropping systems as well as the landscape scale, is needed to optimize conservation biological control on protected vegetable systems...|$|R
