5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> in Washington {{at the behest of the}} State Department requiring all documents relating to <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> {{determined}} {{that it had been}} impossible for any passenger aboard the Hughes Airwest DC-9 to survive the collision, disintegration, and crash of the aircraft. Though a severe ground fire ravaged both crash sites, <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> {{determined that}} all of the victims had died in the crash itself.|$|E
5|$|Due to the accident, the FAA put the Teterboro {{controller}} and {{his supervisor}} on leave and made {{comments about the}} phone call, which was deemed improper behavior. However, <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> rebuked the FAA for doing so, stating that only <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> {{has the authority to}} determine the controller's contribution to the incident.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> {{released}} several {{reports on}} January 17, 2007, including transcripts of the CVR and an engineering report.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these recommendations, <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> also recommended that the Department of Defense restrict high-speed, low-altitude aircraft operation in civilian air corridors, consider collision avoidance technologies on military aircraft, and make military pilots aware of the FAA's radar advisory service.|$|E
5|$|Much {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the role of human error in the collision; once the engineer had forgotten (or missed) the approach signal there was no automatic system to prevent the collision. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> noted that had a positive train control system been in place on the Metropolitan Subdivision the collision would have been less likely: the system would have detected MARC #286's unauthorized speed and stopped the train. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> also strongly criticized CSX and the Federal Transit Administration for the removal of a signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction as part of capacity improvements on the Metropolitan Subdivision. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> argued that having this signal after Kensington would have reduced the likelihood of the sort of human error which caused the crash, and in the NTSB's view CSX and the FTA did not properly assess the effects of removing the signal.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB's</b> {{final report}} was issued on March 21, 2002, {{after a two-year}} investigation, and {{concluded}} that the crash was a suicide by pilot.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB's</b> final {{conclusion}} was [...] "The pilot's intentional flight into known adverse weather, continued flight into instrument meteorological conditions, and improper altitude.

5|$|On 16 November 2010, {{five months}} after the Court of Inquiry was constituted, it {{submitted}} its report with input from <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> and Boeing, and stated that pilot error was the cause of the accident since the flight path was incorrect.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board {{released}} a report regarding the incident. The report discussed several aspects of the collision, including locations of origin of the aircraft, planned destination, and air traffic control communications. In addition, the report discussed how one of the controllers at Teterboro Airport was on a phone call and did not warn the airplane pilot of the potential conflict. The National Air Traffic Controller's Union (NATCA) then issued their own press release disputing some of the phrasing in the NTSB's report. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> then retracted some of its statements regarding the controller's part in the crash, saying that the controller could not have warned the plane about the tour helicopter because the tour helicopter {{was not on the}} controller's radar. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> also removed NATCA as a party to the investigation as a result of NATCA's press release, as parties to NTSB investigations agree to let <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> control publicity during the investigation. NATCA may still submit information to the board regarding the accident, but they will not hold a seat on the investigation board.|$|E
5|$|Prior to <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> issuing {{its report}} MARC had taken steps in that direction, {{including}} {{the installation of}} more emergency windows, the improvement of door release mechanisms, and improved emergency signage.|$|E

As part of her duties in administration, Drake consults with {{aviation}} officials in various countries {{in an effort to}} improve their safety records. She has investigated over 300 crashes and shares her expertise as a means of helping reduce mechanical and environmental factors involved in aircraft accidents.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> {{added that}} {{the design of the}} Embraer's {{avionics}} is such that the non-functioning of the TCAS that apparently occurred is shown by a small static white text message, which may not be noticeable by the flight crew. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> noted:Using only static text messages to indicate a loss of collision avoidance system functionality is not a reliable means to capture pilots' attention because these visual warnings can be easily overlooked if their attention is directed elsewhere in the flight environment.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> {{concluded}} that the crash occurred due to the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff due to {{the speed of the}} aircraft, and that a runway overrun was unavoidable at the 707's speed. The disabled DC-9, a Delta Air Lines flight which had reported that it had cleared the runway when in fact it had not, was a contributing factor in the crash. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> recommended that the FAA establish and publicize standards of safe clearance from runway edges for both aircraft and ground vehicles which also take into account the exhaust fumes of jet engines. The board also recommended a reevaluation of training manuals and aircraft procedures in regard to abort procedures.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E
50|$|As NTSB Chairman, Rosenker {{ordered the}} 2006/2007 {{re-opening}} {{of the controversial}} 1967 investigation of Piedmont Airlines Flight 22. In the official petition for reconsideration, Paul Houle (an amateur historian who asked for the investigation to be reopened) suggested that numerous important facts were missing from the original investigation, as well as apparent potential conflicts of interest {{that should have been}} found at the time. Despite the cockpit voice recorder conflicting with <b>the</b> original <b>NTSB</b> report, <b>the</b> <b>NTSB's</b> Office of Aviation Safety found no compelling reason to make any changes to the report. Rosenker subsequently wrote to Houle, sharing the Board's findings upholding the probable cause and contributing factors as presented in <b>the</b> original <b>NTSB</b> report.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>NTSB's</b> findings, <b>the</b> Federal Aviation Administration ordered that the servo valves be {{replaced}} on all 737s by November 12, 2002. The FAA also ordered new training protocols for pilots to handle in an unexpected movement of flight controls.|$|R
25|$|The Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic TV series Mayday (also called Air Crash Investigation or Air Disasters) dramatized {{the crash}} of Flight 427 and <b>the</b> <b>NTSB's</b> 737 rudder {{investigation}} in a 2007 episode titled Hidden Danger (broadcast in some countries as Mystery Crashes).|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> report {{included}} {{a total of}} five recommendations for the FAA. These recommendations included: installing recorders for radar displays, installing audio conversation recorders at air traffic control facilities; establishing climb and descent corridors under ATC positive control in the vicinity of air terminals; and establishing more definitive procedures for receiving and handling the emergency transponder code 7700. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> strongly recommended that the FAA and the Department of Defense cooperate to develop a program, in areas where a large intermix of civil and military traffic exists, to ensure that appropriate graphical depictions of airspace utilization and typical flow patterns are prominently displayed at all airports and operational bases for the benefit of all airspace users.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> report {{showed that}} the plane had several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to cabin pressure {{in the months leading}} up to the accident. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> sent {{a team to}} {{the crash}} site to {{investigate}} the accident. They concluded that, unknown to the crew, ice had collected on the wings, which disrupted airflow and reduced lift.The inquiry lasted just under one year.|$|E
5000|$|In the aftermath, Con Edison sued New York City, and {{the office}} of Mayor de Blasio {{rejected}} <b>the</b> <b>NTSB's</b> finding of fault on the city's part, saying that the effects of sewer leakage was [...] "localized" [...] and did not cause the gas pipes to break.|$|R
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board, {{after an}} {{exhaustive}} investigation effort, {{could not identify}} conclusive evidence to explain the loss of United Airlines flight 585. [...] " [...] This was only {{the fourth time in}} <b>the</b> <b>NTSB's</b> history that it published a final aircraft accident report with an undetermined probable cause.|$|R
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{found that}} the {{probable}} cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading {{to a loss of}} situational awareness by the local controller. The crash led directly to <b>the</b> <b>NTSB's</b> recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. State Department, after closing <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> {{investigation}} {{on the grounds}} that it was not an accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead. Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed that might have embarrassed the administration or contradicted its version of events. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>NTSB,</b> ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved—in this incident, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea—to supply evidence voluntarily.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} opinion presented by <b>the</b> <b>NTSB</b> accident report {{determined that the}} cause of the accident was the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> recommended revisions and expansions to airline abort procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures, taking into account jet engine exhaust. In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' said that he would have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|E
5|$|According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Cirrus SR20 aircraft, tail number N929CD, {{was owned}} by Lidle. On May 1, 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that the {{probable}} cause of the crash was pilot error. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB</b> was unable to determine which person was flying the aircraft {{at the time of}} the crash.|$|E
50|$|The Washington State Patrol and the National Transportation Safety Board {{investigated}} <b>the</b> accident. <b>The</b> <b>NTSB's</b> report attributes <b>the</b> collision to the tall-load truck {{being in}} the wrong, outside lane, and being crowded further into the shoulder by the passing truck. It attributes the bridge collapse to the collision taking out multiple sway braces, which destabilized the critical load-bearing (upper chord) members.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} major airline {{accident}} investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), newly formed to replace the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). <b>The</b> <b>NTSB's</b> report placed <b>the</b> primary responsibility for the accident on the Cessna pilot, while citing air traffic control procedures as a contributing factor, and recommended a review of minimum pilot skill levels required for IFR flight.|$|R
50|$|Through {{internet}} postings,op-ed pieces,industrial journal articles,letters,interviews {{in magazines}} and newspapersand TV appearances,Williams challenged the preliminary remarks {{and the final}} report of <b>the</b> <b>NTSB's</b> accident investigation. Although there were several critics of the investigation, including varied pilots and pundits, Williams {{is widely regarded as}} the major engineering voice providing pushback against the conclusion that the air disaster was essentially the fault of the co-pilot.|$|R
