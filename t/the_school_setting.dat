5|$|The {{relationship}} between Link and Zelda {{was quite different}} from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was {{not a member of}} royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends both served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface. Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over an ledge: initially intended as a rule of three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>setting.</b> Groose's maturation {{during the course of the}} story was intended to help convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.|$|E

Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading. Mid tech supports used in <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>setting</b> include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.|$|E

500|$|Mollie L Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly {{enjoyed the}} game's fresh {{take on the}} high school setting so common in Japanese media, while PC Gamers Samuel Roberts found the size of the cast {{hindered}} the story and compared the experience to a low-quality anime series. RPGamer's Michael A Cunningham enjoyed the characters despite being shallow, with him saying Machina and Rem had the best development out of the main cast. Destructoid's Chris Carter said that, as with other Final Fantasy games, players would find favorites among the characters, and was entertained by the conflict between classes and classmates, which worked in <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>setting.</b> Most of the reviewers made mixed to negative comments {{on the quality of the}} localization; Sullivan drew attention to Nine's incongruous addition of [...] "yo" [...] and [...] "hey" [...] to his sentences, Cunngingham found the experience better when she switched to the Japanese voice track, while Cunningham appreciated the effort put into the translation while finding the final product inconsistent with the new platforms. The exception was Cartar, who said that the English cast [...] "do a great job".|$|E

2500|$|At around 15:30, two grenades were detonated {{approximately}} {{ten minutes}} apart by the militants at security forces outside <b>the</b> <b>school,</b> <b>setting</b> {{a police car}} on fire and injuring one officer, but Russian forces did not return fire. As {{the day and night}} wore on, the combination of stress and sleep deprivation—and possibly drug withdrawal—made the hostage-takers increasingly hysterical and unpredictable. The crying of the children irritated them, and on several occasions crying children and their mothers were threatened with being shot if they would not stop crying. Russian authorities claimed that the hostage-takers had [...] "listened to German heavy metal group Rammstein on personal stereos during the siege to keep themselves edgy and fired up" [...] (Rammstein had previously come under fire following the Columbine High School massacre, and again in 2007 after the Jokela High School shooting).|$|E

According to the DLF web site, the TM program was introduced to the Arts and Technology Academy at Weaver High School in Hartford CT in 2006. Four hundred and fifty students as well as principals and administrators are reported to have been instructed in the technique. A voluntary program at the Kingsbury School, a Washington D.C. private school [...] "for students with learning disorders" [...] in grades K-12, was featured on the PBS program, To The Contrary in 2007. According to the school director, about 10 percent of the teachers, parents and students declined to participate because they found it be religious and cult-ish. Conferences sponsored by the New England Committee for Stress-Free Schools were held in Providence, Rhode Island; Fairfield, Connecticut; and Boston, Massachusetts in 2005. The Boston conference was attended by 100 teachers and featured testimony from school principals who have experience with the TM program in schools. In the mid-2000s the TM technique was incorporated into the educational program at the Daburiya High School in Israel.|$|E
