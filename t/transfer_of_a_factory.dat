5000|$|Terminology differs as {{to whether}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>factory</b> is itself <b>a</b> design pattern - in the seminal book Design Patterns there is no [...] "factory pattern", but instead two {{patterns}} (factory method pattern and abstract factory pattern) that use factories. Some sources refer to the concept as the factory pattern, while others consider the concept itself a programming idiom, reserving the term [...] "factory pattern" [...] or [...] "factory patterns" [...] to more complicated patterns that use factories, most often the factory method pattern; in this context, the concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>factory</b> itself may be referred to as <b>a</b> simple <b>factory.</b> In other contexts, particularly the Python language, [...] "factory" [...] itself is used, as in this article. More broadly, [...] "factory" [...] may be applied not just to an object that returns objects from some method call, but to a subroutine that returns objects, as in <b>a</b> <b>factory</b> function (even if functions are not objects) or factory method. Because in many languages factories are invoked by calling a method, the general concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>factory</b> is often confused with the specific factory method pattern design pattern.|$|R
