5|$|Following {{the end of}} the 1928–29 tour, Chapman did {{not return}} to England until July, midway through the cricket season; Jack White and Arthur Carr captained England in his absence. Chapman resumed playing for Kent shortly after his return home but {{appeared}} in only seven matches, with a top-score of 28. His season was curtailed when he fell awkwardly while fielding in a match against Sussex at the beginning of August. He also missed the two MCC tours <b>that</b> <b>winter</b> to New Zealand and West Indies, neither of which involved a full-strength team.|$|E

5|$|Gauguin was {{foremost}} a painter; {{he came to}} ceramics around 1886, when he {{was taught}} by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During <b>that</b> <b>winter</b> of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles.|$|E
5|$|In July 1954, Allen was {{involved}} in the selection of the MCC team to tour Australia in 1954–55, as the MCC's representative. <b>That</b> <b>winter,</b> he travelled to Australia to expand his business contacts and was present when England won three Test matches, which ensured victory in the series. Before the 1955 season, he was nominated as the Chairman of Selectors, and as his senior partner at David Bevan had no objection, he accepted. The workload of the post brought his playing days to an end.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Irish influences, Bax also drew on a Nordic tradition, being inspired by the Norwegian poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Icelandic sagas. Bax's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra (1917) is seen by the musicologist Julian Herbage as the turning-point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax's oeuvre; Herbage views it as a further indication of the shift <b>that</b> <b>Winter</b> Legends, composed thirteen years later, has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn vertebrates, the adrenocortical stress {{response}} activates an emergency life-history stage, which {{is thought to}} promote survival by helping individuals escape life-threatening situations. Although the adrenocortical {{stress response}} promotes many behavioural and physiological changes, it remains unclear whether this stress response actually translates into higher survival in wild vertebrates. We measured the adrenocortical stress response of non-breeding American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla), a migratory bird <b>that</b> <b>wintered</b> in habitats of either high (mangroves) or low suitability (scrubs), and subsequently monitored their return rate during the following non-breeding seasons. The intensity of the adrenocortical stress response was consistent within individuals across the non-breeding season and {{was positively correlated with}} return rates in redstarts <b>that</b> <b>wintered</b> in scrubs, but not in redstarts <b>that</b> <b>wintered</b> in mangroves. Thus, in a context-dependent manner, the ability of an individual to physiologically react to stress determines its ability of returning to its non-breeding territory the following winters. For an individual, the ability to mount an important adrenocortical stress response probably benefits to survival. However, this beneficial effect probably depends on an individual's environment and phenotypic characteristics because these two variables are likely to affect its probability of being confronted with life-threatening stressors during its annual life cycle...|$|R

5|$|Laura Johnson and Harold Knight {{married in}} 1903 {{and made their}} {{first trip to the}} Netherlands in 1904. They spent six weeks there that year and six months there in 1905.

5|$|The North Atlantic {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) <b>that</b> <b>winter</b> mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{remoteness}} of Dawson {{proved an}} ongoing {{problem for the}} supply of food, and as the population grew to 5,000 in 1897, this became critical.
