5|$|The Shimna {{is a short}} spate river, {{meaning it}} becomes deep and fast flowing after periods of rain and is slow, with low water levels, in drier weather. In {{sections}} of the river where the gradient is low, there are riffles and pools, sandy banks, and pebbles and scattered boulders on the river bed. Along steeper parts there is a faster flow, rapids and cascades, and <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> made up of bedrock and boulders.|$|E
5|$|To {{the eastern}} {{transept}} is the Mother-of-Pearl Bed (พระแท่นบรรทมประดับมุก) {{which was made}} to match the Mother-of-Pearl Throne. The bed was once the king's personal bed and was kept inside the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya; however once {{it was no longer}} used it was transferred to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> {{in the form of a}} high platform with many layers, and small steps leading to the top. When royal ceremonies are carried out within the throne hall, member of the royal family take their seat in the southern transept, while government officials sit to the north, Buddhist monks to the east; the funeral urn is to the west. During such times the throne and bed were used as altars for Buddha images.|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{brickwork}} include bricks, {{beds and}} perpends. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> the mortar upon which a brick is laid. A perpend is a vertical joint between any two bricks and is usually—but not always—filled with mortar.|$|E
60|$|There was a door {{connecting}} the two rooms. It {{was not supposed}} to be used, for one of <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>was</b> against it. But <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>was</b> rolled to one side by Tom. Songbird and his roommate had already gone below.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> under {{at least}} 1 metre of overburden, {{in a small}} field {{near the village of}} Rhynie, so is {{effectively}} inaccessible to collectors; besides which, the site is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. A second unit, the Windyfield chert, is some 700m from the Rhynie. The Rhynie chert extends for at least 80m along strike and 90m down-dip.|$|E
25|$|A strong airflow {{is forced}} through a sandbed. The air seeps through the sand until a point is reached where the sand {{particles}} separate {{to let the}} air through and mixing and churning occurs, thus a fluidized bed is created and fuel and waste can now be introduced. The sand with the pre-treated waste and/or fuel is kept suspended on pumped air currents and takes on a fluid-like character. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> thereby violently mixed and agitated keeping small inert particles and air in a fluid-like state. This allows all {{of the mass of}} waste, fuel and sand to be fully circulated through the furnace.|$|E
25|$|Bed load {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the bed material load (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from <b>the</b> <b>bed)</b> <b>is</b> often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.|$|E

40|$|Couette flow of two viscous, incompressible, {{immiscible}} fluids in {{a channel}} bounded by permeable <b>beds</b> <b>is</b> investigated. <b>The</b> lower <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> of finite thickness with high permeability and <b>the</b> upper <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> of infinite thickness with low permeability. The flow in <b>the</b> lower permeable <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> described by Brinkman equation whereas the flow in <b>the</b> upper permeable <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> described by Darcy’s law. The flow between <b>the</b> two <b>beds</b> <b>is</b> governed by Navier-Stokes equations. The velocity {{field and the}} mass flow rate are obtained. It is observed that the velocity is in increasing trend with the increment in the Reynolds number...|$|R
25|$|With {{increasing}} attention {{being paid}} to saving energy, many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration. Of these methods, a third method has emerged and has been adopted {{by the majority of}} modern ethanol plants. This new process uses molecular sieves to remove water from fuel ethanol. In this process, ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads. The bead's pores are sized to allow adsorption of water while excluding ethanol. After a period of time, <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere (e.g. N2) to remove the adsorbed water. Two beds are often used so that one is available to adsorb water while the other is being regenerated. This dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus/gallon (840 kJ/L) compared to earlier azeotropic distillation.|$|E
25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} sights seen on {{entering}} the park is a large flowerbed representing the Canadian flag. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> empty during the park's first weeks of being open and is replaced with a faux graveyard during the autumn for Halloween Haunt. Approximately 11,000 begonias are planted in the bed, which is [...] by [...] in size. Behind it is a large fountain area, {{with a variety of}} water patterns all day and lighting effects at night. A pathway structure, modeled to look like an arch bridge, contained (as of 1982) a computer that controlled the fountain's 93 pneumatic valves and nozzles and its 504 red, white, and turquoise lights. In 1982, the lighting patterns would change roughly every 30 seconds, with a 30-minute rotation. In 2011, the lights were upgraded to offer a range of 16 million colours. Before the park opened, the [...] by [...] water basin was referred to as Royal Fountain.|$|E

500|$|Philosopher {{and film}} theorist Robert Sinnerbrink {{similarly}} {{notes that the}} images following Diane's apparent suicide undermine the [...] "dream and reality" [...] interpretation. After Diane shoots herself, <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> consumed with smoke, and Betty and Rita are shown beaming at each other, after which {{a woman in the}} Club Silencio balcony whispers [...] "Silencio" [...] as the screen fades to black. Sinnerbrink writes that the [...] "concluding images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image", also noting that it might be that the [...] "last sequence comprises the fantasy images of Diane's dying consciousness, concluding with the real moment of her death: the final Silencio". Referring to the same sequence, film theorist Andrew Hageman notes that [...] "the ninety-second coda that follows Betty/Diane's suicide is a cinematic space that persists after the curtain has dropped on her living consciousness, and this persistent space is the very theatre where the illusion of illusion is continually unmasked".|$|E
500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how I like it Daddy {{when you hit the}} spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll make you think <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E
500|$|The {{windows of}} the stair turret {{represent}} [...] "the Storming of the Castle of Love". On the first floor are two bedrooms and an armoury. Burges's bedroom, with a theme of sea creatures, overlooks the garden. Its elaborate ceiling is segmented into panels by gilded and painted beams, studded with miniature convex mirrors set in to gilt stars. Fish and eels swim in a frieze of waves painted under the ceiling, and fish are also carved in relief on the chimneypiece. On the fire-hood, a sculpted mermaid gazes into a looking-glass, with seashells, coral, seaweed and a baby mermaid also represented. Charles Handley-Read described the frieze around the Mermaid fireplace as [...] "proto-Art Nouveau" [...] and noted [...] "the debt of international art nouveau to Victorian Gothic designers, Burges included". In this room, Burges placed two of his most personal pieces of furniture, the Red Bed, in which he died, and the Narcissus washstand, both of which originally came from Buckingham Street. [...] <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> painted blood red and features a panel depicting Sleeping Beauty. The washstand is red and gold; its tip-up basin of marble inlaid with fishes is silver and gold.|$|E
50|$|Both camps were {{supposed}} {{to be as good as}} each other, although there were some differences between the camps. Camp Sheila contained a pink and white recliner, a picture of a shirtless man holding a baby and <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> pink. Camp Bruce contained a black leather recliner, a picture of a woman scratching her bottom in tennis clothes and <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>were</b> blue, Camp Bruce also was slightly bigger.|$|R

50|$|Rocks on North West Solitary Island {{consist of}} repeating beds of sillicaceous argillite, {{mudstone}} and sandstone. The argillite probably formed from volcanic ash falls. <b>The</b> <b>beds</b> <b>are</b> 5 to 10 cm thick. The strike of <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>is</b> between 0° and 20° with overturned <b>beds</b> dipping to <b>the</b> east.

500|$|The {{identity}} {{of the woman in}} <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> not known, but the archaeologists who excavated the site have suggested that she was [...] "a female member of the local aristocracy, probably a princess and an outsider, whose personal status was strong enough to act as a catalyst for the site" [...] and that her companions were similarly [...] "a group of people of high status from outside the region." [...] Average life expectancy at the time was short– only 32years for men and 28years for women– so {{it is possible that the}} cemetery was used exclusively by members of the [...] "princess's" [...] community and ceased to be used when the last member died. This would fit with its short period of usage, perhaps only 30years or so, judging from the age of the artefacts found during the excavations. Steve Sherlock, the site's discoverer, believes that she was buried first and that the other graves were dug around hers afterward. Next to her grave is a probable male grave, to which it may be linked. The close proximity of the graves and their offset from the rest of the graves in the cemetery raises questions about whether the occupants were related.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, bed {{roughness}} can act to slow glacial motion. The roughness of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>is</b> {{a measure}} of how many boulders and obstacles protrude into the overlying ice. [...] Ice flows around these obstacles by melting under the high pressure on their lee sides; the resultant meltwater is then forced down a steep pressure gradient into the cavity arising in their stoss, where it re-freezes. Cavitation on the stoss side increases this pressure gradient, which assists flow.|$|E
