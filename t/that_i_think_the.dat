It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Pasmer sacrificed her astonishment in the {{interest}} of sanity, and returned quietly: [...] "Glad, Alice! You know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's <b>the</b> sweetest and best fellow in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have made}} it equally plain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> negro is {{included}} in the word [...] "men" [...] used in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since you {{accuse me}} of concealing my real impressions, I may admit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> tendency--among you generally--is to be made unhappy too easily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care. I didn't {{mean to do}} it. It was an accident. Besides <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> waiter was as much {{to blame}} as I was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said Lord Glenvarloch. [...] "And, pray, what dream {{have you}} had that has {{deprived}} me of your good opinion; for <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> seems <b>the</b> moral of the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|How I {{got home}} I can't say, except <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> ran <b>the</b> {{greater part of}} the way.

6000|$|... "I {{believe he}} is. He may put {{three or four}} {{thousand}} dollars into the venture I mention, if he continues pleased with me. <b>That</b> is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> most <b>I</b> could expect from him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must be {{near the}} reef, by <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> only {{currents}} we feel come from the tide, {{and they seem to}} be setting us back and forth, instead of carrying us in any one settled direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--hardly <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> man {{is both a}} fool and a blackguard; but I don't {{think we}} are {{therefore}} to suppose {{that there are many}} fools and blackguards like him. I wonder what he really has wanted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not, {{but we are}} sailing {{under the}} United States flag, Mr. Van Blott," [...] said Captain Marshall, quickly. [...] "Besides <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{authorities}} here will respect a legal document drawn up in Uncle Sam's country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither {{of those}} women cried. The wife stayed there by the bed. I got the other one away to her carriage, down the street.--And so she was there to-day! <b>That</b> explains, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> look you saw." ...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding {{the song}} [...] "Tired of Being Alive", John Christ has {{suggested}} <b>that</b> “Lyrically, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> words {{are about the}} way Glenn was feeling at the time.” The remaining songs feature subjects including love, sex and religious themes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Except his uncle," [...] said Mrs. Woodford. [...] "I fear it is vain to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{best hope}} of his {{becoming}} {{a good and}} valuable man, a comfort and not a sorrow to yourself, would be to let him even now rejoin Sir Peregrine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My joints {{are not so}} stiff yet," [...] he said, [...] "that I can't {{be induced}} to run without such a high prize as <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> income of an abbey or two held `in commendam,' without the trouble of getting my head shaved, would satisfy me at present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must always}} have come along here," [...] Dias said.

5000|$|McMullin J stated [...] "The first respondent's {{evidence}} {{was that he}} wanted to keep the appellant out of the industry {{for the rest of his}} life. <b>That,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is <b>the</b> only explanation for a covenant of such a length." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] said Mr. Enderton, as we {{were seated}} at the wedding-feast, [...] "is a most creditable display of {{attractive}} viands, but I may say, my dear Ruth, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> perceived <b>the</b> influence of the happy event of to-day even before it took place. I have lately had a better appetite for my food, and have experienced a greater enjoyment of my surroundings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly, Mordecai," [...] said Pash, [...] "if {{you mean}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> worse of myself {{for being a}} Jew.

6000|$|I do not {{say this}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> same thing will be practised again, or {{anything}} like it, though I know that very homely proverb, [...] "More ways of killing a dog than hanging him."--But I instance it to shew, the counsels of every grand juryman should be kept secret, that he may act freely and without apprehensions of resentment from the prosecuted or prosecutor.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gage {{waved the}} facts aside with his hand. [...] "I don't undervalue those things. If I could be master, {{no one should}} have my girl without them.

6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] breathed Miss Willett. [...] "I mean—I {{was only}} going to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{slightest}} detail would have escaped me. All she seems {{to remember is that}} it took place in a church." ...|$|R

5000|$|When, in some obscure country town, {{the farmers}} come {{together}} to a special town-meeting, to express their opinion on some subject which is vexing <b>the</b> land, <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is <b>the</b> true Congress, and the most respectable one that is ever assembled in the United States.|$|R
60|$|There {{were other}} peculiarities, {{but it is}} not {{necessary}} to describe them further than to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> soil benefited by the natural heat of the volcano, and that when this erupted, as happened occasionally, the lava streams always passed to the north and south of the cup of land. Indeed, it was these lava streams that had built up the protecting cliffs.|$|E
60|$|I {{have gone}} {{carefully}} over your story again, and quite {{agree with you}} that the episode of the clergyman could be told in a very few lines. Startling as I know it will appear to you, I am bound to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> purpose of the whole tale would be immensely strengthened by great compression. I doubt if it could not be told more forcibly in half the space.|$|E
6000|$|I {{wish you}} would mention to Thomas, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> paper on hops {{extremely}} well done. He has quite caught the idea we want, and caught it in the best way. In pursuing the bridge subject, I {{think it would be}} advisable to look up the Thames police. I have a misty notion of some capital papers coming out of it. Will you see to this branch of the tree among the other branches? ...|$|E
