In the presence of a TATA-less promoter, TBP binds with the help of TBP-associated factors (TAFs). TBP associates with a host of factors, including the general transcription factors TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, and -H, to form huge multi-subunit pre-initiation complexes on the core promoter. Through its association with different transcription factors, TBP can initiate transcription from different RNA polymerases. There are several related TBPs, including TBP-like (TBPL) proteins.|$|E

DNA-binding assays previously identified NF-Y, GATA- 1, C/EBP beta and C/EBP gamma as candidate regulators of beta-globin transcription via the CCAAT-box, a promoter element situated between CACC- and <b>TATA-boxes.</b> We have identified C/EBP delta as an additional beta-globin CCAAT-box binding protein. In reporter assays, we show that C/EBP delta can co-operate with EKLF, a CACC-box binding protein, to activate the beta-globin promoter, whereas C/EBP gamma inhibits the transcriptional activity of EKLF in this assay.

40|$|AbstractEquimolecular {{presence}} of ribosomal proteins (RPs) {{in the cell}} is needed for ribosome assembly and is achieved by synchronized expression of ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) with promoters of similar strengths. Over-represented motifs of RPG promoter regions are identified as targets for specific transcription factors. Unlike RPs, those motifs are not conserved between mammals, drosophila, and yeast. We analyzed RPGs proximal promoter regions of three basal metazoans with sequenced genomes: sponge, cnidarian, and placozoan and found common features, such as 5 ′-terminal oligopyrimidine tracts and <b>TATA-boxes.</b> Furthermore, we identified over-represented motifs, some of which displayed the highest similarity to motifs abundant in human RPG promoters and not present in Drosophila or yeast. Our results indicate that humans over-represented motifs, as well as corresponding domains of transcription factors, were established very early in metazoan evolution.

Recently the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), and receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) have become recognized as integral components of the adrenomedullin signaling system. However, mechanisms of regulation of CRLR expression are still largely unknown. This is {{in part due to}} lack of information on the gene promoter.

40|$|Abstract Background Mammalian {{olfactory}} receptors (ORs) {{are subject}} to a remarkable but poorly understood regime of transcriptional regulation, whereby individual olfactory neurons each express only one allele of a single member of the large OR gene family. Results We performed a rigorous search for enriched sequence motifs in the largest dataset of OR promoter regions analyzed to date. We combined measures of cross-species conservation with databases of known transcription factor binding sites and ab initio motif-finding algorithms. We found strong enrichment of binding sites for the O/E family of transcription factors and for homeodomain factors, both already known {{to be involved in}} the transcriptional control of ORs, but did not identify any novel enriched sequences. We also found that <b>TATA-boxes</b> are present in at least a subset of OR promoters.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} an overview of promoter activities intrinsic to primary DNA sequences in the human genome within a particular cell type, we carried out systematic quantitative luciferase assays of DNA fragments corresponding to putative promoters for 472 human genes which are expressed in HEK (human embryonic kidney epithelial) 293 cells. We observed the promoter activities of them were distributed in a bimodal manner; putative promoters belonging to the first group (with strong promoter activities) were designated as P 1 and the latter (with weak promoter activities) as P 2. The frequencies of the <b>TATA-boxes,</b> the CpG islands, and the overall G + C-contents were significantly different between these two populations, indicating there are two separate groups of promoters. Interestingly, similar analysis using 251 randomly isolated genomic DNA fragments showed that P 2 -type promoter occasionally occurs within the human genome. Furthermore, 35 DNA fragments corresponding to putative promoters of non-protein-coding transcripts (ncRNAs) shared similar features with the P 2 in both promoter activities and sequence compositions.

This enhancer contains most, {{if not all of}} the sequence elements necessary for the T cell specific induction of the Il- 2 gene by the phorbol ester TPA and the plant lectin Concanavalin A. DNase I footprinting studies with fractionated extracts obtained from induced and uninduced E 14 T cells revealed numerous recognition sites for potential trans-acting factors.

Multiple transcriptional start sites were identified in a GC-rich region lacking <b>TATA-boxes</b> between − 1090 and − 1011 bp from ATG. In transfected mixed cortical cultures, luciferase expression driven by GluR 4 promoter segments were found predominantly in TuJ 1 -positive neurons, indicating neuronal preference of GluR 4. The GluR 4 promoter fragments were 6 – 12 -fold more active in neurons than glia, compared with a 30 -fold neuronal selectivity of GluR 2.

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of promoters is fundamental for understanding gene expression patterns, cell specificity and development. In {{the studies of}} conserved features of regulatory regions of orthologous genes, {{it was observed that}} major promoter functional components such as transcription start points, <b>TATA-boxes</b> and regulatory motifs, are significantly more conservative than the sequences around them (70 – 100 % compared with 30 – 50 %). To improve promoter identification accuracy, we employed these findings in a new program, PromH, created by extending the TSSW program feature set. PromH uses linear discriminant functions that take into account conservation features and nucleotide sequences of promoter regions in pairs of orthologous genes. The program was tested on two sets of pairs of orthologous, mostly human and rodent, sequences with known transcription start sites (TSS), annotated to have TATA (21 genes, 11 orthologous pairs) and TATA-less (38 genes, 19 pairs) promoters, respectively. The program correctly predicted TSS for all 21 genes of the first set with a median deviation of 2  bp from true site location. Only for two genes, was there significant (46 and 105  bp) discrepancy between predicted and annotated TSS positions. For 38 TATA-less promoters from the second set, TSS was predicted for 27 genes, in 14 cases within 10  bp distance from annotated TSS, and in 21 cases—within 100  bp distance. Despite more discrepancies between predicted and annotated TSS for genes from the second set, these results are consistent with observations of much higher occurrence of multiple TSS in TATA-less promoters. In any case, our results show that PromH identifies TSS positions significantly more accurately than any other published promoter prediction method. The PromH program is available at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background CD 36 is a {{membrane}} glycoprotein {{involved in}} a variety of cellular processes such as lipid transport, immune regulation, hemostasis, adhesion, angiogenesis and atherosclerosis. It is expressed in many tissues and cell types, with a tissue specific expression pattern that is a result of a complex regulation for which the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. There are several alternative mRNA isoforms described for the gene. We have investigated the expression patterns of five alternative first exons of the CD 36 gene in several human tissues and cell types, to better understand the molecular details behind its regulation. Results We have identified one novel alternative first exon of the CD 36 gene, and confirmed the expression of four previously known alternative first exons of the gene. The alternative transcripts are all expressed in more than one human tissue and their expression patterns vary highly in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, adipose tissue, placenta, spinal cord, cerebrum and monocytes. All alternative first exons are upregulated in THP- 1 macrophages in response to oxidized low density lipoproteins. The alternative promoters lack <b>TATA-boxes</b> and CpG islands. The upstream region of exon 1 b contains several features common for house keeping gene and monocyte specific gene promoters. Conclusion Tissue-specific expression patterns of the alternative first exons of CD 36 suggest that the alternative first exons of the gene are regulated individually and tissue specifically. At the same time, the fact that all first exons are upregulated in THP- 1 macrophages in response to oxidized low density lipoproteins may suggest that the alternative first exons are coregulated in this cell type and environmental condition. The molecular mechanisms regulating CD 36 thus appear to be unusually complex, which might reflect the multifunctional role of the gene in different tissues and cellular conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{in vitro}} studies of the murine 5 -HT 1 A {{receptor}} gene characterized its proximal promoter as being GC rich and TATA-less and have revealed the presence of several functional transcription factor binding sites, including MAZ and SP 1 recognition sequences. To further analyze the promoter of this receptor gene, additional upstream sequence information extending to ? 5. 5 kb of the murine 5 -HT 1 A receptor gene was generated and promoter fragments extending to ? 20 kb were analyzed for activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, two short promoter fragments (- 183 bp and ? 740 bp) were unable to confer neuronal specificity and served as references for basal expression. Specificity was however conferred by longer fragments (- 4. 5 bp, - 5. 5 bp and - 20 kb), which were active in 5 -HT 1 A receptor mRNA positive cells and inactive in 5 -HT 1 A receptor mRNA negative cells. A promoter region between ? 1587 bp and ? 3160 bp containing two putative glucocorticoid response elements was functionally analyzed in vitro with respect to its responsiveness to dexamethasone and aldosterone. Under the chosen conditions the functionality of these cis elements could not be satisfactorily shown. In agreement with the results obtained in vitro, using additive transgenesis to drive LacZ expression in vivo, CNS specific reporter gene expression was found with all three long constructs. Transgene expression in the - 4. 5 kb and - 20 kb mouse lines resembled the typical endogenous 5 -HT 1 A receptor gene expression pattern, whereas the - 5. 5 kb mouse lines revealed strongly reduced expression. Using colocalization studies the rate of concurrence of transgenic and endogenous 5 -HT 1 A receptor gene expression {{brought about by the}} three different constructs was analyzed. All analyzed lines exhibit cellular colocalization. The highest rates of colocalization were observed in mice carrying the 20 kb construct, suggesting a large promoter fragment is required to faithfully direct transgene expression in a 5 -HT 1 A receptor like pattern. LacZ expression was furthermore assessed in transgenic embryos and in mice during early postnatal development. In general expression patterns mirrored the respective adult expression patterns. Expression in the raphe region initiated between E 12. 5 and E 14. 5, reached high levels between E 14. 5 and E 18. 5, became weaker at P 1. 5 and gradually became stronger at P 7. 5 and P 14. 5. Expression in the forebrain initiated at around E 18. 5 and gradually became stronger until the adult levels were reached. These results establish a sound basis to further analyze this promoter in vitro and in vivo functionally, allowing more specific questions concerning, for example, the regulation of its activity by drugs and hormones to be addressed. The promoter fragments may also be of considerable use for directing gene expression specifically to 5 -HT 1 A expressing neurons and subsets thereof. The 5 -HT 7 receptor gene is the most recently identified serotonin receptor gene in mammals and is believed {{to be one of the}} oldest evolutionary. Although splicing events in the 3 ´-region of the 5 -HT 7 receptor gene and the distribution of 5 -HT 7 receptors and their mRNA have been intensively investigated, nothing has been reported on the characteristics or the function of its promoter until now. In this study we identified the 5 -HT 7 receptor gene promoter and initially characterized its properties. Furthermore we identified novel 5 -HT 7 receptor gene splice variants resulting from splice events in the 5 ´-region of the gene. 5. 3 kb of the mouse 5 -HT 7 receptor promoter were cloned and sequenced. By computer based sequence analysis three putative <b>TATA-boxes</b> have been identified at 635 bp to 667 bp upstream of the receptor coding sequence. The 550 bp region upstream of the coding sequence is G/C rich (81. 5 %) and contains multiple putative SP 1 and MAZ binding sites. Several transcription initiation sites could be identified in the G/C rich region and one further upstream at ? 627 bp. This latter is located 21 bp, 35 bp and 49 bp downstream of the three putative <b>TATA-boxes.</b> One transcription initiation site in the G/C rich region at - 124 bp lies within an initiator consensus sequence. No CCAAT-boxes were identified. To further analyze the promoter of this receptor gene, fragments extending to - 4. 2 kb, - 3. 5 kb, - 2. 1 kb and - 1. 2 kb were analyzed for activity in vitro using cells with and without endogenous 5 -HT 7 receptor gene expression. None of the promoter fragments were active in the cells used. A repressor element located at - 22 bp to - 107 bp was identified conferring this complete repression of transcription. When deleted, expression was strongest in cells endogenously expressing the 5 -HT 7 receptor gene, regardless of the construct used. In these cells the region between - 2080 bp and - 1159 bp acts repressory and the region between - 4224 bp and - 3454 bp activates transcription. From these results we conclude that the 5 -HT 7 receptor gene promoter initiates transcription from two regions through two different mechanisms. One mechanism involves G/C rich sequences and gives rise to multiple transcription initiation sites, the other involves <b>TATA-boxes</b> which define only one transcription initiation site. The very proximal region of the promoter contains an element blocking or stopping transcription, acting on both described activation modes. Cis elements not contained on the 4. 2 kb fragment and/or trans elements not expressed by the cells used, presumably abrogate this block, thus conferring specific expression. By cDNA cloning and sequencing six new splice events in the 5 ´-area of the 5 -HT 7 receptor gene were detected. One splice event involves a new alternative exon residing in intron I. The other five all occurred in Exon I at internal splice donor and acceptor sites leading to in frame-deletions. If translated, two variants are predicted to retain the seven transmembrane (TM) structure, three to have a five TM structure and one to have a three TM structure. Further experiments are needed to elucidate the functional relevance and consequences of these results...|$|R
40|$|Clustered {{regularly}} interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) {{found in}} prokaryotes are non-contiguous direct repeats with {{a length of}} 24 - 48 nt. The sequence repeats are weakly palindromic at the 5 '- and 3 '-termini and separated by variable spacer sequences of similar size (Jansen et al., 2002). CRISPR loci are flanked on one side by an AT-rich leader sequence of 200 - 350 bp length. CRISPR sequences are widespread in the two prokaryotic domains; they were identifed in most archaeal genomes, in 40 % of the bacterial genomes and on some plasmids (Grissa et al., 2007). Similarity searches of spacer sequences of CRISPR showed that some spacer match to phages and other extrachromosomal elements, such as plasmids or transposons, but also to chromosomal DNA (Mojica et al., 2005; Bolotin et al., 2005). A group of cas genes is always located near to a CRISPR locus and the encoded proteins {{are assumed to be}} the essential actors for function and assembly of CRISPR (Haft et al., 2005). Recently, it was demonstrated that, in response to phage infection, Bacteria integrate new spacers into their CRISPR arrays, which results in CRISPR-mediated phage resistance. The new integrated spacers were derived from the genome of the challenging phage, due to 100 % identity of spacers and phage sequences (Barrangou et al., 2007). However, the role of CRISPR arrays in microbial genomes and the mechanisms that underlie CRISPR function are mostly uncharacterized, especially in Archaea. Also, whether different CRISPR systems contain different functionalities is still puzzling (Sorek et al., 2008). Therefore, the function of the archaeal CRISPR/Cas system is studied in more detail using the hyperthermophilic organism Thermoproteus tenax as an example. In the course of this work seven CRISPR loci could be identified in the genome of T. tenax. The spacer sequences showed significant similarity not only to archaeal phages, but also to genes of the T. tenax genome. Northern blot analyses of small RNA species prepared from T. tenax cells with spacer probes from all seven CRISPR arrays, revealed transcript length of ~ 130 nt, ~ 110 nt, ~ 70 nt and ~ 50 nt, suggesting that large CRISPR RNA transcripts are stepwise endo- and exonucleolytically processed. The repeat sequence within the transcript has probably two functions: i) stabilising the CRISPR transcript by the formation of hairpin-structures and ii) binding motif for nuclease reaction. The transcription start site is located in front of the first repeat within the leader sequence distinguished by typical BRE-sites and <b>TATA-boxes.</b> Over 20 cas genes were identified in the genome of T. tenax and their organisation is similar to other crenarchaeal organisms. The core cas genes are organised in two operon structures, named casa 1 (cas 4, cas 1 / 2 and csa 1) and casa 2 (csa 5, csa 2, cas 5 a, cas 3, cas 3 hd and csa 4). In front of both operons <b>TATA-boxes</b> and BRE-sites could be identified and the functional genes within the operons showed overlapping start and stop codons. Furthermore, the polycistronic transcripts of both operons could be identified by RT-PCR analyses. The polycistronic transcripts of casa 1 and casa 2 are clearly leaderless, whereas for all genes within the operons consensus SD motifs could be identified. Abiotic stress parameters, such as UV-light or high ionic strength, modulate the transcription of cas genes. The cas 3 gene showed a more than threefold increased and the cas 4 gene a twofold increased transcript level in cells treated 2 min with UV-light in comparison to the control cells. Furthermore, cas 3 mRNA levels of cells treated with 100 mM NaCl were more than tenfold increased in comparison to the control. The protein Csa 3 can be considered as a good candidate for a transcription regulator, whose coding gene is located in between the two cas operons. This protein is structurally characterised by a typical HTH-motif and possesses high affinity to DNA. However, the conditions for a required specific binding (e. g. addition of trehalose, metal ions or cAMP) to the promoter regions of casa 1 and casa 2 has still to be found. The functional characterisation of single Cas proteins encoded by the operons casa 1 and casa 2 was complicated by the formation of inclusion bodies of the recombinant proteins in E. coli. For casa 1, reconstitution experiments revealed that the three proteins encoded by the operon strongly interacted in the refolding process. The resulting tripartite CasA 1 protein complex showed ribonuclease activity with ssRNA CRISPR transcripts as a target. Also four of the six proteins encoded by the operon casa 2 could be expressed only in an insoluble form. For the other two proteins (Csa 5 and Csa 2) “normal” purification protocols could be established. Also in that case, the reconstitution of the multipartite complex (“CasA 2 ”) is favoured in the presence of all proteins encoded by the cas gene operon. Remarkably, addition of T. tenax RNA supports the reconstitution of the CasA 2 complex significantly. The RNA binding capacity could also be documented in EMSA studies. The studies of the CRISPR/Cas system of T. tenax clearly showed that the processing of CRISPR transcripts is an enzymatically catalysed reaction. A relevant component in T. tenax is certainly the CasA 1 complex due to its ribonuclease activity. The CasA 2 complex may be a candidate for accomplishing interference reactions, due to its strong interaction with RNA, detected in the reconstituion assays and supported by the presence of defined RNA and DNA binding domains of components. The present data confirm the common hypothesis that the CRISPR/Cas system of prokaryotic cells represent a defense system against mobile genetic elements, considering the observation that some spacer sequences show clear sequence similarity to known viruses. But there are also hints to additional functions: i) Regulatory functions may also be possible, since spacers of the T. tenax CRISPR are not only similar to foreign genetic sequences, but also to the organism’s own chromosomomal sequences. ii) Moreover, functions of the CRISPR/Cas systems for stabilising the genome structure or nucleic acids are also likely, as the number of CRISPR loci and cas genes correlates with an increased optimal growth temperature and cas genes are modulated by environmental factors...|$|R

In yeast, the most important are: UAF (upstream activating factor), TBP (<b>TATA-box</b> binding protein), and CF (core factor), which bind promoter elements and form the preinitiation complex (PIC), which is in turn recognized by RNA pol.

The formation of this complex requires {{the help of an}} upstream activating factor or UAF that associates with <b>TATA-box</b> binding protein and the core factor (CF). Together the two transcription factors allow the RNA pol I complex to bind with the polymerase I initiation factor, Rrn3. As the pol I transcript is produced, approximately 75 small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles (snoRNPs) facilitate the co-transcriptional covalent modifications of >100 rRNA residues. These snoRNPs control 2’-O-ribose methylation of nucleotides and also assist in the creation of pseudouridines. At the 5’ end of rRNA transcripts, small subunit ribosomal proteins (Rps) and non-ribosomal factors assemble with the pre-RNA transcripts to create ball-like knobs. These knobs are the first pre-ribosomal particles in the small (40S) ribosomal subunit pathway. The rRNA transcript is cleaved at the A2 site, and this separates the early 40S pre-ribosome from the remaining pre-rRNA that will combine with large subunit ribosomal proteins (Rpl) and other non-ribosomal factors to create the pre-60S ribosomal particles.|$|E
5000|$|RNA Polymerase II {{exists in}} two forms unphosphorylated and phosphorylated, IIA and IIO respectively. The {{transition}} {{between the two}} forms facilitates different functions for transcription. The phosphorylation of CTD is catalyzed {{by one of the}} six general transcription factors, TFIIH. TFIIH serves two purposes: one is to unwind the DNA at the transcription start site and the other is to phosphorylate. The form polymerase IIA joins the preinitiation complex, this is suggested because IIA binds with higher affinity to the TBP (<b>TATA-box</b> binding protein), the subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID, than polymerase IIO form. The form polymerase IIO facilitates the elongation of the RNA chain. The method for the elongation initiation is done by the phosphorylation of Serine at position 5 (ser5), via TFIIH. The newly phosphorylated Ser5 recruits enzymes to cap the 5' end of the newly synthesized RNA and the [...] "3' processing factors to poly(A) sites". Once the second Serine is phosphorylated, Ser2, elongation is activated. In order to terminate elongation dephosphorylation must occur. Once the domain is completely dephosphorylated the RNAP II enzyme is [...] "recycled" [...] and catalyzes the same process with another initiation site.|$|E
40|$|The <b>TATA-box</b> is a {{regulatory}} element {{involved in the}} Transcription Initiation Complex (TIC) formation and is conserved through the evolution at a strict location in promoters [1]. Some TATA-variants are also TIC binding sequences [2]. Nevertheless, {{few studies have been}} dedicated to their sequences and functions. We assume that the more TATA-variants share features with the <b>TATA-box,</b> the more they may be recently diverged motifs. We propose to identify, characterize and compare TATA-variants, in order to investigate their putative evolutionary links with the canonical <b>TATA-box.</b> Materials and Methods In plants, a description at the genomic level of the promoter architecture is possible for both A. thaliana and O. sativa due to the large availability of transcripts. We developed an ab-initio approach using the preferential location of motifs to identify biologically relevant regulatory elements[3].

40|$|We {{had earlier}} {{reported}} that mutations to G and C at {{the seventh and}} eighth positions in the prototype <b>TATA-box</b> TCACTATATATAG inhibited light-dependent activation of transcription from the promoter. In this study, we characterized mutations at the ninth position of the prototype <b>TATA-box.</b> Substitution of T at the ninth position with G or C enhanced transcription from the promoter in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. The effect of T 9 G/C mutations was not light dependent, although the 9 G/C <b>TATA-box</b> showed synergy with the light-responsive element (lre). However, the 9 G/C mutants {{in the presence of}} lre failed to respond to phytochromes, sugar, and calcium signaling, in contrast to the prototype <b>TATA-box</b> with lre. The 9 G/C mutation shifted the point of initiation of transcription, and transcription activation was dependent upon the type of activating element present upstream. The synergy in activation was noticed with lre and legumin activators but not with rbcS, Pcec, and PR- 1 a activators. The 9 G mutation resulted in a micrococcal nuclease-sensitive region over the <b>TATA-box,</b> suggesting a nucleosome-free region, in contrast to the prototype promoter, which had a distinct nucleosome on the <b>TATA-box.</b> Thus, the transcriptional augmentation with mutation at the ninth position might be because of the loss of a repressive nucleosomal structure on the <b>TATA-box.</b> In agreement with our findings, the promoters containing TATAGATA as identified by genome-wide analysis of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) are not tightly repressed...|$|E
40|$|The human snRNA genes {{transcribed}} by RNA polymerase II (pol II) and III (pol III) have different core promoter elements. Both gene types contain similar proximal sequence elements (PSEs) but {{differ in the}} absence (pol II) or presence (pol III) of a <b>TATA-box,</b> which, together with the PSE, determines the assembly of a pol III-specific pre-initiation complex. BRFU is a factor exclusively required for transcription of the pol III-type snRNA genes. We report that recruitment of BRFU to the <b>TATA-box</b> of these promoters is TATA-binding protein (TBP) -dependent. BRFU in turn stabilizes TBP on TATA-containing template and extends the TBP footprint both upstream and downstream of the TATA element. The core domain of TBP is sufficient for BRFU. TBP. DNA complex formation and for interaction with BRFU off the template. We have mapped amino acid residues within TBP and domains of BRFU that mediate this interaction. BRFU has no specificity for sequences flanking the <b>TATA-box</b> and also forms a stable complex on the <b>TATA-box</b> of the pol II-specific adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP). Furthermore, pol III-type transcription can initiate from an snRNA gene promoter containing an AdMLP <b>TATA-box</b> and flanking sequences. Therefore, the polymerase recruitment is not simply determined by the sequence of the <b>TATA-box</b> and immediate flanking sequences...|$|E
40|$|Transcription {{initiation}} {{requires the}} assembly of a preinitiation complex (PIC), which is nucleated through binding of the <b>TATA-box</b> binding protein (TBP) to the promoter. Biochemical studies have shown, however, that TBP recognizes the <b>TATA-box</b> in both orientations and, therefore, cannot account for the directionality of PIC assembly. Transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) is essential for transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoters. Recent functional studies have identified a specific 7 bp TFIIB recognition element (BRE) immediately upstream of the <b>TATA-box.</b> We present here the 2. 65 A resolution crystal structure of a human TFIIBc-TBPc complex bound to an idealized and extended adenovirus major late promoter. This structure now reveals that human TFIIBc binds to the promoter asymmetrically through base-specific contacts in the major groove upstream and in the minor groove downstream of the <b>TATA-box.</b> Binding of TFIIBc is, therefore, synergistic with TBPc requiring the distortion of the <b>TATA-box.</b> Thus, the newly described TFIIBc-DNA interface {{is likely to be}} a key determinant for the unidirectional assembly of a functional PIC...|$|E
40|$|Spacing {{mutations}} {{have been}} constructed between an SV 40 72 bp enhancer element and the Adenovirus- 2 major late promoter upstream element (Ad 2 MLP-UE), the Ad 2 MLP-UE and the Ad 2 MLP <b>TATA-box</b> and the SV 40 72 bp enhancer and the <b>TATA-box</b> {{in the absence of}} the Ad 2 MLP-UE. A clear periodic pattern of transcription from the Ad 2 MLP was obtained by inserting multiples of half of a DNA turn between the SV 40 enhancer and the Ad 2 MLP-UE. We interpret this as a stereospecific requirement for the spatial alignment between the enhancer element and either the Ad 2 MLP-UE or the <b>TATA-box.</b> Insertions between the upstream element and the <b>TATA-box</b> did not give a periodic transcription pattern, though insertion of half of a DNA turn increased the steady-state level of specific RNA. Unexpectedly, spacing mutations between the enhancer and <b>TATA-box</b> in which the upstream element had been point mutated gave indications of stereospecificity, whereas the same insertions with a deleted upstream element showed little requirement for a precise stereoalignment...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{transcription}} of most protein-encoding genes in eukaryotes is the binding of a transcription factor to the <b>TATA-box</b> promoter element. This <b>TATA-box</b> transcription factor was purified from extracts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using reconstitution of in vitro transcription reactions as an assay. The activity copurified with a protein whose sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel mobility is 25 kDa. The sequence of the amino-terminal 21 residues of this protein was determined by sequential Edman degradation. A yeast genomic library was screened with mixed oligonucleotides encoding six residues of the protein sequence. The yeast <b>TATA-box</b> factor gene was cloned, and DNA sequencing revealed a 720 -base-pair open reading frame encoding a 27, 016 -Da protein. The identity of the clone was confirmed by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli and detecting <b>TATA-box</b> factor DNA binding and transcriptional activities in extracts of the recombinant E. coli. The <b>TATA-box</b> factor gene was mapped to chromosome five of S. cerevisiae. RNA blot hybridization and nuclease S 1 analysis indicated that the major <b>TATA-box</b> factor mRNA is 1. 3 kilobases, including an unusually long 5 ' untranslated region of 188 +/- 5 nucleotides. Homology searches showed a region of distant similarity to the calcium-binding structures of calpains, a structure that has a conformation similar to the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA binding proteins...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} 13 -bp <b>TATA-box</b> sequence, TCACTATATATAG, was mutated at each nucleotide {{position and}} examined for its {{function in the}} core promoter. Specific nucleotides in the first TATA, the second TATA, {{as well as the}} flanking sequences influenced promoter function in transient transformation of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var Petit Havana) leaves. The effect of a given mutation on reporter gene expression in light versus dark was variable and sometimes contrasting. Some mutations, like T 7 or A 8 →C or G, completely inactivated the expression of the minimal promoter in light but not in dark. In general, the sequence requirement for dark expression was less stringent than that for light expression. The selective effect of <b>TATA-box</b> mutations on light versus dark expression was exerted on core promoter function in the chromatin-integrated state also. Even in the presence of an upstream light response activator element, <b>TATA-box</b> mutations influenced modulation of the promoter by light. An A at the eighth position was specifically involved in the red light response of the promoter. Selectivity in gene expression was associated {{with a high level of}} transcript initiation from a site that was not active in the dark. Nuclear proteins from dark- and light-grown seedlings showed that the sequence variation within the <b>TATA-box</b> governs the formation of alternative transcriptional complexes. The experiments give direct evidence for the role of a core <b>TATA-box</b> sequence in determining the level as well as selectivity of gene expression in plants...|$|E
