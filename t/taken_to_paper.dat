After confronting the man, Green called the police, then {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> pen <b>to</b> <b>paper</b> {{and produce a}} caricature.

[...] "Keep your eyes skinned, and you're good for a dozen of 'em," [...] he said sotto voce, {{and then turned to}} Stanner. [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this <b>paper</b> <b>to</b> Wild Cat.

At 2 p.m. on March 3, Bagby transferred the <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> Lieutenant James Pollard with instructions to deliver them to his commander Col. Richard L. T. Beale. Beale instructed that they be delivered to the Confederate command in Richmond immediately. Pollard arrived in Richmond at noon on March 4 and delivered the <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> General Fitzhugh Lee. Lee, astonished at their contents, immediately <b>took</b> the <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> President Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin. Davis quietly read through the documents in Lee's presence and paused {{when he reached the}} assassination order, remarking [...] "That means you, Mr. Benjamin." [...] Lee was then instructed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> the War Department where they were received by Secretary of War James A. Seddon. Seddon decided to release the documents publicly and sought Davis' approval to do so. The Richmond newspapers were contacted for a conference at the War Department and given copies of the orders, which were published the next morning on March 5.|$|R

50|$|There is some {{variation}} in how institutions {{make use of}} the results - candidates can contact the relevant institution(s) for more information. However, STEP papers are taken post-interview and results typically used to supplement candidates’ exam results. University College London (UCL) does not require the candidate <b>to</b> <b>take</b> STEP <b>paper</b> but getting grade 1 or 2 in any of the STEP papers could make up for an A*. Imperial college usually ask candidate <b>to</b> <b>take</b> STEP <b>papers</b> who are pursuing for Mathematics or Computer Science degree if the are unable <b>to</b> <b>take</b> MAT or if they apply to Imperial College London after the MAT exam.|$|R
6000|$|... "You satirical creature!" [...] {{she burst}} out gayly. [...] "If you had lived a dull life at St. Domingo, {{you would have}} <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> spoiling <b>paper</b> too. I might really have turned out an artist, if I had been clever and industrious like you. As it was, I learned a little drawing--and got tired of it. I tried {{modeling}} in wax--and got tired of it. Who {{do you think was}} my teacher? One of our slaves." ...|$|R

6000|$|It was Mr. Poinsett's turn <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the <b>paper</b> from Gabriel's hands. He {{examined}} it attentively by the fading light. [...] "That is so," [...] he said, earnestly; [...] "it is quite legal and valid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do {{not know}} exactly {{the state of the}} case," [...] she answered, [...] "but I will tell you what I think about it as far as I know. You must not be {{offended}} at what I say. If I am a friend to anybody--and I would be ashamed if I were not a friend to you--I must tell him just what I think about things, and this is what I think about this thing: I ought <b>to</b> <b>take</b> these <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Chester. I know her well enough, and it is a woman who ought to go to her at such a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you, Uiliami," [...] he said, [...] "have {{pointed out}} that the {{soldiers}} have demanded coin and refused the paper Fulualea has offered them. Tell them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the <b>paper</b> and see that they be paid to-morrow." ...|$|R
50|$|Barbara {{took the}} paper home. There {{she felt a}} spiritual urge <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the <b>paper</b> <b>to</b> Bergzabern. On her arrival in Bergzabern, she {{discovered}} that she had just missed Krausert, who had proceeded to Anweiler. The next day, she caught up with him, and showed him the paper. He sent her to a Brother's house, while he read the <b>paper</b> <b>to</b> {{the people who were}} assembled with him. These people did not want to consider anything she had written. They regarded Barbara as an inferior, an uneducated country maid. They ignored Krausert, who told them that the writing was the word of the Lord, against which he could do nothing. Because of this opposition, Krausert sent Barbara back to her father's house.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid, Colonel Ray," [...] I said, [...] "that {{you are not}} {{inclined}} to give me credit for very much common sense. <b>Take</b> those <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> Lord Chelsford. I will come round to your rooms as soon as possible." ...|$|R

Crossing the Great Plains in Texas with his father (Chris Cooper), young Ned (Sean Baca) is kidnapped by a brutal gang of Comancheros and, fortuitously, placed in the care of a Mexican-Indian mystic named Crecencio (Luis Avalos). This wily sage teaches the boy how to survive—and how to lie and steal, so that he becomes known as the Texas boy bandit.|$|R

50|$|This was {{the start}} of many a great adventure. The odd little puppy grew into a great and fearless dog. He was well liked, well {{respected}} and well behaved. He lived out his life at Percy's side with unwavering loyalty and his loving memory inspired many a bedtime story to Percy’s three children. However, it was only when FitzPatrick had made his fortune, settled down to have a family and become an established and well-respected member of society that he <b>took</b> pen <b>to</b> <b>paper</b> at the urging of his children and shared these delightful tales {{with the rest of the}} world.|$|R
6000|$|... "He had, then, several false keys. He <b>took</b> the <b>papers</b> <b>to</b> London to {{sell the}} secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans {{themselves}} back in the safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on this treasonable mission he met his end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} sleep," [...] said Jimmy, {{with a gesture}} of resignation.

6000|$|... "Man {{with a flat}} face," [...] said Dirk anxiously, as he slit away at the {{stitches}} of {{the saddle}} to find the letter; [...] "tell me about him. What was he like, and {{what makes you think}} he wished <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the <b>paper</b> from you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|MChemA: Mastership in Chemical Analysis The RSC awards this {{postgraduate}} qualification {{which is}} the UK statutory qualification for practice as a Public Analyst.

60|$|He did at last consent <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the <b>papers</b> in his hands, and to {{read them}} through with care. He took them away with that promise, and with an {{assurance}} that he would bring them back on the day but one following--should Mr. Scarborough then be alive.|$|R

50|$|This mildly {{photosensitive}} {{solution is}} then {{applied to a}} receptive surface (such as paper or cloth) and allowed to dry in a dark place.

Care should be <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> avoid alkaline-buffered <b>papers,</b> which degrade the image over time.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} {{emulation}} {{as a form}} of digital preservation {{can be seen in the}} example of Emory University and the Salman Rushdie's papers. Rushdie donated an outdated computer to the Emory University library, which was so old that the library was unable <b>to</b> extract <b>papers</b> from the harddrive. In order <b>to</b> procure the <b>papers,</b> the library emulated the old software system and was able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the <b>papers</b> off his old computer.|$|R
60|$|It was this, {{more than}} {{anything}} else, which made Paul resist; for {{even if he had}} no right on that particular spot, they surely had no right <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his <b>papers</b> from him; and besides, they were Johnny's property, not his. Therefore he felt he should defend them all the more strongly.|$|R

50|$|The {{most notable}} {{invention}} of the Han period was paper which spawned two new types of arts. Chinese Paper Cutting became a new concept. The idea of expressing symbols and Chinese characters already a part of calligraphy was now extended <b>to</b> Han <b>paper</b> cut outs. Another art form was the Chinese paper folding.

50|$|In 1935, {{there were}} 17,148 public, school and {{university}} libraries in Czechoslovakia, having a book stock of 8,528,744 volumes.
