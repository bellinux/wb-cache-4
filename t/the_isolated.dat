40|$|We {{report the}} {{isolation}} and characterization {{of a member}} of <b>the</b> family Enterobacteriaceae <b>isolated</b> from <b>the</b> gallbladder pus of a food handler. Conventional biochemical tests suggested Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, but <b>the</b> <b>isolate</b> agglutinated with poly(O), 2 O, 9 O, and Vi Salmonella antisera but not with poly(H) or any individual H Salmonella antisera. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing showed that there were two base differences between <b>the</b> <b>isolate</b> and Salmonella enterica serotype Montevideo, four base differences between <b>the</b> <b>isolate</b> and serotype Typhi, five base differences between <b>the</b> <b>isolate</b> and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, and six base differences between <b>the</b> <b>isolate</b> and Salmonella enterica serotype Dublin, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>isolate</b> was a strain of S. enterica.
