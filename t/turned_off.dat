5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> the vortex dissipated and any water would soon find its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deus Ex: Human Revolution is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game with incorporated first-person shooter and stealth mechanics. Players take {{the role of}} Adam Jensen, a man equipped with mechanical cybernetic implants called augmentations. The game's environments, ranging from open world hubs to more scripted environments, are explored in first-person, although actions such as hiding behind cover, conversing with non-playable characters (NPCs), and some attack animations switch to a third-person view. In these environments, players can find NPCs that will advance both the main story quest and optional side quests: completing quests, along with other actions such as combat with enemies, rewards Adam with experience points, which raise his experience level. Also accessible are black market vendors which supply equipment and weapons for Credits, the in-game currency. Interactive objects within environments can be highlighted, although these options are either <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> on the hardest difficulty or can be <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> in the options menu by the player.|$|E

50|$|The Emitter <b>Turn</b> <b>Off</b> Thyristor (ETO) {{is a type}} of {{thyristor}} {{that uses}} a MOSFET to turn on and <b>turn</b> <b>off.</b> It combines the advantages of both the GTO and MOSFET. It has two gates - one normal gate for turn on and one with a series MOSFET for <b>turn</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
50|$|During <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> {{the forward}} voltage {{of the device}} must be limited until the current tails off. The limit is usually around 20% of the forward {{blocking}} voltage rating. If the voltage rises too fast at <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> {{not all of the}} device will <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> and the GTO will fail, often explosively, due to the high voltage and current focused on {{a small portion of the}} device. Substantial snubber circuits are added around the device to limit the rise of voltage at <b>turn</b> <b>off.</b> Reseting the snubber circuit usually places a minimum on time requirement on GTO based circuits.|$|R
5|$|During the night, the {{electrical}} power suddenly <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> and the radios went silent. Just before 11:30pm, a huge {{stream of water}} swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people. A loud roar could be heard from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they {{believed to be a}} flood.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> any water would soon {{find its way into}} the engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E

40|$|An {{exploratory}} study compared {{the prevalence of}} multiple types of condom-associated ‘turn offs’ in men and women. Nearly 2000 people completed a web-based questionnaire. Data were analysed from 464 {{men and women who}} reported that condoms had <b>turned</b> them <b>off</b> the last time they were used. Gender differences were not observed for the majority (9) of 15 <b>turn</b> <b>offs.</b> The most common <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> related to loss of pleasure. For example, more than three-quarters of the men and nearly 40 % of the women reported decreased sexual sensation (P = 0. 0001). Putting on condoms was reported by 43. 2 % of the men versus 30. 2 % of the women (P = 0. 02). Smell was a relatively frequent <b>turn</b> <b>off,</b> with about one-third indicating this issue and no significant gender difference (P = 0. 32). <b>Turn</b> <b>offs</b> pertaining to arousal and orgasm were also common. Findings suggest that numerous physical and psychological condom <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> may be experienced by men and women while using male condoms. Although some <b>turn</b> <b>offs</b> differed as a function of gender, there was remarkable similarity between men and wome...|$|R

5|$|Blue and Red Landers, {{recurring}} {{characters in}} many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively. Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some {{of them are}} not items but non-player characters that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a password that allows the player to resume the game at a later time with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, she was {{the leader}} of the {{initiative}} to challenge the constitutionality of the Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for anti-censorship campaigners; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that filtering software on computers in public libraries could be <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> if so requested by an adult guardian. Krug warned that the filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare.|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to the 2011–17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason {{it had not been}} reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow again was approximately US$500,000.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E

5|$|The {{water was}} <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated {{the cost of}} electricity was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city {{would pay for the}} operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again during the winter of 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E
