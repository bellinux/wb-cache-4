5|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} ear, which has large numbers of auditory neurons, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation. The tawny owl's hearing is ten times better than a human's, and it can hunt using this sense alone in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> a woodland on an overcast night, but the patter of raindrops {{makes it difficult to}} detect faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.|$|E

5|$|Major-General Hunter's flying column set {{out from}} Kassinger, a small town {{a few miles north}} of Merowe, at five-thirty the evening of July 29, marching only at night so as to avoid both the heat of the sun and the eyes of any Mahdist lookouts. There was no road or path to follow, and the terrain upon which Hunter's flying column marched was nearly nontraversable; the route alternated between broken, rocky ground and ankle-high sand, {{ultimately}} proving extremely difficult to navigate in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> night. Added to these difficulties was the measure of speed imposed upon the column, as the mounted Major-General Hunter and Lieutenant MacDonald drove their units to their breaking points in order to preempt Mahdist reinforcements. The column advanced until midnight, completing a march of over sixteen miles. Sleeping during the day was made impossible by the sweltering heat; only when adequate shade was found in the barren desert could the exhausted men of Hunter's flying column rest.|$|E

500|$|Some of the North-eastern {{islands are}} {{populated}} by the white-skinned Kargish people, {{who see the}} Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The Kargish peoples have a distinct culture and geography: for example, they do not use written language, as they consider it an evil practice. The Kargish people have been described by scholars as being the analog {{of people in the}} United States; similarities include an organized religion, and a class system. This society does not believe in the equilibrium {{that the rest of the}} archipelago believes in, and does not believe in magic either. The Kargad empire is a theocracy; its monarch, the God-king, claims to represent the power of the Nameless Ones, described as the [...] "powers of <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> <b>of</b> ruin, of madness". The society is depicted as militant, and patriarchal. Le Guin suggests that though the God-king relies upon the Nameless Ones and their high priestess to maintain his authority, he no longer believes in them.|$|E
500|$|Burnham's wife of 55 years, Blanche (February 25, 1862 – December 22, 1939) of Nevada, Iowa, {{accompanied}} him in very primitive conditions through many travels {{in both the}} Southwest United States and southern Africa. Together they had three children, all of whom spent their early youth in Africa. In the early years, she watched over {{the children and the}} pack animals, and she always kept a rifle nearby. In <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> night, she used her rifle many times against lions and hyena and, during the Siege of Bulawayo, against Matabele warriors. Several members of the Blick family joined the Burnhams in Rhodesia, moved with them to England, and returned to the United States with the Burnhams to live near Three Rivers, California. When Burnham Exploration Company struck it rich in 1923, the Burnhams moved to a mansion built by Pasadena architect Joseph Blick, his brother-in-law, in a new housing development then known as Hollywoodland (a name later shortened to [...] "Hollywood") and took many trips around the world in high style. In 1939, Blanche suffered a stroke. She died a month later and was buried in the Three Rivers Cemetery.|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Colonel Smith, {{concerned}} {{about the safety of}} his men, sent flankers to follow a ridge and protect his forces from the roughly 1,000 colonials now in the field as the British marched east out of Concord. This ridge ended near Meriam's Corner, a crossroads about a mile (2km) outside the village of Concord, where the main road came to a bridge across a small stream. To cross the narrow bridge, the British had to pull the flankers back into the main column and close ranks to a mere three soldiers abreast. [...] Colonial militia companies arriving from the north and east had converged at this point, and presented a clear numerical advantage over the regulars. The British were now witnessing once again what General Gage had hoped to avoid by dispatching the expedition in secrecy and in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> night: the ability of the colonial militiamen to rise and converge by the thousands when British forces ventured out of Boston. [...] As the last of the British column marched over the narrow bridge, the British rear guard wheeled and fired a volley at the colonial militiamen, who had been firing irregularly and ineffectively from a distance but now had closed to within musket range. [...] The colonists returned fire, this time with deadly effect. Two regulars were killed and perhaps six wounded, with no colonial casualties. Smith sent out his flanking troops again after crossing the small bridge.|$|E

2500|$|In Odisha, {{the festival}} is known as Deepavali (Odia: ଦୀପାବଳୀ). The festival day starts with drawing rangolis {{in front of the}} house. The rangoli is drawn in the shape of {{sailboat}} on {{the ground in front of}} the house and is filled with items such as cotton, salt, mustard, asparagus root, turmeric and a wild creeper. Prasad is placed in the central chamber, over which a deepa of a jute stem with cloth wick is lit. This marks the beginning of Puja. Tarpanam – the ritual meant to invoke the spirits of the ancestors. Immediately after the dusk, all members of household gather for lighting Kaunria (pith of the jute plant). A lighted lamp is placed inside an earthen pot that is tied to a pole erected in front of the house. All the members then hold a bunch of jute stick in their hands and light them from the fire from the main deepa and raise the bunch towards the sky chanting the following verse. Then, in the presence of every member of the house, a bundle of the Kaunria is lit during the Puja and raised skywards accompanied with the chant: [...] "Badbadua ho andhaara re aasa aalua re jaa" [...] meaning [...] "O' forefathers come in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> the evening, we light your way to the heaven". The significance of the ritual is that we show respect to our ancestors who reinforce their absence from the physical world by our presence.|$|E
