40|$|AbstractThe {{whitefly}} Bemisia tabaci {{is one of}} {{the most}} important pests of the tomato Lycopersicon esculentnm in the world; it affects plant vigour, transmits geminiviruses and reduces crop quality. This experiment was conducted to determine the response of Bemisia tabaci population when tomato (Solanum lycopersicum MT 1) planted alone (non-choice), <b>tomato</b> planted <b>with</b> brinjal (Solanum malagna MTe 1), <b>tomato</b> <b>with</b> chilli (Capsicum annuum MC 11), <b>tomato</b> <b>with</b> okra (Abelmoschus esculentus MKBE 1), and all together (choice experiment) under glasshouse conditions (30 - 36 °C, 80 % RH). The results have shown that, there were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) numbers of adults, eggs and nymphs on tomato alone or planted with chilli, whereas significantly lower numbers of adults, eggs and nymphs were seen when <b>tomato</b> was planted <b>with</b> okra and brinjal. Generally, the number of adults and eggs was observed to be more on the upper stratum compared to the lower plant stratum. Interestingly, the number of nymphs was found to be higher on the middle stratum than on the other strata in all treatments...|$|R

40|$|A whole single {{cherry tomato}} was dried in a forced {{convective}} micro-dryer. The experiments {{were carried out}} at constant air velocity and humidity and temperatures of 50, 60, 70 °C. In order to study {{the effect of the}} skin, two sets of experiments were performed using a <b>tomato</b> <b>with</b> and without skin (easily removed). Shorter drying times were obtained when increasing drying temperatures as well as when removing sample skin. X-ray microtomography, a non-destructive 3 D imaging technique was used to follow shrinkage of the samples. This phenomenon was introduced in the modelling part of this study. Analytical solutions of the Fick’law were used to determine the diffusion coefficient at the three temperatures studied, and then the activation energy was obtained through fitting the Arrhenius equation. The skin effect was clearly evidenced by showing that the mass transfer parameter values of an original <b>tomato</b> <b>with</b> skin were largely smaller than the one without skin. Indeed, the moisture effective diffusivity ranged from 2. 56 × 10 - 11 to 7. 67 × 10 - 11 m 2 ·s- 1 with activation energy of 50430 J·mol- 1 for <b>tomato</b> <b>with</b> skin an ranged from 4. 59 × 10 - 10 m 2 ·s- 1 to 6. 73 × 10 - 10 m 2 ·s- 1 with activation energy of 17640 J. mol- 1 for tomato without skin...|$|R
