Each slave had for a day's rations a hunk of sour dough, no more. Yucatan is low, marshy, damp, hot. The Yaquis were bred on the high, dry Sonoran plateau, where the air is like a knife. They dropped dead in the henequen fields, and their places were taken by more. You see, the Mexicans won't kill outright in their war of extermination of the Yaquis. They get use out of them.

This paper {{presents the results}} of a comparison of two methods for determining the required widening of a forest road <b>traveled</b> <b>way</b> in small radius curves: the traditional method based on formulas and the traces curve method, obtained by simulating the {{movement of}} vehicles. Both methods were applied in the preparation of the Main project of reconstruction of the forest road “Rasadnik - Pustinac” with a length of 5. 285 km in the teaching base of the Faculty of Forestry “Majdanpečka domena”. In the project which determined the <b>traveled</b> <b>way</b> widening by the traces curve method, the total area of the surfacing was by 2. 79 % smaller than the area of the surfacing in the project which determined the widening using a formula. The width of the <b>traveled</b> <b>way</b> directly affected the scale of earthworks. In the first case, the volume of the cut was by 4. 17 % lower than in the second one. The volume of the filling decreased by 7. 05 %, and the amount of material needed for making the surfacing decreased by 2. 94 %. A smaller volume of earthworks and material required for pavement construction in the preparation of the Main project of reconstruction, in which the size of widening was calculated by the traces curve method, influenced the estimated value of reconstruction is lower by 3. 34 % than the total cost of reconstruction obtained in the preparation of the Main project of the same forest road reconstruction that calculated the widening size using the traditional method...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} eventual consequences (falls, unsteadiness, and cognitive impairment) of mild chronic hyponatremia, which is generally considered as asymptomatic. METHODS: In a case-control study, we focused on the incidence of falls among 122 patients (mean age 72 ± 13 years) with asymptomatic chronic hyponatremia (mean serum sodium concentration [SNa] 126 ± 5 mEq/L), who were admitted to the medical emergency department, compared with 244 matched controls. To explore the mechanisms of the excess of falls, we prospectively asked 16 comparable patients (mean age 63 ± 15 years; SNa ± 2 mEq/L) to perform 8 attention tests and a gait test consisting of 3 steps "in tandem," in which we measured the "total traveled way" by the center of pressure or total <b>traveled</b> <b>way.</b> Thereafter, the patients were treated and tested again (50 % of the patients were tested first with normal SNa to avoid learning biases). RESULTS: Epidemiology of falls: Twenty-six patients (21. 3 %) of 122 were admitted for falls, compared with only 5. 3 % of the control patients (adjusted odds ratio: 67; 95 % confidence: 7. 5 - 607; P <. 001). The frequency of falls was the same regardless of the level of hyponatremia. Gait: The total <b>traveled</b> <b>way</b> by the center of pressure significantly increased in hyponatremia (1336 ± 320 mm vs 1047 ± 172 mm with normal SNa; P =. 003). Attention tests: The mean response time was 673 ± 182 milliseconds in hyponatremia and 615 ± 184 milliseconds in patients with normal SNa (difference: 58 milliseconds, P <. 001). The total error number in hyponatremia increased 1. 2 -fold (P =. 001). These modifications were comparable to those observed after alcohol intake in 10 volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Mild chronic hyponatremia induces a high incidence of falls possibly as the result of marked gait and attention impairments. Treating these patients might prevent a considerable number of hospitalizations. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe sight {{distance}} (SD) on a three-dimensional (3 -d) compound curve {{has been studied}} recently {{in the absence of}} obstacles at road sides. Often, physical barriers are installed at road sides or in a roadway median for reducing potential collision severities; these rigid, semi-rigid, or even temporary cushion-type barriers can limit or reduce the driver's {{sight distance}}, depending on their horizontal offset distances away from the nearest edge of <b>traveled</b> <b>way</b> (ETW). The closer a barrier to the ETW is, the shorter the driver's sight distance would be. Since most barriers are constructed to prevent running-off road or crossing-median collisions, it is crucial to check whether the installation would reduce the driver's sight distance and potentially cause other traffic collisions such as rear-end or side swipe collisions. In this paper, an exact analytic framework is formulated with derived equations the first time to calculate the sight distance on a 3 -d compound curve {{in the presence of a}} median barrier, a roadside barrier, or a temporary cushion or barrier used for construction or other maintenance purposes. This framework provides an engineer a handy tool to examine the possible change of SD in the presence of a barrier and choose the required horizontal offset/clearance of a barrier from the nearest <b>traveled</b> <b>way</b> edge to meet certain design criteria or standards. This critical offset distance determined using this framework not only reinforces the importance of having roadside clearance recovery zones on highways but also provides a method to determine its horizontal clearance from a different standpoint. This analytic framework can easily be programmed into an Excel spreadsheet to evaluate the design of a physical barrier and its potential influence on sight distance along a 3 -d compound horizontal and vertical curve. Transportation engineers or practitioners may find this design tool handy and useful once the programmed spreadsheet is saved in a shared or a flash/thumb drive. Note that the sight distance on a two-dimensional curve, such as a horizontal or a vertical curve, can be calculated straightforward as special cases using the programmed spreadsheet...|$|E

40|$|Evaluation method {{employed}} {{for the proposed}} corridor projects by Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) consider road geometry improvements by a generalized categorization. A new method which considers the change in geometry improvements requires additional information regarding cross section elements. Part of this information is readily available but some information like the embankment slopes and obstructions near <b>traveled</b> <b>way</b> needs to be acquired. This study investigates available data sources and methods to obtain cross-section and clear zone information in a feasible way for this purpose. We have employed color infrared (CIR) orthophotos, LiDAR point clouds, digital elevation and surface models for the extraction of the paved surface, average grade, embankment slopes, and obstructions near the <b>traveled</b> <b>way</b> like trees and man-made structures. We propose a framework which first performs a support vector machine (SVM) classification of the paved surface, then determines the medial axis and reconstructs the paved surface. Once the paved surface is obtained, the clear zones are defined and the features within the clear zones are extracted by the classification of LiDAR point clouds. SVM classification of the paved surface from CIR orthophotos {{in the study area}} results with a classification accuracy over 90 % which suggests the suitability of high resolution CIR images for the classification of paved surface via SVM. A total of 21. 3 miles of relevant road network has been extracted. This corresponds to approximately 90 % of the actual road network due to missing parts in the paved surface classification results and parts which were removed during cleaning, simplification and generalization process. Branches due to connecting driveways, adjacent parking lots, etc. were also extracted together with the main road alignment as by-product. This information may also be utilized if found necessary with further effort to filter out irrelevant pieces that do not correspond to any actual branches. Based on the extracted centerline and classification results, we have estimated the paved surface as observed on the orthophotos. Based on the estimated paved surface centerline and width, we have generated cross section lines and calculated the side slopes. We have extracted the buildings and trees within the clear-zones that are also defined based on the reconstruction of the paved surface. Among 86 objects detected as buildings, 14 % were false positives due to confusion with bridges or trees which present planar structure...|$|E
