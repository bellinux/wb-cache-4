40|$|As guest editors {{for this}} Special Issue on driving and {{community}} mobility we were delighted by the extremely good {{response to the}} call and thank the many peer reviewers who worked tirelessly <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> strong <b>research</b> for publication.

The second will be published later this year, although the papers will appear online as a ‘virtual issue’ before that. Special Issue part one focuses on approaches to assessment related to the occupation of driving and community mobility, while part two presents approaches to intervention. We start this issue with the gold standard approach <b>to</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>research</b> evidence: A systematic review. The review presents methods and assessments used to assess fitness to drive after a mild traumatic head injury (Baker and Unsworth, 2015) and identifies the means and time-scales {{that can be used}} when making complex clinical judgements concerning resumption of driving...|$|R

40|$|Since 1991 the NHS has {{attempted}} to identify and prioritise its needs {{for research and development}} in a systematic manner. This has not been done before and there is little evidence on which to draw. Multidisciplinary expert groups have identified priorities in different topics using explicit criteria and after widespread consultation within the NHS and research community to identify pressing problems and opportunities for research. This paper focuses on a review completed in 1993 <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>research</b> and development priorities for the NHS in relation to the interface between primary and secondary care. The review covered several recent developments which require evaluation. The authors describe the process used <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>research</b> and development priorities in this complex subject and examine {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the approach.
