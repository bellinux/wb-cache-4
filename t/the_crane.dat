5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crane</b> {{fell into}} disuse in 1980s, {{and in the}} {{intervening}} period of neglect, <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> suffered vandalism to the wheelhouse and corrosion to the structure. In 1988 <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> was recognised as a Category A Listed historical structure.|$|E
5|$|After Wyllie's {{death in}} May 2012, a giant {{question}} mark was suspended from <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> in an acknowledgement of his work. In 2013, microphones {{were attached to}} <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> by American artist Bill Fontana, to record the sounds made by the structure.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{serviced}} by <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> were closed in 1969, and {{have since been}} filled in and redeveloped. The North Rotunda (part of the defunct Clyde Harbour Tunnel) stands {{to the east of}} <b>the</b> <b>crane,</b> and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre and the Clyde Auditorium to the west.|$|E

The geese and <b>the</b> <b>cranes</b> were feeding in the same meadow, when a birdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets. <b>The</b> <b>cranes,</b> being light of wing, fled away at his approach, while the geese, being slower of flight and heavier in their bodies, were captured.|$|R
5|$|Connected to a {{spur of the}} Stobcross Railway, the crane's {{primary purpose}} was the lifting of heavy machinery, such as tanks and steam {{locomotives}}, onto ships for export. As many as 30,000 locomotives were hauled {{through the streets of}} Glasgow by Clydesdale horses, traction engines and diesel tractors, from the works at Springburn to <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> for export to the British Empire. <b>The</b> <b>crane</b> is (as of 1988) not in working order, but is retained {{as a symbol of the}} city's engineering heritage.|$|E
5|$|Ships {{constructed}} by <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> include HMS Hood, the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth 2, and the Royal Yacht Britannia.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{regeneration}} company Clydebank Re-Built started a £3.75m restoration project in 2005, and <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> at night.|$|E

50|$|There are 15 {{living species}} of cranes in four genera. A {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study published in}} 2010 found that the genus Grus, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, <b>the</b> Siberian <b>crane</b> {{was moved to the}} resurrected monotypic genus Leucogeranus while <b>the</b> sandhill <b>crane,</b> <b>the</b> white-naped <b>crane,</b> <b>the</b> sarus <b>crane</b> and <b>the</b> brolga were moved to the resurrected genus Antigone. Some authorities recognize the additional genera Anthropoides (for <b>the</b> demoiselle <b>crane</b> and blue crane) and Bugeranus (for <b>the</b> wattled <b>crane)</b> on morphological grounds.|$|R
50|$|However, {{one problem}} that has arisen is that <b>the</b> <b>cranes</b> have begun to congregate only in Izumi, leading to {{research}} into how to get <b>the</b> <b>cranes</b> to winter {{in other parts of}} western Japan.|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1987, a {{full-size}} replica locomotive made from straw by local sculptor George Wyllie was hauled from the old Hyde Park Works in Springburn and suspended from <b>the</b> <b>crane,</b> then hauled back to Springburn and burned to reveal the metal framework underneath.|$|E

On August 16, Mark Bernes died. Ballad About <b>the</b> <b>Cranes</b> was played at his funeral.|$|R
50|$|This {{species and}} <b>the</b> black-crowned <b>crane</b> are <b>the</b> only <b>cranes</b> that can roost in trees, {{because of a}} long hind toe that can grasp branches.

40|$|In {{this work}} paper {{we will study}} the dynamic {{behavior}} of <b>the</b> tower <b>crane</b> during <b>the</b> horizontal – translational movement of the load hanging in <b>the</b> <b>crane’s</b> boom. Using computer simulations of <b>the</b> <b>crane’s</b> virtual model, we will study the influentia of this motion in <b>the</b> <b>crane’s</b> construction when fully engaged with load. We will try to find how does the load swinging effect the carrying construction, what happens when load stops somewhere in <b>the</b> <b>crane’s</b> boom and at the peak point, and how does this effects some main parts of crane. For this case we created virtually a whole Tower Crane using Finite Elements and model design application MSC. VisualNastran [4]. Dimensions are from standard manufacturers and using DIN 44 [1]. The results {{will give us a}} better view about the dynamic occurrences caused by the load horizontal movement...|$|R
5|$|Situated {{at the end}} of a U-shaped {{fitting out}} basin, <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> was used to {{construct}} some of the largest ships of the 20th century, including the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth 2.

5|$|The Finnieston Crane or Stobcross Crane is a disused giant {{cantilever}} crane (Hammerhead crane) in {{the centre of}} Glasgow, Scotland. It {{is no longer in}} working order, but is retained {{as a symbol of the}} city's engineering heritage. <b>The</b> <b>crane</b> was used for loading cargo, in particular steam locomotives, onto ships to be exported around the world.|$|E
5|$|The brolga (Antigone rubicunda), {{formerly}} known as the native companion, is a bird in <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> family. It has also been given the name Australian crane, a term coined in 1865 by well-known ornithological artist John Gould in his Birds of Australia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Siberian <b>crane</b> was {{formally}} described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1773 {{and given the}} binomial name Grus leucogeranus. The specific epithet {{is derived from the}} classical Greek words leukos for [...] "white" [...] and geranos [...] for a [...] "crane". Ustad Mansur, a 17th-century court artist and singer of Jahangir, had illustrated a Siberian crane about 100 years earlier. The genus Megalornis was used for <b>the</b> <b>cranes</b> by George Robert Gray and this species was included in it, while Richard Bowdler Sharpe suggested a separation from Grus and used the genus Sarcogeranus. <b>The</b> Siberian <b>crane</b> lacks <b>the</b> complex tracheal coils found in most other cranes but shares this feature with <b>the</b> wattled <b>crane.</b> <b>The</b> unison call differed from that of most cranes and some authors suggested that <b>the</b> Siberian <b>crane</b> belonged in <b>the</b> genus Bugeranus along with <b>the</b> wattled <b>crane.</b> Comparisons of <b>the</b> DNA sequences of cytochrome-b however suggest that <b>the</b> Siberian <b>crane</b> is basal among the Gruinae and <b>the</b> wattled <b>crane</b> is retained as the sole species in the genus Bugeranus and placed as a sister to <b>the</b> Anthropoides <b>cranes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Two sub-adult {{whooping}} cranes (Grus americana) wintered in {{the coastal}} marsh and grain fields of Brazoria County, Texas, {{during the winter of}} 1985 - 86. Observations were made on 59 days during the 75 day period <b>the</b> <b>cranes</b> were present. During December and January <b>the</b> whooping <b>cranes</b> primarily fed in waste corn fields. During February and March they fed primarily in brakish marshes. <b>The</b> whooping <b>cranes</b> flew over a tall electric transmission line a minimum of 80 times during the winter. To prevent <b>the</b> two whooping <b>cranes</b> from eating seed corn treated with pesticides it was necessary to haze <b>the</b> <b>cranes</b> on 5 separate dates. <b>The</b> whooping <b>cranes</b> began their northward migration on 31 March 1986...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cranes</b> had a 15-ton {{capacity}} and are mounted on tracks that run 1700 ft along the Delaware River waterfront at Trenton's southern limits. They were overhauled in 1952 and stand approximately 40 ft tall. Only the substructure of <b>the</b> <b>cranes</b> {{is currently in}} place.|$|R
5|$|The dock {{was used}} for fitting out vessels, and <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> would lift engines and boilers into ships. The lifting {{capacity}} of the Titan, {{and the location of}} the yard at the confluence of the River Clyde and River Cart, contributed {{to the success of the}} yard as it could build extremely large ships.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} a Pinfalls Count Anywhere {{match for the}} WWE Championship, as John Cena defended against The Great Khali. Khali had control {{for most of the}} contest, {{performing}} a spin kick and a leg drop onto Cena. The contest went into the crowd, as Khali hit Cena with a television monitor. Cena gained the advantage, swinging the boom camera by the crew set into Khali. Cena attempted to perform the FU, but Khali blocked it with his elbow. Khali regained the upper hand, scoop slamming Cena onto a crane. Cena fought back while on <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> and performed an FU to Khali off <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> onto the arena floor. Cena got the pinfall and the victory.|$|E
5|$|The sagas {{describe}} {{three of}} the ships in Olaf Tryggvason's fleet. According to Heimskringla, <b>the</b> <b>Crane</b> was a large swift-sailing warship with thirty rowers' benches, high in stem and stern. It was commissioned by King Olaf and used as his flagship for some time.|$|E
50|$|The genus {{formerly}} included additional species. A molecular phylogenetic {{study published}} in 2010 found that the genus Grus, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, <b>the</b> sandhill <b>crane,</b> <b>the</b> white-naped <b>crane,</b> <b>the</b> sarus <b>crane</b> and <b>the</b> brolga were moved to the resurrected genus Antigone that had been erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853. <b>The</b> Siberian <b>crane</b> {{was moved to the}} resurrected monotypic genus Leucogeranus.|$|R

50|$|The {{contract}} for <b>the</b> two <b>cranes</b> was signed on April 21, 1913. <b>The</b> <b>cranes</b> were <b>the</b> revolving type, {{at a cost}} of about $837,500 each. <b>The</b> two <b>cranes</b> were to be completed in 580 days and delivered to the Panama Isthmus by December 2, 1914, from Emden, Germany.|$|R
5|$|Within {{a couple}} of years, <b>the</b> <b>Crane</b> family {{suffered}} more losses. First, Townley and his wife lost their two young children. His wife Fannie died of Bright's disease in November 1883. Agnes Crane became ill and died on June 10, 1884, of meningitis {{at the age of}} 28.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. <b>The</b> <b>Crane</b> Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|E
5|$|Double-articulation cranes, {{which can}} load {{at a rate}} of 1,000tons per hour, {{represent}} a widely used method, and the use of shore-based gantry cranes, reaching 2,000tons per hour, is growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the speed at which <b>the</b> <b>crane</b> can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern gantry cranes, the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E
