5|$|The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joy-filled {{market of}} people buying <b>the</b> <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> Christmas dinner and {{celebrations}} of Christmas in a miner's cottage {{and in a}} lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die soon unless {{the course of events}} changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.|$|E

25|$|Literary critic Hugh M. Richmond {{notes that}} Richard's {{beliefs about the}} Divine Right of Kings tend to fall {{more in line with}} the medieval view of the throne. Bolingbroke on the other hand {{represents}} a more modern view of the throne, arguing that not only bloodline but also intellect and political savvy contribute to <b>the</b> <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> a good king. Richard believes that as king he is chosen and guided by God, that he is not subject to human frailty, and that the English people are his to do with as he pleases. Elliott argues that this mistaken notion of his role as king ultimately leads to Richard's failure. Elliott goes on further to point out that it is Bolingbroke's ability to relate and speak with those of the middle and lower classes that allows him to take the throne.|$|E
25|$|Heseltine's biographers Michael Crick and Julian Critchley recount how, despite {{not having}} an innate gift for public speaking, {{he became a}} strong orator through much effort, which {{included}} practising his speeches {{in front of a}} mirror, listening to tape recordings of speeches by television administrator Charles Hill, and taking voice-coaching lessons from a vicar's wife. In the 1970s and 1980s Heseltine's conference speech was often to be the highlight of the Conservative Party Conference despite his views being well {{to the left of the}} then leader Margaret Thatcher. He was eventually elected to the Library Committee of the Oxford Union for Hilary (Spring) Term 1953. The Oxford Union minutes record after a debate on 12 February 1953 that “Mr Heseltine should guard against artificial mannerisms of voice and calculated flourishes of self-conscious histrionics; this is only worth saying because he has <b>the</b> <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> a first class speaker”.|$|E
25|$|By the 1830s, {{the house}} and estate was in the {{ownership}} of Edmund's descendant Peter Hesketh, High Sheriff of Lancashire and MP for Preston. A man of somewhat liberal views for his time, Hesketh believed that the sheltered harbour and views over Morecambe Bay gave the area <b>the</b> <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> a busy seaport and popular resort for the less-affluent. With no rail link between London and Scotland, he envisaged Fleetwood as the transfer point between the railway and the steamers to Scotland, and set about encouraging a railway link from Preston. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he engaged Frederick Kemp as his agent. He originally considered naming the new town Wyreton or New Liverpool, but after changing his name to Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831, he settled on the name Fleetwood. After some delays, he recruited the prominent architect Decimus Burton, whose work in St Leonard's-on-Sea he had admired, to lay out {{what would be the}} first planned town of the Victorian era. The plans were complete by 1835, and construction of the first buildings and the railway line began in 1836.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{compared}} Monaco {{to other}} games and films. The most common comparison {{was to the}} 1960 heist film Oceans 11. Scott Nichols compared it to Oceans 11 because [...] "with its ensemble cast, daring break-ins and carefully laid plans, it has all <b>the</b> <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> an interactive heist flick". Anton Bjurvald (Eurogamer) also compared the game to Oceans 11. Roger Hargreaves mentioned that he felt like the game was [...] "Ocean’s Eleven meets Pac-Man and Metal Gear Solid".

WVU rebounded to defeat Texas Christian in the Bluebonnet Bowl, finishing the season at 8–4 with a No. 21 ranking in the final Coaches poll.

Iremonger was much more positive, assuring Larwood that his bowling required only fine tuning.

[...] "The {{best way to deal with}} him", Carr said later, [...] "was as if he was my own son".

500|$|Until the 19th century AD, European-written music {{histories}} {{began with}} mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented.

Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by archeological evidence.

[...] When contrasting the two teams, Wenger said: [...] "The game of Chelsea is based on experience and power, ours will be based on mobility and movement."
