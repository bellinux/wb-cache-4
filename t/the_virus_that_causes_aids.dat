Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with HIV, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS,</b> poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, a Kaiser Family Foundation {{study found}} that 95% of public {{secondary}} schools offered sex education programs. More {{than half of the}} schools in the study followed a comprehensive approach that included information about both abstinence and contraception, while approximately one third of schools provided students with abstinence-only sex education. In 2002, most Americans favored the comprehensive approach. A 2000 {{study found that}} almost all schools included information about HIV, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS,</b> in their curricula. There have been efforts among social conservatives in the US government to limit sex education in public schools to abstinence-only sex education curricula. The effectiveness of abstinence-only programs has been an issue of controversy.|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 award went to Harald zur Hausen [...] in {{recognition}} of his discovery that human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer, and to Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier for discovering the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whether Robert Gallo or Luc Montagnier deserved more credit for the discovery of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> has {{been a matter of}} considerable controversy. As it was, Gallo was left out and not awarded a prize. Additionally, there was scandal when it was learned that Harald zur Hausen was being investigated for having a financial interest in vaccines for the cervical cancer that HPV can cause. AstraZeneca, who with a stake in two lucrative HPV vaccines could benefit financially from the prize, had agreed to sponsor Nobel Media and Nobel Web. According to Times Online, two senior figures in the selection process that chose zur Hausen also had strong links with AstraZeneca.|$|E
