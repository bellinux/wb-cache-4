5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of the victims were {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement.

5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern.

The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E

5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not.</b> The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them).

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} days of Operation Goodwood Royal Navy {{planners}} decided not to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> well suited to the task. Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.|$|E
