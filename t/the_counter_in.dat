25|$|Benefits aside, however, {{orlistat}} is {{notorious for}} its gastrointestinal side effects (sometimes {{referred to as}} treatment effects), which can include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools). They decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug. In Australia, the United States and the European Union, orlistat is available for sale without a prescription. Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with consumer advocacy group Public Citizen repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds. Generic formulations of orlistat are available in some countries. In Australia it is listed as an S3 medication and so is available over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>in</b> pharmacies.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{practical}} implications of the theoretical results obtained in Part I [1] for queueing systems consisting of two single-server queues in series in which the service times of an arbitrary customer at both queues are identical. For this purpose some tables and graphs are included. A comparison is made [...] mainly by numerical and asymptotic techniques [...] between the following two phenomena: (i) the queueing behaviour at <b>the</b> second <b>counter</b> of <b>the</b> two-stage tandem queue and (ii) the queueing behaviour at a single-server queue with the same offered (Poisson) traffic as <b>the</b> first <b>counter</b> and <b>the</b> same service-time distribution as <b>the</b> second <b>counter.</b> This comparison makes it possible to assess the influence of <b>the</b> first <b>counter</b> on <b>the</b> queueing behaviour at <b>the</b> second <b>counter.</b> <b>In</b> particular we note that placing <b>the</b> first <b>counter</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> second <b>counter</b> <b>in</b> heavy traffic significantly reduces both the mean and variance of the total time spent in the second system...|$|R
