5|$|The cross-fjord route was {{in service}} from 1958 to 1964. It {{connected}} the three sea-locked communities of Venneshamn, Mosvik and Ytterøy {{to the mainland}} at Inderøy and Levanger. On workdays, the ferry made two round <b>trips</b> to Ytterøy and Levanger, three round <b>trips</b> to Venneshamn and five round <b>trips</b> to Vangshylla and Kjerringvik.|$|E
5|$|A man {{was sent}} to New York to receive payment for the stock, but Grey had {{forgotten}} that he had ever stopped at Martha's Vineyard. Colonel Beriah Norton made two special <b>trips</b> to London for the same purpose, and at one time {{he was given a}} hearing in Parliament. Very little was accomplished in these two <b>trips</b> to England.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} interrelationship between <b>trip</b> chain pattern and <b>trip</b> mode choice based on multinomial {{logistic}} model, using 2010 Nanjing resident <b>trip</b> survey data. Unlike previous literatures, <b>trip</b> mode choice {{is divided into}} single-mode and multi-modes in this study. Estimation coefficients verify <b>trip</b> chain pattern and <b>trip</b> mode selection are a pair of choices that influence each other. <b>Trip</b> mode is great positively associated with <b>trip</b> chain pattern of HW+WH, HO+OH, HW+OH, however, in return <b>trip</b> chain pattern {{is the most significant}} negative factor that affects <b>trip</b> mode choice, which means that no <b>trip</b> chain pattern would provoke travelers to select multi-modes. Despite the results seem to reach a contradiction between <b>trip</b> chain pattern and <b>trip</b> mode choice, still two facets of views try to explain the phenomenon, in addition, discussion on the interrelationship between complex <b>trip</b> chain pattern and multi-modes which might put forward more challenges to urban planning is also proposed as well in the paper...|$|R

5|$|All <b>trips</b> {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several <b>trips</b> in one day, or many <b>trips,</b> or many short <b>trips,</b> in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E
5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} <b>trips</b> {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer <b>trips</b> incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short <b>trips</b> from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} in 1912, the B {{operated}} 12 Boston-Albany round <b>trips,</b> one Boston-Pittsfield round trip, {{and as many as}} 10 Pittsfield-North Adams round <b>trips.</b> Around 1913 the New Haven planned to use the Housatonic as part of a New York-Montreal through route to compete with the NYC, but this never materialized and service levels were never high. After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round <b>trips</b> with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend <b>trips</b> were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E

5|$|Knightstone Island {{housed a}} theatre, {{swimming}} pool and sauna, after having been purchased by the physician Edward Long Fox in 1830 to create a therapeutic spa with range of hot, cold and chemical baths. After years of disrepair and dereliction, the area has been redeveloped by Redrow Homes. During 2006/2007, luxury apartments and commercial outlets have been built on the site.

5|$|The Harrisons {{made many}} <b>trips</b> {{out of the}} capital, which {{included}} speeches at most stops – including Philadelphia, New England, Indianapolis and Chicago. The President typically made his best impression speaking before large audiences, as opposed to more intimate settings.

40|$|In this paper, <b>trip</b> wire is {{implemented}} using video analytics technology. This <b>trip</b> wire {{is used to}} maintain security for outdoor and also indoor scene. Undesired motions in restricted areas are detected and tracked. This restriction to specific area of video scene is provided by drawing <b>trip</b> wires. Alarm indication will appear on moving objects which crossed <b>trip</b> wires. Direction of <b>tripping</b> is selected by user. Main advantage of this application is user can select single <b>trip</b> wire mode or two <b>trip</b> wire mode. Continuous Adaptive MeanShift (CAMShift) Algorithm is used for motion tracking. Mouse callback events are implemented to draw <b>trip</b> wires on video. Application is developed by using OpenCV library functions and C code...|$|R
40|$|Three studies {{confirm the}} {{existence}} of the return <b>trip</b> effect: The return <b>trip</b> often seems shorter than the initial <b>trip,</b> even though the distance traveled and the actual time spent traveling are identical. A pretest shows that people indeed experience a return <b>trip</b> effect regularly, and the effect was found on a bus <b>trip</b> (Study 1), a bicycle <b>trip</b> (Study 2), and when participants watched a video of someone else traveling (Study 3). The return <b>trip</b> effect also existed when another, equidistant route was taken on the return <b>trip,</b> showing that it is not familiarity with the route that causes this effect. Rather, it seems that a violation of expectations causes this effect...|$|R
40|$|<b>Trip</b> {{generation}} {{is a very}} important part in transportation planning and traffic engineering. It used as a model analysis to forecast the population, land use, economic, travels and revenues in area wide. From the <b>trip</b> generation, the other analysis can be carried out which are <b>trip</b> distributions, modal split and <b>trip</b> assignment. This study is an attempt to throw light on determine primary school <b>trip</b> production and attraction rate in Skudai Town. As generally, in Malaysia, <b>trip</b> generation has often been treated lightly with very little research works carried out. Regression analysis using multiple linear regression method was adopted for the modeling process. The data includes three parameters that are considered to determine school <b>trip</b> generations in Skudai Town are accessibility, holding capacity and cost index. The finding of the research shows that the accessibility is the strong factors that affecting <b>trip</b> generation in Skudai Town. This result of <b>trip</b> generation of primary school <b>trip</b> generation in Skudai Town is useful for the further study on <b>trip</b> distribution, mode choice and <b>trip</b> assignment in order to forecast the travel demand for Skudai Town in the future time period...|$|R
