500|$|The {{team had}} several goals: factions {{should not be}} [...] "locked-in" [...] to certain strategies; players should have {{interesting}} things to do without unbalancing the game, and the factions must be fun to play. The team believed the [...] "coolness" [...] of the Progenitor aliens would determine {{the success or failure}} of Alien Crossfire. They strove <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> significantly different to play, but still compatible with the existing game mechanics. The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres, a Planetary survey, non-blind research, and other powers to produce [...] "a nasty and potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down". Chris Pine modified the AI to account for the additions. The team also used artwork, sound effects, music, and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart. Other than the aliens, the Pirates proved to be the toughest faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{interpreted}} the Telmarines, including Caspian, as being Spanish {{because of their}} pirate origins, which producer Mark Johnson noted made Caspian [...] "a contrast to the lily-white [...] ". Production designer Roger Ford originally wanted the Telmarines to be French, as they had a confrontational history with the English, who are represented by the Pevensies. This was scrapped as the crew were unable to shoot at Pierrefonds Castle, for Miraz's lair, so they went for the Spanish feel. Weta Workshop created masked helmets for their army, and faceplates for the live horses on set. The stunt soldiers wield two-hundred polearms in two different styles, two-hundred rapiers of varying design, over a hundred falchions, two-hundred and fifty shields and fifty-five crossbows. Caspian's own sword is {{a variation of the}} Royal Guard's weapons. Costume designer Isis Mussenden looked to the paintings of El Greco to inspire the Telmarines' costumes. She wanted to use colours that looked [...] "acidic and hot and cool at the same time", unlike the red and gold seen in the Narnian soldiers. Their masked helmets are based on conquistadors and samurai. She visited the armour archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration. An eagle emblem was incorporated into the characters' lairs <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> fascist.|$|E
2500|$|The Maddox Brothers and Rose were at [...] "the {{leading edge}} of rockabilly with the slapped bass that Fred Maddox had developed". Maddox said, [...] "You've got to have somethin' they can tap their foot, or dance <b>to,</b> or <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> <b>feel</b> it." [...] After World War II the band shifted into higher gear leaning more toward a {{whimsical}} honky-tonk feel, with a heavy, manic bottom end - the slap bass of Fred Maddox. [...] "They played hillbilly music but it sounded real hot. They played real loud for that time, too ..." [...] The Maddoxes were also known for their lively [...] "antics and stuff." [...] "We always {{put on a show}} ... I mean it just wasn't us up there pickin' and singing. There was something going on all the time." [...] "... the demonstrative Maddoxes, helped release white bodies from traditional motions of decorum... more and more younger white artists began to behave on stage like the lively Maddoxes." [...] Others believe that they were not only at the leading edge, but were one of the first Rockabilly groups, if not the first.|$|R

500|$|Just Cause 2 was {{developed}} by the Swedish Avalanche Studios, with Square Enix London Studios providing additional support. The game's predecessor, Just Cause, was a moderate commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. The team thought that although it had potential, it was an opportunity missed and described Just Cause 2 as a [...] "sequel waiting to be made". Shortly after the start of development, the team begin analyzing the first game's strengths and weaknesses with the intention of improving it. They wanted to use the large open world to create rewarding quests and missions, dropping the first game's side missions in favor of faction missions, stronghold takeovers and race challenges to increase gameplay density (keeping players occupied, even when simply exploring the world). This density increased the connectivity between the faction and Agency missions. Another goal was to improve the game's combat and artificial intelligence, so action stunts would be easier to perform and the game's tactical element would increase. The team overhauled the artificial intelligence, improving enemy characters' reaction to player action and their environment. The game [...] features a Hybrid Locking System, which make aiming easier, and a real-time destruction system. The team refined the game's driving mechanics <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> more realistic.|$|E
2500|$|According to M. Hunter Hayes, Self {{has given}} his reason for writing as follows: [...] "I don't write fiction {{for people to}} {{identify}} with and I don't write {{a picture of the}} world they can recognise. I write to astonish people." [...] "What excites me is to disturb the reader's fundamental assumptions. I want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> that certain categories within which they are used to perceiving the world are unstable." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{band and}} their {{creative}} team focused initial meetings {{on what they}} wanted to communicate to the audience and how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel.</b> After defining the thematic arc of the show, the stage design began to take shape. Devlin explained the creative team's approach in designing the multifaceted stage: [...] "We wanted to respond to the geometry of an arena: all that oval air, how to energize the whole mass of air in those spaces so that the atmosphere reaches everyone in the room equally." [...] Williams found it beneficial to collaborate with two separate firms, Devlin's company and Stufish, on the stage because of their contrasting work methods. Devlin's team created physical models, while Lipson's team made animations and collaborated with Tait on construction drawings. Fisher was unable to physically attend any meetings after the first one, but did occasionally videoconference with the creative team via Skype. In the final meeting he attended before his death in June 2013, when Bono asked the team to think of an object that could symbolise U2 and be incorporated into the stage design, Fisher suggested a cross; the idea would be implemented into some of the stage's lighting fixtures.|$|E
5000|$|To {{ensure that}} the {{movements}} of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. They visited aquariums, went diving in Hawaii and received in-house lectures from an ichthyologist. As a result, Pixar's animator for Dory, Gini Cruz Santos, integrated [...] "the fish movement, human movement, and facial expressions <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> look and <b>feel</b> like real characters." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} people are {{attracted}} <b>to</b> those who <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> good can also explain why people are attracted to those they cannot have. Forbidden love is the most intense. Again, dopamine plays a major role. Beyond pleasure, dopamine is also associated with focus, motivation, and goal-oriented behavior. When a person cannot get somebody, the dopamine system keeps on spitting out hormones, providing the adrenaline, focus and motivation necessary to keep trying.|$|R

2500|$|In 1941 {{during the}} run-up to American {{involvement}} in World WarII, President Roosevelt appointed La Guardia first {{director of the new}} Office of Civilian Defense (OCD). Roosevelt was an admirer of La Guardia; after meeting Winston Churchill {{for the first time he}} described him as [...] "an English Mayor La Guardia". The OCD was the national agency responsible for preparing for blackouts, air raid wardens, sirens, and shelters in case of German air raids. The government knew that such air raids were impossible but the goal was to psychologically mobilize many thousands of middle class volunteers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> part of the war effort. La Guardia remained Mayor of New York, shuttling back and forth with three days in Washington and four in the city in an effort to do justice to two herculean jobs. On top of this, he still performed other gestures, such as arranging police protection with his personal assurances for local artists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, when they were threatened by Nazi supporters for their new patriotic comic book superhero, Captain America. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, his role was turned over to full-time director of OCD, James M. Landis. La Guardia's popularity slipped away and he ran so poorly in straw polls in 1945 that he did not run for a fourth term.|$|E
60|$|What showed itself {{especially}} in this interview was her tenderness for all young people.

She seemed interested to point out to them what they should see and study in London; and the charm of her conversation left on their minds an impression that subsequent years have never effaced.

Originally designed for use by college students, the exercise can easily be adapted for a wide range of student ages. The students are asked to locate people in the room who match items on a list (included in the report). This Human Scavenger Hunt provides an opportunity for students to become acquainted with the professor and with each other and could be a way to enhance the quality of instruction.

2500|$|During {{their long}} arduous return journeys, the Indians had {{received}} mixed treatment {{from the local}} Burmese; some Indians were treated with kindness, {{in keeping with the}} prevailing Buddhist culture of Burma; however, others were subjected to extortion, robbery, and violence. [...] Between 10,000 and 50,000 Indians refugees, according to one estimate, died from various causes before they reached India. [...] By May 1942, some 300,000 refugees had passed through Bengal en route to their homes elsewhere in India. [...] Back home, the refugees told tales of atrocities inflicted by the Burmese and of the viciousness of the Japanese attack. Rumor and panic took hold in many parts of India. In Assam, through which the injured British and Indian soldiers had returned in May, fears arose of a Japanese attack. In the United Provinces, where in Gorakhpur district alone, some 30,000 refugees had returned by the end of 1942, the Governor publicly lamented the low morale. In Bengal, a witness before the Government-appointed Famine Commission, recalled later in 1945, that the refugees were [...] "bringing hair-raising stories of atrocities and sufferings. The natural effect of all that on the people of Bengal was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> that the times were extremely uncertain and that terrible things might happen." [...] The civil administration in Bengal was also affected: the embittered and humiliated colonial administrators from Singapore and Burma who had appeared in Calcutta in early 1942 further unnerved the already demoralized and shorthanded colonial Indian civil service. [...] In many parts of India, the Japanese victory had created the public perception that the British Raj was vulnerable, its end near, perceptions that were to later draw increased participation in the Quit India movement of August 1942.|$|E
