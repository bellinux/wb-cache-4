Vance and Marsha are swallowed by the creature, as their bodies sink into the sand, much to the horror of their friends. Jonah sees the cracked ball from the night before and concludes that it must have been an egg, and whatever hatched from it has burrowed under the sand and has wiped out everyone, including Vance, Heather, and Marsha.|$|E

50|$|The group cannot {{call for}} help, as their phones {{are locked in}} the trunk of the car, and the car's battery is dead from their having left the {{headlights}} on all night. Mitch and Kaylee find hot dogs in the lifeguard shack and toss them at different ends of the beach to find out the extent of the creature under the sand. Thus they find the edge of it, and the group is momentarily hopeful until they realize the distance is too great. Jonah uses two surfboards as a bridge to reach <b>the</b> <b>picnic</b> <b>table.</b> He makes it to the table, but not before the creature has slashed his stomach, leaving a painful wound that starts to seep pus. He notes to the others, though, that the creature won't go near the ashes of the previous night's bonfire, indicating that it hates fire.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Spike {{manages to}} prepare the meal, he and Tyke are sit down to eat except that both chasing Tom and Jerry are no longer seen in this point.

The diving board Spike and Tyke are standing on starts shaking as the Ant Army gets closer. Then they push them into the pool while the food {{goes back to the}} ground where the Ant Army carry them off. Spike proceeds to the ground and grabs the steak from the ants before they can take it home. But at this time, the lead ant blows his trumpet as the Ant Army retrieves and marches off with it.|$|E
50|$|While {{searching for}} Jerry, Tom gets enamored with {{the aroma of}} the steam and goes up to the grill. Jerry, who was hiding behind the grill, places Tom's tail into the grill, causing Tom to scream and run around wildly with the grill in tow. In the process, he smashes the table where his owner is eating steak, ruining his luncheon and angering him further. Tom lands above the {{swimming}} pool with grill to cool off, but {{when he tries to}} get out in the water due to the grill's weight, until the owner, now having enough of Tom's tomfoolery, rescues Tom and furiously thrashing him for ruining his luncheon, all of while Jerry hides under <b>the</b> <b>picnic</b> <b>table</b> as covered his eyes with his hat. After the beating ends, the owner then ties Tom very tightly to a lawnchair in order to keep him out of trouble. Jerry then wheels the lawnchair out of the yard and attaches it to a car, and the car drives away with the horrified cat on it. After that, the owner returns to his grilling in peace, while Jerry climbs up onto the table to eat the owner's cooked steaks.|$|E

5000|$|Team Challenge: The Gazebo: Jake and Nicole {{are given}} the job of leading the contestants through the task of {{building}} a prefabricated gazebo, along with making a picnic table from scratch, and building a barbecue out of an old oil drum. Jake assigns Fabian and Jesse to build <b>the</b> <b>picnic</b> <b>table</b> which, despite getting very little direction from Jake, they complete without any trouble. The barbecue is mostly handled by Steve, who also manages to finish it without any trouble, though considers Jake's leadership {{to be more than}} a little nitpicky. Nicole leads the remaining contestants in assembling the gazebo, and quickly gets very flustered and snappy, causing the build to progress slowly. Things speed up once the remaining contestants join them, despite Nicole continuing to maintain a negative attitude. However, after having already witnessed several safety violations (including Jesse and Fabian both needing to be reminded to wear eye protection, and Jake's unsafe use of the angle grinder), Rob drags everyone aside to reprimand them for failing to wear the safety gloves that they were specifically instructed to use. He warns them of dire consequences should he see any more safety violations, but minutes later Fabian is caught without his gloves on a critical part of the build. An infuriated Rob immediately shuts the build down and declares the project a failure; consequently, no team is named the best for this task, and no-one gets an advantage for the next challenge.|$|E
