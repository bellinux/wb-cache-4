Kružić led {{the defense of}} Klis, and with his soldiers fought almost alone against the Ottomans, as they repeatedly hurled armies against the fortress. No troops from the Hungarian king arrived, as they were slaughtered by the Ottomans at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, and the Venetians baulked at sending any help.

5|$|Bede also covers Wilfrid's {{life in his}} Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, {{but this}} account is more {{measured}} and restrained than the Vita. In the Historia, Bede used Stephen's Vita as a source, reworking the information and adding new material when possible. Other, more minor, sources for Wilfrid's life include a mention of Wilfrid in one of Bede's letters. A poetical Vita Sancti Wilfrithi by Frithegod written in the 10th century is essentially a rewrite of Stephen's Vita, produced in celebration of the movement of Wilfrid's relics to Canterbury. Wilfrid is also mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, but as the Chronicle was probably a 9th-century compilation, the material on Wilfrid may ultimately have derived either from Stephen's Vita or from Bede. Another, later, source is the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi written by Eadmer, a 12th-century Anglo-Norman writer and monk from Canterbury. This source is highly influenced by the contemporary concerns of its writer, but does attempt <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> new material besides reworking Bede.|$|E
5|$|The CPFC 2010 consortium, {{consisting}} of businessmen Steve Parish, Martin Long, Stephen Browett and Jeremy Hosking, appointed former Scotland boss George Burley as the club's new {{manager for the}} 2010–11 season, with Freedman remaining at the club as his assistant. The club was short on players, with {{several members of the}} squad from the previous season having departed. One of Burley's first signings to bridge this gap was former Netherlands midfielder Edgar Davids. Palace started poorly in the league, however, and by November sat bottom, with Davids departing after less than impressive performances for the club. The club's away form {{in the first half of}} the season was poor and a heavy South London derby defeat to Millwall on New Year's Day saw Burley sacked, with Palace second-from-bottom in the Championship table. Dougie Freedman was appointed manager, Lennie Lawrence was brought in as his assistant <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> much-needed experience, and the duo successfully guided Palace to safety with a game to spare.|$|E
5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E

Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005 by Queen Sonja of Norway and the new research station the following day. After the opening, another power station was built in 2005. In 2006, a satellite base station was built by Kongsberg Satellite Services. This resulted in the need for a broadband connection for the base. During the winter season of 2006, there was no overwintering due to lack of funding, but from 2007 this has been re-instated.

5|$|The {{postage stamps}} of Ireland are {{issued by the}} postal {{operator}} of the independent Irish state. Ireland {{was part of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland when the world's first postage stamps were issued in 1840. These stamps, and all subsequent British issues, were used in Ireland until the new Irish Government assumed power in 1922. Beginning on 17 February 1922, existing British stamps were overprinted with Irish text <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> definitives until separate Irish issues became available. Following the overprints, a regular series of definitive stamps was produced by the new Department of Posts and Telegraphs, using domestic designs. These definitives were issued on 6 December 1922; the first was a 2d stamp, depicting a map of Ireland (including Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom). Since then new images, and additional values as needed, have produced of nine definitive series of different designs.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch East India Company (VOC) {{arrived in}} {{southern}} Formosa in 1624 and, after building their stronghold of Fort Zeelandia {{on the peninsula}} of Tayouan, began to sound out local villages as {{to the possibility of}} forming alliances. Although initially the intention was to run the colony solely as an entrepôt (a trading port), the Dutch later decided that they needed control over the hinterland <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>some</b> security. Additionally, a large percentage of supplies for the Dutch colonists had to be shipped from Batavia at great expense and irregular intervals, and the government of the fledgling colony was keen to source foodstuffs and other supplies locally. The Company decided to ally with the closest village, the relatively small Sinkan, who were able to supply them firewood, venison and fish. However, relations with the other villages were not so friendly. The aboriginal settlements of the area were involved in more or less constant low-level warfare with each other (head-hunting raids and looting of property), and an alliance with Sinkan put the Dutch at odds with the foes of that village. In 1625 the Dutch bought a piece of land from the Sinkaners for the sum of fifteen cangans (a kind of cloth), where they then built the town of Sakam for Dutch and Chinese merchants.|$|E
