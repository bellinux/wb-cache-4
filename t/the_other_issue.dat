5|$|The {{resilience}} of Indonesian Republican resistance and active international diplomacy set world opinion against the Dutch efforts to re-establish their colony. The second 'police action' was a diplomatic {{disaster for the}} Dutch cause. The newly appointed United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson pushed the Netherlands government into negotiations earlier recommended by the United Nations but until then defied by the Netherlands. The Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. The Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the 'United States of Indonesia' (RUSI). It would include all {{the territory of the}} former Dutch East Indies with the exception of Netherlands New Guinea; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> on which Indonesia gave concessions was Netherlands East Indies debt. Indonesia agreed to responsibility for this sum of £4.3billion, much of which was directly attributable to Dutch attempts to crush the revolution. Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949, and the new state was immediately recognised by the United States of America.|$|E
25|$|Virtual globes may be {{used for}} study or {{navigation}} (by connecting to a GPS device) and their design varies considerably according to their purpose. Those wishing to portray a visually accurate representation of the Earth often use satellite image servers and are capable not only of rotation but also zooming and sometimes horizon tilting. Very often such virtual globes aim to provide as true a representation of the World as is possible with worldwide coverage up to a very detailed level. When this is the case the interface often has the option of providing simplified graphical overlays to highlight man-made features since these are not necessarily obvious from a photographic aerial view. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> raised by such detail available is that of security with some governments having raised concerns about the ease of access to detailed views of sensitive locations such as airports and military bases.|$|E

500|$|Banks's 1859 reelection was {{influenced}} by two significant issues. [...] One was a state constitutional amendment requiring newly naturalized citizens to wait two years before becoming eligible to vote. [...] Promoted by the state's Know Nothings, it was passed by referendum in May of that year. [...] Banks, catering to Know Nothing supporters, supported its passage, although Republicans elsewhere opposed such measures, because they were seeking immigrant votes. The amendment was repealed in 1863. [...] <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> was John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, which more radical Republicans (notably John Albion Andrew) expressed sympathy for. [...] Not yet ready for armed conflict, the state voted for the more moderate Banks. [...] After the election, Banks vetoed a series of bills, over provisions removing a restriction limiting state militia participation to whites. [...] This incensed the radical abolitionist forces in the legislature, but {{they were unable to}} override his vetoes in that year's session, or of similar bills passed in the next.|$|E

She was the only twin-screw ship ever to have hoisting screws.

500|$|Buffalo, New York, {{announced}} {{interest in}} attracting the Grizzlies. The city had an appropriate venue in HSBC Arena (now KeyBank Center), {{home of the}} Buffalo Sabres NHL ice hockey franchise. Mayor Anthony Masiello, a former college basketball star, stated that the attempt was [...] "a long shot", but worth the try. The city previously hosted an NBA franchise in the Buffalo Braves, from 1970 to 1978, which was only dismantled because Paul Snyder, who owned the team from 1971 to 1976, was feuding with other teams that used Buffalo's only arena at the time (Buffalo Memorial Auditorium); some of those conflicts were no longer issues with the new arena, and Snyder was still active in business {{at the time of}} the Grizzlies bid. The Braves became the San Diego Clippers in 1978 and moved to Los Angeles in 1984; San Diego was also mentioned as a potential site for the Grizzlies, although the city lacked a suitable venue. Heisley visited Las Vegas, Nevada, where he negotiated with Mayor Oscar Goodman. The city offered the team free land for a new arena, but would not pay for construction. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> was Stern's demand that casinos stop accepting bets on NBA games as a precondition of placing a team in Las Vegas.|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the thought}} process behind {{changing}} Reyes' origin for the series, Bell {{said that the}} writers first wanted to ground the character in the more realistic world of the series and the wider MCU, and so though Reyes believes he is possessed by the devil in the series, they decided to instead tie the Ghost Rider figure to another dimension. Bell noted that the MCU film Doctor Strange also explores other dimensions and dimensional beings, and was being released {{around the same time}} that the episode was. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> that writers and producers had when approaching the origin story for the series is that they felt it was too complicated to translate accurately from the comics, particularly because the series had already used the character Mister Hyde in a different way to the comics and with Reyes' uncle Eli Morrow being a serial killer whose spirit possesses Reyes in that version. They decided to bring their origin story closer to that of other Ghost Rider iterations such as Johnny Blaze and Danny Ketch by having Reyes be more of a traditional [...] "Spirit of Vengeance", and use Morrow in a different way that was still as a villain and [...] "hopefully in a way that surprised people". They hoped that the series' version was true to the spirit of the comics' Robbie Reyes story while also connecting to [...] "the past of the other" [...] Ghost Rider characters, which was described as [...] "the best of both worlds".|$|E
500|$|A week later, {{the figures}} for a brand-new station at Laurence Harbor were released, saying the station would take {{five years to}} construct, with costs ranging from $25 million$30 million (2001 USD) of funding {{from the state of}} New Jersey and the federal government. The station would also relieve the busy Aberdeen-Matawan station, which at the time hosted about 3,500 commuters daily. Most of the city council and mayor {{supported}} the deal, except for councilman Joseph Hoff. Hoff believed the train station was a good idea, but {{there were a number of}} outstanding issues before plans for one could go forward. Hoff stated that the additional truck traffic and the safety of the pedestrians in the area were also a concern. These concerns would also get worse when the Atrium II office complex would be completed on the western side of Exit 120. Another major issue was the traffic congestion at Exit 120 itself, which at rush hour was [...] "atrocious". By November 2002, the station had not received any studies on the general location were not conducted by New Jersey Transit. Although the proposal still had support by the community, several citizens, including Joseph Hoff, were still questioning it. Hoff cited that New Jersey Transit has not put any interest forward and would just end up becoming another parking lot rather than a tax revenue. He reported however, that if residential homes and commercial businesses were constructed, it would be beneficial to Laurence Harbor. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> that Hoff maintained, was that it would risk the lives of children heading to and from Laurence Harbor Memorial School by affecting the traffic in the area.|$|E
2500|$|A {{frequent}} {{question and}} point of {{confusion in the}} ToK System is the definition and meaning of consciousness. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, {{it is crucial to}} recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are sentience, which is the capacity for mental experience and self-awareness, which is the capacity to be aware of one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a [...] "level 3" [...] phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a [...] "perceived" [...] electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the [...] "hard" [...] problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very direct analysis of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> of consciousness, that of self-awareness.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{issues with}} the orbiter's Ku antenna were noted by Cain, {{although}} he stated they would not impact the mission. The antenna was not handing over from Ku to S-band automatically as it should, which meant that teams on the ground had to manually switch the antenna from Ku to S Band and back again. [...] Sarafin noted that this was likely a software issue, and would not affect the crew on board, or the mission. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> {{had to do with}} the antenna's failure to [...] "lock on" [...] to satellite targets after being given the pointing data. Instead, the antenna was drifting, which meant that the teams on the ground would have to use an alternate method of pointing the antenna. There was a possibility that the shuttle crew would need to use a backup procedure during rendezvous with the station, but it was not a concern, and would not change the timeline, Cain noted.|$|E
