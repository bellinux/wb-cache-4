40|$|We {{have studied}} thermostimulated luminenscence and {{electron}} emission of nitrogen films and nanoclusters containing atomic nitrogen free radicals. Thermostimulated electron emission from N₂ nanoclusters was ob-served {{for the first}} time. <b>Thermostimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> spectra obtained during N₂–He sample destruction {{are similar to those}} detected from N₂ films pre-irradiated by an electron beam. This similarity reveals common mechanisms of energy transfer and relaxation. The correlation of the luminescence intensity and the electron cur-rent in both systems points to the important role of ionic species in relaxation cascades. A sublimation of solid helium shells isolating nitrogen nanoclusters is a trigger for the initiation of <b>thermostimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> and electron emission in these nitrogen–helium condensates...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} spectroscopic {{study of}} single ZnWO 4 :Fe crystals with different iron concentrations has been performed under excitation by ultraviolet light, by synchrotron radiation or under photostimulation by near-infrared light. The luminescence of Fe 3 +-related centres has been studied. It is shown that iron centres {{of different types}} efficiently promote the formation of crystal defects at low temperatures. Electrons and holes can be trapped near Fe 2 + or Fe 3 + ions, which is further revealed in phosphorescence, <b>thermostimulated</b> or photostimulated <b>luminescence.</b> At room temperature {{the main effect of}} iron impurity is to reduce the light yield of a ZnWO 4 scintillator...|$|R

Lithium tetraborate (LTB) doped with europium {{has been found}} to favour a further increase of the light sum storage of electron-captured centres.

40|$|Radiative {{relaxation}} {{channels and}} energy losses in In and Tl doped CsI scintillation crystals {{have been investigated}} {{as a function of}} temperature and excitation conditions to evaluate scintillation efficiency of the activator channel. Two activator concentration series of crystals were grown by the Bridgman method. Temperature dependence of excitation and luminescence spectra were measured under VUV and X-ray excitation; <b>thermostimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> was also studied. The observed drop of radioluminescence yield of doped CsI crystals at room temperature relative to the pure crystal is explained by the migration losses caused by charge carrier trapping on the activator centers. The energy losses in CsI:A at low temperatures are due to the trapping of charge carriers on different centers: self-trapping of holes and capture of electrons by the activator centers. We suppose that migration energy losses are the main reason for significantly lower luminescence yield of CsI:A at room temperature than that of self-trapped excitons in pure CsI crysta...|$|E
40|$|The {{luminescence}} {{and optical}} properties of promising cryogenic scintillator Li$_{ 2 }$MoO$_{ 4 }$ were {{studied in the}} temperature region of 2 – 300 K. The data on luminescence spectra and decay characteristics, excitation spectra, <b>thermostimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> curves and spectra as well as transmission and reflectivity spectra are presented for the single crystals grown by two different procedures, the conventional Czochralski method and the low-temperature gradient Czochralski technique. The bandgap of Li$_{ 2 }$MoO$_{ 4 }$ is estimated from the analysis of transmission, luminescence excitation and reflectivity spectra. Up to three luminescence bands with the maxima at 1. 98, 2. 08 and 2. 25 eV are detected in the emission spectra of crystals and their origin is discussed. In the thermoluminescence curves of both studied crystals, two high-intensity peaks were observed at 22 and 42 K, which are ascribed to the thermal release of self-trapped charge carriers. The coexistence of self-trapped electrons and holes allows one to explain the poor scintillation light yield of Li$_{ 2 }$MoO$_{ 4 }$ at low temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The unusual {{luminescence}} {{of particular}} varieties of natural pink calcite (CaCO{sub 3 }) samples was studied by laser-induced time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy at different temperatures. The luminescence {{is characterized by}} intense blue emission under short-wave UV lamp excitation with an extremely long decay time, accompanied by pink-orange luminescence under long wave UV excitation. Our investigation included optical absorption, natural <b>thermostimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> (NTL) and Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) studies. Two luminescence centers were detected: a narrow violet band, with {lambda}{sub max} = 412 nm, {Delta} = 45 nm, two decay components of {tau}{sub 1 } = 5 ns and {tau}{sub 2 } = 7. 2 ms, accompanied by very long afterglow, and an orange emission band with {lambda}{sub max} = 595 nm, {Delta} = 90 nm and {tau} = 5 ns. Both luminescence centers are thermally unstable with the blue emission disappearing after heating at 500 C, and the orange emission disappearing after heating at different temperatures starting from 230 C, although sometimes it is stable up to 500 C in different samples. Both centers have spectral-kinetic properties very unusual for mineral luminescence, which in combination with extremely low impurity concentrations, prevent their identification with specific impurity related emission. The most likely explanation of these observations may be the presence of radiation-induced luminescence centers. The long violet afterglow is evidently connected with trapped charge carrier liberation, with their subsequent migration through the valence band and ultimate recombination with a radiation-induced center responsible for the unusual violet luminescence...|$|E
