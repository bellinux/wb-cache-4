5|$|Formed by the {{confluence}} of three tiny headstreams on the southwest flank of Two Oceans Plateau in western Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park, <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> starts out as a small river flowing west and south into Jackson Lake. Its first 50 miles (80 km) run through the valley of Jackson Hole, which cuts between the Teton Range and the Continental Divide. <b>The</b> <b>Snake</b> takes a large bend northwest through Snake River Canyon, cutting through <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Range and into eastern Idaho, receiving first the Hoback and Greys rivers before entering Palisades Reservoir. There it is also met by the Salt River {{at the mouth of}} Star Valley. After passing through Palisades Dam, <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River flows through <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain, a vast physiographic province extending through southern Idaho across the massif of the Rocky Mountains and underlain by <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Aquifer, one of the most productive aquifers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River flows {{north to}} south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. <b>The</b> <b>Snake</b> River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River. Major tributaries which flow into <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. <b>The</b> <b>Snake</b> River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E
5|$|Many {{factors have}} {{influenced}} the construction of dams along <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River. A total of fifteen dams have been constructed along <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River for a multitude of different purposes, from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its mouth on Lake Wallula, a slackwater reservoir formed behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River. Dams on <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> can be grouped into three major categories. From its headwaters {{to the beginning of}} Hells Canyon, many small dams block <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> to provide irrigation water. Between here and Hells Canyon, the first dam on <b>the</b> <b>Snake,</b> Swan Falls Dam, was built in 1901. In Hells Canyon, a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from the river's lofty decrease in elevation over a comparatively small distance. Finally, a third cascade of dams, from Hells Canyon to the mouth, facilitates navigation. Many different government and private agencies have worked to build dams on <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River, which now serve an important purpose for people living in the Snake's drainage basin and trade of agricultural products to Pacific seaports.|$|E
50|$|These snakes {{can go for}} up to {{two years}} without food in the wild. A 5½-month {{starvation}} study showed <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> reduced energy expenditures by an average of 80% over the length of <b>the</b> study. <b>The</b> <b>snakes</b> also feed from within on energy-rich lipid stores. The most interesting finding was <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> grew during <b>the</b> study, indicating while <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> mass was shrinking, it was putting its resources into skeletal muscles and bone.|$|R
50|$|One {{feature that}} distinguishes <b>the</b> Chicago garter <b>snake</b> from other garter <b>snake</b> subspecies, {{especially}} <b>the</b> eastern garter <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis), is, in Thamnophis sirtalis semifasciatus, <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> side stripe is broken, near <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> head, into a dashed line by black crossbars.|$|R
50|$|Worship {{services}} usually include singing, praying, {{speaking in}} tongues and preaching. The {{front of the}} church, behind the pulpit, is the designated area for handling snakes. Rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, and copperheads (venomous snakes native to North America) are the most common, but even cobras have been used. During the service, believers may approach the front and pick up <b>the</b> <b>snakes,</b> usually raising them {{into the air and}} sometimes allowing <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> to crawl on their bodies. <b>The</b> <b>snakes</b> are considered incarnations of demons, and handling <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> demonstrates one's power over them. Members are not required to handle <b>the</b> <b>snakes.</b> Some believers will also engage in drinking poison (most commonly strychnine) at this time.|$|R
5|$|More than 11,000 years ago, prehistoric Native Americans lived along <b>the</b> <b>Snake.</b> Salmon {{from the}} Pacific Ocean spawned by the {{millions}} in the river. These fish were central {{to the lives of}} the people along <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> below Shoshone Falls. By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the Rockies and sighted the valley of a Snake tributary, the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the most powerful peoples in the region. Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans, which reshaped their hunting and cultures for the next few hundred years before outside settlement. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River basin. At one point, a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent a snake, giving <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River its name.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River, but rather feed <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Aquifer underneath <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to the west side of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E
5|$|Rugged {{mountains}} {{divided by}} rolling plains characterize the physiographically diverse watershed of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River. <b>The</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain {{was created by}} a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath Yellowstone National Park, where the headwaters of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River arise. Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes {{that occurred during the}} previous Ice Age carved out many topographical features, including various canyons and ridges along the middle and lower Snake River. Two of these catastrophic flooding events significantly affected the river and its surrounds.|$|E
5000|$|Some systems, {{including}} <b>the</b> original <b>snakes</b> implementation, {{allowed for}} user interaction to guide <b>the</b> <b>snakes,</b> {{not only in}} initial placement but also in their energy terms. Such constraint energy [...] {{can be used to}} interactively guide <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> towards or away from particular features.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Snake's</b> Skin (Das Schlangenhemd) (also {{referred}} as <b>The</b> <b>Snake's</b> Slough) {{is a novel}} by prominent Georgian writer Grigol Robakidze. It was written and published in the Georgian and German languages.|$|R
50|$|The Fauna of Peslières {{includes}} the Peslières Ouiseau Bird, <b>the</b> Grass <b>Snake,</b> <b>the</b> Recrimè <b>Snake,</b> <b>the</b> Time Travelling Velociraptor, and the Common Frog.|$|R
5|$|Southwest of {{the city}} of Rexburg, <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> {{receives}} from the right the Henrys Fork, sometimes called the North Fork of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River. The confluence with the Henrys Fork takes the river southwards through downtown Idaho Falls, rounding the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and into American Falls Reservoir, receiving the Portneuf River. The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain, carving out many topographic features and significantly altering <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River landscape. <b>The</b> <b>Snake</b> River resumes its journey westwards, then enters <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Canyon of Idaho, where it drops over Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that marks the historical upriver limit of migrating salmon, and passing under the Perrine Bridge. Close to Twin Falls, <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> approaches the southernmost point in its entire course, after which it starts to flow generally northwest.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Snake</b> River also {{shares a}} {{boundary}} with the Green River to the southeast; the Green River drains parts of Wyoming and Utah {{and is the}} largest tributary of the Colorado River. On the western extremity for a short stretch the Continental Divide separates <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> watershed from the Bighorn River, {{a tributary of the}} Yellowstone River, which <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> begins near. On the north <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River watershed is bounded by the Red Rock River, a tributary of the Beaverhead River, which flows into the Jefferson River and into the Missouri River, part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage basin.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Snake</b> River {{watershed}} is {{bounded by}} several other major North American watersheds, which drain {{both to the}} Atlantic or the Pacific, or into endorheic basins. On the southwest side a divide separates <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> watershed from Oregon's Harney Basin, which is endorheic. On the south, <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> watershed borders that of the Humboldt River in Nevada, and the watershed of the Great Salt Lake (the Bear, Jordan and Weber rivers) on the south.|$|E

2500|$|The habitat {{requirements}} for <b>the</b> queen <b>snake</b> are very specific, and this snake is never found {{in areas that}} lack clean running streams and watersheds with stony and rocky bottoms. The water temperature must be a minimum of [...] during <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> active months. This is in a large part due to <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> dietary requirements. They subsist almost entirely on fresh water crayfish. It preys almost exclusively on newly-molted crayfish, which {{are not able to}} defend themselves effectively with their pincers. One study indicates that crayfish make up over 90% of <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> diet.|$|R
5|$|The priests catch <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> {{and prepare}} to kill her, but are stopped by the goddess Kwan Im, who tells the stunned pursuers that <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> is {{pregnant}} and thus must not be killed. A month after <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> gives birth, the priests return. The snake-woman gives her child to Khouw and then surrenders herself to her fate. She is captured in a magical jar and brought away.|$|E
5|$|The rest of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River {{watershed}} {{borders on}} several other major Columbia River tributaries - mostly the Spokane River to the north, but also Clark Fork in Montana {{to the northeast}} and the John Day River to the west. Of these, the Clark Fork (via the Pend Oreille River) and the Spokane join the Columbia above <b>the</b> <b>Snake,</b> while the John Day joins downstream of <b>the</b> <b>Snake,</b> in the Columbia River Gorge. It is of note that the northeastern divide of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River watershed forms the Idaho-Montana boundary, so <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River watershed does not extend into Montana.|$|E
5|$|The river {{supported}} species including chinook salmon, coho salmon, and sockeye salmon, {{as well as}} steelhead, white sturgeon, and Pacific lamprey. It {{is known}} that before the construction of dams on the river, there were three major chinook salmon runs in <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River; in the spring, summer and fall, totaling about 120,000fish, and the sockeye salmon run was about 150,000. The historical barrier to fish migration on <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River was Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that occurs as <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River passes through <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain.|$|E
60|$|Three of <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> were hit, one quite seriously. These retreated, but <b>the</b> other <b>snakes</b> {{remained}} as defiant as ever.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the King of Avanthi Devavarma, who {{had been}} banished and {{wandering}} in disguise in the Sahyadri Mountains, saw these five snakes and decided to save them. He wrapped <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> {{with a piece of}} cloth and started travelling towards <b>the</b> west. <b>The</b> <b>snakes</b> slid out of the cloth wrapper and reached a nearby termite hill. One of <b>the</b> <b>snakes</b> called “Mandarathi” reached a part of forest, which came to be called as “Mandarthi” later.|$|R
50|$|In the lake, {{there is}} a white snake spirit who has been {{practicing}} Taoist magical arts {{in the hope of}} becoming an immortal after centuries of training and cultivation. She eats the pills and gains 500 years' worth of magical powers. She therefore feels grateful to Xu Xian and their fates become intertwined. There is another terrapin (or tortoise) spirit also training in the lake who did not manage to consume any of the pills; he is very jealous of <b>the</b> white <b>snake.</b> One day, <b>the</b> white <b>snake</b> sees a beggar on the bridge who has caught a green snake and wants to dig out <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> gall and sell it. <b>The</b> white <b>snake</b> transforms into a woman and buys <b>the</b> green <b>snake</b> from <b>the</b> beggar, thus saving <b>the</b> green <b>snake's</b> life. <b>The</b> green <b>snake</b> is grateful to <b>the</b> white <b>snake</b> and she regards <b>the</b> white <b>snake</b> as an elder sister.|$|R
5|$|According to legend, the Nez Perce tribe {{was first}} {{founded in the}} valley of the Clearwater River, one of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River's {{lowermost}} major tributaries. At its height, there were at least 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. <b>The</b> <b>Snake</b> River's annual salmon run, which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years, supported the Nez Perce, who lived in permanent, well-defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River. The Nez Perce also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute <b>the</b> <b>Snake.</b> Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E
5|$|At the {{confluence}} of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> and Clearwater Rivers, young salmon that swim down from spawning gravels in {{the headwaters of the}} Clearwater River often delay their migrations because of a significant temperature difference. (Prior to the removal of Lewiston Dam on the main Clearwater and Grangeville Dam on the South Fork Clearwater, the Clearwater was completely unusable by migrating salmon.) Agricultural runoff and water held in reservoirs higher upstream on <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> warm its waters as it flows through <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River Plain, so as <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> meets the Clearwater, its average temperature is much higher. Directly below {{the confluence}}, the river flows into Lower Granite Lake, formed by Lower Granite Dam, the uppermost dam of the Lower Snake River Project. Paradoxically, the combination of these factors gives the young salmon further time to grow and to feed in Lower Granite Lake, so when they begin the migration to the Pacific Ocean, they often have a higher chance at survival, compared to those salmon who migrate to the ocean earlier.|$|E
50|$|The common {{reptiles}} include: <b>the</b> Garter <b>Snake,</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Massasauga, <b>the</b> Hognose <b>Snake,</b> <b>the</b> Northern Water <b>Snake,</b> plus <b>the</b> painted turtle, Snapping Turtle., and {{the soft}} shell turtle. All of which are available to see at the nature center.|$|R
50|$|It burrows {{primarily}} {{near the}} Pouteria caimito, {{commonly known as}} the abiu, a tropical fruit tree, the nutrients of which supply <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> clutch of eggs. In turn the tree is fertilized by <b>the</b> <b>snake's</b> urine and embryotic fluid.|$|R
5000|$|According to Grigol Robakidze's nephew, Rostom Lominashvili, [...] "During the First World War, Grigol Robakidze was in Iran. It {{was there}} that <b>The</b> <b>Snake's</b> Skin took shape". Grigol Robakidze himself states that the idea for <b>The</b> <b>Snake's</b> Skin was {{generated}} in Iran: “The idea of <b>The</b> <b>Snake’s</b> Skin {{came to me in}} the summer of 1917 in Hamadan…”. In 1926 <b>the</b> novel <b>The</b> <b>Snake’s</b> Skin was published {{for the first time in}} Georgian, the language in which it was originally written. In 1928 Grigol Robakidze translated it himself into German, and left for Germany thereafter for its German publication, which included an introduction by Stefan Zweig a prominent Austrian writer of the time.|$|R
5|$|By the 1870s, the OSN Company, {{owned by}} the Northern Pacific Railroad, was {{operating}} seven steamboats for transporting wheat and grain from the productive Palouse region along <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> and Columbia to lower Columbia River ports. These boats were the Harvest Queen, John Gates, Spokane, Annie Faxon, Mountain Queen, R.R. Thompson, and Wide West, {{all of which were}} built on the Columbia River. However, there were more resources along <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River than wheat and grain. In the 1890s, a huge copper deposit was discovered at Eureka Bar in Hells Canyon. Several ships were built specifically to transport ore from there to Lewiston: these included Imnaha, Mountain Gem, and Norma. In 1893 the Annie Faxon suffered a boiler explosion and sank on <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> below Lewiston.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{explorer}} David Thompson {{first recorded}} the Native American name of <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River as Shawpatin {{when he arrived}} at its mouth by boat in 1800. When the Lewis and Clark Expedition crossed westwards into <b>the</b> <b>Snake</b> River watershed in 1805, they first gave it the name Lewis River, Lewis Fork or Lewis's Fork, as Meriwether Lewis was the first of their group to sight the river.|$|E
5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> would withdraw. In 2.5 years, <b>the</b> <b>snake</b> had accepted three species of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a spotted salamander, water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|E
50|$|Their habitat {{has been}} {{degraded}} by urbanization, illegal rock removal, vandalisation and indescriminate reptile collecting.
