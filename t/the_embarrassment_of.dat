5|$|Extravagant {{to a great}} degree, Ernest {{had many}} money {{troubles}} throughout his reign. In January 1848, Ernest visited his brother {{in the midst of}} political unrest in Germany. Upon his return, he also discovered unrest in Coburg. One of the many concerns related to finances. Although Ernest had a large inheritance, he also had frequent debts. There were increasing calls to nationalize most of his property. Indeed, Albert had to intervene at one point and spare his brother <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> losing one of his Coburg properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a {{disaster}} for the French. According to unofficial accounts, they lost approximately 900men killed or drowned and at least 300wounded, in addition to the loss of a number of the newly constructed landing craft. In France the newly appointed Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix ordered a second attempt on the islands soon afterwards but the orders were immediately countermanded by the French Directory, which did not want <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> a second disastrous attack. Instead, Lacrosse gave orders for most of the surviving ships to be sent to Cherbourg, detachments later reaching Saint Malo and Granville. Muskein was ordered to return to Le Havre with the remainder.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Lukashenko {{was elected}} Deputy to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus. He {{was the only}} deputy of the Belarusian {{parliament}} who voted against ratification of the December 1991 agreement that dissolved the Soviet Union {{and set up the}} Commonwealth of Independent States. Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent of corruption, Lukashenko was elected in April 1993 to serve as the interim chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament. In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials, including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich, of corruption including stealing state funds for personal purposes. While the charges were never fully proven against him, Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> the series of events and losing a vote of no-confidence. He served in that position until July 1994.|$|E

6000|$|Georgina got up, holding rather {{higher than}} before that {{beautiful}} head which, in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> this interview, {{had not yet}} perceptibly abated of its elevation. [...] "Would you have liked me to--to not marry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Anna {{leaned back}} in the chair and laughed softly. Even this man had {{accepted}} her for [...] "Alcide" [...] without a moment's question. Then all <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter flashed in upon her. She was suddenly grave.|$|R
5|$|In August 1909, a {{group of}} army {{officers}} that had formed a military league, Stratiotikos Syndesmos, demanded, among other things, that the royal family be stripped of their military commissions. To save the King <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> removing his sons from their commissions, they resigned them. The military league attempted a coup d'état, and the King insisted on supporting the duly elected Hellenic Parliament in response. Eventually, the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution. King George gave way, and new elections to the revising assembly were held in August 1910. After some political maneuvering, Venizelos became prime minister of a minority government. Just a month later, Venizelos called new elections for , at which he won an overwhelming majority after most of the opposition parties declined to take part.|$|E

25|$|The Beijing Guo’an {{football}} club {{was scheduled to}} play at the stadium, but later backed out of their agreement, citing <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> using an 80,000+ seat venue for games that routinely draw only slightly more than 10,000.|$|E

25|$|The Iranian {{reaction}} to 6 April press conference was {{to dismiss the}} entire thing as propaganda and {{to claim that the}} former captives had been dictated to by the British authorities into defaming Iran to hide <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> having violated Iranian waters.|$|E
25|$|As if <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> high {{involvement}} of the commoner in the agitations were not enough for the Congress, Baktavatsalam further added fuel to fire by claiming that he possessed documents proving the {{involvement of}} DMK in instigating violence, the documents which he could never publish.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1935, {{numerous}} factors combined {{which resulted}} in the termination of the highway camps. The federal government of R. B. Bennett used Section 98 of the Criminal Code in 1931 to arrest several leaders of the Communist Party of Canada. However, the lack of evidence and protests would eventually lead to the early release of the men, much to <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> the government.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{suddenly}} was Mrs Durby {{bereft of}} her treasure and thrown into abject despair. While {{in this condition}} she partially unbosomed herself to Captain Lee, and, contrary to strict orders, revealed all she knew about <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> Mrs Tipps, carefully concealing, however, {{the nature of the}} contents of her lost parcel, and the real object of her journey to London.|$|R
5000|$|For Bloom, “the Covering Cherub then is a demon of continuity...cultural history, {{the dead}} poets, <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> a {{tradition}} grown too wealthy to need anything more”. [...] Bloom considered the artistic struggle in Freudian terms, as a filial contest with {{a father figure}} carrying cultural authority - an Oedipal conflict with a superego either originally modelled on a culture hero, or influenced subsequently by such an ideal model.|$|R

25|$|Brandy Station was {{the largest}} {{predominantly}} cavalry fight of the war, and the largest to take place on American soil. It was a tactical draw, although Pleasonton withdrew before finding the location of Lee's infantry nearby and Stuart claimed a victory, attempting to disguise <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> a cavalry force being surprised as it was by Pleasonton. The battle established the emerging reputation of the Union cavalry as a peer of the Confederate mounted arm.|$|E
25|$|On {{her next}} voyage, {{which was also}} her first transpacific crossing, the {{problems}} recurred, and when she arrived in Hong Kong, Roach suffered <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> having his celebrated new vessel declared unseaworthy by the British authorities. Roach was forced to dispatch a team of workmen to effect on-the-spot repairs, and he now found himself denigrated in the American press as a builder of inferior ships. Even with the problems however, City of Peking had still managed to set a new speed record of 22 days on her first San Francisco to Hong Kong crossing.|$|E
25|$|Pardew {{moved to}} Charlton Athletic in November 1991, and was Charlton's top scorer in the 1992–93 season with ten goals. In 1995, Pardew {{appeared}} four times on loan at Tottenham Hotspur in the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup. He {{played in the}} team who suffered <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> being involved in Spurs' record defeat {{in the history of}} the club, when they lost 8–0 away to German side 1. FC Köln. Spurs had fielded a team made up of reserves and loanees, including Pardew, for their final group game in Cologne.|$|E

25|$|Visiting {{politicians}} and senior bureaucrats from South Asian countries {{are known to}} lack basic sense of social decorum and diplomatic finesse while on official representation. Lack of preparation in diplomatic protocol, cultural norms, culinary skills and restroom etiquette makes them prone to committing faux-pas to <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> their hosts, muted helplessness of embassy staff and amusement of the press-corps. Chinese officials are known {{to pay attention to}} their outward appearance and practice their roles/actions which are carefully choreographed before-hand to the minutest detail. In June 2015, an Indian Parliamentary delegation invited to the European Parliament in Brussels included a delegate who wore sports shoes to a meeting with the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz.|$|E
25|$|As {{the men and}} Mimì dine at the cafe, Musetta, {{formerly}} Marcello's sweetheart, {{arrives with}} her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting. It is clear she has tired of him. To the delight of the Parisians and <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> her patron, she sings a risqué song (Musetta's waltz: Quando me'n vo'—"When I go along"), hoping to reclaim Marcello's attention. The ploy works; at the same time, Mimì recognizes that Musetta truly loves Marcello. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get her shoe mended. Alcindoro leaves, and Musetta and Marcello fall rapturously into each other's arms.|$|E
25|$|In January 1988 he won {{his first}} top {{division}} tournament championship, which was also the first for the Tatsunami-Isegahama icihimon or group of stables in nearly twenty years. In 1989 he won 40 out of a possible 45 bouts in the first three championships of the year and came very close to promotion to the highest rank of yokozuna, but he was defeated by yokozuna Hokutoumi in playoffs in both January and May 1989. His 13–2 mark in May was his fifth consecutive runner-up performance, and his seventh overall, but he had been unable to win two tournaments in a row, regarded by the Japan Sumo Association as the minimum requirement for yokozuna promotion after <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> Futahaguro's brief tenure at sumo top's rank.|$|E
50|$|In time, Angleton's zeal and {{paranoia}} came to {{be regarded}} as counter-productive, if not destructive, for the CIA. In the wake of his departure, counter-intelligence efforts were undertaken with far less enthusiasm. Some believe this overcompensation was responsible for oversights which allowed Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen and many others to compromise the CIA, the FBI and other agencies long after Angleton's resignation. Although the American intelligence community quickly bounced back from <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church Committee, it found itself uncharacteristically incapable of policing itself after Angleton's departure.|$|R

'You have my warmest wishes, my dear Mr. De la Pluche, {{and those of}} my Lady Bareacres; but I am not--not quite certain about Lady Angelina's feelings. Girls are wild and romantic. They {{do not see the}} {{necessity}} of prudent establishments, and I have never yet been able to make Angelina understand <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> her family. These silly creatures prate about love and a cottage, and despise advantages which wiser heads than theirs know how to estimate.' ...|$|R

[...] "That makes her {{touching}} to me--it adds to the many good reasons for which one may want to help her. She's tackling a big job, and tackling it by herself; throwing herself upon the world in good faith and dealing with it as she can; meeting alone, in her youth, her beauty, her generosity, all <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> notoriety and all the difficulties of a profession of which, if one half's what's called brilliant the other's frankly odious." ...|$|R
25|$|Another serious fire {{occurred}} in Hastings {{in the spring}} of 1864, by which a fine brick store and a large stock of goods were almost entirely destroyed. Hastings was buoyant, rapidly progressive, and looking forward to the time ere long, it might become an incorporated village, when these severe disasters, followed by the general depression occasioned by scant harvests, and <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> the agricultural community, placed a barrier against further progress, and caused a withdrawal of a portion of the inhabitants to seek more remunerative employment elsewhere. But this dark day, it is believed, has to a threat extent passed away; and increased hope and renewed enterprise promise ere long to restore this fine village to more than its former prosperity.|$|E
25|$|Though Isandlwana was a {{disaster}} for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost. As King Cetshwayo feared, <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.|$|E
25|$|Commentators {{have stated}} that one {{motivation}} to submit these reports may be to avoid identification by other states as having failed to implement ICCPR principles, or risk <b>the</b> <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> being blacklisted. The publication of State Reports on the internet allows for individual access to a country's progress {{as well as the}} response from the HRC. Public accessibility to reports has been further aided with a United Nations General Assembly resolution (57/300) to make available in the UN information centre of each state, copies of recent state reports, summary records and concluding observations. This stigma that may result from non-compliance does not prevent some reports being excessively late, and in some cases, erroneous. The non-invasive nature of the process means the committee is precluded from enforce recommendations made during the reporting process, therefore the power lies with the state in deciding whether the observe these observations.|$|E

5000|$|There is a {{modified}} version of the game called [...] "Thoughtful Solitaire", in which the identity of all 52 cards is known.

Similarly, all dead-ends in Thoughtful will be dead ends in Klondike. [...] However, the theoretical odds of winning a standard game of non-Thoughtful Klondike are currently not known exactly. The inability of theoreticians to precisely calculate these odds has been referred to by mathematician Persi Diaconis as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> applied probability".|$|R
