5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E

40|$|Abstract / In {{this article}} I examine <b>the</b> {{deployment}} of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> {{in two different}} contexts.

I then look at the marketing and consumption of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in <b>the</b> (over) developed world, focusing on the USA. I argue that the Philippine protest movement, known as People Power II, indicates the medium’s progressive potential, while <b>the</b> marketing of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> in <b>the</b> USA indicates the medium’s reactionary potential, or, borrowing a term from Paul Virilio, <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone’s</b> potential as ‘technological nanny’.

The investigators traced the SUV's last registered owner, and the female college student who sold the suspect the Pathfinder. Law enforcement officials recovered the suspect's pre-paid disposable cell phone's number from <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> of the seller, and ran it through a number of databases. They determined that the disposable phone had been used for calls to and from a Pakistani telephone number which they knew to be associated with Faisal Shahzad. The phone had also been used to call a fireworks store in rural Pennsylvania. They collected his e-mail address from an email which he sent to the seller’s computer.|$|E
25|$|New spotter {{technologies}} and training techniques have been developing since the 1960s. Prior to the 1960s, {{the vast majority}} of amateur radio communication relied on AM-modulated signals and the use of simplex. It was not uncommon for spotters to hear the distant net control station and not hear other mobile or base stations which were much closer. After 1960, amateurs adopted the use of FM repeaters which operated in the VHF spectrum. The use of FM repeaters was a huge advancement for storm spotters; spotters could now hear each other regularly. The low noise floor and greatly improved audio quality meant much better signal reception for all stations. By the 1970s, nearly all spotter radio activity consisted of half-duplex FM repeater use. The next major technology to aid spotters was the development of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was then possible for non-amateur radio operators to directly report severe weather.|$|E

25|$|Kristiansen's mother testified {{during the}} trial that she saw her son {{arriving}} and walking in the backyard {{on the evening of}} the murders, and as such could not have been at the murder-site. This statement also matched the measurements in the telecommunication reports since the cell cite connected to Kristiansen's phone was close to his home, a fact Kristiansen's mother couldn't have known about since <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> alibi wasn't discovered until the trial was almost over. Furthermore, a witness saw a man together with two girls right before the crime. The description he gave matched Andersen and the victims. He did not see a second man, and it's unlikely that the witness saw Kristiansen instead of Andersen since Kristansen is a short and thin while Andersen is tall and big. Despite extensive public outreach for everyone who was in the area to contact the police, no other people matched this description. This witness, a commercial airline pilot, was not called as witness to the trials. Additional 5 people that heard or saw relevant activity that did not fit the timeline created by the police were not called as witness to the court either.|$|E
25|$|In {{respect to}} the other {{non-lethal}} weapon effects from an IND detonated {{on or near the}} surface, the detonation's blast wave would likely produce a momentary electric grid blackout due to the loss of a large portion of a city's electrical equipment drawing power/electrical load, while the electromagnetic pulse(EMP) from a surface/ground-burst explosion would cause little damage outside the blast area, so cell phone towers that survive the blast should be capable of carrying communications. Although if communications during the 9/11 attacks or after a major hurricane are anything to go by, and <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> network towers survive, the service would be overloaded(a Mass call event) and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and emergency responders are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service. However, as Civil defense(CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality, they contained amongst other things, at least one CDV-715 radiation survey meter and a CD emergency radio receiver which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help and if communications continued, inform them of the outside situation as it developed.|$|E
