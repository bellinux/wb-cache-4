In the first few years, the park added a circle swing, a Whip, a miniature railroad, and in 1938, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company Rollo Coaster. World War II and the resulting rationing forced the park to close in 1943. Upon reopening in 1946, the park added the Caterpillar and a small showboat that sailed in Lake Bouquet.|$|E

5|$|Becoming an {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season, Alberts signed a two-year deal with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 16, 2009. The contract paid him $800,000 <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> $1.3 million the second. After appearing in 62 games for Carolina, he was dealt at the 2009–10 trade deadline on March 3, 2010, to the Vancouver Canucks {{in exchange for a}} third round pick in the 2010 draft (Austin Levi). Between Carolina and Vancouver, Alberts finished the regular season with 3 goals and 12 points over 76 games. His defensive play struggled in his initial stint with Vancouver, often being made a healthy scratch. He continued to earn criticism from Vancouver fans and media in the playoffs, particularly for his lack of speed and for taking costly penalties.|$|E
5|$|Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) is a {{four-year}} Doctoral programme in Management started in 2000.

Students who have completed PGDM from any of the IIMs are admitted directly to the second year.

40|$|Studio {{pedagogy}} is {{intrinsic to}} most education programmes within {{the built environment}} higher education sector. As student numbers increase and academic institutions place pressure on staff to achieve more with less, improve student retention <b>and</b> heighten <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> experience, appropriate <b>and</b> effective pedagogies become critical. Consequently, studio teaching and learning environments, and in particular planning studios in most countries have been re-thought and re-structured in recent years. Our paper will draw upon some {{of the literature on}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> experience <b>and</b> planning studio teaching and learning in general. We will discuss the changes made to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> planning studio <b>and</b> comment on possibilities for and relevance of planning studios, specifically in relation to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> experience <b>and</b> as a means to address the institutional call for economic and efficient teaching models that deliver excellence teaching and learning outcomes. Results show that by restructuring a planning studio to include an intensive mode of delivery, time and cost saving can be achieved and student outcomes improved.

5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} {{periodic}} attempts to restore service in southern Montana and North Dakota.

This proposal went nowhere as neither state voted funds. Another proposal mooted in 1991 would have required an additional yearly federal appropriation of $12–15 million plus new equipment. In this scenario the Portland section would operate over the old route. Again, nothing came of it.|$|E

5|$|With Bertuzzi {{entering}} {{the final year}} of his contract, the Canucks began negotiating a contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. Despite Bertuzzi's agent, Pat Morris, declaring that they would cease negotiations once the season began, Bertuzzi signed a four-year, $27.8 million deal with the Canucks on October 23, 2003. The contract took effect immediately, erasing the last year on his previous contract, and included a $3 million signing bonus ($2.5 million paid in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> $500,000 in the second).

5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} the clashes around Constantinople are unclear, as Theophanes {{condenses}} the siege in his account of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> the Arab chroniclers do not mention the siege at all but merely provide the names of leaders of unspecified expeditions into Byzantine territory. Thus from the Arab sources it is only known that Abdallah ibn Qays and Fadhala ibn 'Ubayd raided Crete and wintered there in 675, while {{in the same year}} Malik ibn Abdallah led a raid into Asia Minor. The Arab historians Ibn Wadih and al-Tabari report that Yazid was dispatched by Mu'awiya with reinforcements to Constantinople in 676, and record that Abdallah ibn Qays led a campaign in 677, whose target is unknown. At the same time, the Byzantines had to face a Slavic attack on Thessalonica and Lombard attacks in Italy. Finally, in autumn 677 or early 678 Constantine IV resolved to confront the Arab besiegers in a head-on engagement. His fleet, equipped with Greek fire, routed the Arab fleet. It is probable that the death of admiral Yazid ibn Shagara, reported by Arab chroniclers for 677/678, is related to this defeat. At about the same time, the Muslim army in Asia Minor, under the command of Sufyan ibn 'Awf, was defeated by the Byzantine army under the generals Phloros, Petron and Cyprian, losing 30,000 men according to Theophanes. These defeats forced the Arabs to abandon the siege in 678. On its way back to Syria, the Arab fleet was almost annihilated in a storm off Syllaion.|$|E
