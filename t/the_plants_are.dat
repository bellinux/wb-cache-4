5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds {{from these}} plants are noted for their oil content, but little {{information}} is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.|$|E
5|$|Routine care {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> young. <b>The</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} {{grown as}} ornamentals. Dead stems decay {{to leave a}} hollow wooden tube with a pattern of lengthwise slits. These are sometimes used as canes or to make curios. The Roman Catholic Penitentes of New Mexico formerly tied fresh stems to their bare backs in Holy Week processions. The Zuni people use the imbricata variety ceremonially.|$|E
50|$|This <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> used in gardens. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} beekeeping, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> rich in pollen and nectar.|$|R
50|$|Horticultural {{collection}} {{and the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> slow growing contribute to the fact that <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> endangered.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} used in herbalism. In medieval times <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{thought to be}} an antidote for leprosy.|$|R
5|$|C.maxima {{originated}} in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay. <b>The</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> sensitive to frost, and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. C.maxima {{did not start}} to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of C.maxima include triloba, zapallito, zipinka, Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow (C.maxima Marrow), Show, and Turban.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid {{is a major}} pest of sugar beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. <b>The</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, {{after the}} Russo-Finnish War of 1939—1940, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> built in <b>the</b> area of Sortavala, which {{became part of}} the newly created Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.In 1944 <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed after <b>the</b> Finnish occupation.In 1970 <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{upgraded}} with new soviet equipment.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the bitter}} {{taste of the}} tubers, they are edible and have {{nutritional}} value. Some part of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> eaten by humans {{at some point in}} ancient history. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> known to have a high amount of carbohydrates. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> known to have been eaten in Africa in famine-stricken areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> diminutive, and a hand-lens is {{necessary}} for proper identification. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> very sensitive to temperature and precipitation, and under drought or hot conditions the seeds will not germinate or survive. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> visible anywhere from February through July during good rain year, but most years <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> only visible from April to June. Each minute flower yields one seed. This species is octoploid and probably arose through hybridization between other Chorizanthe, perhaps C. procumbens and C. polygonoides.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> scapose, {{having a}} single central {{leafless}} hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves {{arise from the}} bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendent), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E
5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they are unaware that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, unaware that <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> illegal, they have not engaged in a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1961 to build Moto-Ski snowmobiles and <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} to railcars in 1971 (Bombardier continued to market Moto-Ski until 1985).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{first used}} as a {{medicinal}} herb in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks used the root to treat dysentery, toothaches and animal bites. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> also found in a few European pharmacies {{during the nineteenth century}} and was {{used as a}}n antisyphilitic agent and to treat rabies. Today, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> not usually used medically.|$|R
5|$|V. thapsus is a {{dicotyledonous}} {{plant that}} produces a rosette of leaves {{in its first year}} of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n=36.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> {{often called}} kantong semar (Semar's pocket) in Indonesia and sako ni Hudas (Judas' money bag) in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> {{sensitive}} to frost. For flowering, Capsicum is a non-photoperiod-sensitive crop. The flowers can self-pollinate. However, at extremely high temperature, , pollen loses viability, and flowers {{are much less}} likely to pollinate successfully.|$|E
