5|$|The {{structure}} of the bright portion of <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> is primarily caused by the interaction of a fast stellar wind being emitted by the central PNN with the visible material ejected during the formation of <b>the</b> <b>nebula.</b> This interaction causes the emission of X-rays discussed above. The stellar wind, blowing with the velocity as high as , has 'hollowed out' the inner bubble of <b>the</b> <b>nebula,</b> and appears to have burst the bubble at both ends.|$|E
5|$|Later on the bridge, Data is {{reviewing}} {{the information from}} the probes sent into <b>the</b> <b>nebula.</b> He theorises that life might have evolved differently in <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within <b>the</b> <b>nebula.</b> Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him on the cheek and then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data seeks the opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn). Data decides to pursue the relationship and goes to D'Sora's cabin with a bunch of flowers, where he informs her that he created a romantic subroutine for the relationship.|$|E
5|$|The known {{expansion}} {{rate of the}} Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> are symmetrical, the projection of <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae is clearly at the same distance.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} <b>the</b> {{star and}} <b>nebula</b> visualization techniques {{used to create}} a 3 D volumetric visualization of <b>the</b> Orion <b>Nebula.</b> <b>The</b> <b>nebula's</b> ionization layer is modeled first as a surface model, derived from infrared and visible light observations.

5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E

5|$|In the {{northern}} part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514. This planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> is a luminous gas, rather than stars.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nebula</b> Awards {{annually}} {{recognize the}} best works {{of science fiction}} or fantasy published in the United States. The awards are organized and awarded by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), a nonprofit association of professional science fiction and fantasy writers. They were first given in 1966 at a ceremony created for the awards, and are given in four categories for different lengths of literary works. A fifth category for film and television episode scripts was given 1974–78 and 2000–09. The rules governing <b>the</b> <b>Nebula</b> Awards have changed {{several times during the}} awards' history, most recently in 2010. The SFWA Nebula Conference, at which the awards are announced and presented, is held each spring in the United States. Locations vary from year to year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> {{extended}} <b>nebulae</b> {{formed as}} pulsar winds expand into their surroundings {{provide information about}} {{the composition of the}} winds, the injection history from the host pulsar, and the material into which <b>the</b> <b>nebulae</b> are expanding. Observations from across the electromagnetic spectrum provide constraints on the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>nebulae,</b> <b>the</b> density and composition of the surrounding ejecta, the geometry of the systems, the formation of jets, and the maximum energy of the particles in <b>the</b> <b>nebulae.</b> Here I provide a broad overview of the structure of pulsar wind nebulae, with specific examples that demonstrate our ability to constrain the above parameters. The association of pulsar wind nebulae with extended sources of very high energy gamma-ray emission are investigated, along with constraints on the nature of such high energy emission...|$|R

5|$|The {{battle in}} <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> was a {{difficult}} sequence to accomplish {{without the aid of}} computer-generated models. The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E
5|$|Corvus {{contains}} no Messier objects. It has several galaxies and a planetary nebula observable with amateur telescopes. The center of Corvus {{is home to}} a planetary nebula, NGC 4361. <b>The</b> <b>nebula</b> itself resembles a small elliptical galaxy and has a magnitude of 10.3, but the magnitude 13 star at its centre gives away its true nature.|$|E
5|$|Different studies {{generally}} find varying {{values for}} elemental abundances. This is often because spectrographs attached to telescopes do not collect all {{the light from}} objects being observed, instead gathering light from a slit or small aperture.

5|$|First Contact was {{the last}} film to feature a {{physical}} model of the Enterprise. For the ship's dramatic introduction, the effects team combined motion control shots of the Enterprise model with a computer-generated background. Sequence supervisor Dennis Turner, who had created Generations energy ribbon and specialized in creating natural phenomena, was charged with creating the star cluster, modeled after the Eagle Nebula. The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface shaders applied to make the edges of <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> glow. A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film Twister was {{used to create a}} turbulent look within <b>the</b> <b>nebula.</b> Once the shots of the Enterprise had been captured, Turner inserted the ship into the computer-generated background and altered its position until the images matched up.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The ISO and IUE {{spectra of}} <b>the</b> bipolar {{planetary}} <b>nebulae</b> NGC 6537 and He 2 - 111 are presented. These spectra are {{combined with the}} spectrum in the visual wavelength region from <b>the</b> <b>nebulae</b> to obtain a complete spectrum that is corrected for extinction. The chemical abundance of <b>the</b> <b>nebulae</b> is then determined and compared to previous determinations. The abundance of <b>the</b> two <b>nebulae</b> is quite similar. A comparison is then made with the abundance of two other bipolar planetary nebulae whose abundance is also determined {{with the help of}} ISO observations. It is shown that not all bipolar nebulae have similar abundance. NGC 6445 has a much lower nitrogen to oxygen ratio, similar to NGC 7027, but still not as low as <b>the</b> Orion <b>nebula...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Cat's Eye was {{the first}} {{planetary}} nebula to be observed with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864. Huggins' observations revealed that the nebula's spectrum was non-continuous and made of a few bright emission lines, first indication that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images at these wavelengths {{have been used to}} reveal the intricate structure of <b>the</b> <b>nebula.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{degree to}} the {{northwest}} of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula (M1), a supernova remnant. This expanding nebula was created by a Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but <b>the</b> <b>nebula</b> is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E
