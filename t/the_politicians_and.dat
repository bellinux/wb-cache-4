5|$|Academic jobs {{in history}} were {{not easy to}} find in 1941, so Elliott joined the Civil Service, working in the Prices and Statistics Section of the Iron and Steel Control {{directorate}} in the Ministry of Supply. She subsequently moved to the Board of Trade, and the Directorate of Housing Fitments, where she rose {{to the rank of}} Assistant Principal, before moving to the Cabinet Office in 1945. There she became involved with the Official History of the Second World War, as assistant to Keith Hancock who was overall editor of the United Kingdom Civil Series of books within the Official History. As an official historian of the History of the Second World War: United Kingdom Civil Series, Gowing had access to unpublished official papers and files. She came to know personally many of <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> senior civil servants involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{the plans}} for an indoor arena, {{primarily}} for handball, was launched again, {{but the cost of}} NOK6 million was not able to be financed. Following the work with the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, the plans resurfaced, this time with an ice hockey rink to be the centerpiece. In 1985, Lillehammer Municipal Council accepted an agreement with the Norwegian Confederation of Sports (NIF), which offered to finance 50% of a new multi-use arena in Lillehammer. The venue opened in December 1988 and cost NOK65 million. After Lillehammer was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, it became necessary to build a larger venue to hold the Olympic ice hockey matches. In June 1989, the municipal council voted to locate most of the Lillehammer venues to the Stampesletta area, and to put Håkons Hall adjacent to Kristins Hall. This was controversial among <b>the</b> <b>politicians,</b> <b>and</b> many councilors voted in support of the originally-planned decentralized plan, with the venues spread out through the municipality. Håkons Hall cost NOK238 million and it opened on 1 February 1993. Prior to the Olympics, the power lines across the fields were dug down to give better television images. The bid for the Olympics had also included using Stampesletta for the speed skating events, but with the demands for an indoor venue, it was instead decided to build Vikingskipet in Hamar.|$|E

25|$|Jean Léchelle or Jean L'Échelle (2 April 1760 – 11 November 1793) briefly {{commanded}} a French army during the French Revolutionary Wars.

He was elected to lead a volunteer National Guard battalion which fought at Valmy and Jemappes in 1792. He earned promotion to general officer after distinguishing himself at the Siege of Valenciennes and saving a representative from an angry mob. He won such favor with <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> the war office that he was rapidly catapulted into command of an army in the War in the Vendée.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> {{their parties}} have {{themselves}} become major political issues. Corruption among some DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian {{was linked to}} possible corruption. The political effect on President Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters alike. It {{eventually led to the}} creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP leader Shih Ming-teh which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party in the world. Nearing the end of 2006, KMT's chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also hit by corruption controversies, although he has since then been cleared of any wrongdoings by the courts. After completing his second term as President, Chen Shui-bian was charged with corruption and money laundering. Following his conviction, he is serving a 17-year sentence in Taipei Prison.|$|E

Only on 8 April did he suggest a partial mobilization. Three days earlier, on 5 April, Laake had been among some 200 prominent Norwegians to attend a party held at the German legation in Oslo. At the party, the Germans had shown their guest from the political and military elites of Norway a dramatic propaganda film about their conquest of Poland the year before. On the evening of 8 April, Laake boarded a train that brought him to his farm near Strømmen, east of Oslo, where he was to celebrate his 65th birthday on 9 April 1940.|$|E
25|$|Smith, {{although}} {{running for}} his campaign, {{would refuse to}} leave without beginning the skeleton of a new park and parkway system for Long Island {{and make sure the}} land needed would be in property of the state. Smith continued ripping <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> that they were on the side of those in Wheatley Hills and pledged to keep the parkway out of their neighborhood. However, Smith argued that the sentiment had changed in Wheatley Hills and that most of the residents were in support of the project. However, Hewitt and Hutchinson refused to permit the money because they would not touch any money until the Southern State Parkway was completed. Smith denied that agreement ever occurred. The money {{that was supposed to be}} use was from unappropriated state land in New York City. The money for purchasing land would go to those who agreed with the LISPC on prices or those who could not afford to give away the land.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of March 21–23, John Brown Baldwin of the Valley’s Augusta County made a Unionist speech, {{beginning}} with a defense of “African slavery, as it exists in Virginia, is a right and a good thing…” But {{he believed that the}} idea that the election of someone to the Presidency could justify secession “as a direct assault upon the fundamental principles of American liberty”. The three branches of government with their Constitutional checks and balances protect against “encroachment upon the liberties of the minority of the people or upon the rights of the States.” And even with the withdrawal of Southern delegations, the remaining Republican majority passed a Constitutional Amendment for ratification prohibiting the Federal Government to interfere with slavery in the states in any respect. “...the great masses of people, leaving out <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> fanatics of both sections, have this day an earnest yearning for each other, and for peace and Union with each other…” Baldwin sought a conference of border states to adopt the Peace Convention recommendations that he believed would cause the Confederate states to separately return to the Union.|$|E

500|$|Domestic German {{opposition}} to Article 231 {{has been held}} to have created a psychological and political burden on the post-war Weimar Republic. German politicians seeking international sympathy would use the article for its propaganda value, convincing many who had not read the treaties that the article implied full war guilt. German revisionist historians who subsequently attempted to ignore {{the validity of the}} clause found a ready audience among 'revisionist' writers in France, Britain, and the United States. The objective of both <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> historians was to prove that Germany was not solely guilty for causing the war; if that guilt could be disproved the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear. To that end, the German government funded the Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War. This subject, the question of Germany's guilt (Kriegsschuldfrage or war guilt question) became a major theme of Adolf Hitler's political career.|$|E
500|$|The latest {{technological}} innovation of the time, submarines, {{were developed in}} the state of New Jersey by an Irish-American inventor, John Philip Holland. His submarine, [...] was officially commissioned into U.S. Navy service in the fall of 1900. The Russo-Japanese War of 1905 and the launching of [...] in the following year lent impetus to the construction program. At the end of 1907 Roosevelt had sixteen new battleships to make up his [...] "Great White Fleet", which he sent on a cruise around the world. While nominally peaceful, and a valuable training exercise for the rapidly expanding Navy, it was also useful politically as a demonstration of United States power and capabilities; at every port, <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> naval officers of both potential allies and enemies were welcomed on board and given tours.

500|$|The {{other main}} commanders of the {{uprising}} included the former VKJ officers Colonel Bajo Stanišić and Major Đorđije Lašić. Within six weeks, a force of 67,000 Italian troops, assisted by Muslim and Albanian irregulars from border areas who provided flank security, regained control of all towns and communication routes in Montenegro. General Alessandro Pirzio Biroli, the Italian military governor of Montenegro, issued orders to crush the revolt but directed his forces to avoid [...] "acts of revenge and useless cruelty". Nevertheless, dozens of villages were burned, hundreds were killed, and between 10,000 and 20,000 inhabitants were interned in the revolt's suppression. For a while, the Muslim and Albanian irregulars were permitted to pillage and torch villages. As soon as the Italians launched their offensive, politicians in Berane abandoned {{their support for the}} uprising and began criticising it. Former VKJ officers deserted their units and Đurišić left the military committee organising the uprising in the Berane district. <b>The</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> officers formed their own committees and approached the Italians to express their loyalty and denounce the communists.|$|E

500|$|In 1934 Schuster {{was subject}} to a public attack by Lord Hewart, the Lord Chief Justice. On 7 December 1934 his clerk found a bill amongst Hewart's {{parliamentary}} papers with a clause that allowed the Lord Chancellor to appoint any Lord Justice of Appeal as Vice President of the Chancery Appeal Court, a right traditionally held by the Lord Chief Justice. Hewart immediately made plans to attend the House of Lords, where Lord Sankey was expected to move the Second Reading of the bill in question. Immediately after second reading Hewart rose and began a speech that was [...] "as violent an attack as has ever {{been made in the}} Lords". In it he criticised the officials of the Lord Chancellor's Department (which to listeners clearly meant Schuster specifically) and insinuated that the bill was part of a conspiracy to move power from the judiciary to <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> (<b>and</b> thus the civil service) and create a Ministry of Justice. The speech provoked uproar in the house; a public quarrel between senior judges and civil servants had not happened in centuries, especially in such a traditionally calm and collected place. Lord Reading, himself a former Lord Chief Justice, adjourned the debate, and the following Friday Lord Hailsham, at the time the Leader of the House of Lords, made a defence of Schuster, saying that [...] "I can show that this is an absolute delusion [...] that there was no such scheme ever hatched". He showed that the proposal of a Ministry of Justice had originated in 1836, long before Schuster became Permanent Secretary, and in addition that the report Schuster had helped prepare for Sankey was clearly biased against the creation of such a Ministry as he himself was opposed to it. He went on to praise Schuster as [...] "the author and instigator of many great reforms", and along with a similar speech by Lord Sankey and an amendment to the offending bill this helped appease Hewart.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the capture}} of only four vessels, the Battle of Cape Saint Vincent became celebrated as an {{outstanding}} victory and the awards and recognition far outweighed the achievement. The bad news of the evacuation of the Mediterranean, the capitulation of the Spanish and the Italian city-states and {{the defeat of the}} Austrian army alongside the increasing threat of a French invasion of Britain had depressed <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> general public. A victory, such as that of Cape Saint Vincent, was more important for the morale of {{the country as a whole}} than its military ramifications. Both Jervis and Nelson were hailed as heroes and Jervis was made Baron Jervis of Meaford and Earl St Vincent. Songs were written about Jervis and the battle and there was a general feeling of relief in both the Government and people of Britain. Nelson for his services was invested as a Knight of the Bath. The now Earl St Vincent was gifted a pension for life of £3,000 per year. The City of London had already presented him with the Freedom of the City in a gold box valued at 100 guineas for his success in the West Indies and for this battle awarded him a presentation sword. The presentation box and sword are both currently held at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. Nelson was also awarded his freedom of the City of London for the Battle of Cape St Vincent, and was to get a presentation sword for the Nile. [...] The sword awarded to Jervis was the first of their kind that the City of London issued. St Vincent was awarded the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and given a gold medal by the King. The London Gazette published an advertisement in 1798 regarding the prize money that was due to the officers and men who had fought at the battle. The sum quoted was £140,000, in inflationary terms this would be approximately £ as of 20, of which, as admiral, Jervis was entitled to a sizeable share. Jervis resumed his blockade of the Spanish fleet in Cadiz.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his injury}} in 1924, Gilligan {{could no longer}} bowl fast and, as a player, had little {{influence}} on the 1924–25 tour of Australia; his performances were hampered by further injuries. His best bowling figures of four for 12 came in the opening match and his only century came in the second game; he passed fifty just once more on the tour. His leadership proved influential in one main respect. In previous series, Australia had been superior to England in the field, but according to Gibson, Gilligan [...] "revolutionized the English fielding, a department in which they began to compare with Australia, {{for the first time}} since the war and possibly since the early 1900s. This had much effect on the England sides of the next few years". However an Australian newspaper estimated that England dropped 21 catches in the five Tests, which may have impacted on the series result; Australia won 4–1. Other aspects of Gilligan's leadership were less successful; his captaincy lacked tactical sophistication, and the Australian captain Herbie Collins proved superior in this respect. According to Gibson, critics claimed that Gilligan [...] "was too easygoing on the finer points of law". In addition, his inexperience led to defeat in one warm-up match that the MCC could have drawn, and commentators dismissed him as naive and easy-going on the field. However, he was immensely popular with the Australian public and well-liked by his team. Gibson, writing in 1979, noted that Gilligan [...] "was, and is, one of the most popular captains England have sent to Australia". During the tour, Gilligan was the focus of a great deal of publicity. The periodical Cricket described him as [...] "'one of the most jovial personalities imaginable", while former Australian Test captain Monty Noble wrote that Gilligan was the [...] "type of man who, in the most unostentatious way, can do more than all <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> <b>and</b> statesmen to cement the relations between the Homeland and the Dominions". His sportsmanship, including his grace and cheerfulness in defeat, made him, according to Noble, a perfect English gentleman and an [...] "Empire builder".|$|E
