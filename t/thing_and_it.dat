500|$|After Robert Koehler of Variety previewed the {{screener}} edit of {{the series}} at the Outfest film festival, he wrote: [...] "What would have been spectacular stuff just 10 years ago is now something closer to a high-quality Oprah special, humanizing in rather simplistic terms complex lives…". Anthony Glassman of the Gay People's Chronicle was also cautious in his assessment: [...] "The word 'groundbreaking' should be used sparingly, and perhaps it does not apply here. TransGeneration does one <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> does it well. It shows the viewer the reality and normality {{of the lives of}} these students and those around them, their family and friends." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with TV Guide Anders expressed the same sentiments, responding, [...] "I've watched Rachel struggle. She's always {{trying to do the}} right thing, or thinks she's {{trying to do the right}} <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> always gets messed up." [...] Anders also said that this song is [...] "her asking when things are going to work out," [...] and commented that it was [...] "emotional" [...] and thought that it would bring people to tears. [...] "Get It Right" [...] and [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] both premiered on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on February25,2011, and were performed in the episode [...] "Original Song", on March15,2011. The song was also released on the iTunes Store in the United States on March15,2011. In the episode performance, Rachel Berry (Michele) appears performing the song with a bedazzled microphone, wearing a blue dress, black belt, and boots, accompanied by Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) in the background.|$|E
500|$|Following the election, Ann Romney {{received}} {{an offer to}} appear on the spring 2013 season of Dancing with the Stars, but although she was a fan of the show, she declined: [...] "I would've loved to have done it, and I am turning 64, and I started thinking about it. I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – {{a lot of people around}} us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other." [...] In October 2013, she published, and made promotional appearances for, The Romney Family Table: Sharing Home-Cooked Recipes & Favorite Traditions, a cookbook that made the New York Times Best Seller list.|$|E

500|$|In June 2011, Ice filmed {{a role in}} {{the film}} That's My Boy (released in 2012). In the film, Ice portrayed an exaggerated version of himself, called Uncle Vanny. He also worked with Andy Samberg in the movie and while shooting, Ice collaborated both with Samberg and Sandler musically. In August, Ice {{performed}} at the 2011 Gathering of the Juggalos, where it was officially announced that he had signed with Psychopathic Records. His sixth studio album, WTF, was released on August 19 through Radium Records. While the record featured an array of different styles, like other recent Vanilla Ice albums, it also featured Ice's return to Electronica, with songs like [...] "Turn It Up", [...] "Rock Star Party", [...] "Nightmare Disco" [...] and [...] "Cadillac Ninjas". On the new record and its numerous musical genres, Ice was quoted saying [...] "It's like techno hip-hop. European. I live a lot in Europe, and when I'm over there I get way into the techno stuff and I get into new music. So I thought I'd make a record of it. I did the <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was a lot of fun".|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E

2500|$|Shantel VanSanten portrays Quinn James, Haley's free {{spirited}} older sister. Fans were unreceptive to {{the character}} at first, but eventually warmed to her. [...] "It's funny. I feel that. I struggle because I take it personally. Obviously, it is a personal thing. Quinn is a character that the writers and myself have developed", said VanSanten. [...] "And {{there was no way}} that I could ever change the way that we started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> wasn't something that we could really explore a whole lot of. So, I think it was a hard place for people to accept as I came in. I wasn't bubbly and happy. You know?" [...] Quinn is introduced in season 7 when she moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down.|$|E
2500|$|In remarks aired by the CNN program D.L. Hughley Breaks the News on March 1, 2009, Steele said he, {{rather than}} Limbaugh, is [...] "the de facto {{leader of the}} Republican Party. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly." [...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those things}} where I thinking I was saying one <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not." [...] Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh [...] "is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize." ...|$|E

2500|$|Edison {{expressed}} {{views that}} AC was unworkable {{and the high}} voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, [...] "Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts {{in a system of}} any size. He has got a new <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically." [...] Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general. Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.|$|E
2500|$|Still {{determined}} to get the album out, Swervedriver forwent signing with one of two other interested major labels and instead opted for independent label Zero Hour Records out of New York. They officially released 99th Dream, their fourth album, on 24 February 1998. The band also formed their own label, Sonic Wave Discs (SWD), and on 10 August 1998 issued the album in the UK. About the album's progression to a more indie rock style, Franklin told The Star-Ledger, [...] "It wasn't a conscious decision. [...] {{just the way it}} was going – concise little pop songs, bossa nova beats and such." [...] He continued, [...] "I've always liked the idea that you don't always know where it's coming from... all about time. It's all over the place. I didn't put too much thought into it, which may be good. You're fueling more from the subconscious that way." [...] In an interview for Mean Street magazine, Hindmarsh mentioned, [...] "There's a track called 'She Weaves a Tender Trap.' That's like a one-take, all-four-of-us <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> has a lot more air in it, a lot more space. Whereas in the past, we used to try and fill every single hole. That song sort of defines a change in the way we're thinking. I think we're headed that way, to leave space to let the music breathe a little bit." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was really upset that she would say and do those things. In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and do those things when people break up, and she obviously felt the need {{to go out there and}} make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't care what the bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write back and be mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E
