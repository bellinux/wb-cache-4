5|$|The {{incidence}} of TBI varies by age, gender, region and other factors.

5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference.

25|$|A {{critical}} {{finding of}} <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> {{that many of}} the 'disconnects' between the public's preferences and what actually is taking place are caused by weak or non-existent implementation tools – rather than by inadequate policies, as contained in the City/County Comprehensive Plan and other already adopted legislation.|$|E

25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} {{corporations}} increase long-term profits by operating with a CSR perspective, while {{critics argue that}} CSR distracts from businesses' economic role. A 2000 study compared existing econometric studies {{of the relationship between}} social and financial performance, concluding that the contradictory results of previous studies reporting positive, negative, and neutral financial impact, were due to flawed empirical analysis and claimed when <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> properly specified, CSR has a neutral impact on financial outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Double-blinding is {{relatively}} easy to achieve in drug studies, by formulating the investigational drug and the control (either a placebo or an established drug) to have identical appearance (color, taste, etc.). Patients are randomly assigned to the control or experimental group and given random numbers by a study coordinator, who also encodes the drugs with matching random numbers. Neither the patients nor the researchers monitoring the outcome know which patient is receiving which treatment, until <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> over and the random code is revealed.|$|E
25|$|A {{common goal}} for a {{statistical}} research {{project is to}} investigate causality, and in particular to draw a conclusion {{on the effect of}} changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> actually conducted. Each can be very effective.|$|E
