Tenancy agreements had to be formally registered in the municipal <b>tax</b> <b>rolls,</b> and had to include the tenant's name, a particular plot of land, and the landowner's name. The tenant was then added to the <b>tax</b> <b>roll</b> for that specific field and could therefore be identified as part of the chain of responsibility for that area of land. Being registered in the imperial or municipal <b>tax</b> <b>rolls</b> also provided additional benefits. Tenants that were registered taxpayers were lawfully protected against eviction and the raising of their rents.|$|R

During plastic deformation the increase in yield strength caused by cold working is more significant for stainless steel than carbon steel and it occurs in manufacturing cold rolled sheet material and in forming the sheet material into cold formed sections.
