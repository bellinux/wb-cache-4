40|$|Nail-bed {{injuries}} {{are the most}} common hand injury in children. Surgical dogma is to replace the nail plate after repairing the nail bed. Recent evidence suggests this might increase infection rates and returns to clinic. The aim of this feasibility trial was to inform the design and conduct of a definitive trial comparing replacing or discarding the nail plate after nail-bed repair. This study recruited participants from four hand units in the UK between April and July 2015. Participants were {{children under the age of}} 16 years with a nail-bed injury requiring surgery. They were randomized to either having the nail plate replaced or discarded after nail-bed repair. The follow-up method was also allocated randomly (postal versus clinic). Information was collected on complications at 2 weeks and 30 days, and on nail-plate appearance at 4 months using the Zook classification. Two possible approaches to follow-up were also piloted and compared. During the recruitment phase, there were 156 potentially eligible children. Sixty were randomized in just over 3 months using remote web-based allocation. By 2 weeks, there were two infections, both in children with replaced nail plates. The nail-replaced group also experienced more complications. There was no evidence of a difference in return rates between postal <b>and</b> clinic <b>follow-up.</b> Recruitment was rapid and nail-bed repair appeared to have low complication and infection rates in this pilot trial.

40|$|The {{launch of}} the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has heralded {{a new era in}} the study of gamma-ray pulsars. The {{population}} of confirmed gamma-ray pulsars has gone from 6 - 7 to more than 60, and the superb sensitivity of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on Fermi has allowed the detailed study of their spectra and light curves. Twenty-four of these pulsars were discovered in blind searches of the gamma-ray data, and twenty-one of these are, at present, radio quiet, despite deep radio follow-up observations. In addition, millisecond pulsars have been confirmed as a class of gamma-ray emitters, both individually and collectively in globular clusters. Recently, radio searches in the direction of LAT sources with no likely counterparts have been highly productive, leading to the discovery {{of a large number of}} new millisecond pulsars. Taken together, these discoveries promise a great improvement in the understanding of the gamma-ray emission properties and Galactic population of pulsars.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} frequency, <b>timing,</b> technique, <b>and</b> <b>follow-up</b> of {{tracheostomy}} for long-term ventilated patients in different intensive care units (ICUs) in The Netherlands. DESIGN AND SETTING: Postal questionnaire, survey on retrospective data. A questionnaire {{was sent to}} all (n= 63) ICUs with six or more beds suitable for mechanical ventilation and officially recognized by The Netherlands Intensive Care Society. Pediatric ICUs were excluded. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: There was an 87 % (n= 55) response rate of contacted ICUs. The number of tracheostomies per year per unit varied widely (range 1 - 75), most ICUs (42 %) performing between 11 and 25 tracheostomies per year. In 44 % of ICUs (n= 24) tracheostomy was not performed on a routine basis. In 25 % of ICUs (n= 14) tracheostomies were performed during {{the second week of}} ventilation. Surgical tracheostomy and percutaneous procedures were technique of first choice in 38 % and 62 % of ICUs, respectively. In only 7 % of units were late follow-up protocols in use. Thirty-two units (58 %) reported a total of 56 major complications. CONCLUSIONS: Timing and technique of tracheostomy varies widely in Dutch ICUs. The percutaneous technique is the procedure of choice for tracheostomy in most of these units. Late follow-up protocols are rarely in use...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Relevant data of randomized-controlled {{studies on}} shock wave {{treatment}} for chronic plantar fasciopathy are statistically and clinically heterogeneous. METHODS: Randomized trials were identified form a current {{search of the}} Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group specialized register of trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and reference lists of articles and dissertations. We identified and retrieved a total of 17 articles. Methodological quality criterial included appropriate randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, number lost of <b>follow-up</b> <b>and</b> intention to treat analysis. Significant heterogeneity between studies precluded pooled analyses. Instead, individual trial results were described in the text. RESULTS: We identified conflicting results in the 17 studies, involving more than 2100 participants. There was considerable heterogeneity in terms of methodological quality, treatment regimen, patient selection <b>and</b> <b>follow-up</b> period. CONCLUSIONS: With current studies heterogenous {{in terms of the}} duration of the disorder; type, frequency and total dose of shock wave therapy (SWT); period of time between SWT; type of management <b>and</b> control group; <b>timing</b> of <b>follow-up</b> <b>and</b> outcomes assessed, a pooled meta-analysis of SWT for chronic plantar fasciopathy was considered inappropriate. Neverhteless, there was a preponderance of well-designed studies showing favourable results.

40|$|The {{detection}} of distant metastases {{is critical for}} prognostication and for the choice of treatment in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Pretreatment screening for distant metastases should be conducted particularly for patients with high risk factors, prior to locoregional treatment decisions. Different diagnostic techniques are discussed. Unfortunately, most studies lack sufficient follow-up to reliably assess false-negative results. Moreover, the designs of most studies vary substantially with regard to homogeneity of groups (tumor types <b>and</b> stages), <b>timing</b> (pretreatment, <b>follow-up)</b> <b>and</b> definition of risk factors (patient selection). Therefore, only a few studies are comparable. The combination of F- 18 fluoro-d-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and a dedicated CT (at least of the chest) {{is the most important}} imaging protocol at the present time. Eventually, whole-body-MRI (WB-MRI) may possibly replace PET-CT for screening patients for distant metastases...|$|R
40|$|Health {{technology}} assessment requires {{the synthesis of}} evidence from multiple sources to assess the cost-effectiveness of competing interventions. However, {{the format of the}} available reported evidence is often complex. We present a case-study of electronic aids to smoking cessation, which raises various methodological challenges. The evidence base evaluated highly complex and diverse interventions, reporting one or both of two different, but related, outcome measures. Furthermore, there were differences between studies in the number <b>and</b> <b>timing</b> of <b>follow-up</b> times reported, whereas 12 -month continuous abstinence is required in the cost-effectiveness analysis. We develop a categorization system to evaluate the interventions, and we use network meta-analysis of time-to-relapse model parameters to estimate coherent intervention effects for any pair of categories. We compare the fit of alternative time-to-relapse models and explore the effect of joint models for both outcome measures, which can be used to estimate treatment effects when a given outcome is not reported, so that all the available evidence can be combined. © 2013 Royal Statistical Society...|$|R

40|$|Non-melanoma {{skin cancer}} (NMSC) {{is the most}} common type of skin cancer. Important {{controversial}} issues are the need for incisional biopsies, surgical margin, <b>and</b> <b>timing</b> of <b>follow-up.</b> Methods. A retrospective study was undertaken on 2544 lesions. Accuracy of diagnosis and prevalence of incomplete excision were evaluated, comparing clinical and histological diagnosis using 2 tests with Yates’ correction. Kaplan-Meier recurrence graphs have been obtained. Results. Lesions were correctly diagnosed in 94 % of basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and in 69 % of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) (p < 0. 001). Positive margins on pathological examination were 6. 6 % for BCC and 6. 8 % for SCC. A significant difference for incomplete excision has been found for BCC in the face (p < 0. 001). Kaplan- Meier survival curves showed a different pattern for BCC and SCC. Conclusions. On the basis of our data, if clinical diagnosis is BCC, excision and reconstruction may be undertaken without an incisional biopsy. Alternatively, if clinical diagnosis is SCC, it is advisable to consider an incisional biopsy, before definitive surgical treatment...|$|R
40|$|Follow-up of surgically treated {{colorectal}} cancer patients is {{not supported by}} objectively certain data. Despite the thousands of investigations reported in the literature, only six randomized prospective studies and two meta-analysis of randomized studies provide data suggesting clear conclusions until today. The main goal of colorectal follow-up is to improve patient survival by early diagnosis of recurrence during the asymptomatic stage when radical surgical treatment is more viable [1]. However the reduction of global mortality from {{colorectal cancer}} achieved by <b>follow-up,</b> radical second-surgery <b>and</b> therefore new and definite patient recovery calculated in our patients in follow-up on 5 years disease free interval was only 2. 6 % according {{to the findings of}} other authors [2, 3]. In our recent study carried out on a group of 280 patients in our follow-up the average age was 69. 5 demonstrating that the age must be carefully considered in order to establish the <b>follow-up</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> modality and to calculate the cost-benefit ratio. In our experience the far from brilliant results obtained led us to change our <b>follow-up</b> in 2006 <b>and</b> make it less intensive, tailoring it to the stage of the disease, the reliability of the diagnostic methods, times of recurrences and no less important, the age of patients. In the aged obviously the surgical and/or adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments are to be considered with caution and local and general controindications to every type of therapy carefully evaluated. The age is a fundamental part of ASA, POSSUM and PST and could condition the therapeutical strategies. On the other hand many reports confirm the possibility of performing safe operation for liver and lung metastases or local recurrences in the elderly without a statistical higher rate of morbidity and mortality compounding with younger adults. Lastly, in our policy we have considered the agreement of elderly patients to modality <b>and</b> <b>timing</b> of <b>follow-up</b> on th...|$|R

40|$|Off-time pubertal {{maturation}} {{is associated}} with mental disorders, presumably due to stress caused by deviation from peers that could also attract negative attention and result in being bullied. Stress related to off-time maturation could be acted out by involving oneself in bullying behavior. The associations between pubertal <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> involvement in bullying have {{so far not been}} a focus of research. The objective is to explore associations between off-time pubertal maturation and involvement in bullying. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between self-reported pubertal <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> involvement in bullying as victims and perpetrators were studied in a sample of 2070 Finnish adolescents aged 15 – 17 who participated in the Adolescent Mental Health Cohort Study. Internalizing (depression) and externalizing (conduct disorder) symptoms were controlled for. The adolescents were recruited to response the baseline survey in 2002 – 2003 (T 1) <b>and</b> <b>follow-up</b> two years later (T 2). In T 1, response rate was 94. 4 % of all eligible students. The 2070 participants in T 2 comprised 63. 1 % of the T 1 participants. Early maturation among boys was cross-sectionally associated with being a bully, and late maturation with exclusion from peer group. After two years, the associations had disappeared. Among girls, no associations were detected between pubertal <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> involvement in bullying. Off-time pubertal maturation places boys at risk for involvement in bullying. The influence is transient and supports the stressful change hypothesis of pubertal timing.

40|$|Abstract: The urea-cycle {{functions}} to facilitate ammonia excretion, {{a disruption of}} which results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites. The neurological outcome of neonatal-onset urea-cycle defects (UCDs) is poor, {{and there are no}} good predictors of prognosis beyond ammonia levels at presentation. The role of neuroimaging in the prognosis of neonatal-onset UCDs is unclear. We describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of two patients with neonatal-onset UCDs (argininosuccinic aciduria and citrullinemia) at presentation and at 2 -year <b>follow-up,</b> <b>and</b> present {{a review of the literature}} on neuroimaging in this age-group. We observed two potentially significant distinct patterns of cerebral involvement on MRI: (1) a central and focal pattern of involvement limited to the basal ganglia, perirolandic regions, and internal capsule; and (2) diffuse involvement of the cerebral cortex, internal capsule, basal ganglia, and variably thalami and brain stem. Patients with more diffuse findings tended to have higher serum glutamine peaks and worse neurological outcomes, while those with central involvement, aggressive acute management, and early liver transplantation tended to have better outcomes. We propose that MRI imaging of the brain may have prognostic value following presentation with neonatal UCDs, particularly in identifying patients at risk for poor outcome. The role <b>and</b> <b>timing</b> of <b>follow-up</b> neuroimaging is currently unclear. Further collaborative studies are necessary to evaluate whether patterns of MRI findings vary with specific UCD subtypes, and are predictive of clinical outcomes in neonatal UCDs...|$|R

40|$|The {{alfalfa weevil}} Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) {{is the most}} {{destructive}} pest of leguminous crops such as alfalfa, Chinese milk vetch, and hairy vetch throughout the world, including Japan. To control H. postica, the solitary endoparasitoid Bathyplectes anurus (Thomson) was released in Japan as a classical biological control agent. In our study, we investigated the bottom-up effects of hairy vetch seeding methods (i. e., control of seeding <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> density) on the B. anurus density to develop a field production method for B. anurus. The average densities of H. postica and B. anurus were significantly higher with early <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> a higher seeding density compared with early <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> a lower seeding density, late <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> a higher seeding density <b>and</b> late <b>timing,</b> <b>and</b> a lower seeding density.

During the tri-trophic interaction among hairy vetch, H. postica, and B. anurus, {{the interaction between the}} hairy vetch weight and H. postica densities was high, whereas the interaction between the H. postica and B. anurus densities was very high. These results suggested that early <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> high density seeding indirectly enhanced the density of B. anurus by strong direct effects of the H. postica density on the B. anurus during the tri-trophic interaction. Overall, we concluded that a combination of early <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> high density hairy vetch seeding may facilitate efficient field productions of B. anurus...|$|R

40|$|Background: Public {{involvement}} is health research {{policy in the}} UK and internationally. There {{is a need to}} establish a robust evidence base on the impact of public involvement on research processes and outcomes. Purpose: To review examples of public involvement in the design and conduct of clinical trials, to synthesise the contributions of the public, as well as the identified tensions and facilitating strategies. Method: Systematic literature search and narrative review. Results: Nine papers were identified, covering the following topics: breast-feeding, antiretroviral and nutrition interventions; paediatric resuscitation; exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy; breast cancer; stroke; chronic suppurative otitis media; Paget's disease; and shared decision-making in patient consultations. Six papers reported on public involvement at the trial design stage, while three reported on public involvement at the design and conduct stages of clinical trials. It was found that the public contributed at the consultation, collaboration and publicly-led levels of involvement. Four main public contributions to trial design were identified: review of consent procedures and patient information sheets; suggestion of additional trial outcomes; review of trial data collection procedures; and recommendations on the <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> location of <b>follow-up</b> data collection. Two main contributions that the public made to the conduct of trials were identified: scrutiny of the conduct of the trial through membership of the Trial Steering Committee; and delivering the trial protocol after completing relevant training. Numerous tensions and facilitating strategies were identified. Limitations: Papers on public involvement in the design and conduct of clinical trials may have been overlooked due to the difficulty of searching for, and identifying, papers in this area. Only English publications were searched for and the review focused on evidence in peer-reviewed journal articles only. Conclusions: The issues raised here should assist researchers in developing and conducting clinical trials with the involvement of the public. ?? Common Ground...|$|R
