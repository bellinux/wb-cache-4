At the hall door she found Rupert, the old bloodhound, stationed on the mat, with the determination that the first person who was sensible enough to take a walk that morning should have the honour of his approbation and society. As he thrust his great black and tawny head under her hand, and wagged his tail with vigorous eloquence, and reached the climax of his welcome by jumping up to lick her face, which was at a convenient licking height for him, Caterina felt quite grateful to the old dog for his friendliness. Animals are such agreeable friends--they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms.|$|E

Every article is arranged with the utmost neatness and care; nor is the most costly furniture of a fashionable parlor more sedulously guarded from a scratch or a rub, than is that brightly-varnished bureau, and that neat cherry tea table and bedstead.

In our age, the <b>Thin</b> <b>Place</b> quest has morphed into a challenge to evolve {{beyond the confines of}} our own physiology; through human ingenuity and invention, we reach places not meant to accommodate human life. The early Antarctic explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard defined exploration as “the physical expression of intellectual passion. ” Our quests to explore the end of the earth, the top of the world, and into outer space exemplify this definition.

The five exhibiting artists and the other contributors to this project have produced work that is concerned with or responds to two particular locations: West Wales and the West of Ireland.

40|$|The {{research}} which underpins {{this paper}} {{began as a}} doctoral project exploring archaic beliefs concerning Otherworlds and Thin Places in two particular landscapes - the West Coast of Wales and the West Coast of Ireland. A <b>Thin</b> <b>Place</b> is an ancient Celtic Christian term used to describe a marginal, liminal realm, beyond everyday human experience and perception, where mortals could pass into the Otherworld more readily, or make contact {{with those in the}} Otherworld more willingly. To encounter a <b>Thin</b> <b>Place</b> in ancient folklore was significant because it engendered a state of alertness, an awakening to what the theologian John O’ Donohue (2004 : 49) called “the primal affection. ” These complex notions and terms will be further explored in this paper in relation to Education. Thin Teaching is a pedagogical approach which offers students the space to ruminate on the possibility that their existence can be more and can mean more than the categories they believed they belonged to or felt they should inhabit. Central to the argument then, is that certain places and their inhabitants can become revitalised by sensitively considered teaching methodologies. This raises interesting questions about the role spirituality plays in teaching practice as a tool for healing in the twenty first century...|$|E

40|$|The ideas {{proposed}} {{in this thesis}} emerged out of a practice based interdisciplinary curatorial research project titled <b>Thin</b> <b>Place,</b> which was installed at Oriel Myrddin, Carmarthen in early 2015. Fully funded by Arts Council Wales, the exhibition, education programme, publication and symposium aimed to dissolve boundaries that separate fields of knowledge and in so doing, attempted to create a metaphysical ‘thin place’ within the gallery. In ancient times {{it was believed that}} the delineation between worlds was more permeable in certain anomalous areas in a landscape; these areas were known as ‘thin places’ and were sometimes signified by burial mounds or standing stones. The five exhibiting artists and the many other contributors to the project produced work that was concerned with or responded to two particular locations: West Wales and the West of Ireland. These were locations where, it was believed, souls could easily enter Otherworlds. Building upon this notion of a ‘thin place’, this practice based doctoral project addresses the ways in which we value our relationship with Place, particularly in landscapes where animism was once a well established world-view, and where ambiguities in liminal spaces were embraced. By attending to these archaic ideas through contemporary curatorial practice, <b>Thin</b> <b>Place</b> questions current socio-political and socio-ecological paradigms and proposes new modes of ecological/environmental knowing through alternative forms of curating...|$|E

40|$|I examine ritual {{transmission}} {{through three}} practices: Sacred Harp hymnody, Montessori Sunday School, and Celtic <b>thin</b> <b>place,</b> all practices meant {{to provide the}} participant with a tangible sense of transcendence. Ritual transmission in not linear exchange, but is instead a complex system involving pedagogy, praxis, and persuasion: an ecology. Ritual ecology provides a {{way to think about}} rituals as both preserving practices and as consistently evolving. The composition of a ritual – that which makes it possible to transmit – requires the development of technical praxis. Ritual praxis is a blend of procedural and exegetical knowledge; it is the link between the actions/words of the ritual and its theory: the significance and symbolic meaning behind the actions and words. To teach a ritual to a new participant, and ultimately to fold that new participant into the community that practices the ritual, requires negotiation with an environment that contains signs and symbols. The individual must read and incorporate these signs and symbols into his or her exegetical knowledge. Transmission is not exclusively the province of live community, but happens also through web technology. Technology is taken up into this ritual ecology, shifting and expanding the mechanisms of transmission and fundamentally changing how participants imagine and construct the “face of God”-type moments. ...|$|E
40|$|Kathryn Davis holds a {{marginal}} {{position in the}} current literary canon, having received little critical recognition for her six experimental novels. This thesis will explore three of her texts, Hell (1998), The Walking Tour (1999), and The <b>Thin</b> <b>Place</b> (2006), as innovative commentaries on domestic space and women‟s relationship to this space in a contemporary world. Davis‟ works engage with the highly complicated and controversial concept of “the domestic” as well as women‟s ongoing negotiation with this contested space. In order to analyze how Davis creates and revises the homes and the female characters in her novels, this thesis will apply both feminist and postmodern theories of space and home to her works. These theories will elucidate Davis‟ interpretation of the pertinent postmodern and feminist concerns regarding how {{to live in a}} world of inversion, uncertainty and infinite possibility. This thesis will argue that Davis deconstructs domestic spaces that limit women to the role of housewife, revealing the problems inherent within the patriarchal model of private spheres. With the uncomfortable and oppressive realities of the traditional relationship between homes and women laid bare, Davis struggles to conceptualize a new home, a home that both functions in an ever-evolving late postmodern world that also promotes women‟s agency. Through three of her novels that all address this problem, Davis‟ view of the domestic shifts from hopeless destruction, to infinite imagination, to her final answer: a home built on communal relationships with nature and spirituality that provides women with active, meaningful subjectivity...|$|E
40|$|This joint {{collaborative}} presentation with accompanying images emerged {{out of a}} {{correspondence between}} Ciara Healy (University of Reading) and Adam Stead (MFA Student University of Reading). Their letters build a creative relationship of practice that documents how their visual and curatorial work attends to ecological and environmental ways of knowing in socio-agricultural and metaphysical modes. Adam Stead’s letters {{are concerned with the}} socio-political and socio- ecological impacts of increased industrialisation and consumerism on agriculture within rural communities in Britain and Ireland. His sculptural works reflect on his relationship with the farm he grew up on and its future. Coinciding with this research, Ciara Healy’s letters discuss the outcomes of a funded interdisciplinary curatorial model she developed in rural west Wales. <b>Thin</b> <b>Place</b> tested new insights in curating and gallery education in an area highlighted on the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation. The exhibition, education programme, international symposium and publication she produced invited specialists from many different fields to explore their perceptual commonalities. Their insights into the mythologies, histories and ecologies of the local area increased levels of wellbeing and fostered a deeper sense of belonging in the small rural community where she worked. Through this collaborative presentation both Adam and Ciara take different, and sometimes contentious positions on emergent ideas in eco-criticism, eco- feminism and post-humanism. Given the severity of our socio-environmental situation, this dialogue has a degree of urgency, as it proposes a movement away from reductive economic systems towards ecological and spiritual economies, which focus on sustainability, community, and relational co- existence...|$|E
