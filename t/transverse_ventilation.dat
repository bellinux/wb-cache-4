50|$|It is {{the only}} {{underwater}} vehicle tunnel currently in operation in the state, as the Baytown Tunnel was replaced in 1995 by a bridge. The tunnel consists of a single bore, 895 meters (2,909 feet) in length, with a six-percent roadway grade outward from the center towards each exit. Forced <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> is potentially provided by three automatic high-speed Westinghouse Sturtevant blower fans located in a tower at the north entrance. These fans are designed to keep the air free from high-levels of carbon monoxide.|$|E
50|$|The Chenani-Nashri tunnel {{comprises}} two tubes {{that run}} parallel {{to each other}} — the main traffic tunnel of diameter 13 m and a separate safety or escape tunnel of diameter 6 m alongside. The two tubes — each approximately 9 km long — are connected by 29 cross passages at regular intervals of every 300 meters along {{the entire length of the}} tunnel. These passages add up to about 1 km of tunnel length, and the main and escape tubes, plus the cross passages make up about 19 km of tunnel length. Since such a long tunnel could present the problem of a lack of oxygen, to ensure that there is no excessive carbon-dioxide build-up inside, there are several exhaust meters that will check the air all through the length of the tunnel. With inlets, every 8 meters, bringing fresh air into the main tube, and exhaust outlets every 100 m opening into the escape tube, the tunnel is the country’s first — and the world’s sixth — road tunnel with a <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> system. <b>Transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> will keep tailpipe smoke inside the tunnel at a minimum level in order to prevent suffocation and keep visibility at acceptable levels, especially since the tunnel is so long. The 29 cross passages between the two tunnels will be used to evacuate, through the escape tunnel, a user who might be in distress or to tow away any vehicle that might have broken down in the main tunnel. A total of 124 cameras and a linear heat detection system inside the tunnel will alert the Integrated Tunnel Control Room (ITCR) located outside the tunnel to the need for intervention. In the case of a traffic violation, the Control Room informs the traffic police deployed outside the tunnel, who shall impose a fine on errant drivers on the spot.|$|E
50|$|The new V-44 12-cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine, {{developing}} 520 hp (388 kW) at 1,800 rpm, was a {{more powerful}} version of the T-34's model V-2 with a new planetary manual 5-speed transmission system, filtration system, improved cooling system, horizontally placed water and oil pumps and an improved fuel system which increased its power output, although the tank retained the side clutches from the T-34. The new engine gave the T-44 a maximal road speed of 53 km/h and maximal cross country speed of 20 km/h to 25 km/h as well as maximal road range of 350 km. The engine could become worn out after the tank traveled 3,000 km. When that happened, the oil pressure would drop to 2-3 atmospheres and under heavy loads, the engine would start smoking, spewing out black smog {{out of the side}} of the tank. The engine deck had two <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> grilles at the rear. The exhaust port was on the rear left hand side of the hull. The tank could cross 1 m high vertical obstacles, 2.5 m wide trenches, 32° side slopes and 60° gradients and ford 1.3 m deep water obstacles without preparation.|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of the deterministic approach in the safety analyses comes from the {{need to understand the}} conditions that come out during the fire accident in a road tunnel. The key factor of the tunnel operations during the fire is the ventilation, which during the initial fazes of the fire, impact strongly on the evacuation of people and latter on the access of the intervention units in the tunnel. The paper presents the use of the computational fluid dynamics model in the tunnel safety assessment process. The model is validated by comparing data with experimental and quantifying the differences. The set-up of the initial and boundary conditions and the requirement for grid density found during the validation tests is used to prepare three kind of fire scenarios 20 MW, 50 MW, and 100 MW, with different ventilation conditions; natural, semi transverse, full <b>transverse,</b> and longitudinal <b>ventilation.</b> The observed variables, soot density and temperature, are presented in minutes time steps trough the entire tunnel length. Comparing the obtained data in a table, allows the analyses of the ventilation conditions for different heat releases from fires. The second step is to add additional criteria of human behaviour inside the tunnel (evacuation) and human resistance to the elevated gas concentrations and temperature. What comes out is a fully deterministic risk matrix that is based on the calculated data where the risk is ranged on five levels, from the lowest to a very danger level. The deterministic risk matrix represents the alternative to a probabilistic safety assessment methodology, where the fire risk is represented in detail as well as the computational fluid dynamics model results are physically correct. ...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{full-scale}} experiments {{was conducted}} to study thermal and smoke control strategies using <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> system in a sloping urban traffic link tunnel (UTLT). Results showed {{that it is not}} the case that the slower the smoke spread longitudinally, the better the smoke being controlled. For <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation,</b> within the smoke extraction compartment, the faster the smoke spread to the exhaust vents the faster the smoke being extracted from the tunnel. More importantly, the operation of the exhaust and supply vents for <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> in real time should take the effect of tunnel slope into consideration. For tunnel with a slope going uphill from upstream to downstream, supplying air from the downstream is recommended while supplying air from the upstream or directly to the fire located smoke compartment should be avoided. Additionally, for a given total smoke exhaust volume flow rate, increasing the number of exhaust vents is an effective way of controlling the smoke layer interface height. For the kind of tunnel as studied at hand, open the exhaust vents in the fire located compartment and its downstream smoke compartment is recommended...|$|E
40|$|For road tunnels {{with and}} without smoke extraction, the control of {{longitudinal}} airflow is essential in order to limit smoke propagation in case of fire. Various concepts for the handling of longitudinal airflow have been investigated. These include jet fans, the use of (semi-) <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation,</b> directed point air injection (Saccardo-nozzles), local air extraction, air curtains and mechanical curtains. At present, the application of jet fans is the standard solution, but not necessarily the optimum for all applications. Jet fan installation in the traffic envelope often leads to problems with corrosion and accessibility for maintenance and repair. Jet fans require extra space under the ceiling or in niches. This may lead to high additional costs if jet fans have to be retrofitted during ventilation system upgrades in existing tunnels.

In this paper, according to the measurement of reduced-scale fire tests, the smoke layer's temperature, thickness, gas concentration and heat release rate of fire source were studied. Furthermore, the effects of fire source, opening and ventilation to the occurrence of flashover were further discussed. It is shown that the critical line of flashover for the different fuels is between 600 °C and 700 °C, and critical condition is different for different fuels and different openings; for the different <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation,</b> the smoke evacuation has the best effect only when the exhaust port neat the fire is opened...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} {{determine}} the key features of the fire safety design in transversely ventilated tunnels, the smoke propagation characteristics are examined as a function of fire size, fire location, and airflow rates of supply and exhaust. A 12 -m long scale model of the Memorial tunnel, with a scale down ratio of cross section 1 / 20, is used. Fire sizes and ventilation rates in real tunnels are then deduced from the Froude similarity. In general, it is found that the smoke propagating distance increases with the fire size and decreases with the exhaust ventilation rate. When the fire location is off-centered, the propa-gating distance becomes substantially larger than that of the centered fire with the same size. A hazardous situation generated from an imbalance between the supply rate and the exhaust rate is also observed. The results suggest that the smoke propagating distance and/or the smoke filling may serve as good criteria for determining the <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> rate.

40|$|In cities, road tunnels {{are built}} {{to make room}} for homes and offices and in these tunnels {{millions}} of vehicles travel every year. Fires in these confined spaces can have severe consequences and must actively be worked with to prevent. In Värtahamnen, Stockholm, a short road tunnel {{at the end of the}} E 20 is currently being projected between 2011 and 2013. The stretch is a known hazardous goods route and thus fire protection systems should be adapted accordingly. Fires in tunnels are problematic since the tunnels confined nature provides a very high re- radiation of heat, temperatures up to 1000 °C is expected in early stages of the fire. Hamnpåfarten is a known hazardous goods route, and the fire protection is designed with a fireload of 100 MW. Safety in road tunnels is governed by a number of regulations, for tunnels over 500 m statutory rules in the act (SFS 2006 : 418) – and the ordinance (SFS 2006 : 311) on safety in road tunnels apply. Transportstyrelsen is originator ofTunnel 11, which although is not mandatory for other actors than Transportstyrelsen, municipalities may choose to use these guidelines in their own tunnel projects. ADR-S is the Swedish version of the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road. In this document tunnel classifications are defined, for whether hazardous good may be carried in a road tunnel or not. Hamnpåfarten is an about 200 meters long tunnel that is inclined about 5 %, and makes a sharp turn. In the system document, no fixed fire fighting system is planned, instead an evacuation staircase in the middle of the tunnel is used. Hamnpåfarten is classified in tunnel class TB, and is expected to be classified as a B-class tunnel in ADR. The main risks identified in the tunnel include: collision between vehicles, spill of hazardous goods and explosion class 1. However, none of these risks are significantly large. Alternative methods to keep fire safety at a high level include fixed fire fighting systems and fire ventilation. In order to offer the same evacuation opportunities as an evacuation staircase, the effectiveness of half <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> combined with a foam based fixed extinguishing system is examined using simulations in FDS. The results from the FDS simulations showed that with the adopted parameters, the system is not capable of the high fire load. Only the northern end of the tunnel upholds the environmental standards for evacuation. The simulations carried out were made on the assumptions that the <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> must be approved according to Tunnel 11. It also appears some questions related to this result. How much money is it worth to invest in a system wich in the initial stages may not be able to control the large fire? It is displayed in Tyréns FDS simulations that critical conditions occur in the tunnel after 9 minutes, it may in other words not be possible to initiate the fire fighting systems systems after five minutes. Fixed fire protection in tunnels appear to be an interesting technical area, however, there are few tests performed on large scale fires in tunnels, which might be interesting to do more of that to be able to design protection systems that can handle these fires.

40|$|In many tunnels with <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation,</b> the smoke-extraction {{capacity}} is determined {{on the base}} of the estimated smoke production rate of the design fire. This design method implicitly assumes a stable stratification of the smoke layer. As the assumption of a stratified smoke layer is not justified when higher flow velocities are expected, the entire air volume that flows in the tunnel must be removed. In tunnels with gradients exceeding three percent, the chimney effect due to the rising temperature in the tunnel may cause flow velocities of 4 m/s and more. Therefore, the smoke-extraction capacity has to be designed for an anticipated longitudinal flow at the fire location. In this paper, three models for the calculation of the effective pressure difference due to the chimney effect are compared. With these models, the expected flow velocity in the tunnel can be calculated based on buoyancy and external forces. Examples for smoke extraction systems are given for existing and planned tunnels. In the tunnel Gotschna, the smoke extraction {{capacity is}} designed for an expected maximum flow velocity during the design fire. In the tunnel Vue-des-Alpes, the extraction capacity is not sufficient and the longitud inal flow during the fire is limited by means of several jet fans.

In particular, has been detected that the building acts with a behaviour typically defined as "greenhouse effect", which determines high values of temperature and humidity content, in absence of a correct longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The research was aimed to study all the failures and pathologies and to identify design solutions to improve the performance of the thermo-hygrometric and internal ventilation of the building, and in general the conditions of the microclimate, in order to ensure a condition of comfort to the users and to ensure, at the same time, a suitable air quality for the preservation of fruit and vegetables. It is targeted to a solution that, using techniques of passive cooling, is able to control and exploit the geometric, locational and technological characteristics of the building, ensuring the maximization of air efficiency and thermal exchanges between the building and the outside. Through a bioclimatic approach, have been proposed solutions able to low the inside temperature in the central gallery of the market in the summer period and an adequate exchange of air: the interaction of the existing building with the external environment has been exploited to produce the necessary internal cooling, thanks to a model that works with "stack effect", by combining solar chimneys and properly designed earth-air heat exchangers in the ground...|$|E
40|$|The 2, 7 km long Saukopf-tunnel in Weinheim (Germany) is {{operated}} with bidirectional traffic and ventilated using a <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> system. This incorporates a continuous smoke extraction that enables {{to extract the}} smoke over the half or the entire tunnel length. In addition, the vitiated tunnel air can be extracted {{from the middle of}} the tunnel using the point extraction that can also perform smoke extraction. Due to the enforcement of the new German guideline on tunnel equipment of road tunnels (RABT- 2003 [1]), the ventilation system has to be upgraded in order to cater for the more onerous requirements for the fire case. The distributed smoke extraction is to be replaced with localised smoke extraction using remote controlled dampers. Furthermore during the smoke extraction, a control of the longitudinal flow is recommended. In this tunnel with bidirectional traffic, the most efficient smoke extraction is obtained, if the smoke is extracted such that air flows equally from both sides of the fire towards the extraction point situated above the fire. In order to enable a regulation of the longitudinal flow, new ventilation systems typically use jet fans. However due to civil constraints, this would be difficult to realize for this tunnel and consequently alternatives have been considered. One method is to enable air supply as well as extraction at the current middle extraction point. Furthermore, when smoke is extracted in one half of the tunnel, fresh air could be supplied in the other half. With these means, the flow velocity at the location of the fire can be influenced favourably. In the present work, the theoretical framework for the control of the flow velocity using a punctual air supply or exhaust is developed. The analysis is tested by conducting one-dimensional non-stationary calculations with the in-house computer program SPRINT. Using a scenario approach, the concept for the control routines has been simulated, evaluated and optimised...|$|E

However, traffic tunnels present significant environmental and health issues due to the elevated levels of pollutants inside the tunnels, poor visibility, and smoke caused by accidents. In this research, a critical review of the recent literature on air pollution modeling in traffic tunnels and on the ventilation systems used in tunnels is presented. In addition, an air quality modeling concept that has been applied to the Souk Sagheer Traffic Tunnel in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is also presented. This tunnel is bidirectional and has a forced ventilation system. The level of air pollution inside the tunnel, especially the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration, has been reported to exceed the permissible limits. The tunnel is particularly congested with traffic during the pilgrimage season and has different modes of operation at different times of the year. In the present work, the current status of the tunnel is simulated using a one-dimensional model that takes into consideration the effects of the forced ventilation and the piston action of vehicles. The developed model that validated with measured data, and the Mann-Whitney test shows that the means values of measured and predicted results are equal at a 7 % significance level. The measured results show that during peak traffic times, high concentrations of CO, nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and fine particulate matter often exceed the regulatory limits. SO₂ has the highest ratio of measured to recommended concentration of all of the pollutants considered. In this study, several solution scenarios are simulated, such as improving the current longitudinal ventilation, utilizing a <b>transverse</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, or building a wall to separate the tunnel into two smaller tubes. The simulation results show that building a separation wall between the two directions of traffic will significantly reduce the pollution inside the tunnel. For example, the mean value of CO inside the tunnel is reduced from 43. 8 mg/m³ to 12. 1 mg/m³ when a wall barrier is introduced.
