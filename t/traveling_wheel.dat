50|$|The bullwheel began use in farm {{implements}} with the reaper. The term described the <b>traveling</b> <b>wheel,</b> traction wheel, drive wheel, or harvester wheel. The bullwheel powered all {{the moving parts}} of these farm machines including the reciprocating knives, reel, rake, and self binder. The bullwheel's outer surface provided traction against the ground and turned when the draft animals or tractor pulled the implement forward. Cyrus McCormick used the bullwheel to power his 1834 reaper and until the early 1920s when small internal combustion engine gasoline engines like the Cushman Motor began to be favored.|$|E

40|$|Compaction {{behavior}} of ground subjected to repeated loading by a <b>traveling</b> <b>wheel</b> was anaiyzed for shallow sand laycr. Displacement of soil particles was measured as {{the movement of}} marlters, arranged between the sand layer and the transparent sidewall or soil bin. Soil particles represented elliptical trajectory in the processes with approach and passage of the wheel. The displacement of the soil particles reduced exponentially {{with the number of}} repetition of the wheel traveling. The volumetric strain, which was calculated from the displacements, was gradually increased with respect to the repetition number. The magnitude of the volumetric strain at high slippage was grater than that at low one. Likewise, the changes of the shear strain also showed the same tendency as that of the volumetric one. Therefore, it was clarified that the soil compaction due to the wheel traveling is closely related to the shear deformation of ground, i. e. the dilatancy effect. 車輪の繰返し走行時の地盤転圧挙動を解明するために, 走行車輪下の土の変異を高精度に計測し, 地盤の変形挙動を詳細に解析した. その結果, 以下の知見を得た. １）車輪の接近, 通過に伴い土粒子は楕円状の変位軌跡を示した. また, 変位軌跡の残留性状は, すべり率が大きくなるほど車輪後方へ変移することがわかった. 2) 変位軌跡の大きさはすべり率によらず走行回数とともに指数関数的に減少する傾向が見られるが, その変化率はすべり率が大なほど顕著となることを示した. 3) 地盤の圧縮率は, すべり率に関係なく表層付近が最も大きく, 深度約 70 mmにまで線形的に減少した. 4) 地盤は繰返し走行回数に対して指数関数的な圧縮特性を示した. 5) すべり率が大きい場合には, せん断ひずみの振幅量が大きくなるため, 地盤が著しく圧縮される. 地盤の圧縮には, 地盤のせん断変形によって引起されるダイレイタンシーが深く関係している事実を明らかにしている...|$|E
40|$|The {{trial-and-error}} method {{is widely used}} for the current optimization of the steel casting feeding system, which is highly random, subjective and thus inefficient. In the present work, both the theoretical and the experimental research on the modeling and optimization methods of the process are studied. An approximate alternative model is established based on the Back Propagation (BP) neural network and experimental design. The process parameters of the feeding system are taken as the input, the volumes of shrinkage cavities and porosities calculated by simulation are simultaneously taken as the output. Thus, a mathematical model is established by the BP neural network to combine the input variables with the output response. Then, this model is optimized by the nonlinear optimization function of the genetic algorithm. Finally, a feeding system optimization of a steel <b>traveling</b> <b>wheel</b> is conducted. No shrinkage cavities and porosities are induced through the optimization. Compared to the initial design scheme, the process yield is increased by 4. 1 % and {{the volume of the}} riser is decreased by 5. 48 × 106 mm 3...|$|E

50|$|During {{the year}} the college holds a number of large events, of which the largest are Victoriana!, the Informal, the Jazz Dinner Dance, and the College Formal. The Jazz Dinner Dance ('JDD') is an {{intimate}} black tie occasion for collegians and their guests. The College Formal is an annual event, organised and run by a committee (usually selected from senior students). Up to 500 guests attend the black tie function. Usually held in the quadrangle, recent themes have included School of Rock (2007- including a guest performance by Austrian glam-metal band Gerspunken), Neon Mirage (2005 - Las Vegas) and Circus Royale (2004). The 2004 Formal took the event to the college oval, with dodgem cars, a jumping castle, fire breathers and the largest <b>traveling</b> Ferris <b>wheel</b> in Australia. Previous years have also allowed guests to bathe in hot tubs, ride in hot air balloons, take motorbike rides around the oval and view fireworks displays.|$|R

After doing so, it is time for Snafu to relax. He smokes under the shade of a tree. He is not alarmed when the tree asks for a light, speaking in a German accent. The Fairy has to remind him that the enemy can use camouflage too.|$|R

We first present a concept of the new driving wheel mechanism with a tire in the conventional style such QS a rubber tire or a pneumatic tire,"Offset Steered Driving Wheel". The configuration of the wheel has an offset distance between a wheel axle and a steering axle along a direction of <b>wheel</b> <b>traveling.</b> We then describe the kinematics and the control method of Offset Steered Driving Wheel to provide an omnidirectional and holonomic capability for a vehicle by actuating a wheel axis and a steering axis independently. The wheel is non-holonomic system however, we introduce a control strategy to avoid a non-holonomic constraint...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{analysis}} of running gear–soil interaction traditionally {{focuses on the}} measurement of forces and torques developed by the running gear. This type of measurement provides useful information about running gear performance {{but it does not}} allow for explicit investigation of soil failure behavior. This paper describes a methodology based on particle image velocimetry for analyzing soil motion from a sequence of images. A procedure for systematically identifying experimental and processing settings is presented. Soil motion is analyzed for a rigid <b>wheel</b> <b>traveling</b> on a Mars regolith simulant while operating against a glass wall, thereby imposing plain strain boundary conditions. An off-the-shelf high speed camera is used to collect images of the soil flow. Experimental results show {{that it is possible to}} accurately compute soil deformation characteristics without the need of markers. Measured soil velocity fields are used to calculate strain fields...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{excavator}} is {{used for}} not only civil engineering but also building demolition, scrap recycling and so on. The reason is thought {{that it has a}} general-purpose power supply system and is able to move by itself. In other words, it could be considered a kind of high-powered robot. As a whole, it consists of several modules. Divided roughly by each function, power module such as an engine and pumps, working module such as front structures and hydraulic actuators, traveling module such as crawlers or wheels, operation module such as control levers and pedals. In this time, to gather and carry lots of objectives in scrap yard or somewhere, both a fork grapple and a loader bucket are equipped as a working module. And to carry the objectives quickly to destination, <b>wheeled</b> <b>traveling</b> system is equipped. As a result, we have produced a multi-functional handling machine which has double front attachments and wheels. Then if operators cooperate the modules effectively, {{they will be able to}} handle their work more efficiently...|$|R
40|$|When {{a vehicle}} with wheels aligned in pairs turn, the <b>wheel</b> <b>traveling</b> {{around the outside}} of the curve has to roll farther than the wheel on the inside. This means that some sort of device must must be used to allow the drive wheels to rotate at {{different}} speeds to prevent wear on the tires. This is usually a mechanical device where the input rotation controls the sum of the two output rotations, this is known as a differential. This solution however has some shortcomings, the biggest one is that the total amount of force that can be transferred between the tires and the road surface is limited by the tire with the least traction. In slippery conditions this can be a big problem since it only takes one wheel to lose traction in order to prevent the vehicle from accelerating. In this thesis a locking differential is used to overcome this shortcoming, this gives the driver the option to lock the shafts of the driving wheels together. This is done by pushing two cogwheels, one attached to each shaft, together. The aim of this thesis is to shorten the lock- and unlock-time of the locking differential by aligning the cogwheels using the service brakes and available sensors. The results were evaluated by implementing the software in a truck and doing test runs on Scanias test track. These tests showed that the system greatly improved both lock- and unlock-times but at cost of lower driver comfort. With additional work with some fine tuning of the system, the overall performance could probably be increased even more...|$|R
