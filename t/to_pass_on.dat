5|$|Criticism of the MPC has {{centred on}} its {{predominant}} focus on inflation {{to the detriment}} of growth and employment, although that criticism may have been mitigated by the March 2013 revisions to the committee's remit. There have also been complaints about the reluctance of lenders <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> rate changes, and {{about the extent to which}} the introduction and management of QE have risked politicising the committee.|$|E

5|$|More {{offspring}} {{are produced}} than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction.

2500|$|During the {{production}} of sex cells, DNA is [...] "reshuffled" [...] {{to ensure that the}} next generation does not inherit, for example, grandpa's chromosome 8, but a mixture of DNA from each parent. Instead, paired chromosomes exchange parallel pieces of DNA, a process called chromosomal crossover, prior <b>to</b> being <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the next generation. When particular genes are located physically close together on a chromosome, they tend <b>to</b> be <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> together. The rate at which two genes are <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> together can be used to calculate their distance from each other on the chromosome. Genes which tend <b>to</b> be <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> as a group form what is called a [...] "linkage group." ...|$|R

5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose Madonna and Child, signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E
5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also important because they produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>on.</b> All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins {{described himself}} as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.|$|E

These {{and most of the}} 211 ex-VVKJ aircraft received by the ZNDH had first to be repaired and/or overhauled at the Ikarus plant in Zemun.|$|E
5|$|Under Confucianism {{the typical}} family was patriarchal because men had the {{capability}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> {{the family name}} and carry on the lineage of the ancestors; women {{were expected to be}} subservient. Adoption of Western family values in the twentieth century challenged traditional Chinese values. Nationalism contributed to the changes of customs and status of women. Nationalist revolutionary Qiu Jin promoted feminism through various essays and speeches, as well as through her Chinese Women's Journal. Jin chastised wife beating, female infanticide, arranged marriages, and foot binding. She eventually began teaching at a girls' school. Around this time, many other schools for girls opened in China. This led to increased job opportunities for women in the 1920s.|$|E
