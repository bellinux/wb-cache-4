500|$|After {{the success}} of Baby Doll, Baker was {{subsequently}} offered parts in The Brothers Karamazov (1958), Too Much, Too Soon (1958), and The Devil's Disciple (1959). She refused to make Too Much Too Soon, so Warner Bros. put her on suspension, which prevented her from starring in The Brothers Karamazov (1958) at MGM. Baker was also chosen by MGM for the lead in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and by Twentieth Century Fox for The Three Faces of Eve (1957), but her contract with Warner Bros. again prevented her from accepting the roles. Tensions between Baker and the studio escalated further when she went against their wishes by appearing in Arms and the Man on stage. Baker commented {{on the effect of}} the system on her career, saying: [...] "I came in {{at the end of the}} big studio system. I still had a slave contract and they were willing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> almost anything they had." ...|$|E

500|$|Higginbotham entered Purdue as a {{freshman}} in 1944. At the time, the student body was composed of approximately 6,000 white students, and 12 black students. Although eligible for admission, black students were not permitted {{to live in the}} dormitories. Higginbotham and the other 11 black students were placed in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks could live in West Lafayette. The students slept in the attic, which was unheated. Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C. Elliott, to ask permission for the students to sleep in a section of one of the heated dormitories. Elliott's response was purportedly [...] "he law doesn't require us <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> those dormitories. The law doesn't even require us to let you in. You take it or leave it."

[...] At PopMatters, Scott Interrante rated the album eight discs out of ten, writing that [...] "Minor missteps aside, Yours Truly is ultimately an impressive debut for Grande." [...] Ryan Dennehy of AbsolutePunk rated the album a 70-percent, stating that [...] "Yours Truly is more tempered and less likely <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a beaming state of catatonia" [...] that is [...] "a missive containing some of her most personal thoughts and her oft-regrettable youthful impulses." [...] At Pitchfork, Andrew Ryce rated the album a 6.5 out of ten, calling it [...] "a very safe record." [...] Lewis Conner of Digital Spy rated the album four stars out of five, writing how [...] "The production feels fresh, the lyrics are relatable and the melodies are as cool and sweet as a dollop of raspberry ripple", and where he also states that [...] "The tone and pace of the album rarely changes, but the songs feel accomplished, polished and vibrant".

2500|$|Butkus {{was drafted}} by the Bears as the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL Draft. He soon {{established}} himself as a ball hawk with his penchant for forcing turnovers. In his NFL career, he intercepted 22 passes, recovered 27 fumbles (a record when he retired), and was responsible for causing many more fumbles with his jarring tackles. His tackling ability earned him both admiration and trepidation from opposing players. According to Hall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones, Butkus [...] "was a well-conditioned animal, and every time he hit you, he tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the cemetery, not the hospital." [...] In 2009, the NFL Network named Butkus the most feared tackler of all time.|$|E

In the letter (entitled [...] "Special Clarification by the Italian Representative of RAI, the Official Italian Television Station"), Cristiano denies that RAI had any involvement with the filming of the incident {{and that one of}} the station's Italian competitors was responsible for the footage. He wrote, [...] "We [...] emphasize to all of you that the events did not happen this way, because we always respect (will continue to respect) the journalistic procedures with the Palestinian Authority for (journalistic) work in Palestine and we are credible in our precise work."

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Out Magazine, Amos used the song [...] "Maybe California", a track from the album in which a mother ruminates on leaving her husband and child(ren) [...] "better off" [...] as she contemplates suicide, to explain just how personal writing and composing both the song and the record as a whole were for her: [...] "I wouldn’t have written this record if I hadn’t been pushed — {{for all kinds of}} reasons. I don’t want to go into all of it but “Maybe California” doesn’t come from nowhere. You’re not able to write that by having a drink with somebody who’s had the experience and you haven’t. You have to be pushed to that place." [...] She speaks of the mother figure in the song: [...] "there's nothing that she can give to stop this terrible emotional cancer that has taken over her family - her life - everything around her." [...] Adding credence to the notion that the song is deeply autobiographical, Amos chose to highlight the despair older, more mature women, such as herself, face: [...] "I began to realize how serious this quiet, tragic problem was and that it's not okay to talk about it, whereas teen suicide - it gets discussed and it's almost something where there are [...] for it. But mothers contemplating this - my God - they're just going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a nuthouse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> your place. She doesn't sit and ponder about stuff, where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. But {{every now and then}} I like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which Jackson says every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though I later learned it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. For years I didn't. Now I love being called Jo. I've come to the point where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that has happened to me. I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E
