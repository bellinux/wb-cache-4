Container dimensions have been standardized over the years, and sea transport primarily utilizes containers on ships [45]. However, there is no standardized container type designed specifically for humanitarian logistics. Nevertheless, a promising intermodal transportation unit (ITU) design was funded under EU 7 th Framework Programme (Tellibox [46]) for commercial setting combined transportation (i.e. road, rail, and sea).

30|$|Regardless of the {{organization}} of the transport, the benefit of reduced transport time variability is related to the impact on costs of the sender and/or receiver of the goods.

Little guidance is available on how the impact of infrastructure measures on the transport time variability may be estimated. There are various sources for time variability for transports that go either direct or via <b>transhipment</b> <b>points</b> from a sender to a receiver. The sum of the variations adds up to the total transport time variability during the transport. The second issue is to calculate the VTTV for the cargo transported on the part of the infrastructure that is addressed.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{increasing}} presence of Western powers in East Asia, {{the importance of}} maritime access to Beijing grew. In 1816, the Taku Forts were rebuilt to protect the access to the Haihe estuary at the Dagu area. The Forts became a critical battleground during the Second Opium War. In {{the aftermath of the}} war, the 1860 Treaty of Tianjin opened up Tianjin to foreign trade and established the first Foreign Concessions in Tianjin. While the main trade port was located upriver in the Concessions at Zichulin (紫竹林), right next to Tianjin city, Dagu and Tanggu became critical <b>transhipment</b> <b>points</b> due to the Taku Bar (大沽坝), the two-miles wide sandbar at the Haihe mouth, which had a high tide depth of less than 3 m. This meant that most seagoing ships needed to anchor in the Bohai Bay and lighter their cargo onto shallow barges. For this purpose, the Sino-British [...] "Taku Tug & Lighterage Company" [...] (大沽驳船公司) was founded in 1864, and the first modern wharf at Tanggu was opened (the [...] "Tongku Little Wharf" [...] at Lanjingdao, nowadays the Huanhai Shipyard). Soon other transshipment facilities followed, in particular those run by Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson. Tanggu also remained a critical strategic point for the Qing government, and Li Hongzhang established the Taku Naval Dockyard there, and fostered the extension of the Kaiping Tramway to Dagu —later the Jingtang (Beijing-Tanggu) railway.|$|R

40|$|Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs) {{are often}} {{conceived}} as an enabler to alleviate negative effects associated with {{distribution of goods}} in cities, such as traffic congestion and hazardous emissions. UCCs not only {{have the potential to}} reduce these effects but also provide alternative distribution solutions by introducing new <b>transhipment</b> <b>points.</b> Despite their potential, UCCs often fail to be self-supporting and are often dependent on subsides, which is not considered to be sustainable in the long run. In response, this thesis takes its point of departure in the two business models elements value propositions and target customers. A business model is often viewed as an enabler to generate revenue and UCCs have the potential to generate revenue by offering services to their customers, and the customers pay for the services. To understand how customers can benefit from UCCs and provide arguments why they should use these, {{it is important to understand}} the relationship between customers’ needs and the services UCCs can provide. The purpose of this thesis is to identify and describe the potential relationship between needs of UCC customers and UCC services. The research in the thesis is both explorative and descriptive, where a first step is to identify customer needs, UCC services, and value propositions. The descriptive part is to describe them and it is also the foundation for understanding the relationship between customer needs and UCC services. Through the analysis and discussion, multiple customer needs are identified and described for seven customer groups and the UCC operator; all of which could be considered customers of UCCs. The thesis also adds to the UCC literature with three new identified UCC services: e-commerce with used products, advertisement, and registration in computer system. The outcome of the analysis also provides illustrations of how customer needs can be matched with UCC services. For the most studied customer group, receiver of goods, a total of 29 different matches were identified, which illustrates the possibilities but also the complexity of the relationships. To understand the relationship, three different types of gaps were also identified that have implications for future research. The main contributions to research and the UCC literature in particular are enlargement of the scope of customers and the illustration of the relationships between customer needs and UCC services. The illustrations include contributions such as identifying, mapping and describing the customer needs, UCC services, and value propositions. An important first step is to understand how customer needs and UCC services can be linked, and this thesis provides examples of how this can be achieved. Viewing every stakeholder as a potential customer opens up the opportunity to fulfil their needs and the potential to generate revenue, which in turn could close the gap in the problem of non-self-supporting UCCs. Furthermore, with self-supporting UCCs, the number of freight vehicles can be reduced and this may lead to more attractive cities with less traffic congestion and lower emissions.

40|$|The {{economic}} impact of the port sector is usually measured at an aggregate level by indicators such as value added, employment and investment. This paper tries to define the economic relevance for the regional {{as well as for the}} national economy at a disaggregate level. It attempts to identify, quantify and locate the mutual relationships between the various port players themselves and between them and other Belgian industries. Due to a lack of information foreign trade is only tackled very briefly but the method outlined in this paper can be used to measure the national effects of changes in port activity at a detailed level. A sector analysis is made by compiling a regional (regional as geographically opposed to national, not to be mistaken for the Belgian Regions Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia) input-output table, resorting to microeconomic data: a bottom-up approach. The main customers and suppliers of the port's key players or stakeholders are identified. A geographical analysis can also be carried out by using data at a disaggregate level. Each customer or supplier can be located by means of their postcode. In so doing, the {{economic impact}} of the port is quantified, both functionally and geographically. In the case of the port of Antwerp, the results show important links between freight forwarders and agents. The geographical analysis suggests the existence of major agglomerating effects in and around the port of Antwerp, referred to as a major <b>transhipment</b> location <b>point.</b> Key words: port economics, regional input-output table, sector analysis, geographical analysis. port economics, regional input-output table, sector analysis, geographical analysis...|$|R
50|$|In 1921 the Federal Royal Commission into Standard Gauge had {{recommended}} that the mainland States of Australia and the Australian Government commit themselves to providing a uniform railway network linking the capital cities of Australia with a common gauge. As part of the standardisation of the disparate gauges, a new link between Sydney and Brisbane via Kyogle, New South Wales was identified as being a central element. Queensland in 1924 passed the South Brisbane Kyogle Grafton Act committing itself {{to the construction of}} a new standard gauge railway from South Brisbane railway station to the border with New South Wales. As part of this, New South Wales demanded a bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton and the upgrading of the Kyogle branch. The Australian Government provided half the funding for the project. The interstate standard gauge railway line between Kyogle and South Brisbane opened in 1930. The importance of the Toowoomba-Wallangarra southern line diminished, as the new link via northern New South Wales and the Richmond Gap into Queensland did not involve a change of trains at a border station.During the time of the Second World War the strategic importance of Wallangarra was vital in providing an inland <b>transhipment</b> and staging <b>point</b> during the defence of Australia. Large numbers of workers were employed to tranship goods in the New South Wales section of the yard. The extensive yard and station complex at this time consisted of the station building, closets and horse dock at the southern end of the station platform (the border dock). Refreshment Room staff and ambulance quarters were situated at the north end of the platform. On the western (Queensland) side was a goods office, casual crew quarters with dining room, frame tent and library. To the north-east an engine shed was situated, reserve coal dump, locomotive coal stage, tool room, ASM's residence (1919), ganger's residence (1919) and trucking yards. On the east side (New South Wales) was the Station Master's residence (1887), 25 ton weighbridge, lamp room, waitresses quarters and the footwarmer furnace. Quarters were also provided for laundresses. Most of these ancillary buildings are now removed.|$|R
