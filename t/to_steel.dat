5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 {{to convert it}} from iron <b>to</b> <b>steel.</b> It was {{repeatedly}} reinforced throughout its existence. When Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley line in 1977, {{the stability of the}} trestle had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail had tried to sell the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the trestle was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5000|$|A flux, often zinc {{ammonium}} chloride is applied <b>to</b> the <b>steel</b> <b>to</b> inhibit oxidation of the cleaned surface upon exposure to air.

5|$|The wood beams {{under the}} glass canopy were {{determined}} to be defective in 2014, and a plan was made to replace them in September 2015 with steel beams. ZGF agreed to pay $602,000 to replace the wood beams, with the city paying an additional $188,000 to upgrade <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> beams.|$|E
5|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> by farriers because it is lighter and more durable.|$|E
5|$|To inhibit corrosion, {{at least}} 11% {{chromium}} is added <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> {{so that a}} hard oxide forms on the metal surface; {{this is known as}} stainless steel. Tungsten slows the formation of cementite, keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in high speed steel. On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.|$|E

5|$|Vanadium foil {{is used in}} {{cladding}} titanium <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> {{because it}} is compatible with both iron and titanium. The moderate thermal neutron-capture cross-section and the short half-life of the isotopes produced by neutron capture makes vanadium a suitable material for the inner structure of a fusion reactor.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, Cubzac {{served as}} a watchtower through the Four Sons of Amon castle. Different means of {{crossing}} the river in Cubzac have historically been used, from pontoon bridges and horse-powered ferries <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> and concrete bridges. Part of a vibrant wine region, Cubzac has several wine castles, including the Terrefort castle. It has developed its own sparkling wine, {{in what is now}} called the Café de Paris. The limestone quarries of Cubzac supplied for the typical white constructions found in Bordeaux and its region. Cubzac has two Monuments Historiques; the first is a painting in a church, the other is the ruins of the Four Sons of Amon castle.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> and not aluminium.|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} {{lathe machine}} {{was used as}} a direct drive friction welding machine to weld similar specimens of high speed steels, similar specimens of carbon steels, high speed <b>steel</b> <b>to</b> carbon <b>steel,</b> pure copper <b>to</b> carbon <b>steel,</b> and aluminum <b>to</b> pure copper. The steel specimens were welded at different friction pressures, at each friction pressure, the friction time and the total upset were measured, and the specimens were heat treated. Specimens of pure copper <b>to</b> carbon <b>steel</b> and aluminum <b>to</b> pure copper were welded at constant friction pressure; the friction time and the total upset were measured. All the specimens were subjected to tensile tests. The study revealed that, the optimum friction pressure for steel specimens was 25 bar. It also revealed that an excellent joint efficiency was obtained by welding of similar specimens of carbon steels, a satisfactory joint efficiency was obtained by welding of high speed <b>steel</b> <b>to</b> carbon <b>steel,</b> a poor joint efficiency was obtained by welding of similar specimens of high speed steels, a good joint efficiency was obtained by welding of copper <b>to</b> carbon <b>steel,</b> a very weak joint was obtained by welding of copper to aluminu...|$|R

5|$|The {{high bulk}} density of some ash {{deposits}} can cause line breakage and damage <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> towers and wooden poles due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or {{the lines and}} structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) {{and there has been}} ≥10 mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) adheres to lines and structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware.|$|E
5|$|These {{methods of}} steel {{production}} were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of {{basic oxygen steelmaking}} (BOS), developed in the 1950s, and other oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used. Today, electric arc furnaces (EAF) are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel. They {{can also be used}} for converting pig iron <b>to</b> <b>steel,</b> but they use a lot of electrical energy (about 440 kWh per metric ton), and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E

5|$|As {{the popular}} choice {{leading into the}} election, he handily {{defeated}} fellow councillor Arthur Cushing by a count of 627 votes to 355, and thus became mayor of Edmonton. He served in this capacity for one term of one year, but did not seek re-election in 1906 and retired from political life thereafter. It was during May's term as mayor in which the municipal foundations of Edmonton were set; he oversaw {{the purchase of the}} road maintenance equipment, the city's first telephone system as well as the upgrade of the street car system <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> rails and posts, purchase of land for municipal use, paving of roads, and negotiations {{for the establishment of a}} manufacturing plant in the city. He also travelled to Toronto to lobby for a new union railway station in Edmonton to be constructed for use by the Grand Trunk, Canadian Northern and Canadian Pacific Railways. It was also during May's term which the Alberta Legislature Building would first open its doors, which he would participate in its opening ceremonies. In 1911, he would be named a returning officer for Edmonton, in charge of overseeing the Canadian federal election, 1911.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored <b>to</b> <b>steel</b> I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared <b>to</b> <b>steel.</b> Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E
