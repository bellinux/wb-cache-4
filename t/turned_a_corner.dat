Marshall Plan funding helped overcome bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and Marshall Plan business reforms opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports. Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for realistic prices, emphasizing to Germans that their economy had <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner.</b>|$|E
500|$|In an {{official}} statement, Sega of America chairman David Rosen expressed {{satisfaction with the}} settlement. [...] According to Rosen, [...] "This settlement is a satisfactory ending to what was a very complex set of issues. Not only are we pleased to settle this case amicably, we've also <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> in our association with Accolade and now {{look forward to a}} healthy and mutually beneficial relationship in the future." [...] Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, [...] "We are very pleased with the settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. We will now be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and Game Gear systems throughout the world." [...] Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to missing training camp, Doughty suffered a concussion {{early in the}} season that forced him onto injured reserve. [...] He struggled upon his return from the injury and faced criticism that he had allowed his physical conditioning to lapse. Doughty himself admitted that he was not enjoying the game {{early in the season}}. [...] He said that his season <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> when the team replaced Murray with Darryl Sutter, a coach who preached the need for preparation. [...] Doughty was elevated into a role where he was expected to shut down the opposition's top forwards, forcing him to focus more on his defensive play than his offensive. [...] Consequently, Doughty's 36 points on the season was his lowest total in three years. [...] He was the top-scoring defenceman in the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, however, recording 16 points in 20 games to help the Kings win the first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. Doughty was praised as the top player for either team in the final series, a six-game victory over the New Jersey Devils.|$|E

500|$|In their {{review of}} the show, The Age commented that Minogue was able to emulate Bardot's {{appearance}} well and wrote: [...] " [...] looked the spitting image of Brigitte Bardot as she <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of west London into Paris for the evening." [...] Andy Battaglia from the A.V. Club complimented the staging and performances as [...] "sharp and kinetic," [...] although he also felt that the [...] "little bits of stage banter deflate an aesthetic otherwise set on air-lock." [...] Billboard critic Keith Caulfield praised the concert show as [...] "extravagant" [...] and opined {{that it should have}} been a part of a [...] "mammoth" [...] arena tour. Writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, Greg Hassall gave a favourable review of Money Can't Buy and summarised it as [...] "lots of '80s-influenced electro-pop, with a few oldies thrown in for good measure." [...] People magazine complimented the visuals but felt Minogue's vocals were [...] "electronically enhanced." [...] Craig McLean from the Daily Telegraph called Money Can't Buy a [...] "real tour de force" [...] and noticed that the tracks from Body Language were more low-key than songs from her previous albums, describing them as [...] "sedate and immaculate dancefloor rhythm" [...] and [...] "All very stylish and considerably more affecting than the similarly nostalgic Sophie Ellis-Bextor." [...] Mclean praised the incorporation of the past songs as they provided [...] "the huge choruses for which the nation loves her so," [...] and concluded of the show: [...] "No slinky back-arching or pristine choreography here: just the giddy joy of pop music at play." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 12:30 pm, {{thousands}} of government supporters were {{gathered around the}} palace blocking all routes to Miraflores except for the Llaguno Overpass, which was where the Bolivarian Circles had gathered to overlook the route. As the march <b>turned</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> and began to approach the Miraflores at about 2:00 pm, the National Guard fired about 12 tear gas canisters from behind the palace walls and the protesters fled back down the road. As more marchers pressed toward Miraflores, {{the leaders of the}} protest, Guaicaipuro Lameda and Rear Admiral Molina Tamayo, [...] "kept calling on them to surge forward for a direct assault on the palace about two hundred yards away" [...] and urged the crowd to advance through the tear gas about 20 minutes after the initial confrontation. The protesters made it closer to Miraflores and the Presidential Guard responded with more tear gas, about 20 gas canisters causing panic and a dispersion of the demonstrators to areas surrounding the palace. At about 2:30 pm opposition protesters began to throw objects at the National Guard and the Chavistas a block away; some were thrown back, and the opposition and the Chavistas exchanged insults.|$|E
