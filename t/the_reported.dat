5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>report</b> on <b>the</b> Beef Tribunal was {{published}} in July 1994. Labour had threatened to leave the government if Reynolds was criticised.

5|$|Early in the afternoon, another {{supercell}} developed {{around the}} town of Maryborough, around 300km north of Brisbane. It developed rapidly also, and at 2:30pm a number of reports sent to the Bureau of Meteorology reported a tornado had touched down in Oakhurst, a rural area 10km west of Maryborough. However, due to the low population density in the area <b>the</b> <b>reported</b> damage was sparse, with one house destroyed, several others unroofed and hundreds of trees were snapped.|$|E
5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, <b>the</b> <b>reported</b> associated variants {{are unlikely to be}} the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.|$|E
5|$|In August 1964, the United States Navy {{reported}} they {{were attacked by}} torpedo boats of the North Vietnamese Navy in {{what became known as}} the Tonkin Gulf Incident. In response to the perceived aggression of Communist forces in Southeast Asia, the United States Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution which enabled U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to deploy conventional military forces in the region to prevent further attacks by the North Vietnamese. Immediately after the Tonkin Gulf Resolution was passed, Johnson ordered the bombing of North Vietnamese Navy bases in retaliation for <b>the</b> <b>reported</b> attacks on U.S. Navy warships between 2 and 4 August 1964. However, the Viet Cong forces in South Vietnam were not deterred by the threat of U.S. retaliation.|$|E

5|$|In February 2012 the Standards in Public Office Commission {{published}} the candidates' returns for campaign donations and election expenses.

Three candidates received the maximum refund allowed; the other four had too few votes and received no refund. Only donations above €638 need be reported, making <b>the</b> <b>reported</b> totals less meaningful. Gay Mitchell had stated his campaign would be funded by a Fine Gael members' lottery.|$|E
5|$|Inconsistent {{inheritance}} of myostatin mutations (for example, F94L in Limousins, nt821 in Angus, and Q204X in Charolais) by progeny {{is expected to}} result in possible BLUP prediction errors for EBVs and EPDs equalling or exceeding worst case standard errors of prediction. For example, average rib eye area for Limousins in US Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) trials during the 1980s and early 1990s {{is reported to be}} 12.3in2, and <b>the</b> <b>reported</b> possible difference in rib eye area in progeny arising from {{inheritance of}} either two F94L mutations or two normal myostatin genes from heterozygous parents is estimated to be 1.8in2 (12.3in2 x 15%). This difference, which is unpredictable without DNA testing, is nearly four times the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy, reported to be 0.46in2 for the rib eye EPD.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have lighter greys {{and browns}} amidst the starker {{blacks and whites}} of their plumage; two- or three-year-old birds of both sexes closely {{resemble}} and are difficult to distinguish from adult females.

Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age, though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded. <b>The</b> <b>reported</b> age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is {{between the ages of}} three and five years.|$|E

Markway has chosen two individuals to accompany him—a psychic, Theodora, also known as Theo, and the meek Eleanor Lance, who experienced poltergeist activity as a child. Eleanor spent her adult life caring for her invalid mother, whose recent death has left Eleanor with severe guilt.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>reported</b> {{stations}} for box huckleberry {{fall within the}} Appalachian Mountains, ranging from central Pennsylvania in the north to eastern Tennessee in the south. However, the specimens located in Maryland and Delaware {{were found on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain, and the single North Carolina station is in the Piedmont. Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America, but was almost eradicated by glacial advances, surviving only where it escaped the ice in protected refugia.|$|E

A majority of the board voted to keep <b>the</b> <b>report</b> secret. Sweeney resigned from the board, then threatened to bring the matter up before a public meeting of the executive council of the AFL-CIO. The board established an eight-member special advisory committee, headed by O'Sullivan, {{to decide whether to}} release <b>the</b> <b>report.</b> <b>The</b> committee unanimously agreed to release <b>the</b> <b>report,</b> but O'Sullivan was out-voted 6 to 2 to accept <b>the</b> <b>report's</b> recommendation that directors return their profits to ULLICO.|$|R
5|$|Ocean {{embarked}} on a six-date concert tour from November 5 to November 15, 2011, through North America and Europe to promote both the mixtape and his other musical projects. Originally, six shows were scheduled with a New York City performance at the Bowery Ballroom on the 6th. The original date for that show was postponed to the 27th, and that an additional show on the 28th had been added. <b>The</b> <b>reported</b> reason was because Ocean was sick.

5|$|See then {{elected to}} perform a visual {{circling}} approach, a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules, {{as long as the}} pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. <b>The</b> <b>reported</b> weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E
