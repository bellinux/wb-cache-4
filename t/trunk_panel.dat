5000|$|SLAB: Originated in the Houston, TX {{area since}} the mid-1980s - usually a {{full-size}} luxury car (primarily a Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, or Lincoln inclusive with several lowered-tier brands e.g. Chevrolet, Ford, Chrysler; in recent years some malaise era GM front wheel drive luxury sedans and imports e.g. Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Lexus are included), custom wire wheels (primarily the discontinued Cragar Star Wire originally optioned for the 1983 and 1984 Cadillac Eldorado now manufactured by Texan Wire Wheels) fitted with Vogue Tyres (known as 83s, 84s, Swangaz, Elbows), loud speaker set-ups (same as the DUB/DONK), neon signage inside the <b>trunk</b> <b>panel,</b> hydraulic-actuated trunk panels (known as a pop trunk), flashy paint (several coats of clearcoat on a paint job known as candy paint (named after the Jolly Rancher or Now & Later candy products), vertical stainless steel trim on the <b>trunk</b> <b>panel</b> (known as belt buckles) aftermarket grille (similar to a Rolls-Royce or Bentley as homage to the 1970s-era pimpmobiles), {{and the use of}} a Cadillac front end sheetmetal conversion (from the use of 1990-92 Brougham sheetmetal or if a large truck or SUV, the front sheetmetal from an Escalade). Vehicle interior usually clad in beige or tan (known as peanut butter interior), and a Grant GT steering wheel clad in woodgrain (known as a Wood Grain Wheel). Usually connotated with Houston Hip Hop music.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, the 429CJ & SCJ's {{were dropped}} from the lineup, and {{horsepower}} dropped across the board due to the switch to new SAE net horsepower calculations. The following year also produced the fewest Mach 1 sales of the 1971-73 generation. There are no major differences in the '71 and '72 Mustangs externally, other than {{the addition of a}} [...] "Mustang" [...] script {{on the right side of}} the <b>trunk</b> <b>panel</b> (excluding Mach 1). The '72 Mach 1 also saw deletion of the pop-open gas cap, which was replaced with the standard twist-on cap found on the other Mustang models that year. The 302 Windsor remained as the base Mach 1 engine, with the 2 or 4 barrel 351 Clevelands as the only options.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{forming process}} of {{automobile}} <b>trunk</b> side <b>panel</b> was investigated, using numerical simulation technology, {{to acquire the}} feasible process parameters and improve the formability of the product. With the technology, the manufacturability working procedures and drawing process parameters of the product were analyzed, calculated and simulated to achieve optimum formability characteristics. The method effectively lowers the probability of springback, wrinkling and thickness reduction, and shortens design cycle and cost. Based on the simulation results including forming limit diagram and thickness distribution diagram, the feasible process parameters are determined...|$|R
50|$|Other test {{equipment}} includes a line insulation tester and an automatic trunk tester, for items whose numerosity and simplicity lent themselves to automatic testing. An automated AMA translator tester checked for miswiring that could bill one line to another. A nonautomated outgoing <b>trunk</b> test <b>panel</b> allows voltmeter checks on trunks to distant offices, freeing the MTF from this tedious job. Each outgoing trunk {{is represented by}} two jacks: one for test access for the voltmeter {{and one for the}} make-busy operation. MTF was able to override Make Busy when necessary.|$|R
5000|$|The P400S Miura, {{also known}} as the Miura S, made its {{introduction}} at the Turin Motorshow in November 1968, where the original chassis had been introduced three years earlier. It was slightly revised from the P400, with the addition of power windows, bright chrome trim around external windows and headlights, new overhead inline console with new rocker switches, engine intake manifolds made 2 mm larger, different camshaft profiles, and notched <b>trunk</b> end <b>panels</b> (allowing for slightly more luggage space). Engine changes were reportedly good for an additional [...]|$|R
5000|$|The 1967 Satellite was a {{carryover}} from 1966, {{but there}} were several trim changes. A new grille featured dual side-by-side headlights, {{a change in the}} rear <b>trunk</b> finish <b>panel</b> and taillights included multiple horizontal ribs. New horizontal aluminum trim at the lower body crease with lower silver paint gave all 1967 Satellites essentially a two-tone paint scheme. For 1966 and 1967, the interior vinyl seats and door panels were treated to a unique 'Western Scroll' design which mimicked tooled leather in appearance. This was the 'premium' interior shared with the GTX in 1967. For 1966 and 1967 the Satellite was again offered only in 2-door hardtop and convertible models and was powered by V8 engines. The 361 was discontinued for the 1967 models, but a 2-barrel 383 producing [...] was optional, as well as 4-barrel version rated at [...]|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} possible transport of cyanogenic glycosides from leaves of rubber tree crown clones (Hevea spp.) resistant to South American leaf blight to the <b>trunk</b> of the <b>panel</b> clones in which they are grafted. The cyanogenic potential (HCNp) of the crown clones was determined in the trunk bark, at different distances from the cambium, and its gradient was evaluated along the trunk. The correlation between the HCNp of the crown leaves and that of the trunk bark was also evaluated. HCNp determined in leaves showed a wide range variation in the species studied as crown clones, with the lowest values registered in H. nitida clones, and the highest ones in H. rigidifolia. In the trunk bark, the tissue layer nearer the cambium showed higher HCNp values. A positive basipetal gradient was observed along the trunk, i. e., there was an increase in HCNp from the apex toward the base. Although the grafted crowns influence the cyanogenic potential of the <b>trunk</b> bark of <b>panel</b> clones, the absence of correlation between the HCNp of the leaves and trunk bark indicates that the crown is not the main source of the cyanogenic glycosides found in the trunk...|$|R
50|$|The carved panel {{facing this}} one is a {{two-level}} depiction of Ravana lifting Kailash. The upper scene is Mount Kailash, where Shiva and Parvati are seated. The eight-armed, three-eyed Shiva wears headgear with a crescent and disc behind it. Most of his arms are broken, two of them resting on attendants' heads. The Parvati figure, seated facing Shiva, remains only as a <b>trunk.</b> The <b>panel</b> is flanked by door keepers. Attendants of Shiva are also seen in the relief but mostly in a damaged state. Bhringi is seated near Shiva's feet and to his left is the elephant-headed son of Shiva, Ganesha. In this ensemble, the ten-headed demon-king Ravana is seen, with only one head left unscathed, and out of his twenty arms, only a few are discernible. Around Ravana are several demons. Numerous figures are seen above Shiva: the god Vishnu, riding his mount Garuda, to his left; a skeleton-figure; and in a recess, Parvati's mount, a tiger is depicted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract ? The {{objective}} of this work was to study the influence of cyanogenesis on the onset of irreversible tapping panel dryness (TPD) and the physiological and histological aspects of secondary phloem in the <b>trunk</b> (tapping <b>panel)</b> of rubber trees (Hevea spp.). Two cyanogenic compounds, linamarin and KCN, were applied separately on the trunk bark of healthy mature trees belonging to two Brazilian clones (Fx 4098 and Fx 3899). Changes in histology, latex pressure potential (YP) and cyanogenic potential (HCNP) were followed in the trunk inner barks. In addition, the HCNp levels were determined in TPD-affected plants of both clones. The applications of linamarin or KCN in healthy plants decreased latex YP, and formed tylosoids associated with in situ coagulation of latex. The clone Fx 4098 had the higher HCNp and showed the quicker and stronger responses to the cyanogenic compounds. Plants with TPD syntoms had a higher HCNp than the untreated healthy ones. Since histological changes are also structural markers of early TPD, it can be inferred that excessive release of cyanide can induce it in sensitive rubber clones. 201...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{the quality and}} {{accuracy}} of models improved dramatically, but price went up and they were sold in more upscale stores, dealerships, and through on-line mail order.

50|$|For {{outgoing}} calls, the Line Link Frame {{acted like}} the line finder {{of the panel}} switch, autonomously connecting the line to a junctor, which corresponded to the cord circuit of the old cord telephone switchboard. As in the panel switch, the sender then found the chosen junctor and supplied dial tone. Like the panel switch, the 1XB common control {{was based on a}} complex, versatile sender circuit. The sender decoded dial pulses and was retrofitted for dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) in the 1960s. A large number of senders used a common translator circuit to detect a call going to a nearby area code to be stored in abbreviated form. It called in an auxiliary sender when necessary to implement Direct Distance Dialing (DDD). Like the panel switch, two or more offices with separate incoming sections could share an outgoing section for more efficient <b>trunking.</b> Unlike the <b>panel</b> switch, it was rare to combine more than two this way.|$|R
40|$|There is good {{potential}} {{for use of}} Reclaimed fibers such as cotton, Polyester in moldable nonwoven materials for automotive applications. Variety of automotive parts, such as headliner, wall <b>panels,</b> <b>trunk</b> liners, parcel shelves, and hood sound insulators with excellent shape stability can be manufactured by conventional techniques. These fibers are coupled with economic and environmental benefits. The thermal insulation properties of the nonwoven materials were determined, in accordance with ASTM, using the new thermal conductivity tester. The experimental data show that thermal insulation properties of the nonwoven materials vary significantly, {{depending on the type}} of Reclaimed fibre [...] This research work starts with opening and segregating the reclaimed fibers. Later the fibers get transformed to a non-woven, by passing it through a sequence of operations, which encompass the mechanical web laying technique, the aerodynamic principle and chemical bonding. The focus of this research is to produce compostable used fibre based non-woven. These non-woven disposed off after their intended use in an eco-friendly way.

Dois compostos cianogênicos, linamarina e KCN, foram aplicados separadamente na casca do tronco de árvores sadias de dois clones adultos (Fx 4098 e Fx 3899). Alterações na histologia, potencial de pressão de látex (&# 936;P) e potencial cianogênico (HCNp) foram monitoradas. Além disso, os níveis HCNp foram determinados em plantas afetadas por TPD, em ambos os clones.

5000|$|With such {{big changes}} for Eldorado {{just a year}} earlier, 1989 saw little that was new. The {{optional}} automatic rearview mirror went from an electrically operated mechanical tilting mechanism to the new electrochromic style, using a clear fluid filled between the mirror and a thin sheet of glass, which tints upon activation. A new exterior color, White Diamond, brought the color choices up to 18. Gone were the 14-inch wheels, as the previously optional 15-inch [...] "snowflake"-style aluminum wheel, introduced last year, was made standard for the base Eldorado. A compact disc player, available only with the Delco Bose Gold Series music system, was a new option this year, as was reversible floor mats, and gold-plated ornamentation ("Cadillac" [...] grille and <b>trunk</b> scripts, sail <b>panel</b> ornaments, deck lid engine plaque, trunk lock cover, tail lamp emblems, and available wire wheel cover wreath and crest). New standard items include an express-down module for the driver's window, electronic oil-life indicator, a more powerful Delco Freedom II battery, a revised factory warranty, and GM's PASS (Passive Automotive Security System) KEY theft-deterrent system, which activated the fuel system based upon a coded pellet within the ignition key. Previously optional items that were now added as standard equipment included a cassette player with graphic equalizer, remote fuel filler door release, and a front license plate mounting. In an effort to use up existing warehouse stock, the brushed chrome lower bodyside accent molding, optional through last year, was added as standard equipment for 1989 (revamped moldings would appear in 1990). New high-gloss Birdseye Maple trim (replacing the satin-finished American Walnut used from 1986 to 1988) on the instrument panel and console was standard on Eldorado Biarritz, and available (for $245) on the base Eldorado. The optional full cabriolet roof, which re-created the dashing look of a convertible top, was offered this year in limited colors. Pricing rose again, now at $26,738. Production slipped slightly, down to 27,807 (including 7,174 Biarritz models). The dip in sales was partly due to competition from GM's own Buick Riviera, which grew 11" [...] this year in a dramatic restyle, and had a production increase from 8,625 units in 1988 to 21,189 in 1989.|$|R
50|$|Interiors were {{available}} in four colors: black, nut brown, sky blue, and wine red. With the only exceptions of the A and C-pillar inner plastic moldings, the windshield and rear hatch inner plastic surrounding moldings, the door latches, the door cranks, the side armrests, the door ashtrays, {{the steering wheel and}} column plus the dashboard the rest of the interior is 100% made and designed in Mexico by VAM's styling department. The most striking features of the Lerma's interior design relied on the its door <b>panels,</b> side <b>panels,</b> <b>trunk</b> and seats. The first two incorporated high trim fabric and lower portion horizontal carpet inserts with fake horizontal chrome (lower portion) and woodgrain (upper portion) moldings. The seats consisted of a fixed rear bench seat and individual recling front wide bucket seats with adjustable headrests. The pattern on these seats is nothing short of impressive, incorporating a design of four squared buttons forming another square over the seat bottoms and backs. These portions are actually outer ones over {{the main body of the}} seat and is not stretched out, giving the feeling and impression of having a cushion over both the main seat bottom and back. The bases of both sets of seats are covered in carpet. The VAM Lerma was the only four-door VAM car not to incorporate a fixed front bench seat, making it also the only four-door VAM car to incorporate individual (reclining) front seats. The Lerma's trunk is unique among VAM (and AMC) cars alike. It is a closed compartment covered in carpet and incorporated both rear stereo speakers at each side of the lid. The lid itself is hinged to the back of the frame near the rear seat back and had a fixed rear light similar to the ones used in the hood, it would flick on and off depending on the position of the lid. Despite how truly elegant the trunk looked, its design made to follow the side lines of the interior of the car as well as the dimensions of the massive rear hatch glass ended up creating a truly low amount of trunk space for barely anything other than the spare tire. This situation forced owners to buy an external roof rack fixed to the side drip rails in order to be able to carry any luggage, which might compromise the looks of the car.|$|R
