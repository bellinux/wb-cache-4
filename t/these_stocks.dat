5|$|Whales again {{migrate off}} Japanese archipelagos {{and into the}} Sea of Japan. Connections between <b>these</b> <b>stocks</b> and whales seen in the Sea of Okhotsk, on Kamchatka coasts and around the Commander Islands have been studied. Historical {{wintering}} distributions could have been much wider and more southerly distributed, as whales were seen in areas along the Batanes, Sulu and Celebes Seas including off Palawan, Luzon, Malaysia and Mindanao, with higher densities around today's Cape Eluanbi and Kenting National Park. Unconfirmed sightings have been reported near Borneo in modern times. The first confirmation in modern Taiwan was of a pair off Hualien in 1994, followed by a successful escape from entanglement off Taitung in 1999, and continuous sightings around Orchid Island in 2000. Few/none regularly migrate into Kenting National Park. In addition, despite sightings reported almost annually off Green and Orchid Islands, relatively short stays in these waters indicate recoveries as winter foraging has not occurred. Sightings, including of a cow-calf pair, have occurred along {{the east coast of}} Taiwan. Around Hong Kong, two documented sightings were recorded in 2009 and in 2016. One of the first documented sightings within the Yellow Sea was of a group of 3 or 4 individuals, including a cow/calf pair in Changhai County in October, 2015.|$|E

We apply the weekly stock returns data for <b>these</b> 5 international <b>stock</b> markets from January 2005 to November 2012. The results show that, {{there is no evidence}} of global financial crisis contagion to stock markets of ASEAN countries based on time varying beta indices of <b>these</b> <b>stock</b> markets. In the other hand, during the global financial crisis period, there is significant reduction in dynamic portfolio value at risk level, that it is an evidence of lack of financial crisis contagion to <b>these</b> <b>stock</b> markets. This also means that the ASEAN portfolio leads to a low level of capital required and also a small revision to required capital. The estimated results also show that there are significant interaction and co movements in cross ASEAN stock markets except Malaysia stock market. This means that there are not diversification gains of the constructed portfolio among <b>these</b> <b>stock</b> markets. <b>These</b> results may have implication for investors and portfolio managers in order to international portfolio diversification and risk management...|$|R

25|$|Herring {{are found}} in the North Sea and the North Atlantic at depths to 200 meters. Important herring {{fisheries}} have existed in these areas for centuries. Herring of different sizes and growth rates belong to different populations, each of which have their own migration routes. When spawning, a female produces from 20,000 to 50,000 eggs. After spawning, the herrings are depleted in fat, and migrate back to feeding grounds rich in plankton. Around Iceland, three separate populations of herring were traditionally fished. <b>These</b> <b>stocks</b> collapsed in the late 1960s, although two have since recovered. After the collapse, Iceland turned to capelin, which now account for about half of Iceland's total catch.|$|E

However, holding stock in a Federal Reserve bank is not like owning stock in a publicly traded company. <b>These</b> <b>stocks</b> cannot be sold or traded, and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank {{as a result of}} owning this stock. From the profits of the Regional Bank of which it is a member, a member bank receives a dividend equal to 6% of their purchased stock. The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks' profits is given over to the United States Treasury Department. In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of $100.2 billion and distributed $2.5 billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.|$|E

2500|$|Borrow cost is the {{fee paid}} to a {{securities}} lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The {{cost of borrowing}} the stock is usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the margin account - in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted {{for less than a}} 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the margin account. However, certain stocks become [...] "hard to borrow" [...] as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The cost of borrowing <b>these</b> <b>stocks</b> can become significant - in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) Krispy Kreme stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock {{over the course of the}} year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply. This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, as the borrow cost itself can become a significant convenience yield for holding the stock (similar to additional dividend) - for instance, put-call parity relationships are broken and the early exercise feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become rational to exercise early, which otherwise would not be economical.|$|E
