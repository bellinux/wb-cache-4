5|$|In 1976, {{a clutch}} of seven 190-million-year-old Massospondylus eggs was found in Golden Gate Highlands National Park in South Africa by James Kitching, who {{identified}} them as most likely belonging to Massospondylus. It was nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 15-centimetre- (6in-) long embryos. They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found. By early 2012, at least 10 egg clutches from at least four fossiliferous horizons had been found, with up to 34 eggs per clutch. This indicates that this nesting site {{may have been used}} repeatedly (site fidelity), by groups of animals (colonial nesting); in both cases, these represent the oldest evidence of this behaviour. Sedimentary structures indicate that the nesting area was in the vicinity of a lake. The eggshells were very thin (about 0.1 mm), allowing gas exchange even in a low oxygen and carbon dioxide rich environment, which indicates that the eggs were at least partly buried in the substrate. There are no hints that Massospondylus constructed nests; however, the arrangement of the eggs in <b>tight</b> <b>rows</b> indicates that the eggs were pushed in this position by the adults.|$|E

Unlike the uniform, <b>tight</b> <b>rows</b> of {{buildings}} of Gorky Street, Dorogomilovo road {{was lined with}} very different buildings, with wide spaces between them. It was an experimental area for Burov, Rosenfeld and other young architects. These buildings were not as thoroughly engineered as on Tverskaya and wooden ceilings and partitions and wet-stucco exteriors eventually resulted in greater maintenance costs.

5000|$|You {{will see}} it everywhere, on Broadway of every city and Main Street of every town, on the boardwalks and beaches of coast resorts, and even in remote farming villages. It comes up to hit {{you in the face}} year after year in all its amazing variations: waist-line under the arm pits, [...] "trick" [...] little belts, what-nots in the cuffs; {{trousers}} so narrow you fear they will burst before your eyes, pockets placed in every position, buttons clustered together in a <b>tight</b> little <b>row</b> or reduced to one. Such progressive styles may not reflect the international tastes or etiquette.|$|R

60|$|Without further delay they {{embarked}} in the boat, which, though small, {{was found}} to be sufficiently <b>tight,</b> and <b>rowed</b> off towards the spot where the hippopotamus had been seen. Presently his blunt ungainly head rose within ten feet of them. Wilkins got such a start that he tripped over one of the thwarts in trying to take aim, and nearly upset the boat. He recovered himself, however, in a moment, and fired--sending a ball into the brute which just touched the brain and stunned it. He then fired his second barrel, and while he was loading Tom put two more balls into it. It proved hard to kill, however, for they fired alternately, and put sixteen bullets--seven to the pound--into different parts of its head before they succeeded in killing it.|$|R
50|$|As {{the quarterback}} goes, so goes any team, which {{explains}} {{the rise and}} fall of the Browns in 1980 and '81. FB Mike Pruitt rushed for more than 1,000 yards (1,103) for the third straight year in 1981, and caught 63 passes for the second season in a <b>row.</b> <b>Tight</b> end Ozzie Newsome set a team record (since broken) for receptions with 69 and had the second-most receiving yards in Browns history at the time with 1,002.HB Greg Pruitt established a personal best with 65 catches.|$|R

"No mistake at all," [...] responded Dick, {{suffering}} his oar {{to float}} on its blade, and running his fingers into his hair, {{as if he}} was content with his achievement [...] "no more mistake than there is in taking the sun on a clear day and in smooth water. Guinea is in the boat you hired; but a bad bargain you made of it, as I thought at the time; and so, as 'better late than never' is my rule, I have just been casting an eye over all the craft; if this is not the <b>tightest</b> and fastest <b>rowing</b> clipper of them all, then am I no judge; and yet the parish priest would tell you, if he were here, that my father was a boat-builder, ay, and swear it too; that is to say, if you paid him well for the same." ...|$|R
40|$|Corruption in literal {{meaning is}} a crime, rottenness, bribery, immorality, depravity, dishonest that use {{authority}} to enrich themselves/other persons/ corporation which could bring suffering toward state financial and economy, depravity of the perpetrator of corruption crime can suffer the social {{life in a}} state continuously. Thus, corruption is also mentioned as an extraordinary crime and mentioned as transnational crime. Therefore, more modern ways {{should be used to}} eliminate corruption crime. In this matter, the prosecutor is an independent institution in conducting eliminating of corruption act that is established based on the Law Number 16 of 2004. Currently, it becomes social consideration on the presence of prosecutor by the emergence of new institution, i. e. Commission of Corruption Eliminator (KPK) that is valued by most of parties has more superior authority in conducting investigation of corruption crime. It brings influence on how the presence of prosecutor in conducting investigation of criminal crime. This research intended to know the presence of prosecutor as an institution that has authority to conduct investigation by the attendance of Commission of Corruption Eliminator (KPK) in handling corruption criminal crime. In fact, the position of prosecutor and KPK is equal, by the reason based on the establishment of respective institutions appropriately to the law; thus, between prosecutor and KPK, there aren’t any hierarchic/ organizational relations. It makes the prosecutor have not obedient to KPK. However these two institutions are related to coordinal relations and supervision in order to increase their perceived respective roles by the attendance of KPK. The prosecutor can more optimize its performance in eliminating corruption. The conclusion from this legal writing is that the corruption crime gradually spreads, thus it damages this state’s economy. Thus, it is established institution so called KPK which is hoped to be able to cooperate with the prosecutor in eliminating the perpetrator of corruption who in conducting its credibility, it doesn’t exclude their respective authority in handling corruption crime. Thus there will not be any overlapping authority of these respective institutions. Thus, as suggestion from the author, it is better in conducting the overwhelming of corruption crime, there is any coordination and having <b>tight</b> mutual <b>rows,</b> either in the part of prosecutor and KPK, thus the efforts that are conducted can be more effective and maximal in eliminating the enemy of human, i. e. corruption...|$|R
50|$|One {{contemporary}} observer at {{this time}} noted that Coatbridge is 'not famous for its sylvan beauties of its charming scenery' and 'offers the visitor no inducements to loiter long'. However, 'a visit to the large Gartsherrie works {{is one of the}} sights of a lifetime'.

50|$|Many crops {{which are}} {{critical}} for the market, like vegetables, are row crops (that is, grown in <b>tight</b> <b>rows).</b> While often the most profitable for farmers, these crops are more taxing on the soil Row crops typically have low biomass and shallow roots: this means the plant contributes low residue to the surrounding soil and has limited effects on structure. With much of the soil around the plant exposed to disruption by rainfall and traffic, fields with row crops experience faster break down of organic matter by microbes, leaving fewer nutrients for future plants.|$|E
5000|$|On May 9, 2015, {{the second}} {{community}} tree planting volunteers planted 5,000, 4-6 foot tall tulip poplar trees. The holes {{will once again}} be pre-dug and prepared for planting. Volunteers will only {{have to put the}} tree in the hole and cover it with dirt. Participants are asked to bring shovels, as equipment is limited. The plan is to grow the trees for about 10 years, over five acres, in <b>tight</b> <b>rows,</b> causing them to grow taller and straighter, and then [...] "thin" [...] them by transplanting some to other open lots.|$|E
50|$|A flatbed wagon {{would pull}} {{up next to}} the barn {{underneath}} the end of the track, the spear lowered down to the wagon, and speared into a single bale. The pulley rope would be used to manually lift the bale up until it could enter the mow through the door, then moved along the track into the barn and finally released for manual stacking in <b>tight</b> <b>rows</b> across the floor of the loft. As the stack filled the loft, the bales would be lifted higher and higher with the pulleys until the hay was stacked {{all the way up to}} the peak.|$|E
5000|$|This second Literary Guild {{selection}} is, at one level, {{a classic}} gothic. Yet, again drawing {{on his personal}} background, the author sets the story on a modern high-tech Navy base. [...] "Those ships!" [...] reviewed Caroline Banks in The Washington Post, [...] "Richard Setlowe has made them—in part by juxtaposing them to the elegant 'pillared mansions of the senior officers along Walnut Avenue'—seem as sinister as the House of Usher. They are 'a great desolate armada—aircraft carriers, battle cruisers, assault transports, destroyers and submarines—all packed stem to stern in <b>tight</b> <b>rows</b> {{along the length of}} a narrow bleak pier.' [...] " [...] As in The Experiment, Setlowe creates a convincing scientific framework for the supernatural.|$|E
50|$|The hand flake {{was only}} built and {{utilized}} when {{the amount of}} fish caught during a season called for it; as such these were considered temporary structures. Hand flakes were built {{low to the ground}} at about waist height with the surface area about the width of a person's reach stretched in various lengths. These were placed in very <b>tight</b> <b>rows</b> to maximize available land. These were conveniently located next to or in close proximity to the main flake for quick storage of the fish whenever the weather was inclement. It was very vital that the fish be kept dry during the curing process to prevent rot and most importantly to prevent fly spits that would lead to maggots. Any of these occurrences could ruin a harvest.|$|E
50|$|Local {{tradition}} {{holds that}} the Blood family themselves collected the cobblestones from the lake and brought {{them down to the}} house starting with Blood's purchase of a farm in the area in 1830, reflecting Lyndonville's increasing importance within the town over Yates Center due to its proximity to the Erie Canal and its location along a creek that powered a mill. It was completed in 1846, its <b>tight</b> <b>rows</b> a hallmark of the middle and late years of the cobblestone trend. Originally it had four chimneys, three of which were purely decorative, to maintain a symmetrical exterior appearance. The fourth was at the southeast corner of the main block. Its extant flue angles to the east wall, suggesting along with the construction date that the builder was using the new technology of stoves to heat the house, instead of relying on fireplaces.|$|E

40|$|A house once {{symbolized the}} American dream-frequently {{clustered}} in <b>tight</b> <b>rows</b> and cul-de-sacs, the single-family dwelling not only represented financial success but stability {{and hope for}} the future. However, as recent generations have come to face more and more economic difficulties, a house has, for many, become more of a liability than a dream. Lack of home ownership in New York City has reached an extreme- more than 75 % of residents rent rather than own. In light of this trend, this thesis seeks to imagine, through architecture, a new kind of American dream: housing for nomads where no one owns anything and people are free to roam around the city. This proposal suggests that rather than continuing to downsize the micro houses that constitute today's solution to the home ownership problem, Americans can once again live large-together. by Jasmine M.
