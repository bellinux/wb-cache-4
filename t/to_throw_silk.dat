50|$|There {{were seven}} mills built in Cheshire <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>silk</b> before 1780. Two were in Congleton on the River Dane. Clayton and Pattinson's silk mill, the Old Mill, {{was built in}} 1773 and finally {{demolished}} in 2003. It was a 29 bay, five storey mill with an internal wheel-pit (for a waterwheel). It was described by Yates in 1822:The first silk mill {{which is the largest}} and most conspicuous structure in Congleton, is built of brick, with a pediment containing the dialplate of a clock in the centre. It is 240 feet long, 24 feet wide and 48 feet high, consisting of five storeys, and is lighted by 390 windowsEleven circular throwing machines were housed on the ground floor with winding machines above. In 1771 it employed 600. This was extended by another 17 bays in 1830.|$|E
50|$|The mill was {{constructed}} in 1800 by Henry Hayter on a plot of land called Frog Island. The mill is probably on the same site {{as one of the}} four mills recorded in the Domesday Book. Originally it was a fulling mill (part of the finishing process of cloth weaving). Some years later, in 1917, it was bought by William Madick who changed its operation <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>silk.</b> In 1844 it was acquired by Alexander Bannerman and John Spencer, merchants of Manchester. William Chappell, the manager of the mill, purchased it from them in 1846. At this time the mill employed 108 staff, including 39 {{children under the age of}} 13. By 1866 the mill had passed into the ownership of the Hide family with whom it remained until the death of James Hide in 1955. It ultimately passed to Ede and Ravenscroft who operated it up to 1985, producing legal and academic gowns. It was then acquired by the Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust who, after renovation works, opened it to the public in 1990.|$|E
50|$|Industry started {{early in}} Chomérac, thanks to silk {{manufacturers}} (up <b>to</b> 15 <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> mills in the 19th century) and the marble quarry, which delivers {{to the whole}} region and even abroad.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>throwing</b> is the {{industrial}} process where silk {{that has been}} reeled into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is wound onto bobbins. The yarn is now twisted together with threads, in {{a process known as}} doubling. Colloquially <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, <b>throwing</b> and doubling. <b>Silk</b> had <b>to</b> be <b>thrown</b> <b>to</b> make it strong enough to be used as organizine for the warp in a loom, or tram for weft.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thrown</b> <b>silk</b> is twisted single filament. There {{is a lot}} {{of waste}} from {{processing}} and damaged cocoons. Silk is expensive and ways were found to recover the waste. The waste was cut into fibres 25-50mm long and then these were spun like worsted or cotton using a throstle. This was 'short Silk'. Such a short thread produced a silk with an inferior lustre. In 1836 Gibson and Campbell patented a 'Long Silk' machine for spinning staples up to 250mm. Carding and combing (known as dressing) remained a problem until Lister invented the self-acting dressing machine in 1877. Spun silk is softer than <b>thrown</b> <b>silk</b> and easily blended with other fibres. Silk spinning became an important industry in Congleton: taking place in Stonehouse Green and Brooks Mill, Forge Mill and Bath Vale. Brocklehursts continued long silk spinning in Macclesfield until the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Silk mill is {{a factory}} that makes silk {{garments}} using {{a process called}} <b>silk</b> <b>throwing.</b> Traditionally, <b>silk</b> mills were concentrated in Japan, England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Switzerland. In New Jersey, disputes between silk mill workers and owners lead to the 1913 Paterson silk strike and the 1926 Passaic Textile Strike.|$|R
50|$|C. lyoni {{are active}} hunters. Hanging upside down, they will quickly capture prey caught in their {{irregular}} cobweb-like webs. If hungry enough, they also actively pursue prey that fly {{close to their}} webs. They do not use their fangs when hunting, <b>throwing</b> <b>silk</b> over prey instead and then wrapping them loosely using their hind legs. They will only bite them when they start to feed, which can sometimes be as long as six days after capture. They also actively clean their webs by removing carcasses regularly. When webs become too dirty, they build new ones.|$|R
25|$|James I {{attempted}} to establish silk production in England, purchasing and planting 100,000 mulberry trees, some on land adjacent to Hampton Court Palace, {{but they were}} of a species unsuited to the silk worms, and the attempt failed. In 1732 John Guardivaglio set up a <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> enterprise at Logwood mill in Stockport; in 1744, Burton Mill was erected in Macclesfield; and in 1753 Old Mill was built in Congleton. These three towns remained {{the centre of the}} English <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> industry until <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> was replaced by silk waste spinning. British enterprise also established silk filature in Cyprus in 1928. In England in the mid-20th century, raw silk was produced at Lullingstone Castle in Kent. Silkworms were raised and reeled under the direction of Zoe Lady Hart Dyke, later moving to Ayot St Lawrence in Hertfordshire in 1956.|$|R

50|$|In 1704, Thomas Cotchett {{set up a}} waterpowered <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> mill <b>to</b> produce organizine in Derby. It failed due {{to the use of}} {{the wrong}} type of machinery. In 1717, John Lombe, visited Piedmont and {{returned}} to England with details of the Italian machines, and some Italian craftsmen. He was granted a fourteen-year patent, and built Lombe's Mill in Derby. The King of Sardinia retaliated by prohibiting the export of raw silk. Nevertheless, in 1732 John Guardivaglio set up a <b>silk</b> <b>throwing</b> enterprise at Logwood mill in Stockport, and in 1744, The Button Mill was erected in Macclesfield and in 1753 Old Mill was built in Congleton.

The architect was George Sorocold. At its height, the mill employed some 300 people.|$|R

5000|$|The {{partnership}} of Wilson and Lloyd ended in 1753 after acrimony and legal suits. Lloyd remained {{in possession of}} the building and machinery. In 1765 Thomas Bennet bought the premises from Lloyd subject to a mortgage to the Wilson family but neglected the building during years of trade recession and competition from other mills in Derby and Cheshire. Lamech Swift became the sub-tenant in 1780 paying an annual rent of £7 to the corporation and £170 to Thomas Wilson, brother of Richard and William. Despite a row with the corporation over repairs to the weirs in 1781, he remained in occupation until the lease expired in 1803 when the corporation advertised a lease to run for 60 years.
