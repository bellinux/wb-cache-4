5|$|By {{this time}} {{most of the}} 3rd Brigade men had been killed or wounded, and the line was held by the five {{depleted}} companies from the 1st Brigade. On the left, Gordon's company 2nd Battalion, with the 11th and 12th Battalion's survivors, charged five times and captured the summit of Baby 700, but were driven back by Turkish counter-attacks; Gordon was among the casualties. For the second time Maclagen requested reinforcements for Baby 700, but the only reserves Bridges had available were two 2nd Battalion companies and the 4th Battalion. It was now 10:45 and the advance companies of the 1st New Zealand Brigade were disembarking, so it was decided they would go <b>to</b> <b>Baby</b> 700.|$|E
5|$|Syphilis is most {{commonly}} spread through sexual activity. It {{may also be}} transmitted from mother <b>to</b> <b>baby</b> during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in congenital syphilis. Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and bejel (subspecies endemicum). Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Brigade {{commander}} {{had been}} taken ill, so Birdwood appointed Brigadier-General Harold Walker, a staff officer already ashore, as commander. The Auckland Battalion had landed by 12:00, and were being sent north along the beach to Walker's Ridge {{on their way to}} Russell's Top. Seeing that the only way along the ridge was in single file along a goat track, Walker ordered them to take the route over Plugge's Plateau. As each New Zealand unit landed they were directed the same way <b>to</b> <b>Baby</b> 700. However, in trying to avoid Turkish fire, they became split up in Monash Valley and Rest Gully, and it was after midday that two of the Auckland companies reached Baby 700.|$|E

5|$|After Baby {{discovers that}} Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes), is {{pregnant}} by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter {{who is also}} dating and cheating on Baby's older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker) and several other female guests, she borrows money from her father {{to pay for an}} illegal abortion for Penny. Jake agrees to give the money <b>to</b> <b>Baby</b> even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E
5|$|At 15:15 Lalor {{left the}} defence of The Nek to a platoon that had arrived as reinforcements, and moved his company <b>to</b> <b>Baby</b> 700. There {{he joined a}} group from the 2nd Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Leslie Morshead. Lalor was killed soon afterwards. The left flank of Baby 700 was now held by sixty men, the remnants of several units, commanded by a corporal. They had survived five charges by the Turks between 07:30 and 15:00; after the last charge the Australians were ordered to withdraw through The Nek. There, a company from the Canterbury Battalion had just arrived, with their commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Stewart. By 16:00 the New Zealand companies had formed a defence line on Russell's Top. On Baby 700, there was on the left Morsehead's and Lalor's men, {{and at the top}} of Malone's Gulley were the survivors of the 2nd Battalion and some men from the 3rd Brigade. On the right were the men left from the Auckland companies, and a mixed group from the 1st, 2nd, 11th and 12th Battalions. Once Stewart's men were secure, he ordered Morsehead to withdraw. During a Turkish artillery bombardment of The Nek, Stewart was killed. The artillery heralded the start of a Turkish counter-attack; columns of troops appeared over the top of Battleship Hill and on the flanks and attacked the ANZAC lines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighth}} season, it is {{revealed}} that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy test is negative, {{in order to achieve}} Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth <b>to</b> <b>baby</b> Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: There {{is growing}} {{research}} documenting the psychological benefits of singing. However, it remains unknown whether singing <b>to</b> new <b>babies</b> {{is associated with}} enhanced maternal mental health. This study had two aims: (i) to explore whether these associations exist, and (ii) to compare the effects of singing <b>to</b> <b>babies</b> with listening <b>to</b> music in order to explore whether {{the sound of music}} alone or the physical act of singing might be responsible for effects. Methods: Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to analyse cross-sectional data from 391 new mothers, exploring associations between both singing <b>to</b> <b>babies</b> and listening <b>to</b> music, and symptoms of postnatal depression, wellbeing, self-esteem and self-rated mother-infant bond. Results: Singing <b>to</b> <b>babies</b> on a daily basis was associated with lower symptoms of postnatal depression and enhanced wellbeing, self-esteem and self-reported mother-infant bond. Listening to music was associated with lower depression and enhanced wellbeing but effects were attenuated by confounding variables involving other arts engagement. Discussion: These data suggest that the specific act of singing could support the mental health of new mothers. The correlations found in this study raise questions as to whether maternal singing <b>to</b> <b>babies</b> can causally improve maternal mental health and wellbeing and as such whether singing could be recommended to new mothers as a positive parenting practice, or whether supportive community singing interventions could be developed...|$|R

25|$|English Shepherds {{are often}} larger than Border Collie, but {{the quickest way}} to tell the two apart is to put them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a {{distinctive}} strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull <b>to</b> <b>baby</b> chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as tough as necessary with the stock.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} cause {{worldwide}} is viruses. Other causes include heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, other infections, autoimmune diseases, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There are five main types of viral hepatitis: type A, B, C, D, and E. Hepatitis A and E are mainly spread by contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B is mainly sexually transmitted, but may also be passed from mother <b>to</b> <b>baby</b> during pregnancy or childbirth. Both hepatitis B and hepatitis C are commonly spread through infected blood such as may occur during needle sharing by intravenous drug users.
