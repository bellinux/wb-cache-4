After a bitter argument (and upon both Scully and the Gunmen revealing to Mulder the arrival of black ops mercenaries on the scene), they leave before security arrives.|$|E
5|$|A 3D Classics {{remake of}} Kid Icarus was {{published}} for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console. The remake features stereoscopic 3D along with updated graphics including backgrounds, which the original lacked. It also {{uses the same}} save system as the Family Computer Disk System version does, as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>Password</b> system from the NES version. The 3D Classics version also utilizes the Family Computer Disk System's music and sound effects (utilizing the extra sound channel not available in the NES version).|$|E
5|$|An {{attacker}} having gained authentication material may impersonate the material's owner {{after the}} victim has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material is accepted (for example, until <b>the</b> <b>password</b> is changed or the private key revoked). Heartbleed therefore constitutes a critical threat to confidentiality. However, an attacker impersonating a victim may also alter data. Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go far beyond a confidentiality breach for many systems.|$|E

5|$|After Bond and Vesper share {{a romantic}} dinner, Vesper is kidnapped by Le Chiffre's men. Bond pursues {{them in his}} Aston Martin. He sees Vesper lying {{in the street and}} swerves to avoid her, {{crashing}} his Aston Martin. They are taken captive by Le Chiffre. Before Bond falls unconscious, Le Chiffre reveals that Mathis was his mole in MI6. Le Chiffre tortures Bond for <b>the</b> <b>password</b> to the account containing the money, but Bond refuses to give in. As Le Chiffre prepares to castrate Bond, White bursts in and shoots him dead. Bond awakens in a hospital on Lake Como as Mathis is taken in by MI6. Bond decides to resign from MI6 to be with Vesper.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man 2 {{features}} a few gameplay changes {{from the original}} Mega Man. A new item, the Energy Tank, allows a player to refill Mega Man’s health at any time. Also introduced is a password system. After defeating each Robot Master a password is displayed, allowing the player to return to that particular point in the game after restarting the system. <b>The</b> <b>password</b> stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters, {{as well as the}} number of accumulated Energy Tanks. Unlike the first game, Mega Man 2 does not feature a score counter, and the player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once completed.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening <b>the</b> <b>password</b> protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we review}} <b>the</b> Noisy <b>password,</b> Voiceprint {{biometric}} and One-Time-Password. The most common method used for authentication is static <b>passwords.</b> <b>The</b> traditional <b>passwords</b> {{are vulnerable to}} dictionary attacks, shoulder surfing and eves dropping. <b>The</b> noisy <b>passwords</b> {{can be used as}} an alternative to <b>the</b> static <b>password.</b> <b>The</b> noisy <b>password</b> attempts to mitigate above mentioned problems. The biometric technique like fingerprints, palm-vein scan, etc. can be used for personal recognition. But as compared to other biometric, Voiceprint requires less implementation cost. E-commerce application uses One-Time-Password to perform E-transaction. Hence it becomes necessary to provide security while transmitting the OTP...|$|R
5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know <b>the</b> <b>password</b> necessary to enter the system.|$|E
5|$|Dönitz {{contacted}} the British {{commander of the}} city of Flensburg, asking him for permission to conduct a formal state funeral, which was approved. That funeral, the last such of the Third Reich, was held on 16 May 1945 with Dönitz, Adolf Hitler's successor as Head of State, delivering the eulogy. In advance, Dönitz had ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the shooting. During the court martial, Gottlob stated that, in accordance with his orders, he had asked for <b>the</b> <b>password</b> three times without receiving a response from the person, whom he could not visually identify in the darkness. Without aiming he had fired his rifle from the hip. The chain of events was confirmed by the watch leader. The court ruled that Gottlob was not guilty and cleared him of any fault.|$|E
5|$|To win, {{the player}} must fight monsters {{to improve the}} characters' {{experience}} levels and get gold to buy better weapons and armor. Eventually, the player's characters become strong {{enough to make it}} to the next town or dungeon. This repeats until the player reaches the final boss and defeats him. However, the gameplay is not necessarily linear, especially after the player gets the boat. Exploration is a key component of the game. The game offers a few spots to save the game. In most of the towns, talking to a king or minister saves the game. In the American version, which incorporated a battery for saved games rather than <b>the</b> <b>password</b> system of the original, talking to the king also allows for the deletion and moving of saved games.|$|E

5|$|Veronica has a {{dream that}} she {{woke up in the}} middle of the winter with Logan, but she is plagued with visions of Madison. When she wakes up, she goes to the Hearst library, where Tim Foyle’s (James Jordan) girlfriend, Bonnie, asks her to {{investigate}} who slipped her RU-486, which caused a miscarriage. When Veronica presses Bonnie further, she reveals that Tim or Dick (Ryan Hansen) could be the father, although Tim has been very supportive. Veronica asks Logan point-blank whether Logan had sex with Madison over the winter, and he says yes, leading to a major fight, with Veronica saying she’ll never forgive him. Veronica speaks to Bonnie’s roommate, Phyllis (Toni Trucks), who reiterates that Tim is being very supportive. Veronica successfully breaks into Tim’s office to investigate before realizing she doesn’t have <b>the</b> <b>password.</b> After Keith comforts Veronica due to her breakup, she bugs Tim’s office.|$|E
5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding <b>the</b> <b>password</b> for one of the Aperture Science login screens from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Mega Man {{series on}} the NES has generally consisted of 2D platform games that focus on run-and-gun gameplay. Mega Man X uses the same basic principles as its precursors but with many added options. The player takes control of the protagonist X, and, after completing an introductory stage, is presented with a stage selection screen that depicts eight boss characters. Each stage is littered with various enemies and hazards and ends with a boss battle against its respective Maverick. Completing a stage rewards the player with a new weapon. The player may attempt these eight levels in any order, using weapons gained in one level to overcome challenges in the others. The player can return to the game at a later point using a password system; <b>the</b> <b>password</b> will retain any number of the eight stages cleared and most power-ups. Completing some stages will subtly affect the landscape of others. For example, clearing Storm Eagle's aircraft carrier stage will cause electrical outages in Spark Mandrill's power plant stage. In certain stages, X can hop inside Ride Armors to fight enemies. Ride Armors are bipedal tanks capable of powerful punches.|$|E
50|$|Since a hash {{function}} is one-way, this provides {{some measure of}} security for the storage of <b>the</b> <b>passwords.</b>|$|R
50|$|To decrypt the text, {{the user}} enters <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>password</b> and then pastes the encrypted text into the program. The unencrypted text is then displayed. Without <b>the</b> correct <b>password</b> <b>the</b> encrypted text cannot be decrypted.|$|R
5000|$|Credit {{card data}} was encrypted, but Sony {{admitted}} that other user information was not encrypted {{at the time}} of the intrusion. The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "If <b>the</b> provider stores <b>passwords</b> unencrypted, then it's very easy for somebody else - not just an external attacker, but members of staff or contractors working on Sony's site - to get access and discover those passwords, potentially using them for nefarious means."On May 2, Sony clarified the [...] "unencrypted" [...] status of users' passwords, stating that: While <b>the</b> <b>passwords</b> that were stored were not “encrypted,” they were transformed using a cryptographic hash function. There is a difference between these two types of security measures which is why we said <b>the</b> <b>passwords</b> had not been encrypted. But I want to be very clear that <b>the</b> <b>passwords</b> were not stored in our database in cleartext form.|$|R
25|$|Moving from never {{changing}} one's password {{to changing}} <b>the</b> <b>password</b> on every authenticate attempt (pass or fail attempts) only doubles {{the number of}} attempts the attacker must make on average before guessing <b>the</b> <b>password</b> in a brute force attack. One gains much more security by just increasing <b>the</b> <b>password</b> length by one character than changing <b>the</b> <b>password</b> on every use.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this is a {{password}} cracker that attempts to guess <b>the</b> <b>password</b> for an encrypted file (assuming that <b>the</b> <b>password</b> has a maximum possible length).|$|E
25|$|If a {{password}} system only stores the hash of <b>the</b> <b>password,</b> an attacker can pre-compute hash values for common passwords variants {{and for all}} passwords shorter than a certain length, allowing very rapid recovery of <b>the</b> <b>password</b> once its hash is obtained. Very long lists of pre-computed password hashes can be efficiently stored using rainbow tables. This method of attack can be foiled by storing a random value, called a cryptographic salt, along with <b>the</b> <b>password.</b> The salt is combined with <b>the</b> <b>password</b> when computing the hash, so an attacker precomputing a rainbow table would have to store for each password its hash with every possible salt value. This becomes infeasible if the salt has a big enough range, say a 32-bit number. Unfortunately, many authentication systems in common use do not employ salts and rainbow tables {{are available on the}} Internet for several such systems.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> game {{features}} <b>passwords,</b> {{which leaves}} <b>the</b> {{player in the}} last played stage. <b>The</b> <b>passwords</b> also take count {{of the number of}} lives remaining and <b>the</b> continues used. <b>Passwords</b> cannot be used in hard difficulty, which means that the game must be completed from the beginning. Completion of the hard mode rewards the player with a special ending.|$|R
50|$|A {{password}} {{manager is}} used to store <b>passwords.</b> <b>The</b> <b>passwords</b> that are stored in SecureSafe are protected by AES-256 and RSA-2048 encryption.|$|R
50|$|Some {{password}} managers use a user-selected master password or passphrase to {{form the}} key used to encrypt <b>the</b> protected <b>passwords.</b> <b>The</b> security of this approach depends {{on the strength of}} <b>the</b> chosen <b>password</b> (which might be guessed or brute-forced), and also that the passphrase itself is never stored locally where a malicious program or individual could read it. A compromised master password renders all of <b>the</b> protected <b>passwords</b> vulnerable.|$|R
25|$|For {{computers}} {{set up to}} be bootable from a USB drive, it {{is possible}} to use a flash drive containing a bootable portable operating system to access the files of the computer, even if the computer is password protected. <b>The</b> <b>password</b> can then be changed, or {{it may be possible to}} crack <b>the</b> <b>password</b> with a password cracking program and gain full control over the computer. Encrypting files provides considerable protection against this type of attack.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>password</b> is not sent {{clear to}} the server, thus {{preventing}} Phishing attacks if the user is tricked into accessing the wrong web site.|$|E
25|$|Key {{length in}} Word 97 and 2000 was {{strengthened}} up to 40 bit. However, modern cracking software allows removing such a password very quickly – a persistent cracking process takes one week at most. Use of rainbow tables reduces password removal time to several seconds. Some password recovery software {{can not only}} remove a password, but also find an actual password that was used by a user to encrypt the document using brute-force attack approach. Statistically, the possibility of recovering <b>the</b> <b>password</b> depends on <b>the</b> <b>password</b> strength.|$|E
50|$|The European version {{exclusively}} uses <b>passwords</b> for back-up, <b>the</b> Japanese {{one uses}} primarily a battery back-up, but <b>the</b> <b>passwords</b> are also an option.|$|R
50|$|Unix /etc/passwd is {{a common}} file used to {{demonstrate}} directory traversal, as it is often used by crackers to try cracking <b>the</b> <b>passwords.</b>|$|R
50|$|Clearly {{an adversary}} who can {{eavesdrop}} on a password authentication can then authenticate {{itself in the}} same way. One solution is to issue multiple passwords, each of them marked with an identifier. The verifier can ask for any of <b>the</b> <b>passwords,</b> and <b>the</b> prover must have that correct password for that identifier. Assuming that <b>the</b> <b>passwords</b> are chosen independently, an adversary who intercepts one challenge-response message pair has no clues to help with a different challenge at a different time.|$|R
