500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. In a retrospective {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Eve" [...] was rated a B+, with the episode being called [...] "tidy, satisfying, and suspenseful". The episode's premise and the casting of Harris were both cited as highlights. Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, also rated the episode a B+, calling it [...] "a nicely realized episode" [...] that [...] "does a nice job building slowly and offering some shocks along the way". The acting and tone were also praised, especially the [...] "dead-eyed performances" [...] of the Krievins twins. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, felt that the episode had [...] "a good, original story" [...] that proved [...] "you can't go wrong {{when it comes to}} twins and horror"; with the girls' acting being called [...] "suitably menacing". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade. Series creator Chris Carter stated he liked the casting of the episode, calling Harriet Harris' performance excellent. He also praised the performance of Erika and Sabrina Krievins, stating [...] "those <b>two</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> were so wonderfully understated and creepy". The band Eve 6 took its name from this episode, as the band's member Tony Fagenson was a fan. The plot for [...] "Eve" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Ellen Steiber.|$|E

2500|$|SFGate {{described}} the [...] "show-tune- style songs" [...] as [...] "pleasant but forgettable", adding that [...] "the singing by Short, Belushi, Curry and Broadway belter Golden {{is the best}} thing about the film". It also noted that [...] "One of the obvious obstacles was how to color a film whose natural shadings tend toward black, white and degrees of gray. The result is a lot of odd but fascinating colorations -- the sky might turn up yellow at times, or the sea a deep maroon". The Spokesman-Review wrote [...] "in an era when G-rated movies are as rare as Hollywood humility, any attempt at family entertainment should be lauded", adding [...] "let us salute Don Bluth and his team of animators". In a rare case, The Daily Gazette gave the film 4 stars. The Animated Movie Guide said the film was an [...] "utter waste of talent and resources", due to interference from external forces. Monica Sullivan of Movie Magazine International noted that the film was [...] "heartily enjoyed by the <b>two</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> who saw it with me at a kiddie matinee".|$|E

2500|$|Stanwyck's first {{sound film}} was The Locked Door (1929), {{followed}} by Mexicali Rose, {{released in the}} same year. Neither film was successful; nonetheless, Frank Capra chose Stanwyck for his Ladies of Leisure (1930). Numerous prominent roles followed, among them the children's nurse who saves <b>two</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> from being gradually starved to death by Clark Gable's vicious character in Night Nurse (1931); [...] So Big!, as a valiant Midwest farm woman (1932); Shopworn 1932; the ambitious woman from [...] "the {{wrong side of the}} tracks" [...] in Baby Face (1933); the self-sacrificing title character in Stella Dallas (1937); Molly Monahan in Union Pacific (1939) with Joel McCrea; Meet John Doe, as an ambitious newspaperwoman with Gary Cooper (1941); the con artist who falls for her intended victim (played by Henry Fonda) in The Lady Eve (1941); the extremely successful, independent doctor Helen Hunt in You Belong to Me (1941), also with Fonda; a nightclub performer who gives a professor (played by Gary Cooper) a better understanding of [...] "modern English" [...] in the comedy Ball of Fire (1941); the woman who talks an infatuated insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) into killing her husband in Double Indemnity (1944); the columnist caught up in white lies and a holiday romance in Christmas in Connecticut (1945); and the doomed wife in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948). She also played a doomed concert pianist in The Other Love (1947); the piano music was played by Ania Dorfmann, who drilled Stanwyck for three hours a day until she was able to move her arms and hands to match the music. Stanwyck was reportedly one of the many actresses considered for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939), although she did not receive a screen test. In 1944 she was the highest-paid woman in the United States.|$|E
