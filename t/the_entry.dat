5000|$|As in {{the case}} of magic squares, a bimagic cube has the {{additional}} property of remaining a magic cube when all of <b>the</b> <b>entries</b> are squared, a trimagic cube remains a magic cube under both the operations of squaring <b>the</b> <b>entries</b> and of cubing <b>the</b> <b>entries.</b> [...] (Only two of these are known, as of 2005.)

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second semi-final, a winner's press conference was held for the ten {{qualifying}} countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists {{took part in a}} draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the order the countries were announced during the semi-final. Austria was drawn to compete in the first half. Following this draw, the shows' producers decided upon the running order of the final, as they had done for the semi-finals. Austria was subsequently placed to perform in position 11, following <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> from Greece and before <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> from Germany. On the day of the grand final, Austria was considered by bookmakers to be the second most likely to win the competition, placed only behind <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>entry</b> hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation.|$|E

Similarly, the eigenvalues may be irrational numbers even if all <b>the</b> <b>entries</b> of A are rational numbers or {{even if they are}} all integers.
