5|$|Graff and {{the other}} leaders of the school covertly work to isolate Ender from his fellow {{recruits}} and prevent him from growing <b>too</b> <b>comfortable</b> in his environment. The cadets participate in competitive war simulations in zero gravity, where Ender quickly masters the game and dominates his opponents. The school continually tries to break Ender down, first promoting him to command a new army composed of raw recruits, then pitting him against multiple armies at once, but Ender's success continues. The jealous commander of the army with whom Ender first served, Bonzo Madrid, compels him to fight outside the simulation, and Ender unintentionally kills him, once again seeking to preemptively prevent all future struggles with Bonzo.|$|E

After living in the United States for 21 years, Rakoff was motivated by a desire to participate in the political process and applied for U.S. citizenship. Rakoff chronicled the experience of becoming an American citizen in an essay published in Don't Get <b>Too</b> <b>Comfortable.</b> He became a U.S. citizen in 2003, {{while at the same time}} retaining his Canadian citizenship.|$|E

Ray Rhodes was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach. Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator, and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room. But Rhodes was fired after one 8–8 season. Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become <b>too</b> <b>comfortable</b> with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club.|$|E
500|$|Since Wheldon's {{death at}} the Las Vegas oval, much {{emphasis}} has been put into the elimination of [...] "pack racing" [...] through changes to the tires and downforce levels on high-banked ovals (particularly at Texas Motor Speedway, for its annual IndyCar event).

500|$|... "Dreams Old Men Dream" [...] was {{inspired}} by the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries and Fyodor Dostoyevskys short story The Dream of a Ridiculous Man. It tells the story of an elderly man reflecting back on the life he had and what he wished he had done before.

[...] The overall sound of the track is described as electronica in the vein of [...] "mid-era Radiohead." [...] The album closer, [...] "Cryptomnesia", {{was inspired by}} a case involving Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov being accused of plagiarism involving his 1955 novel Lolita.

Brennan's testimony was based on New Jersey State Police files which alleged that Friedland had acted as the middleman to suppress criminal complaints against a loan shark.

2500|$|Roosevelt as the {{exemplar of}} American masculinity {{has become a}} major theme. As president, he {{repeatedly}} warned men that they were becoming too office-bound, too complacent, <b>too</b> <b>comfortable</b> with physical ease and moral laxity, and were failing in their duties to propagate the race and exhibit masculine vigor. French historian Serge Ricard says, [...] "the ebullient apostle of the Strenuous Life offers ideal material for a detailed psycho-historical analysis of aggressive manhood in the changing socio-cultural environment of his era; McKinley, Taft, or Wilson would perhaps inadequately serve that purpose". He promoted competitive sports and the Boy Scouts of America, founded in 1910, as the way forward.

2500|$|Don't Get <b>Too</b> <b>Comfortable,</b> {{which is}} subtitled [...] "The Indignities of Coach Class, The Torments of Low Thread Count, The Never-Ending Quest for Artisanal Olive Oil, and Other First World Problems" [...] was {{published}} in 2005 and also consists of comical autobiographical essays. Some of the essays were originally published in shorter form elsewhere and some original. The over-riding theme of the articles is the absurdity and excessiveness in American life: the book is about luxuries and privileges being treated as deserved rights. Rakoff said that {{the moral of the}} book is that there should be [...] "a little more guilt out there" [...] and [...] "we could all, myself included, count our blessings, acknowledge our privileges." [...] The book was generally praised by critics. The New York Times said, [...] "Rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly and wittily portrayed". Emily Gordon says that in his [...] "bursts of pure enthusiasm, he's a delectable Cole Porter, Nicholson Baker and Sarah Vowell smoothie". However, Rakoff was criticised in the Washington Post for misusing the word [...] "like", with the reviewer suggesting that Rakoff's prose could use tightening. In The New York Times, Jennifer 8. Lee said the book was [...] "no more than a collection of vaguely related magazine pieces" [...] rather than [...] "a coherent seriocomic manifesto", that some essays were off-theme, and not about narcissism and excess.|$|E

2500|$|The band visited Dingle, on Ireland's {{west coast}} and started writing new material. They {{stayed in a}} small house, {{described}} by Simpson as a [...] "little round house overlooking the sea". They then did some recording in a studio. The main recording sessions, though, happened in an old [...] "condemned" [...] studio in Westmeath, located in {{the central part of}} the country. Simpson found the place to be [...] "laid-back" [...] and [...] "almost like a holiday home". The location was in a secluded area, quite distant from any civilization, with animals running around. This helped the band concentrate well without much distraction. The band stayed there for six weeks. Simpson felt the reason why producer Jacknife Lee was taking the band to different places was because he did not want them to get <b>too</b> <b>comfortable</b> with the surroundings. The songs were generally not written as a whole, but the band wrote them as they [...] "came". The writing process thus varied for each song; instead of spending excess time on one and overworking themselves, the band chose to work on another, often revisiting the song later. The band was also constantly changing song arrangements. Due to this, they found they had gotten a much clearer idea of which songs they would ultimately polish to possibly make the album. Simpson noted that the band had much more time to write and record this time, a luxury they had not enjoyed previously.|$|E

[...] Hipster of Tiny Mix Tapes gave it a score of two stars out of five and called it [...] "an exhausting and overwhelming effort that fails to leave any tangible impression."

2500|$|Having {{rejected}} {{an offer}} to play Captain Jonathan Archer in the American science-fiction TV series , MacCorkindale returned to the UK in 2002 and joined the cast of the BBC One medical drama Casualty, {{in the role of}} clinical lead consultant Harry Harper. Following his casting, {{he said in an interview}} with the Daily Record that he was a long-time fan of the series, commenting that it was [...] "great to be joining an established show with a great bunch of people." [...] In contrast, Neil Bonner of the Liverpool Daily Post quoted him as stating that he had never seen an episode of the show in its then-16-year history. MacCorkindale was surprised to be offered the role of Harper given the many years that he had spent working in North America, but having settled in Exmoor found Bristol to be an accessible production base. MacCorkindale was [...] "never <b>too</b> <b>comfortable</b> as a young actor" [...] and [...] "always felt that [...] best time in the business would be around [...]" [...] MacCorkindale commented that he [...] "loved [...] time on Casualty," [...] and spent time researching all the medical terminology that his character used to ensure that he understood it. He also appeared as Harper in the Casualty spin-off series Holby City and Casualty@Holby City. Many reviewers were disparaging of MacCorkindale's performances in Casualty: Rupert Smith of The Guardian deemed MacCorkindale [...] "fantastically wooden", while fellow Guardian journalists Sarah Dempster and Jim Shelley commented on MacCorkindale's [...] "loud" [...] delivery of his lines. Shelley described the character of Harper as a [...] "human Foghorn Leghorn", while according to Dempster, Casualty was [...] "above all [...] about Simon MacCorkindale, shouting.

2500|$|Shi {{immediately}} started learning kung fu, Chan Buddhism and acupuncture from his masters, Liu Xin Yi and Shen Ping An, who were Shaolin disciples living outside the temple, rather than monks. Because {{of the open}} nature of the temple, where people could come and go easily, he says he learned to read people. Despite his training, Shi also amused himself by playing pranks on his masters, who would punish him either with beatings, or by making him do the horse stance until his legs were numb and swollen, or making do headstands until the blood draining into his head caused pain. Shi's daily routine consisted of awakening at 4:30 am to practice for two hours, followed by a breakfast of steamed tofu and vegetables, prayer, meditation or relaxation for an hour, and then another {{three and a half}} hours of practice. This would be followed by more prayer, Buddhism studies, and cleaning or other Temple work. Although Shaolin monks do not necessarily follow the practice of other monks who do not eat past noon, those at the temple would eat a lunch of noodles, rice or mantou at 11:30 am, out of respect to monks visiting from other temples. After an hour of relaxation, Shi would practice and pray again from 1:00 pm to 5:30 pm, followed by dinner, more relaxation, and more practice until 10:00 pm. From then until 4:00 am the monks would work in shifts to check the temple's incense. The monks slept on a piece of wood with a blanket on it, sometimes using their clothes for pillows, which Shi says is good for the back, compared to American beds, which he says are <b>too</b> <b>comfortable.</b> Although Shi met his Buddhism Shifu, Shi Yong Qian, almost immediately after entering the temple, he did not begin seriously studying with him until he was about 14 or 15. Because the temple did not have running water, the monks had to transport it from mountain rivers just outside the temple, draw it from a well, and collect rainwater. When the temple acquired running water in 1986, the monks were dissatisfied, because under the system of feng shui, digging up the ground and laying in pipes was, as Shi puts it, akin to [...] "cutting your veins out". During the cold winter months, bathing was restricted to washing selected body parts, rather than immersion in or under water. Even today the temple only has cold water.|$|E
