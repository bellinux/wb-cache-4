There had been a similarly creepy viral video in Poland a few years ago, he recalled, that parodied a children's show.

[...] Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party. For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along class, rather than ideological, lines. [...] Stewart believed that [...] "the more strongly armed the classes become the harder will it be to get the things we really need in our government" [...] and asserted that [...] "I never did and never will have any desire to form a coalition with anybody except with men who <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as I do." ...|$|E
500|$|However, because Joshua did not {{actually}} die, the Game was nullified and Neku is forced {{to play the game}} a third time. His entry fee this time is all of the other players, meaning Neku cannot form any pacts and stands no chance against the Noise. However, Beat immediately defects from the Reapers and rejoins Neku. Neku and Beat find that the Reapers and the entire population of Shibuya are wearing special red pins that cause them to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> harmonious thoughts. Without any missions to complete, the two venture to the fabled [...] "Shibuya River", which Joshua was looking for during the second week. At the river, they find , the Game's Conductor. Kitaniji explains that he created the red pins in an attempt to remake Shibuya, which the Composer challenged him to do. If he fails, both he (as his price for losing the Game) and Shibuya will be erased.|$|E

500|$|In the {{subsequent}} decade, two pioneers {{of the style}} became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and {{it had nothing to do}} with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing happened to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E
2500|$|Psychologist Stuart Sutherland {{wrote that}} cases of telepathy can be {{explained}} by people underestimating the probability of coincidences. According to Sutherland, [...] "most stories about this phenomenon concern people who are close to one another - husband and wife or brother and sister. Since such people have much in common, it is highly probable that they will sometimes <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thought at the same time." [...] Graham Reed, a specialist in anomalistic psychology, noted that experiments into telepathy often involve the subject relaxing and reporting the 'messages' to consist of colored geometric shapes. Reed wrote that these are a common type of hypnagogic image and not evidence for telepathic communication.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Rehnquist, {{joined by}} Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas, argued the Law School's admissions policy {{was an attempt}} to achieve an unconstitutional type of racial balancing. [...] The Chief Justice {{attacked}} the Law School's asserted goal of reaching a [...] "critical mass" [...] of minority students, finding the absolute number African-American, Hispanic, and Native American students varied markedly, which is inconsistent with the concept in that one would <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size critical mass would be needed for all minority groups. [...] He noted that [...] "rom 1995 through 2000, the Law School admitted... between 13 and 19... Native American, between 91 and 108... African American, and between 47 and 56... Hispanic... One would have to believe that the objectives of 'critical mass' offered by respondents are achieved with only half the number of Hispanics, and one-sixth the number of Native Americans as compared to African Americans." [...] Citing admissions statistics, the Chief Justice noted the tight correlation between the percentage of applicants and admittees of a given race and argued that the numbers were [...] "far too precise to be dismissed as merely the result of the school paying 'some attention to [...] numbers.'" ...|$|E

Ewen was quoted saying [...] "This is a tricky one because I don't feel comfortable lying, saying we're in the studio recording and we're going to bring music out next year, {{which seems to be}} the favoured line," [...] she said. [...] "I think it's unfair to fans and we should be honest. The band being over is definitely not my choice. I kind of was unlucky in that I came in [...] {{towards the end of the}} cycle when things naturally came to the end. There was so much drama surrounding the group, I think the music just got lost. I don't like all the drama and the negativity. We kind of fizzled out about two years ago. I do think the lineup changes have obviously got to be a factor, you can't get away from it," [...] she said.
