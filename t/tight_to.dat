Lee's characters were typically stern, morally upright heroes. In contrast, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular men, often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends, or families, who always triumph in the end despite the odds. Additionally, he has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee's: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy. Despite the success of the Rush Hour series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it, since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie nor understands American humour.|$|E

500|$|The unit {{is based}} on the Swedish X2 {{designed}} by Kalmar Verkstad in the 1980s, and delivered from 1990 to the Swedish State Railways for use in their X 2000 high-speed intercity trains. Although the technology involved is similar, like spot-welded stainless steel car bodies, the Class 71 differs in several ways. First, the unit does not have a separate locomotive unit, but has the motors spread throughout the train, with one powered and one unpowered bogie in each car. The car bodies are totally different in layout, including the doors between bogies instead of {{at the end of the}} cars. In addition, the trains are pressure <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> increase comfort for passengers while passing through tunnels. They also have hydraulic couplers at the ends, which are hidden behind covers when not used. The Class 71 is also shorter, with only three cars, and does not have any tilting technology installed. The exterior design, especially the nose, is quite different. Norges Statsbaner later took order of 22 units of the Class 73, that is almost identical, but has four cars and tilting technology. Class 73's pantograph is pivoted in order to keep it centred under the [...] catenary when the body tilts.|$|E
500|$|The final {{recording}} {{was made}} in August at Armoury Studios in Vancouver, Canada, where Garbage built upon their first mix of the song, adding and subtracting parts, and completed final recording and mixing. The band kept the arrangement <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> preserve the song's dynamic, sweeping melody. [...] "The orchestra took up so much space and really dictated where the song was going dynamically," [...] keeping the recording simple, Vig recalled. [...] "Besides the drums and bass and some percussive loops, there's {{a little bit of}} guitar that Duke and Steve did. There's not a lot of miscellaneous tracks on there. There's a few little ear-candy things that we did, but it's all meant to work around Shirley's singing." [...] Although Garbage owned its own recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin, for legal reasons the song could not be recorded in a U.S. studio. [...] "The World Is Not Enough" [...] was completed, mixed and mastered {{at the end of the}} month, and the group returned to their recording studio in Madison to record their mix of the song. Garbage's version (the [...] "chilled-out remix") downplayed the classic Bond sound in favour of the band's style. Vig later said about the original recording, [...] "We're pretty pleased with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, it sounds like a Garbage song. And to Bond fans, it's a Bond song." ...|$|E
500|$|In principle, sprang may be {{regarded}} as a practical application of the fiber manipulation techniques used in the children's game known as cat's cradle. [...] Sprang is made by preparing a set of warp threads either on a rectangular frame or between a pair of beams. [...] The craftsperson then generates a fabric by interlinking the warp threads. [...] Unlike most textile production techniques that add new rows at the end of completed rows, sprang works upon the center of a group of fibers and the material grows inward from both ends with symmetrical top and bottom halves. [...] The craftsperson must maintain control of the center area or the structure unravels: most sprang worked upon has too many fibers to keep in hand, so rods or sticks maintain the appropriate fiber positions. [...] The fiber manipulation itself is done by the craftsperson's fingers. [...] Decorative patterns may be generated by regular variations in the fiber crossings. [...] As crossings accumulate the craftsperson beats the material flat with a stick. [...] Work continues with the material growing from both edges toward the middle until the center band becomes too <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> continue work. [...] The completed fabric is either separated into two identical items or permanently secured at the middle to stabilize the contrary twists. [...] In traditions where two halves of sprang are not severed by cutting, this center seam is a telltale sign of sprang manufacture.|$|E

500|$|Susie's ballads occupy roughly {{one-third of}} the film, {{performing}} {{a combination of both}} contemporary and classic standards. Rosenberg compared the character to actress Marilyn Monroe's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk in the film Some Like it Hot (1959). Susie's lack of singing experience is balanced by an [...] "ineffable vocal quality that causes people to listen, because they might be missing something." [...] Steve Vineberg, writing in the journal Film Quarterly, agreed that, despite her unimpressive voice, Susie [...] "wears a lyric <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> her skin, liked a zipped-up sleeping bag." [...] According to Télérama's Guillemette Odicino, the character has been [...] "endowed with a voice and a charm to take the breath." [...] Susie remains a heavily guarded individual until she performs [...] "Makin' Whoopee", which finally allows her to lower her defenses. When Susie performs the song, she is – for the first time – not singing to the audience, but to her sole accompanist Jack instead. According to Slant film critic Chuck Bowen, [...] "When Susie sings 'Makin' Whoopee' in a traffic-stopping red dress, mounting Jack's piano as if it's an extension of his very essence... all bets of detached, business-collaborative stability between the two are understood to be off." [...] Bowen also compared the character's performance to actress Rita Hayworth's in the film Gilda (1946). Prior to this moment, it almost appears as though a romantic relationship might never actually develop between the two characters. Observing that the character's tough attitude matches the difficult life she has been through, Janet Maslin of The New York Times believes that Susie must be [...] "singing from experience" [...] when she performs the song [...] "Ten Cents a Dance". Go Slow: The Life of Julie London author Michael Owen considers both Pfeiffer's performance and Susie herself to be a tribute to actress and singer Julie London, citing similarities such as asking her accompanist to perform [...] "More Than You Know" [...] in a slow tempo, swearing into a live microphone and delivering a [...] "sexy rendition" [...] of [...] "Makin' Whoopee", capturing [...] "some of the essence of Julie's style." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Boxer is a {{short-haired}} breed, with a shiny, smooth {{coat that}} lies <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> the body. The recognized colors are fawn and brindle, frequently {{with a white}} underbelly and white on the feet. These white markings, called flash, often extend onto the neck or face, and dogs that have these markings are known as [...] "flashy". [...] "Fawn" [...] denotes a range of color, the tones {{of which may be}} described variously as light tan or yellow, reddish tan, mahogany or stag/deer red, and dark honey-blonde. In the UK and Europe, fawn Boxers are typically rich in color and are often called [...] "red". [...] "Brindle" [...] refers to a dog with black stripes on a fawn background. Some brindle Boxers are so heavily striped that they give the appearance of [...] "reverse brindling", fawn stripes on a black body; these dogs are conventionally called [...] "reverse brindles", but that is actually a misnomer—they are still fawn dogs with black stripes. In addition, the breed standards state that the fawn background must clearly contrast with or show through the brindling.|$|E
2500|$|The {{swing and}} row simply {{consists}} of the vaulter swinging the trail leg forward and rowing the pole, bringing the top arm down to the hips, while {{trying to keep the}} trail leg straight to store more potential energy into the pole, the rowing motion also keeps the pole bent {{for a longer period of}} time for the vaulter to get into optimum position. Once in a [...] "U" [...] shape the left arm hugs the pole <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> efficiently use the recoil within the pole. The goal is to carry out these motions as thoroughly and as quickly as possible; it is a race against the unbending of the pole. Effectively, this causes a double pendulum motion, with the top of the pole moving forward and pivoting from the box, while the vaulter acts as a second pendulum pivoting from the right hand. This action gives the vaulter the best position possible to be [...] "ejected" [...] off the pole. The swing continues until the hips are above the head and the arms are pulling the pole close to the chest; from there the vaulter shoots their legs up over the cross bar while keeping the pole close.|$|E
2500|$|Hair styling in African-American {{culture is}} greatly varied. African-American hair is {{typically}} composed of coiled curls, {{which range from}} <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> wavy. Many women choose to wear their hair in its natural state. [...] Natural hair can be styled {{in a variety of}} ways, including the afro, twist outs, braid outs, and wash and go styles. [...] It is a myth that natural hair presents styling problems or is hard to manage; this myth seems prevalent because mainstream culture has, for decades, attempted to get African American women to conform to its standard of beauty (i.e., straight hair). [...] To that end, some women prefer straightening of the hair through the application of heat or chemical processes. [...] Although this can be a matter of personal preference, the choice is often affected by straight hair being a beauty standard in the West and the fact that hair type can affect employment. However, more and more women are wearing their hair in its natural state and receiving positive feedback. Alternatively, the predominant and most socially acceptable practice for men is to leave one's hair natural.|$|E

2500|$|Burnett ran 10,000 cattle {{until the}} end of the lease in 1902. The cattle baron had a strong feeling for Indian rights, and his respect for them was genuine. Where other cattle kings fought Indians and the harsh land to build empires, Burnett learned Comanche ways, passing both the love of the land and his {{friendship}} with the Indians to his family. As a sign of their regard for Burnett, the Comanches gave him a name in their own language: Mas-sa-suta, meaning “Big Boss”. Parker earned the respect of US governmental leaders as he adapted to the white man’s life and became a prosperous rancher in Oklahoma. His spacious, two-story Star House had a bedroom for each of his seven wives and their children. He had his own private quarters, which were rather plain. Beside his bed were photographs of his mother Nadua (Cynthia Ann) and younger sister Prairie Flower. Parker extended hospitality to many influential people, both Native American and European American. Among the latter were the Texas surveyor W. D. Twichell and the cattleman Charles Goodnight. Of all his white acquaintances, Parker counted Burk Burnett the best. He reportedly said: “I got one good friend, Burk Burnett, he big-hearted, rich cowman. Help my people good deal. You see big man hold <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> money, afraid to die. Burnett helped anybody.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Shubik {{began work}} and soon found that finding science fiction stories {{suitable}} for adaptation {{was a difficult}} task. She later recalled “I had to read hundreds of stories to pick a dozen. You {{have no idea how}} difficult some of these authors are to deal with, and it seems a special thing among SF writers to hedge themselves behind almost impossible copyright barriers, even when they have got a story that is possible to do on television. So many you can't. Either the conception is so way out you would need a fantastic budget to produce it, or the story is too short, too <b>tight</b> <b>to</b> be padded out to make an hour's television”. When working on Out of this World Shubik had made a valuable contact in John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction publishing. He was the founder of science fiction magazine New Worlds and agent for many of Britain's science fiction writers. Carnell was able to suggest stories and authors for Shubik to consider. Shubik received copies of science fiction anthologies from British publishers and also sought advice from many authors including Frederik Pohl, Alfred Bester and Robert Silverberg. [...] The latter two admitted to Shubik that they had run into similar difficulties in finding suitable material for television adaptation. Shubik considered asking Nigel Kneale if he would write a new Quatermass story for the series, and contacted Arthur C. Clarke regarding the possibility of adapting his novel The Deep Range.|$|E
2500|$|If melee weapons {{could not}} be brought into combat, such as during long range defense, Qi {{recommended}} waiting [...] "until the face-the-enemy signal , and then, whether from behind wooden stockades, or from moat banks, or from below abatis (拒馬), [...] open up on the enemy, firing by turns (更番射賊).
