2500|$|John Logie Baird FRSE ( [...] ; 14 August 188814 June 1946) was a Scottish engineer, innovator, one of {{the inventors}} of the {{mechanical}} television, demonstrating the first working television system on 26 January 1926, and inventor of both the first publicly demonstrated colour television system, and the first purely electronic colour <b>television</b> <b>picture</b> tube.|$|E
2500|$|Tubes have {{different}} functions, such as cathode ray tubes which create {{a beam of}} electrons for display purposes (such as the <b>television</b> <b>picture</b> tube) in addition to more specialized functions such as electron microscopy and electron beam lithography. X-ray tubes are also vacuum tubes. Phototubes and photomultipliers rely on electron flow through a vacuum, though in those cases electron emission from the cathode depends on energy from photons rather than thermionic emission. Since these sorts of [...] "vacuum tubes" [...] have functions other than electronic amplification and rectification they are described in their own articles.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{laboratory}} on 2 October 1925, Baird successfully transmitted the first <b>television</b> <b>picture</b> with a greyscale image: {{the head of}} a ventriloquist's dummy nicknamed [...] "Stooky Bill" [...] in a 30-line vertically scanned image, at five pictures per second. Baird went downstairs and fetched an office worker, 20-year-old William Edward Taynton, to see what a human face would look like, and Taynton became the first person to be televised in a full tonal range. Looking for publicity, Baird visited the Daily Express newspaper to promote his invention. The news editor was terrified and he was quoted by one of his staff as saying: [...] "For God's sake, go down to reception and get rid of a lunatic who's down there. He says he's got a machine for seeing by wireless! Watch him — he may have a razor on him." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} to apply a criticism similar to Nietzsche's criticism of Kant's [...] "thing in itself" [...] to qualia: Qualia are unobservable in others and unquantifiable in us. We cannot possibly be sure, when discussing individual qualia, that we are even discussing the same phenomena. Thus, any discussion of them is of indeterminate value, as descriptions of qualia are necessarily of indeterminate accuracy. Qualia {{can be compared to}} [...] "things in themselves" [...] in that they have no publicly demonstrable properties; this, along with the impossibility of being sure that we are communicating about the same qualia, makes them of indeterminate value and definition in any philosophy in which proof relies upon precise definition. On the other hand, qualia could be considered akin to Kantian phenomena since they are held to be seemings of appearances. Revonsuo, however, considers that, within neurophysiological inquiry, a definition {{at the level of the}} fields may become possible (just as we can define a <b>television</b> <b>picture</b> at the level of liquid crystal pixels).|$|E

The General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady NY was sending experimental television over their shortwave radio station in early 1928. Westinghouse had a system that would broadcast motion pictures. Several other laboratories were also conducting experiments and demonstrations.|$|R
