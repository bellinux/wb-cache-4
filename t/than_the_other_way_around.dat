5|$|The {{wool and}} cloth trade was {{primarily}} now {{being run by}} English merchants themselves rather than by foreigners. Increasingly, the trade was also passing through London and the ports of the South-West. By the 1360s, 66–75% of the export trade was in English hands and by the 15th century this had risen to 80%; London managed around 50% of these exports in 1400, {{and as much as}} 83% of wool and cloth exports by 1540. The growth in the numbers of chartered trading companies in London, such as the Worshipful Company of Drapers or the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, continued, and English producers began to provide credit to European buyers, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> Usury grew during the period, and few cases were prosecuted by the authorities.|$|E

25|$|Christian apologists, {{among them}} Ronald Nash and Edwin Yamauchi, have {{suggested}} a different interpretation of Mithraism's relationship to Christianity.

25|$|Although the Kingdom of Ireland {{never had}} an {{official}} flag, this flag is recorded as the flag of Ireland by 18th and 19th century sources.

25|$|NASA {{scientists}} Hartman and McKay {{argue that}} plate tectonics {{may in fact}} slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it).

25|$|The wing bar {{is unique}} among living {{whistling}} ducks. When on the ground, {{it may be}} hard to discern the light flanks present in many of these waterfowl. The fulvous whistling duck (D. bicolor) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> Juvenile D. autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (D. viduata), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.|$|E
25|$|The Austrians and Poles {{considered}} Venetian {{participation in}} the war as a useful adjunct to the main operations in Central Europe, as its navy could impede the Ottomans from concentrating their forces by sea and force them to divert forces away from their own fronts. On the Venetian side, {{the debate in the}} Senate about joining the war was heated, but in the end the war party prevailed, judging the moment as an excellent and unique opportunity for a revanche. As a result, when news arrived in Venice on 25 April 1684 of the signing of the Holy League, for the first and only time in the Ottoman–Venetian Wars, the Most Serene Republic declared war on the Ottomans, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around.</b>|$|E

25|$|On September 1, 1995, the F line opened {{replacing}} the faster number 8 bus with {{a parade of}} PCC cars, painted to represent some of the two dozen North American cities {{that this type of}} streetcar once served. At that point in history, this was a rare instance in which a streetcar replaced a bus line in operation, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> Ridership exceeded expectation, and the need for extra cars resulted in the acquisition of ten Peter Witt style cars just being retired in the city of Milan, Italy. These cars were built in the 1920s to a design once common in North American cities, and their sister cars are still widely used on the Milan tramway network.|$|E
25|$|Females {{within a}} group are matrilineally related. Female {{memberships}} are also stable, but less so in larger groups. Relationships between the females {{tend to be}} friendly. They will do various activities with each together, such as foraging, traveling and resting. They will also groom each other regardless of their rank. However, higher-ranking females give out and receive grooming the most. In addition, females groom males more often <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> Male and female relationships are usually positive. Relationships between males can range from peaceful to violent. While females remain in their natal groups, males will leave when they reach adulthood. Relationships between groups tend to be hostile. High-ranking males from different groups will display, vocalize, and fight among themselves.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1820s, {{however, the}} {{economic}} climate of the country had deteriorated, and many investors were waiting to see how the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway would succeed. Moreover, not everyone shared the dream. For most people the canals were adequate for the carriage of goods, while few travelled very far. Most people lived their lives within a few miles of their birthplace. The later story of the railways was a classic one of a product generating a demand, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> Thus, what investment that was forthcoming was for ventures for which a need could be clearly perceived, with a reasonable expectation of a good, and rapid, return.

25|$|Console RPGs {{distinguished}} {{themselves from}} computer RPGs {{to a greater}} degree in the early 1990s. As console RPGs became more heavily story-based than their computer counterparts, one of the major differences that emerged during this time was in the portrayal of the characters. Console RPGs often featured intricately related characters who had distinctive personalities and traits, with players assuming the roles of people who cared about each other, fell in love or even had families. Romance in particular was a theme that was common in most console RPGs at the time but absent from most computer RPGs. During the 1990s, console RPGs had become increasingly dominant, exerting a greater influence on computer RPGs <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> Console RPGs had eclipsed computer RPGs for some time, though computer RPGs began making a comeback {{towards the end of the}} decade with interactive choice-filled adventures.|$|E
25|$|Debt {{levels may}} affect {{economic}} growth rates. In 2010, economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart reported {{that among the}} 20 developed countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e. under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP). In April 2013, the conclusions of Rogoff and Reinhart's study came into question when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by Herndon, Ash and Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Herndon, Ash and Pollin found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods used, {{there was no evidence}} that debt above a specific threshold reduces growth. Reinhart and Rogoff maintain that after correcting for errors, a negative relationship between high debt and growth remains. However, other economists, including Paul Krugman, have argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lucrative Mediterranean {{trade in}} spices, silk and other luxuries from Africa and Asia were shipped on the galleys of the {{powerful}} city-states of Genoa, Venice and Florence, making them phenomenally rich. Medieval Italy, meaning primarily the northern Italian Peninsula, {{was one of the}} few regions in medieval Europe where the distinction between nobility and prosperous commoners were more or less irrelevant, the result of a significant, rich and self-conscious middle class. This meant that the level of culinary refinement and diversity was especially great when compared to the rest of the continent. Italian cuisine was, and still is, better described as a multitude of highly varied regional cuisines, each with long traditions and their own specialties. Italian dishes can therefore be considered either traditional or imported. Being the hub of a vast trade network meant that there was greater access to foreign luxuries to influence the local cooking. Still, there was a great deal of conservatism and in general far more of local Italian foodstuffs were exported to the New World <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>around,</b> though the impact of important products such as vanilla, corn, kidney beans, and of course, the tomato, which had a considerable impact on the cooking south of Naples, even if this transition took some time.|$|E
