It is unsure how long the trial will last, however as of July 2016 it is still ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such large scale exercises will draw down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of the new scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) fingerprinting technique, which makes no physical contact with the fingerprint and {{does not require the}} use of developers, has the potential to allow fingerprints to be recorded whilst still leaving intact material that could subsequently be subjected to DNA analysis. A forensically usable prototype was under development at Swansea University during 2010, in research that was generating significant interest from the British Home Office and a number of different police forces across the UK, as well as internationally. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this instrument could eventually be manufactured in sufficiently large numbers to be widely used by forensic teams worldwide.|$|E
25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1970s, {{international}} fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.|$|E
25|$|Although {{physical}} characteristics and sizes at various instars {{have been used}} to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in gene expression. Three genes were measured in an experiment with Drosophila melanogaster: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because {{they are likely to be}} in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed. However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high confidence level. Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique. One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.|$|E

500|$|The {{non-profit}} Manzanar Committee, formerly led by Sue Kunitomi Embrey, {{has sponsored}} the Pilgrimage since 1969. The event is held annually {{on the last}} Saturday of April [...] with hundreds of visitors {{of all ages and}} backgrounds, including some former incarcerees, gathering at the Manzanar cemetery to remember the incarceration. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> participants can learn about it and help ensure that what is generally accepted to be a tragic chapter in American History is neither forgotten nor repeated. The program traditionally consists of speakers, cultural performances, an interfaith service to memorialize those who died at Manzanar, and Ondo dancing.|$|E
500|$|The {{population}} {{at the core}} of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout's native range, in Yellowstone Lake, declined significantly in the 1960s due to overharvest of mature cutthroat trout by anglers, as well as overharvesting of eggs by hatcheries in the early 20th century. Managers implemented catch and release, which required anglers to return their catches to the lake, and they terminated hatchery operations in the park which allowed the cutthroat trout to recover. Then, in 1994, park officials discovered lake trout [...] in Yellowstone Lake. Although lake trout were established in Shoshone, Lewis and Heart lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. government stocking operations in 1890, they were never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage and their presence there is probably the result of accidental or illegal introductions. By 2000, the cutthroat trout population had declined to less than 10percent of its early 20th century abundance. However, aggressive lake trout eradication programs have killed over one million lake trout since 1996, and <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this will lead to a restoration of cutthroat numbers. Cutthroat trout co-exist with lake trout in Heart Lake, an isolated back-country lake at the head of the Heart River that gets little angling pressure.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{limitations}} to pulque's popularity has been the inability to store it for long periods or ship it far. Recently, pulque makers {{have found a way}} to preserve the beverage in cans. However, they admit this does change the flavor. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with this innovation, pulque can regain its lost market in Mexico and even achieve success as an export item, like tequila. It is already being offered in the United States by Boulder Imports, selling the brand [...] "Nectar del Razo". The original market was Mexican-American men, but the company reports the product is having success as a health food, sought out by athletes and body builders.|$|E

2500|$|Patients in coma, vegetative, or {{minimally}} conscious state pose ethical challenges. The {{patients are}} unable to respond, therefore the assessment of their needs can only be approached by adopting a third person perspective. They {{are unable to}} communicate their pain levels, quality of life, or end of life preferences. Neuroscience and brain imaging have allowed us to explore the brain activity of these patients more thoroughly. Recent findings from studies using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} have changed the way we view vegetative patients. The images have shown that aspects emotional processing, language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in patients whose behavior suggests a vegetative state. If this is the case, it is unethical to allow a third party to dictate the life and future of the patient. [...] For example, defining death is an issue that comes with patients with severe traumatic brain injuries. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining care from these patients can be based on uncertain assessments about the individual's conscious awareness. Case reports have shown that these patients in a persistent vegetative state can recover unexpectedly. This raises the ethical question about the premature termination of care by physicians. <b>The</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one day, neuroimaging technologies can help us to define these different states of consciousness and enable us to communicate with patients in vegetative states {{in a way that was}} never before possible. The clinical translation of these advanced technologies is of vital importance for the medical management of these challenging patients. In this situation, neuroscience has both revealed ethical issues and possible solutions.|$|E
