40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of 2 transfer of stimulus control procedures to teach <b>tacting</b> to individuals with autism. Five participants with differing verbal skills were assessed by a subset of the ABLLS prior to intervention, then were taught 36 previously unknown <b>tacts</b> using the receptive-echoic-tact (r-e-t) and echoic-tact (e-t) transfer procedures. Each transfer method was used separately to establish different <b>tacts,</b> in a multiple baseline design across <b>tacts</b> for 3 sets of stimuli. The results showed that 4 out of 5 participants (who demonstrated mands, <b>tacts,</b> echoics, and sometimes intraverbals prior to the study) acquired all targeted <b>tacts</b> when either r-e-t or e-t training was presented. One participant (who emitted no verbal operants at the onset of the study) did not acquire any <b>tacts.</b> While some participants appeared to learn more quickly with one transfer method, neither method emerged as more efficient with learners with fewer or more extensive verbal skills. The results indicate that both transfer methods promoted the acquisition of <b>tacts</b> for learners with autism with at least minimal verbal skills...|$|R
40|$|Some {{children}} with autism have difficulty acquiring <b>tacts,</b> despite their ability to mand, echo words, and imitate actions. The current study focused on 2 nonvocal children who had acquired a few mands using sign language, but had repeatedly failed to acquire signed <b>tacts.</b> Two procedures were compared to determine the most effective approach for training <b>tacts</b> to these participants. One procedure (the standard condition) used the general verbal prompt “What is that?” The other procedure (the intraverbal condition) used a specific intraverbal prompt “Sign [spoken word]. ” The results showed that both participants acquired nonimitative verbal responses during the intraverbal condition but not during the standard condition. One participant demonstrated complete transfer to pure <b>tacts,</b> and the other participant showed a partial transfer to pure <b>tacts.</b> These results have implications {{for the design of}} language intervention programs for {{children with}} autism who have difficulty acquiring <b>tacts...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} {{promotes}} equivalence relations as a route to integrate reading (CD) and <b>tacting</b> (BD), thus improving speech accuracy in <b>tacting</b> pictures of scenes (BD) using sentences {{in children with}} CIs. After training that matched pictures to dictated sentences and constructed printed sentences under control of the same dictated sentences (AB and AE, respectively), the children formed equivalence relations between dictated sentences, pictures of scenes, and printed sentences. They also <b>tacted</b> pictures with greater point-to-point correspondence to target sentences, improving speech accuracy to reading levels. The results of the posttests indicated functional interdependence between reading (CD) and <b>tacting</b> (BD). These results also corroborate previous findings {{about the ability of}} equivalence relations to produce interrelations between verbal operants and establish one repertoire from another (de Rose et al., 1996; Hollis et al., 1986; Mackay & Sidman, 1984; Sidman, 1971; Sidman, 1986). Some studies in the area of equivalence used oral <b>tacts</b> (BD) to provide oral-textual (CD) responses (de Rose et al., 1996), whereas the present study and other studies that evaluated children with CIs used an inverse route and improved <b>tacting</b> pictures (BD) from previously established reading (CD) skills (Almeida-Verdu & Golfeto, 2016).|$|R
30|$|All of the {{participants}} met the inclusion criterion by demonstrating better speech accuracy when reading text (CD) than when <b>tacting</b> pictures (BD) in the pretests. However, the initial discrepancy between <b>tacting</b> (BD) and reading (CD) requires further explanation. One hypothesis is that this performance reflected an experimental artifact. Our participants were readers, and graphemes functioned as cues for accurate pronunciation in reading (CD). In contrast, pictures of scenes do not provide sufficient clues for <b>tacting</b> (BD) with target sentences. Such characteristics as photo format, the topography of actions, context of the scenes, static motion, and other unknown elements may interfere with <b>tacting</b> pictures (Nation et al., 2001) and may have hindered {{the participants}}’ performance in the present study. Future studies should enhance the pictures by using dynamic motion, making the topography of actions clearer in the scenes, and reducing unknown components, which may ultimately minimize possible artifacts of <b>tacting</b> pictures of scenes.|$|R
5|$|On 4 May 1702 (O.S.) England {{formally}} {{declared war}} on France. Marlborough was given command of the English, Dutch, and hired German forces, {{but he had not}} as yet commanded a large army in the field, and had far less experience than a dozen Dutch and German generals who must now work under him. His command had its limitations, however. As commander of Anglo-Dutch forces he had the power to give orders to Dutch generals only when their troops were in action with his own; at all other times he had to rely on his powers of <b>tact</b> and persuasion, and gain the consent of accompanying Dutch field deputies or political representatives of the States General. Nevertheless, despite his Allies' initial lassitude the campaign in the Low Countries (the war's principal theatre) began well for Marlborough. After outmanoeuvring Marshal Boufflers, he captured Venlo, Roermond, Stevensweert and Liège, for which in December a grateful Queen publicly proclaimed Marlborough a duke.|$|E

Historian Heitor Lyra blamed Rio Branco and his Cabinet, both bishops and, primarily, PedroII for the ordeal. All parties involved revealed a lack of <b>tact,</b> and their intransigence only caused harm—mostly to the monarchy itself. The main consequence of the crisis was that the clergy no longer saw any benefit in upholding PedroII.

30|$|The {{present study}} {{employed}} a multiple-baseline design across participants, which had both advantages and limitations. Repeated measures of <b>tacting</b> pictures of scenes (dependent variable) {{allowed us to}} monitor the baseline and demonstrated {{that all of the}} participants had variable performance in <b>tacting</b> in the pretests. The data indicate instability of the dependent variable, which compromised experimental control. More stable baselines were noticed in other studies with children with minimal verbal repertoires (Frampton et al., 2016). However, children with CIs differed from these populations. The dependent variable presented some variations, with a tendency toward improvement in <b>tacting</b> pictures, objects, and events (Anastácio-Pessan et al., 2015; Golfeto & de Souza, 2015; Lucchesi et al., 2015). In the present study, the variability of <b>tacting</b> pictures was lower than 40 % in the pretests for all of the children, which can be individually attributed to the absence of intellectual deficits and opportunities to learn language from auditory-oral rehabilitation, formal education, and incidental auditory experience. The experimental design also had advantages by controlling those intervenient variables. The first participant <b>tacted</b> 80 % of pictures accurately after EBI, whereas the other two participants continued to perform at baseline levels and maintained <b>tacting</b> picture accuracy below 50 % because none of the participants were exposed to an intervention. Moreover, these effects of EBI on speech accuracy in <b>tacting</b> pictures of scenes were replicated in other participants. Thus, the internal validity of the study was strengthened by demonstrating the effects of the independent variable on the dependent variables, which was replicated for all of the participants. Future studies should seek to replicate these findings with more participants in other laboratories and by manipulating other parameters (e.g., the number of components and phonological control of the stimuli).|$|R

5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, <b>tact</b> and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E
5|$|The {{longevity}} of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world {{should not be}} overlooked as {{a key factor in}} its success. As Tacitus wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate. Had Augustus died earlier (in 23BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the {{longevity of}} Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his <b>tact,</b> and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.|$|E

In Experiment I, the effects of contingent tokens versus contingent adult attention were tested on the number of <b>tacts</b> emitted in three different experimental settings, using an alternating treatment design. In Experiment II, the effects of contingent tokens versus contingent adult attention were tested on the number of <b>tacts</b> per minute and the percentage of peer-to-peer conversational units. The results from both experiments showed that these participants emitted <b>tacts</b> more frequently with contingent social attention than with contingent tokens. In addition, in Experiment II, peer-to-peer conversational units were low when adult attention was available and increased when adult attention was withheld. Implications of these results include, <b>tacts</b> are maintained specifically by social reinforcers, not simply generalized conditioned reinforcers (i. e., tokens). Thus, special attention must be paid when selecting reinforcers for teaching <b>tacts</b> so that the desired function is taught. Moreover, deprivation of adult-attention appears to function as a motivating operation for enhancing the value of attention from peers...|$|R
