40|$|The {{unidirectional}} torsion {{properties of}} silk fibre were investigated on a purpose-built single fibre torsion tester. The torsional fracture angle {{and the number}} of cycles of torsion at breaking were recorded, and the effect of the gauge length and pretension together with the <b>torsion</b> <b>speed</b> on the torsion properties of single silk fibre was investigated in detail. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and a tensile tester were used to understand the morphology, structure and tensile properties of silk fibre after torsion deformation. SME photos show that silk fibre exhibits a ribbon-like profile after torsion, and fracture tends to occur {{at both ends of the}} silk fibre, where a larger number of twists can be observed. The crystallinity calculated from XRD spectra of silk fibre increases from 26. 11 % to 34. 10 % after torsion. The breaking stress and strain decreases slightly with an increase in the gauge length. The breaking cycle increases linearly with an increase in the gauge length, while the actual torsional fracture angle decreases gradually at the same time. The torsional fracture angle together with the breaking cycle decreases gradually as the pretension increases. The fracture angle together with the breaking cycle increases with an increase in the <b>torsion</b> <b>speed.</b> Understanding the unidirectional torsion properties of single silk fibre will benefit its further application in specific areas where the fibre will be subject to frequent torsion and deformation...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{formation}} of spinning pairs of particles, or torsions was studied in a single-layer complex plasma crystal {{by reducing the}} discharge power at constant neutral gas pressure. At higher gas pressures, torsions spontaneously formed below a certain power threshold. Further reduction of the discharge power led to the {{formation of}} multiple torsions. However, at lower gas pressures the torsion formation was preceded by the mode-coupling instability (MCI). The crystal dynamics were studied with the help of the fluctuation spectra of crystal particles’ in-plane velocities. Surprisingly, the spectra of the crystal with torsions and MCI are rather similar and contain “hot spots” at similar locations on the (k, ω) plane, despite very different appearances of the respective particle trajectories. The <b>torsion</b> rotation <b>speed</b> was close (slightly below) to the maximum frequency of the in-plane compressional mode. When multiple torsions formed, their rotation speeds were distributed in a narrow range slightly below the maximum frequency...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{aeroelastic}} {{response of}} multi-segmented hinged wings is studied theoretically and experimentally in this thesis. For the theoretical study, {{a method of}} modeling the aeroelastic characteristics of multi-hinged wings is proposed. The method employs the Runge-Kutta scheme to solve the governing equations of a flexible multibody dynamic system. The Henon method is used to switch between bilinear stiffness states of the wing in bending. Experimental wind tunnel tests of one- and five-hinged wings were conducted for better insight into {{the mechanics of the}} motion. Correlation between the experimental and theoretical results is presented. The theoretical model is found to capture both the linear and nonlinear aeroelastic behavior of a hinged wing. Adding hinges to a wing is found to significantly alter the speed at which an instability will occur. The stiffness of the hinges is found {{to play a major role}} in the determination of flutter speeds with a reduction in hinge stiffness nominally leading to an increase in first bending / first <b>torsion</b> instability <b>speeds.</b> However, for low hinge stiffness, hinged wings were also found to have the possibility of a second bending / first <b>torsion</b> instability at <b>speeds</b> far below the first bending instability. The hinged wing is found to enter into chaotic or limit cycle motion at speeds at, near, or above flutter speeds. The bi-linear nature of a hinge is found to cause a disruption in the coalescence of modes. This limits the energy added to the system while it is in an unstable state. The hinges allow the wing to "fold" under low net loads. The theoretical model can be used for aeroelastic design of future hinged wings for remotely deployable vehicles. by Torrey Owen Radcliffe.

40|$|The {{gyroplane}} {{represents the}} first successful rotorcraft design and it {{paved the way for}} the development of the helicopter during the 1940 s. Gyroplane rotors are not powered in flight and work in autorotative regime and hence the characteristics of a helicopter rotor during powered flight and a rotor in autorotation differ significantly. Gyroplanes in the UK have been involved in number of fatal accidents during the last two decades. Despite several research projects focused on gyroplane flight dynamics, the cause of some of gyroplane accidents still remains unclear. The aeroelastic behaviour of autorotating rotors is a relatively unexplored problem and it has not yet been investigated as possible cause of the accidents. A mathematical model was created to simulate aeroelastic behaviour of rotors in autorotation. The model can investigate couplings between blade teeter, bending, <b>torsion</b> and rotor <b>speed</b> using a finite element model combined with a blade element method and a dynamic inflow model. A set of 'McCutcheon' rotor blades was subjected to a series of experiments, yielding baseline input parameters for the model. The model was validated against published results of modal analysis of helicopter rotor blades, experimental flight measurements and other data published in open literature. Effect of selected rotor design parameters on performance and stability of autorotating rotors was analyzed. Results of the model suggest that steady autorotative flight is not possible for excessive values of blade fixed incidence angle or geometric twist of the blade, leading to an aeromechanical instability. Negative values of these parameters lead to rotor over-speed, loss of rotor thrust and increase in vehicle speed of descent. The simulations have shown that moderate values of blade geometric twist applied to the inboard region of the blade together with blade tip mass can improve stability of a rotor in autorotation. A significant part of the research was focused on investigation of the effect of different values of torsional and flexural stiffness, and the relative chord-wise positions of blade elastic axis and centre of mass on rotor stability during autorotation. The results obtained from the model demonstrate an interesting and unique characteristic of the autorotative regime. Coupled flap-twist-rotor speed oscillations of the rotor occur if the torsional stiffness of the blade is lower than a critical value and if the blade centre of mass is aft of the blade elastic axis. The new type of aeroelastic instability is specific to autorotating rotors and differs from both helicopter rotor flutter and fixed-wing flutter. An extra degree of freedom in rotor speed does not alter flutter onset point significantly and hence this instability can be classified as pitch-flap flutter, with the stability boundary of a hyperbolic shape. However, variation of rotor speed in response to coupled flexural and torsional dynamics of the rotor blades changes behaviour of the rotor during the instability. The coupling of rotor teeter, blade <b>torsion</b> and rotor <b>speed</b> with vehicle speed of descent results in a combined flutter and divergence instability. The investigation aeroelastic behaviour of rotors in autorotation has shown that although autorotation has strong autostabilizing character, catastrophic aeroelastic instability can occur. Aeroelastic instability of this type has not been previously described in open literature. The instability can be initiated by incorrect mass balance of the rotor blades together with their insufficient torsional stiffness. Alternatively, unsuitable rotor geometry causing excessive blade incidence can prevent the rotor from entering steady autorotation. Hence a rotor in autorotation with unsuitable design of rotor blades can encounter an aeroelastic instability even if it is correctly mass balanced.

The AMRA model was verified against experimental data obtained during a CAA sponsored flight test programme of the G-UNIV autogyro. Published results of modal analysis of helicopter rotor blades and other data published in open literature were used to validate the FEM model of the rotor blade. The first torsional natural frequency of the ’McCutcheon’ rotor blades was measured with the aid of high-speed camera and used for validation of the FEM model of blade torsional twist. As a further verification of the modelling method, Aérospatiale Puma helicopter rotor blade data were compared on a Southwell plot showing comparison between experimental results and AMRA estimation. The aeromechanical behaviour of the rotor during both axial flight and forward flight in autorotation was investigated. A significant part of the research was focused on investigation of the effect of different values of torsional and flexural stiffness, and the relative positions of blade shear centre/elastic axis and centre of mass of the blade on stability during the autorotation. The results obtained with the aid of the model demonstrate the interesting, and unique, characteristics of the autorotative regime - with instabilities possible in bending and torsion, but also in rotorspeed. Coupled rotor speed/flap/twist oscillations (flutter and divergence) occur if the torsional stiffness of the blade is lower than a critical value, or if the blade centre of mass is significantly aft of the blade twisting axis, {{as is the case in}} helicopter pitch-flap flutter. The instability shown here, however, is specific to the autogyro, or autorotating rotor, as it is coupled with rotorspeed, and so differs from both helicopter rotor flutter and fixed-wing flutter. The coupling with rotorspeed allows a combined flutter and divergence instability, where the rotor begins to flutter in rotorspeed, teeter angle and torsional twist and, once the rotorspeed had dropped below a critical value, then moves into divergence in flap and rotorspeed. It was found that the aeroelastic behaviour of a rotor in autorotation is significantly affected by the strong coupling of blade bending stiffness and teeter angle with rotorspeed, and the strong coupling between blade aeroelastic twist and rotor torque. </p...|$|R
