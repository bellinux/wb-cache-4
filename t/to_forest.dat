5|$|In {{addition}} to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned {{to reduce the}} population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return <b>to</b> <b>forest</b> or resettled by German colonists. Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union. These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{woodpeckers}} are arboreal {{birds of}} wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur {{in almost all}} suitable habitats including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where {{a small number of}} trees exist, or, in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodland or even, like the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt <b>to</b> <b>forest</b> clearance by exploiting secondary growth, plantations, orchards and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.|$|E
5|$|Phase I's {{flagship}} project was the 63rd Street–Southeast Queens line, which would stretch {{from the existing}} 57th Street subway station in Midtown Manhattan to the existing Laurelton LIRR station in Springfield Gardens.

The first part, Route 131–A, would run from Sixth and Seventh Avenues in Manhattan below 63rd Street and the East River to Northern Boulevard. The next part, Route 131–B, the Super–Express Bypass Line, would continue along the LIRR right-of-way <b>to</b> <b>Forest</b> Hills.

5|$|The highway was {{originally}} commissioned on November 11, 1926, {{with the rest}} of the original U.S. Highway System. At the time, it ran between Forest Lake, Minnesota, and Pembine, Wisconsin, with a planned continuation to Powers, Michigan. Several changes have been made to the routing of the highway since then. The western end was extended south to Minneapolis before it was truncated back <b>to</b> <b>Forest</b> Lake. Other changes on the east end have moved that terminus from the originally planned end location at Powers to the current location in Norway. Internal Wisconsin and Michigan DOT map files at various times have shown plans to reroute the highway to connect to the original 1926 terminus. US8's course through the three states has also been shifted to follow different alignments over the years.|$|E
