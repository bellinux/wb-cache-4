5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the claim for trespass, {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent. Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

Because <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not that it would not bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E

5|$|As {{it appears}} that the {{decision}} of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> was rested, in addition to other grounds, upon a distinct and independent ground, not involving any federal question, and sufficient in itself to maintain the judgment, the writ of error falls within the wellsettled rule on that subject, and cannot be maintained.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1967, President Lyndon Johnson {{nominated}} Combs to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, {{replacing the}} deceased Shackelford Miller, Jr., and the Senate confirmed the nomination on April 5, 1967. Because {{of the rules}} of the federal judiciary, Combs had to liquidate his business and banking assets and severely restrict contact with many of his political acquaintances to avoid potential conflicts of interest with cases he might adjudicate on <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals.</b> He expressed frustration that the cases that came before the court were frequently appealed to the Supreme Court, which often gave little weight to the opinions rendered by <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals.</b> Consequently, he resigned from the court on June 5, 1970, and joined the Louisville law firm of Tarrant, Combs, and Bullitt (later Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs).|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} appealed and {{heard by the}} Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the {{herbicides}} contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were {{not intended to be}} used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.

5|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the financial Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians in debt and unable to meet their financial obligations. A debt relief movement began in the state, and pro-relief candidates won majorities in the General Assembly in 1820. The Assembly passed a law of replevin that was extremely favorable to debtors. Disgruntled creditors challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} law, appealing their case to <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals.</b> The court opined in favor of the creditors. Attempts to remove the anti-relief justices failed. The pro-relief legislature passed a measure abolishing <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> and replacing it with a new court, to which pro-relief governor Joseph Desha appointed pro-relief justices who upheld the replevin law.|$|E
