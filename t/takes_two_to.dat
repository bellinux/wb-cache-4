5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
25|$|The Higher National Diploma (HND) is a {{post-secondary}} qualification. Entry {{requirements for}} the Higher National Diploma typically include a Higher School Certificate (HSC), two GCE A Levels, a National Certificate at Level 4 (NC 4) or Level 5 (NC 5) in related trades, a Diploma in a related subject, or the equivalent. The course typically <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> three years to complete.|$|E
25|$|Males {{typically}} {{live for}} about 5–7 days, feeding on nectar {{and other sources}} of sugar. After obtaining a full blood meal, the female will rest {{for a few days}} while the blood is digested and eggs are developed. This process depends on the temperature, but usually <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> three days in tropical conditions. Once the eggs are fully developed, the female lays them and resumes host-seeking.|$|E

Difficulty with the midday sun, such as dehydration, is common. Guidelines {{recommend}} carrying two {{liters of water}} per person, extra water for dogs, and sun protection. Signs prohibit off-trail shortcuts which can cause erosion, and some shortcuts have barbed wire fencing to reduce trespassing.|$|E
25|$|Each {{country has}} the {{responsibility}} for maintenance of its boundary markers and keeping the clear-cut zone. Most of the maintenance is undertaken during the summer. In August each year {{there is a common}} inspection of the entire border. The practical responsibility alternates between the two countries each year. It is carried out by three groups, each which cover a third of the border. Each group consists of two Norwegians and two Russians and the inspection <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> three days. Afterwards there is a common debriefing.|$|E
25|$|Many toothpastes make {{whitening}} claims. Some {{of these}} toothpastes contain peroxide, the same ingredient found in tooth bleaching gels. The abrasive in these toothpastes, not the peroxide, removes the stains. Whitening toothpaste cannot alter the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration by penetrating surface stains or decay. To remove surface stains, whitening toothpaste may include abrasives to gently polish the teeth or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate {{to break down}} or dissolve stains. When used twice a day, whitening toothpaste typically <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four weeks to make teeth appear whiter. Whitening toothpaste is generally safe for daily use, but excessive use might damage tooth enamel. Teeth whitening gels represent an alternative. However, the whitening process can permanently reduce {{the strength of the}} teeth, as the process scrapes away a protective outer layer of enamel.|$|E

25|$|When a male is mature, {{he spins}} a sperm web, {{deposits}} semen on it, and charges his palpal bulbs with the sperm. Black widow spiders reproduce sexually when the male inserts his palpal bulbs into the female's spermathecal openings. The female deposits her {{eggs in a}} globular silken container in which they remain camouflaged and guarded. A female black widow spider can produce four to nine egg sacs in one summer, each containing about 100–400 eggs. Usually, eggs incubate for twenty to thirty days. It is rare {{for more than a}} hundred to survive this process. On average, thirty will survive through the first molting, because of cannibalism, lack of food, or lack of proper shelter. It <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> four months for black widow spiders to mature enough to breed, however full maturation typically takes six to nine months. The females can live for up to three years, while a male's lifespan is about three to four months. The female may eat the male after mating.|$|E
500|$|Oolong tea: This tea's {{oxidation}} {{is stopped}} {{somewhere between the}} standards for green tea and black tea. The processing typically <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> three days from withering to drying with a relatively short oxidation period of several hours. In Chinese, semi-oxidized teas are collectively grouped as blue tea (青茶, literally: blue-green tea / [...] "celadon tea"), while the term [...] "oolong" [...] is used specifically as a name for certain semi-oxidized teas. Common wisdom about lightly oxidized teas in Taiwan (a large producer of Oolong) is that too little oxidation upsets the stomach of some consumers. Even so, some producers attempt to minimize oxidation {{in order to produce}} a specific taste or allow the tea leaves to be easily rolled into the spherical or half-sphere form demanded by buyers in the market.|$|E

She also made frequent appearances on the syndicated revival of Hollywood Squares that ran from 1986 to 1989. In the 1990s, Westheimer appeared as herself in episode 89 of Quantum Leap, the episode title being [...] "Dr. Ruth". She appeared on Tom Chapin's album This Pretty Planet, in the song [...] "Two Kinds of Seagulls", in which she and Chapin sing of various animals that reproduce sexually. [...] "It <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> tingle", says the song. Dr. Ruth also appeared in several commercial advertisements, including a 1994 Honda Prelude ad, and an ad for Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo and body wash.|$|E
2500|$|The CPEC will connect Pakistan with China and the Central Asian {{countries}} with highway connecting Kashgar to Khunjerab and Gwadar. Gwadar port in southern Pakistan {{will serve as}} the trade nerve center for China, as most of its trade especially that of oil will be done through the port, which is operated by the China Overseas Port Holding Company, a state-owned Chinese company. Currently, sixty percent of China’s oil must be transported by ship from the Persian Gulf to the only commercial port in China, Shanghai, a distance of more than 16,000 kilometres. The journey <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> three months, during which time the ships are vulnerable to pirates, bad weather, political rivals and other risks. Using Gwadar port instead would reduce the distance and possibly the cost.|$|E

Although he became available for the Blues in week 8 of the tournament, he was left out of the squad that week, was on the bench in week 9, and did not make his first start of the season until week 10, when the Blues played the Cheetahs. A week later he was back on the bench for the Blues game against the Sharks [...] A few weeks later, [...] "for disciplinary reasons", Williams was left out of the squad to face the Sharks in Durban in a S14 semi-final match—which the Blues lost—and returned home to Auckland. Blues chief executive Andy Dalton told the press that management and senior players had made a joint decision to eject Williams from the team camp over incidents which occurred during the team's stay in Perth, Australia, where they had played the Western Force. [...] "On several occasions (Williams's) behaviour has been deemed inappropriate within team conduct and protocol and on at least four occasions Williams has been addressed by either coach David Nucifora and manager Ant Strachan or the leadership group on behalf of the team", Dalton said. In response, Williams said that he took [...] "a bit of responsibility" [...] for his actions but that [...] "it <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> tango".|$|E

2500|$|Spawning {{occurs during}} the daytime. There is {{indication}} that the female drinks the sperm and that fertilization takes place after the sperm has passed through her digestive tract. The male and female form the [...] "T-position", where the female places its mouth over the male's genital opening and collects the sperm in the mouth. The female rests at the bottom for 3060seconds, and then swims to the nest, turns upside down, and lays the eggs in the nest. H. littorale is a multiple spawner. Investing in reproduction is high in females since they can spawn up to 14 times during a 7month breeding season and each spawn consists of 6,0009,000 eggs. On average, two to four females spawn simultaneously, resulting in an average number of 20,000 eggs per nest. The adhesive eggs {{are located in the}} centre of the nest under the plant debris above the surface of the water, and not in contact with the oxygen-depleted swamp water. The male guards the nest during incubation; incubation of the eggs <b>takes</b> <b>two</b> <b>to</b> three days depending on the temperature in the nest. The male also regularly supplies foam to the nest. Guarding and maintenance of the nest occurs day and night. Once spawning has been completed, the male attacks females that have deposited their eggs in the nest. Despite intense predation pressure on eggs and larvae, the male's guarding behavior extends for only one or two days after hatching. The male attacks with its large pectoral spines erect; the attack consists of rapid propulsion towards its target followed by a sharp lateral turn, which causes the rough outer edge of pectoral spine to drag across the target and cause abrasion.|$|E
