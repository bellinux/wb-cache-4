The {{facility}} processes over 1,700 tons of steel each day and ships an average of 100 rail cars of parts manufactured daily. During the year, over 425,000 tons of steel are received for manufacturing at the facility. The facility has 20 major press stamping lines that include several <b>transfer</b> <b>presses</b> which include some of the world's largest.

5000|$|For high {{precision}} mass productions, {{it is always}} advisable to use a <b>transfer</b> <b>press</b> also known as eyelet press. The advantage {{of this type of}} press, in respect to conventional progressive presses, is that the parts are transferred from one die to the next by means of so-called [...] "fingers". Not only do the fingers transfer the parts but they also guide the component during the process. This allows parts to be drawn to the deepest depths with the tightest tolerances.|$|E
50|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} in {{medium-high}} volume production environments is often completed {{through the use}} of a <b>Transfer</b> <b>Press</b> operating a number of dies as a complete system. Each die in the system is responsible for adding more shape to the part until the metal work piece attains its final shape. What makes transfer stamping unique is that a single press operates a number of tools, the movement of the sheet metal work piece from one operation to the next is performed by automation either built into the press or onto the dies. With each closing of the press the entire system of tools will close, each performing its designed work to the sheet metal. Upon opening the built in transfer mechanism moves the workpiece from one operation to the next in the sequence. In the past these operations may have been performed using individual presses and the workpieces may have been moved from press to press, and die to die, by hand. As Automation improved hand loading was replaced by pick and place automation and by robots. The <b>transfer</b> <b>press</b> is a natural extension of this practice, simplifying the operation by having all tools in a single large press and using automation which is specifically designed for the press operations.|$|E

5000|$|Progressive {{stamping}} {{can also}} be produced on transfer presses. These are presses that transfer the components from one station to the next {{with the use of}} mechanical [...] "fingers". For mass production of stamped parts which do require complicated in-press operations, it is always advisable to use a progressive press. One of the advantages of this type of press is the production cycle time. Depending upon the part, productions can easily run well over 800 parts/minute. One of the disadvantages of this type of press {{is that it is not}} suitable for high precision deep drawing which is when the depth of the stamping exceeds the diameter of the part. When necessary, this process is performed upon a <b>transfer</b> <b>press,</b> which run at slower speeds, and rely on the mechanical fingers to hold the component in place during the entire forming cycle. In the case of the progressive press, only part of the forming cycle can be guided by spring-loaded sleeves or similar, which result in concentricity and ovality issues and non uniform material thickness. Other disadvantages of progressive presses compared to transfer presses are: increased raw material input required to transfer parts, tools are much more expensive because they are made in blocks with very little independent regulation per station; impossibility to perform processes in the press that require the part leave the strip (example beading, necking, flange curling, thread rolling, rotary stamping etc.).|$|E

40|$|Collar forming is a {{tractive}} compressive forming {{technique to}} turn up a closed component border, often a circular hole in a sheet metal or sheet metal component. Today, high-strength steel materials with a reduced deformation capability compared to a smoother deep drawing grade are used increasingly in collar forming due to developments in lightweight body production. This is {{at the expense of}} the constructive claim for preferably high collar heights. In many applications collar shapes requiring an expansion close to the maximum expansion possibility of the sheet metal component are produced. Negative influences on material ductility caused by batch deviations and further process deviations while handling the components can cause undesirable and irregularly appearing cracking during the collar forming process. Visual supervision by the staff at the outfeed conveyor is a limited possibility depending on the cracking type and size and further circumstances in the processing environment. If crack-containing components are not identified and sorted out early in the process chain, they can be joined to the shell or even be delivered to the customer in the corresponding assembly. The project's objective was to develop and validate a non-destructive test method to detect cracks in collar forming respectively components containing a collar automatically. The suitability of the considered test methods has been evaluated in terms of this application. Non-destructive post-process methods and an in-process method were used. Besides inductive thermal imaging, eddy current testing and electromagnetic ultrasound, noise emission analysis has been performed. Laboratory samples containing a collar of high-strength steel materials and an aluminium alloy have been consulted as objects of investigation. Samples with a wide range of both natural and artificial cracks were used to validate the test methods. Parts from serial processes have also been included. Two test concepts based on the investigations realized were created with regards to the process accompanying and integrated application of crack detection. The first concept uses an EMUS test system whose sensory components can be integrated into the transfer press' space. In the simple case, the EMUS test can be integrated into the <b>transfer</b> <b>press</b> as an own test step at the end of the process chain. The integration of the EMUS sensors directly to the collar forming tool is basically possible. In every case the sensors have to be tailored to the height and diameter of the collar geometry. The collar geometry testable with EMUS brings specific requirements. In the second test concept based on inductive thermal imaging any collar geometry can be tested if optically accessible. The necessary demand of space for mounting such a test system is significantly higher than with EMUS. Therefore this test concept cannot be integrated into the <b>transfer</b> <b>press</b> or even into the tool. The thermal imaging test system can be installed at the conveyor as a continuous inline test method. The objective of the project was achieved...|$|E
