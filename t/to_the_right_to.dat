5|$|Eugène's {{artillery}} {{continued to}} pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout {{set up a}} crossfire with artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. Barclay countered by moving the Prussian General Eugen over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> support Miloradovich in his defense of the redoubt. The French responded to this move by sending forward General Sorbier, commander of the Imperial Guard artillery. Sorbier brought forth 36 artillery pieces from the Imperial Guard Artillery Park and also took command of 49 horse artillery pieces from Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps and La Tour Maubourg's IV Cavalry Corps, {{as well as of}} Viceroy Eugène's own artillery, opening up a massive artillery barrage.|$|E
5|$|Northeast of Brent Cross, at Henlys Corner, the North Circular briefly shares carriageways {{with the}} A1 which joins {{it from the}} left and leaves it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> head into Central London. The {{junction}} complex also serves the Finchley Road and pedestrian traffic, and consequently is a major bottleneck on the route. Transport for London have invested in the junction, including a special hands free crossing for the local Jewish community, who can then cross the road on the Sabbath. The road passes north of St Pancras and Islington Cemetery towards Friern Barnet and Muswell Hill. The road narrows to two lane single carriageway to pass under a railway bridge, and continues as Telford Road towards Bounds Green.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Brigade landed between 05:30 and 07:00, and {{the reserve}} 1st Brigade landed between 09:00 and 12:00, already putting the {{timetable}} behind schedule.

5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E

5|$|Munnerlyn started 14 {{games at}} right cornerback for the Panthers {{in his third}} season with the team and responded with a then career-high 58 tackles {{to go along with}} two sacks, one quarterback pressure, one forced fumble, one fumble {{recovery}} and seven passes defensed. He also accounted for six special teams tackles. In Week 5 at New Orleans Saints on October 9, he registered his first career sack, dropping quarterback Drew Brees for a six-yard loss on a blitz. In a Week 8 game against the Minnesota Vikings, he got his second sack of the season when he tackled Christian Ponder for a one-yard loss after he scrambled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> escape from pressure. Later in the game, he also stripped and recovered a fumble by Vikings wide receiver Percy Harvin a yard shy of the endzone. In Week 15, he suffered a strained left hamstring at Houston and was therefore placed on injured reserve on December 23.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{believed there}} was a need for it to act to prevent Sinn Féin from using the media to defend the actions of the IRA, and the measures were part of a wider government response to the increase in violence, which also included changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> silence and the tightening of rules allowing paramilitary prisoners early release. Further controversy also erupted in September 1988 over an intended edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark which was to have featured the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, as a guest. The show was dropped after the conservative academic Paul Wilkinson – a Professor at Aberdeen University who specialised in the study of terrorism and political violence – voiced strong objections to its transmission (more details here).|$|E

40|$|This article {{suggests}} a rights-based approach (RBA) to conservation of environmental resources. The article points out benefits of an RBA model, such as identifying {{the causes of}} environmental impacts on citizens’ human <b>rights</b> and bettering <b>the</b> regulation of environmental resources. However, the RBA also poses challenges, such as resistance from non-State actors, comparing the importance of different rights, and a commitment of many resources. The article next identifies substantive and procedural rights provided by international law. An RBA implicates, among others, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> life, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> health, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> an adequate standard of living, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> work, <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> religion and culture, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> property, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy and home life and <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> information and participation. <b>The</b> article concludes by providing detailed guidance about how to implement an RBA, and the main steps include analyzing the situation, disseminating information, guaranteeing participation, making a decision about the activity, monitoring and evaluating the RBA, and ensuring <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> by enforcement of the commitments undertaken by various actors...|$|R
