5|$|Allen {{was born}} on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, Australia, the second of three {{children}} to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), née Lamb, {{the daughter of a}} Queensland Minister of Lands. Later rumours suggested that Allen's real father may have been the Middlesex cricketer Pelham Warner, who supported Allen in his cricket career. Both of Allen's parents had roots in England as well as Australia. In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to London—hoping that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> benefit from an English education—where they initially lived in a flat before moving to various country villages. Finding that they enjoyed England, the family abandoned plans to return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Tinne {{was born}} Emily Margaret McCulloch on 21 August 1886 near Calcutta, India. Her father, William McCulloch, was a Presbyterian missionary and {{principal}} at a theological college in nearby Chinsurah, West Bengal. Her {{mother was a}} stern lady, and the family's lack of means and Presbyterian beliefs made for a frugal upbringing. Tinne had two brothers and a sister, and the four were sent to boarding school in 1893, when Tinne was about seven. During the school holidays, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> live either with Tinne's maternal aunt in Sevenoaks, Kent or grandparents in Edinburgh. Her parents remained in India until the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|On many occasions, Jews {{were accused}} of {{drinking}} the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian Eucharist. According to the authors of these so-called blood libels, the 'procedure' for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child {{who had not yet}} reached puberty was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> wounds <b>would</b> be caught in bowls or glasses and then drunk. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. Its dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of black magic would be performed on it. This method, with some variations, can be found in all the alleged Christian descriptions of ritual murder by Jews.|$|R

5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E
5|$|Many Flemish {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} eastern England during the 12th century, {{and they were}} persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154; {{a large number of}} them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of Flemish fullers existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> have presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by green sickness, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and the one most widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken by the children as being Flemish.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{children}} of the king could be born inside the Inner Court. Every detail of the birth of the royal child was recorded, including the time of birth, which was to be used later by court astrologers to cast his or her horoscope. Ceremonies concerning the birth and the rites of passage of the child was performed within the walls of the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. <b>The</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.|$|E

25|$|From the 1920s {{until the}} 1970s, most kibbutzim had a system whereby <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> sleep in {{communal}} children's homes, called 'Beit Yeladim' (בית ילדים), {{instead of in}} their parents' apartments.|$|E
25|$|To {{solve these}} issues the founders created the {{communal}} children's houses, where <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> {{spend most of}} their time; learning, playing and sleeping. Parents spent 3 to 4 hours a day in the afternoon with their children after work and before dinner.|$|E
25|$|Like many Indigenous {{communities}} across Canada, the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh {{also have a}} history of residential schools.

25|$|Malian {{migrants}} {{have long}} worked on cocoa {{farms in the}} Ivory Coast, but in 2000 cocoa prices had dropped to a 10-year low and some farmers stopped paying their employees. The Malian counsel had to rescue some boys {{who had not been}} paid for five years and who were beaten if they tried to run away. Malian officials believed that 15,000 children, some as young as 11 years old, were working in the Ivory Coast in 2001. These children were often from poor families or the slums and were sold to work in other countries. Parents were told <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> find work and send money home, but once the children left home, they often worked in conditions resembling slavery. In other cases, children begging for food were lured from bus stations and sold as slaves. In 2002, the Ivory Coast had 12,000 children with no relatives nearby, which suggested they were trafficked, likely from neighboring Mali, Burkina Faso and Togo.|$|E
25|$|Women {{were the}} primary vehicle for rumors that touched upon issues of family and {{everyday}} life. Fears that collectivization {{would result in the}} socialization of children, the export of women’s hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, when it was announced that a collective farm in Crimea would become a commune and that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women. After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women would sleep on a seven-hundred meter long bed under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket. Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumors without actually believing them so they could attack the collective farm “under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest.” Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore able to get away with a lot more.|$|E
25|$|The third {{reign of}} an-Nasir Muhammad {{also saw a}} {{departure}} from the traditions of succession and administrative elevation of his predecessors since he observed in his first two reigns that such traditions had been ignored anyway, while sultans were being assassinated and mamluks were abusing other mamluks in bids for power. Moreover, an-Nasir Muhammad's being the son of a mamluk instead of a mamluk himself risked undermining his position among the largely mamluk elite. This partially explains his purges of the thousands of mamluks purchased by his predecessors. Amid conditions that stemmed the flow of mamluks from the Mongol-held lands to the sultanate, an-Nasir Muhammad resolved {{to make up for the}} loss of the purged mamluks by adopting new methods of training and military and financial advancement that introduced a great level of permissiveness. This permissiveness, which manifested in far more relaxed conditions for new mamluks, encouraged the pursuit of military careers in Egypt by aspiring mamluks outside of the country, to the point that parents would sell their children as mamluks with the belief <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> enjoy an improved standard of living.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{conversion}} {{was made from}} Germanic to Christian names, most parents just picked a name they liked best or would be most helpful in their child's later life, for example if <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> come from a butcher's family and he himself would one day become a butcher, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> probably be called after [...] "Sint Joris" [...] (the Dutch name for [...] "Saint George"), {{the patron saint of}} the butchers.|$|R

500|$|... "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken" [...] is the {{eleventh}} episode of The Simpsons tenth season. It originally aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on January 17, 1999. When Homer, Barney, Lenny, and Carl drunkenly vandalize Springfield Elementary School, it is blamed on the children of Springfield, prompting Chief Wiggum to impose a curfew. The children respond by setting up a pirate radio show in which they reveal the embarrassing secrets of Springfield's adults. The episode was written by Larry Doyle and directed by Mark Ervin. The concept behind the episode originates from show producer Mike Scully always wanting to do an episode where <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> {{be subject to a}} curfew. The episode received an 8.9 Nielsen rating, and mostly positive reviews from critics.|$|E
500|$|Mike Scully {{wanted to}} do an episode where the {{children}} of Springfield {{would be subject to}} a curfew.

The name of the baseball announcer, Denis Conroy, was used because that is the name of writer Larry Doyle's uncle. Dan Castellaneta ad libbed Homer singing [...] "Hitler is a jerk, Mussolini...." [...] It was added in to the episode only for the purpose of filling time. The Chief Wiggum billboard sketch was inspired by Beaver Cleaver getting stuck in a soup bowl billboard during the [...] "In the Soup" [...] episode of Leave It to Beaver. The music playing when the kids secretly leave their houses to see the movie was written by composer Alf Clausen.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the villain}} {{of the episode}} [...] "Hell House" [...] has supernatural origins, {{the basis of the}} story came from a {{situation}} writer Trey Callaway had as a child; he and his friends created a fake murder scene in an abandoned barn and then convinced their friends that killings occurred there. <b>The</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> often go there to scare each other, with one girl running away and breaking her leg after believing that she saw an attacking ghost. The human antagonists of [...] "The Benders", however, were completely devoid of supernatural elements. Shiban made this decision not only to surprise the audience, but also to have the Winchesters face something they had never encountered before. For [...] "Nightmare", Tucker tried to write the character Max as sympathetic, and thus had difficulties in deciding how to end the episode.

500|$|The {{question}} of whether LeHand and Roosevelt's relationship contained a sexual component was widely discussed among their contemporaries {{and continues to be}} debated by historians. Hazel Rowley argues that [...] "there is no doubt that Franklin's relationship with Missy was romantic", but notes the possibility that the relationship could not have been consummated due to FDR's disability. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin states that [...] "beneath the complexity, it is absolutely clear that Franklin was the love of Missy's life, and that he adored her and depended on her for affection and support as well as work". Doug Wead wrote in his work on the parents of presidents, The Raising of a President, [...] "Some Roosevelt historians insist that their relationship was never consummated. Eleanor and the children accepted the relationship, which speaks for its innocence. Sara [...] spoke favorably of Missy's family and upbringing. Years later, only Elliott, of all <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> <b>would</b> declare that it had not been as benign as historians like to believe." ...|$|E
500|$|The writing {{staff had}} never done a spring break episode before so they thought, [...] "What would Lisa and Bart do on spring break?" [...] {{and came up with}} the road trip plot. Bill Oakley, the show runner of The Simpsons at the time, said that road trips were {{something}} that the writers liked to write stories about. The idea of four children going on a road trip was [...] "so exciting" [...] that they immediately knew they wanted to write it. There was a debate over where <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> go, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was first suggested, but the writers eventually decided to have them go to a [...] "funny unlikely place". Oakley's show runner partner, Josh Weinstein, said that the writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on the show. Homer and Lisa had not been done [...] "too often" [...] and they wanted the two characters to bond and get closer to each other.|$|E
500|$|The Sutherland Room lies at {{the rear}} east wing {{of the house and}} was once the bedroom of the Earl of Althorp in the first few centuries of the house when it was fashionable for the {{occupants}} to sleep on the ground floor and guests to sleep on the first floor. This was still the case during the Holland restoration, and as a result the room was ignored, so it retains many of the earlier mouldings not seen in many other parts of the house. It contains two fireplaces made by John Vardy and James Stuart which were originally situated in Spencer House, and the room has the original 17th-century cornice. The paintings in the room were selected by the current owner Charles Spencer to honour John, Third Earl Spencer and his passion for foxhunting. After it ceased usage as a bedroom, on special occasions the room would be full of life; on Christmas Day the room would be [...] "transformed into a Christmas fairyland, with clockwork Santas, snowmen and angels all spinning and chiming in the candlelight". <b>The</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> have their places marked by a small cake with their names written on it in icing.|$|E
