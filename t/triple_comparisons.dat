40|$|A choice {{experiment}} is reported {{in which all}} pairs and triples of faces from a set of eight moderately attractive faces were presented, both upright and upside down, to 103 subjects. In each orientation, the subjects had to select the face that appeared more (pairs) or most (triples) attractive to them. For each orientation, the preference probabilities that arose from the pair and <b>triple</b> <b>comparisons</b> could be described by the BTL rule (Luce, 1959). Thus, each face was represented by two scores, one reflecting its attractiveness in the upright orientation and the other reflecting its attractiveness in the inverted orientation. Orientation affected the preference probabilities. Qualitatively, score ratios between faces decreased from upright to inverted orientation, suggesting that the faces became less discriminable by inversion. Quantitatively, the effect of inversion could be described by a simple rule that assumes a face’s two attractiveness scores to be affinely related across orientations. This result indicates that inversion affected all faces about equally. The present findings are discussed with respect to faces’ first- and second-order relational properties, a distinction emphasized in current theories of face perception. They suggest that the processing of first- and secondorder relational properties is impaired by inversion to roughly the same degree...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} triple comparison-based {{interactive}} differential evolution (IDE) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The comparison of target vector and trial vector supports a {{local fitness landscape}} for IDE and DE algorithms to conduct a memetic search. In addition to the target vector and trial vector used in canonical IDE and DE algorithm frameworks, we conduct a memetic search around whichever vector has better fitness. We use a random number from a normal distribution generator or a uniform distribution generator to perturb the vector, thereby generating a third vector. By comparing the target vector, the trial vector, and the third vector, we implement a <b>triple</b> <b>comparison</b> mechanism in IDE and DE algorithms. A Gaussian mixture model {{is used as a}} pseudo-IDE user for evaluating the IDE and 25 benchmark functions from the CEC 2005 test suite are employed to evaluate the DE.

We also compare our proposals with several evaluation metrics, such as number of function calls, success rate and acceleration rate. Our proposed triple comparison-based IDE and DE algorithms show significantly better optimization performance arising from the evaluation results.

In 2009, the number of inhabitants living in cities was over the number of people inhabiting rural areas, while from 75 in 1950 the number of cities with more than 1 million inhabitants is expected to increase to 553 by 2050. Nevertheless, the most evident forms of the march of urbanization are megacities, i. e. those urban agglomerations where extremely large populations are concentrated. One important problem of defining megacities is the determination of an optimum population threshold that is the establishment of the population value over which an urban agglomeration can be regarded to be a megacity. This article has been divided into two main sections: the first section relies on a relatively objective method to determine the optimum population threshold value of megacities, whereas the second section makes use of the World Bank and UN’s country classification to arrange the same cities into groups.

In this paper, a new, hybrid error-detection approach offering a very high coverage with no detection latency is proposed to protect the data paths of high-performance microprocessors. The feature of no detection latency is essential to real-time error recovery. The hybrid detection approach is to combine the duplication with <b>comparison,</b> <b>triple</b> modular redundancy (TMR) and self-checking mechanisms to construct a formal framework, which allows the error-detection schemes of varying hardware complexity and performance to be incorporated. We develop three error-detection schemes using the concept of hybrid approach to demonstrate the design compromise among the hardware overhead, performance degradation and error-detection coverage (EDC). Three detection schemes are then implemented in an experimental 32 -bit VLIW core respectively.

Until now, continuous extraction with more than ten multiple theoretical stages has been demonstrated by a single centrifugal extractor {{in the case of}} single specie (zinc extraction with di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA)). In the present study, the centrifugal extraction system has been applied to a multispecies case to clarify the separation behavior by countercurrent Taylor mixing. The extraction behaviors of lanthanides (Sm and Eu) with D 2 EHPA were compared among batch equilibrium measurements, rate measurements by a constant-interfacial-area cell and the continuous experiments by the centrifugal extractor. In the continuous experiment, the separation factor (SF = DEu/DSm) became more than <b>tripled</b> in <b>comparison</b> with the batch equilibrium value due to the multistage extraction effect caused by the countercurrent contact of aqueous/organic phases. The number of theoretical stages of our extractor was evaluated to be 8 to 9 in terms of DEu and 4 to 5 in terms of SF at the rotation speed of 1400 rpm. The SF value from the rate measurement data (SFnoneq; SF in non-equilibrium state) was slightly lower than the batch extraction data (SFeq; SF in equilibrium state) which resulted in difference between theoretical stages evaluated from DEu,eq and SFeq. Although this would slightly decrease the separation efficiency by the continuous extraction, the countercurrent multistage effect was still dominant. By considering this feature, a more effective separation process would be developed by utilizing the countercurrent centrifugal extractor with Taylor vortices...|$|R

The recent inclusion of intellectual functioning in the diagnostic process for autism spectrum disorders leads to the crucial question on how to assess intelligence in autism, especially as some tests and subtests seem more sensitive to certain neurodevelopmental conditions. Our first aim was to examine the cognitive profile on the current version of the most widely used test, the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-IV), for a homogenous subgroup of children on the autism spectrum, i. e. corresponding to DSM-IV diagnosis of "autism". The second aim was to compare cognitive profiles obtained on the third edition versus 4 th edition of WISC, in order to verify whether the WISC-IV yields a more distinctive cognitive profile in autistic children. The third aim was to examine the impact of the WISC-IV on the cognitive profile of another subgroup, children with Asperger's Syndrome. 51 autistic, 15 Asperger and 42 typically developing children completed the WISC-IV and were individually matched to children who completed the WISC-III.

Objective. This study analyses pre- and postoperative pathoanatomic characteristics of <b>triple</b> in <b>comparison</b> to Salter and Chiari osteotomies, with a logistic regression analysis of outcome predictor and effect explanator factors in relation to the chosen type of operation. Methods. The study involved 136 adolescents treated with Salter and Chiari osteotomies or a triple pelvic osteotomy at the Institute of Orthopaedic Surgery 'Banjica' in Belgrade. The patients were between 10 - 20 {{years old at the time}} of operation. We collected and analyzed data from all the patients: illness history, operative parameters, preoperative and postoperative pathoanatomic data. The data was statistically processed using the statistical software SPSS, defining standard descriptive values, and by using the appropriate tests of analytic statistics: t-test for dependent and independent variables, χ 2 -test, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon's test, parameter correlation, one-way ANOVA, multi-factorial ANOVA and logistic regression, according to the type of the analyzed data and the conditions under which the statistical methods were applied. Results. The average CE angle after triple pelvic osteotomy was 43. 5 °, more improved than after the Salter osteotomy (33. 0 °) and Chiari osteotomy (31. 4 °) (F= 16. 822; p< 0. 01). Postoperative spherical congruence was also more frequent after the triple osteotomy than after the other two types of operations, and with a high significance. Preoperative painful discomfort was found to be a valid predictor of indications for the triple osteotomy over both Chiari and Salter osteotomies. The valid explanators of effect for the triple osteotomy are: postoperative joint congruence (compared to the Chiari osteotomy) and increase in joint coverage (compared to Salter osteotomy).

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze whether, and how, {{uncertainty}} influences the layout {{and costs of}} a CO 2 transportation network. The case without uncertainty is modelled with a perfect foresight (PF) model and with uncertainty with the real option approach (ROA). In this study, uncertainties in the CO 2 price, tariff received per tonne of CO 2 transported, the willingness, probability and moment that sources join the CO 2 transportation network are incorporated in the analysis. The results show that uncertainty leads to higher required CO 2 prices before investments in carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are made. With a volatility of 47 % in the CO 2 price, the required CO 2 price almost <b>triples</b> in <b>comparison</b> with the net present value approach. Hence, under uncertainty less sources are retrofitted with CCS and less CO 2 is captured and stored over time. For instance, for the analyzed case study 31 Mt and 137 Mt CO 2 is projected to be captured in the base scenario of ROA and PF model, respectively, in the period 2015 - 2050. If the volatility of the CO 2 price is reduced with 50 %, 96 Mt is projected to be captured in the ROA, which is still about one third less than in the PF model. Furthermore, {{the results show that}} uncertainty leads to less development of trunklines. All this leads to an increase in the transport and storage costs. For instance, for our case study, the average CO 2 transport and storage costs in 2050 increase from 2. 8 €/t to 13 €/t in the base scenario of the ROA compared to the PF model. If the volatility is reduced with 50 %, the transport and storage costs decrease to 7. 5 €/t in the ROA, which is still 2. 5 times as much as in the PF model. Our findings indicate that the implementation of CCS can best be stimulated by reducing the volatility of the CO 2 price, reducing capture costs and facilitating cooperation between nearby sources...|$|R

A total of 538 of the 1208 ring systems in GDB are currently unknown in the CAS Registry and Beilstein databases in any carbon/heteroatom/multiple-bond combination or as a substructure. Over 70 % of GDB molecules are chiral. Because of their small size, all compounds obey Lipinski’s bioavailability rule. A total of 13. 2 million compounds also follow Congreve’s “Rule of 3 ” for lead-likeness. A Kohonen map trained with autocorrelation descriptors organizes GDB according to compound classes and shows that leadlike compounds are most abundant in chiral regions of fused carbocycles and fused heterocycles. The projection of known compounds into this map indicates large uncharted areas of chemical space. The potential of GDB for drug discovery is illustrated by virtual screening for kinase inhibitors, G-protein coupled receptor ligands, and ion-channel modulators.

50|$|Their main {{armament}} of nine 16 in {{guns were}} mounted in triple turrets, the only RN battleships designed in this manner. The guns themselves deviated from standard British designs. Where previous RN weapons fired heavy shells {{at a moderate}} velocity, the Nelsons weapons followed the German practice of a lighter shell at a higher velocity. This change in Director of Naval Ordnance policy was due to British testing of surrendered German equipment after World War I, although much later, subsequent testing proved contradictory. Two different rifling rates were tried, and for some {{time there was a}} mixture of barrel types in different turrets, even sometimes within the same turret. The guns suffered considerable barrel wear and had a fairly large dispersion pattern, due mainly to the different riflings that each barrel had as they were refurbished over their lifespan. To compensate for barrel wear, muzzle velocities were reduced and a heavier (longer) shell was tried to offset this; but the cost of producing new shells, modifying shell handling and storage equipment came at a time when RN funding had been heavily reduced. Nevertheless, these weapons were not generally considered by the RN to be as successful as the previous BL 15 inch Mark I, although they were considered more successful than the BL 14-inch Mark VII fitted to the subsequent King George V-class battleships. The need to reduce displacement led to the use of triple mount turrets, which had early problems with the ammunition handling and loading machinery. The heavier weight of the <b>triple</b> in <b>comparison</b> to a twin turret meant increased stresses on the roller bearings when training the turrets. This was solved by the incorporation of spring-loaded vertical as well as conventional horizontal roller bearings. The triple mount turret proved itself when, in October 1929, a turret crew with two years' experience loaded and fired 33 consecutive rounds without mishap. The incorporation of many safety features, achieved with lighter materials, meant that the complex and relatively fragile equipment had to be serviced regularly over the ships' lifetime. These ships were fitted with the HACS AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk I for surface fire control of the main armament.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalized approach for predicting {{the diameter of}} jet grout columns based on the theoretical framework of turbulent kinematic flow and soil erosion. The proposed calculation method is applicable to all conventional jet-grouting systems and {{takes into account the}} full range of operational parameters, fluid properties, soil strength, and particle size distribution, including the effect of the injection time on erosion distance. It was demonstrated that the increase in the jet grout column diameter arising from the use of a compressed air shroud in the double and triple fluid systems is approximately 27 - 81 % for the typical range of air pressure of 0. 5 - 1. 5 MPa. The proposed method was applied to four case histories involving four variants of jet-grouting systems, i. e., single fluid, double fluid, triple fluid, and an enhanced <b>triple</b> fluid system. <b>Comparison</b> between the calculated and the measured jet grout column diameters indicated that the proposed method can produce reasonable predictions for a variety of soil conditions. It was shown that jet grout columns formed by the enhanced triple fluid system are larger than those formed by the conventional triple fluid system by approximately 36 % on average. The proposed generalized approach allows all the key variables to be considered and is a useful means for the design of ground improvement by jet grouting. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R
40|$|Malic enzymes {{have high}} {{cofactor}} selectivity. An isoform-specific distribution of residues 314, 346, 347 and 362 implies {{that they may}} play key roles in determining the cofactor specificity. Currently, Glu 314, Ser 346, Lys 347 and Lys 362 in human c-NADP-ME were changed to the corresponding residues of human m-NAD(P) -ME (Glu, Lys, Tyr and Gln, respectively) or Ascaris suum m-NAD-ME (Ala, Ile, Asp and His, respectively). Kinetic data demonstrated that the S 346 K/K 347 Y/K 362 Q c-NADP-ME {{was transformed into a}} debilitated NAD(+) -utilizing enzyme, as shown by a severe decrease in catalytic efficiency using NADP(+) as the cofactor without a significant increase in catalysis using NAD(+) as the cofactor. However, the S 346 K/K 347 Y/K 362 H enzyme displayed an enhanced value for k(cat,NAD), suggesting that His at residue 362 may be more beneficial than Gln for NAD(+) binding. Furthermore, the S 3461 /K 347 D/K 362 H mutant had a very large K(m,NADP) value compared to other mutants, suggesting that this mutant exclusively utilizes NAD(+) as its cofactor. Since the S 346 K/K 347 Y/K 362 Q, S 346 K 1 K 347 Y/K 362 H and S 346 I/K 347 D/K 362 H c-NADP-ME mutants did not show significant reductions in their K(m,NAD) values, the E 314 A mutation was then introduced into these <b>triple</b> mutants. <b>Comparison</b> of the kinetic parameters of each triple-quadruple mutant pair (for example, S 346 K/K 347 Y/K 362 Q versus E 314 A/S 346 K/K 347 Y/K 362 Q) revealed that all of the K(m) values for NAD(+) and NADP(+) of the quadruple mutants were significantly decreased, while either k(cat,NAD) or k(cat,NADP) was substantially increased. By adding the E 314 A mutation to these triple mutant enzymes, the E 314 A/S 346 K/K 347 Y/K 362 Q, E 314 A/S 346 K/K 347 Y/K 362 H and E 314 A/S 3461 /K 347 D/K 362 H c-NADP-ME variants are no longer debilitated but become mainly NAD utilizing enzymes by a considerable increase in catalysis using NAD(+) as the cofactor. These results suggest that abolishing the repulsive effect of Glu 314 in these quadruple mutants increases the binding affinity of NAD(+) Here, we demonstrate that a series of E 314 A-containing c-NADP-ME quadruple mutants have been changed to NAD(+) -Utilizing enzymes by abrogating NADP(+) binding and increasing NAD(+) binding...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 85 - 88) The San Emigdio (SE) area in {{the southern}} San Joaquin Valley and the San Juan Bautista (SJB) {{area in the}} northern Gabilan Range lie approximately 295 km apart {{on opposite sides of}} the San Andreas fault. The geochemistry of the lower Miocene volcanic rocks from these two areas was studied ??to determine: 1) whether they could be correlated across the fault, and 2 > their petrogenesis. The Miocene volcanic rocks from the SE and SJB areas are the same age (approximately 22. 5 Ma). Close similarities in major- and trace-element, and isotopic composition strongly suggest that the two areas were in close proximity at the time of eruption and have since been offset by movement along the San Andreas fault. The geochemical data suggest that basalt located in the SE area is not compositionally primitive and probably interacted with the crust. Trace-element and isotopic data from the SE-SJB intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks represent melted crustal rocks, perhaps greywacke from the Franciscan Formation. The SE-SJB volcanic rocks fit well with a group of Neogene volcanic rocks in California that correlate closely with the temporal and spatial position of the Mendocino <b>triple</b> junction. Geochemical <b>comparisons</b> with other volcanic rocks of this group support a similar origin of triple-junction magmatism. One possible model involves decoupling of the subducted slab and consequent upwelling of mantle material. The rising mantle induces melting, which produces basalt. The basalt then induces melting of crustal rocks to produce the more siliceous volcanic rocks...|$|R
40|$|The halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii {{contains}} three operons encoding 2 -oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes (OADHCs) OADHC 1 -OADHC 3. However, {{the biological}} role of these OADHCs {{is not known}} as previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} they cannot use any of the known OADHC substrates. Even the construction of single mutants in all three oadhc operons, reported recently, could not identify a substrate. Therefore, all three possible double mutants and a triple mutant were generated, and single, double and triple mutants were compared to the wild-type. The four mutants devoid of a functional OADHC 1 had a reduced growth yield during nitrate-respirative growth on tryptone. A metabolome analysis of the medium after growth of the <b>triple</b> mutant in <b>comparison</b> to the wild-type revealed that the mutant was unable to degrade isoleucine and leucine, in contrast to the wild-type. It was shown that oadhc 1 mutants were unable to grow in synthetic medium on isoleucine, in contrast to the other mutants and the isogenic parent strain. However, all strains grew indistinguishably on valine and leucine. The transcript of the oadhc 1 operon was highly induced during growth on isoleucine. However, attempts to detect enzymic activity were unsuccessful, while the branched-chain OADHC (BCDHC) of Pseudomonas putida could be measured easily. Therefore, the growth capability of the triple mutant and the wild-type on the two first degradation intermediates of isoleucine was tested and provided further evidence that OADHC is involved in isoleucine degradation. Taken together, the results indicate that OADHC 1 is a specialized BCDHC that uses only one (or maximally two) of the three branched-chain 2 -oxoacids, in contrast to BCDHCs from other species...|$|R
