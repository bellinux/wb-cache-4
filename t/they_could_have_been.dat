5|$|Hill forts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly {{the start of the}} first millenniumBC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate.

5|$|In 1967, {{when the}} King Island emu was still {{thought to be}} only known from prehistoric remains, James Greenway {{questioned}} whether <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> exterminated by a few natives, and speculated that fires started by prehistoric men or lightning may have been responsible. At this time, the mainland emu was also threatened by overhunting, and Greenway cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures were taken in time.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Joseph Brady of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied {{irregularities}} in {{the motion of}} Halley's Comet. Brady claimed that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> caused by a Jupiter-sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a retrograde orbit around the Sun. However, both Marsden and PlanetX proponent P. Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady's PlanetX would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.|$|E
5|$|Longrich et al. {{pointed out}} that the robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and pangolins, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous. The researchers found that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E
5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales. Different tales {{have been told}} of the corgi's origin: some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> either the extinct Deutsches Brachen, or the Dachshund breed.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{conclusive}} evidence explaining why the Dibbles chose to place Gothic {{windows on the}} upper level. The windows {{are believed to have}} been purchased through the Sears catalog. There are two commonly accepted theories: the Dibbles may have wanted the windows to beautify their home at a time when rural life in Iowa was a struggle, or <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> following a trend in which extravagant details were desirable in residences in the late nineteenth century, and the Dibbles chose windows whose costs would have been relatively reasonable at the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> from as few as three individuals.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E

5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly {{less than that of}} modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E
5|$|Several Einsatzgruppen leaders, {{including}} Ohlendorf, claimed at {{the trial}} to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews. To date no evidence {{has been found that}} such an order was ever issued. German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the Einsatzgruppen leaders as accomplices to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the Einsatzgruppen had committed mass murder without orders, then <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> convicted as perpetrators of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.|$|E
5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared for staff duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that there was too much emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> told.|$|E

5|$|Macaws {{are known}} to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from {{mainland}} South America both in historic times by Europeans and natives, and prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, were traded between islands, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. It is therefore difficult to determine whether the numerous historical records of macaws on these islands refer to distinct, endemic species, since <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> based on escaped individuals or feral populations of foreign macaws of known species that had been transported there. As many as thirteen extinct macaws have been suggested to have lived on the islands until recently. Only three endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor) is known from nineteen museum skins and subfossils, the Saint Croix macaw (Ara autochthones) is only known from subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw is known from subfossils and reports. No endemic Caribbean macaws remain today; they were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times.|$|E
5|$|Sir Nigel Gresley's {{independent}} {{report on}} the Kand K1classes during the mainline stability trials stated that they were well designed, mechanically reliable and capable of hauling expresses at high speeds on well-maintained track, which meant that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> useful additions to the Southern Railway's suburban commuter fleet. However, they were undoubtedly prone to rough riding and instability, and {{not only on the}} poorest quality tracks. The restricted water capacity also limited their use outside the Southern Railway's Central section. The impending electrification of the Brighton Main Line, scheduled for 1932 also meant that fewer duties suitable for heavy passenger tank locomotives would be available in the 1930s. The lack of a suitable role for both classes was considered when {{the decision was made to}} rebuild them as U/U1 tender engines following the Sevenoaks disaster. In rebuilt form they continued to operate until the 1960s, and were capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70mph (110km/h) with a greater degree of stability.|$|E
5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed {{the true nature of the}} thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E

25|$|In addition, as hand axes can be recycled, resharpened and remade, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{used for}} varied tasks. For this reason it is {{misleading}} {{to think of}} them as axes, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used for tasks such as digging, cutting, scraping, chopping, piercing and hammering. In addition, and given their mass, they may be used as a lithic core to obtain flakes that could be used as knives or transformed for specialized uses through retouching.|$|E
