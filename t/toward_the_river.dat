5|$|General Grant had Commander Henry Walke {{bring the}} Carondelet up the Cumberland River {{to create a}} {{diversion}} by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting to stretch his men <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided {{that he did not}} have enough men to stretch all the way to the river, so Grant decided to call on more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had been left behind at Fort Henry, to bring his men to Fort Donelson.|$|E
5|$|The mansion at Wappocomo {{is unique}} among the {{historic}} residences along the South Branch Potomac River, in that its formal façade faces {{toward the road}} and the western flanks of South Branch Mountain rather than <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two-story Georgian-style structure, an architectural style prevalent in Virginia at the time of Wappocomo's construction. The bricks used to build the 1774 structure were manufactured in England, and used as ballast to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the James River. The interior of the 1774 structure contains a grand stairway in the center hall and all the original handmade woodworking. A stone addition to the mansion with two stories of deep verandas was completed in 1861. The principal passenger depot for the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad, Wappocomo Station, is located at the farm.|$|E
5|$|The palace is {{structured}} {{around a large}} and paved courtyard. It has a trapezoidal plan, and the land falls away <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Ill. To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the Mansard roof), while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E
50|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>river</b> was dammed up {{which created}} pollution, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{was used for}} {{irrigation}} and for fishing purposes. A clean-up effort in September 1996, was a step <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> restoration.|$|R
2500|$|Sutter's Fort {{is located}} on level ground at an {{elevation}} of approximately [...] above mean sea datum. The slope elevation decreases northward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> American <b>River</b> and westward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento <b>River.</b> Slope elevation gradually increases {{to the south and}} east, away from <b>the</b> <b>rivers.</b> All surface drainage flows <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento <b>River.</b> Groundwater in <b>the</b> vicinity flows south-southwest <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento Delta. However after peak rainfall, <b>the</b> Sacramento <b>River</b> swells and <b>the</b> groundwater flow can actually reverse away from <b>the</b> <b>river.</b>|$|R

5|$|At 2 a.m. on 2 August, Atkinson's forces awoke {{and began}} to break camp, setting out before sunrise. They had moved {{only a few miles}} when they ran into the rear scout element of the {{remaining}} Sauk and Fox forces. The Sauk scouts attempted to lead the enemy away from the main camp and were initially successful. The combined U.S. forces fell into formation for battle: Generals Alexander and Posey formed the right wing, Henry the left wing, and Dodge and the regulars the center element. As the Native Americans retreated <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> the militia's left wing were left in the rear without orders. When a regiment stumbled across the main trail to the camp, the scouts could only fight in retreat and hope that they had given their comrades a chance to escape the militia, while the Sauk and Fox kept retreating to the river. However, Warrior returned after obtaining more wood in Prairie du Chien, leaving the refueling point about midnight and arriving at Bad Axe about 10 a.m. The slaughter that followed continued for the next eight hours.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E

25|$|Greater {{changes in}} {{attitude}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> were {{manifest in the}} Bow River Water Quality Council's reports over time. By 1994, the reports {{emphasized the importance of}} the Bow's ecological balance as a whole for maintaining its water quality and quantity. In the mid-1990s, the upper Bow River began being treated explicitly biocentrically. This was part of the larger pursuit of treating Banff National Park's ecosystems as something intrinsically valuable: maintaining these ecosystems was now prioritized over human enjoyment of the parks.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large {{sand dunes}} about 27 {{miles south of}} present-day {{downtown}} El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses ran <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de Oñate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the Río Grande {{in what is now}} San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. Oñate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the Río Grande for King Philip II of Spain.|$|E

25|$|McClellan ordered Keyes's IV Corps to move west of Glendale {{and protect}} the army's withdrawal, while Porter {{was sent to the}} high ground at Malvern Hill to develop {{defensive}} positions. The supply trains were ordered to move south <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> McClellan departed for Harrison's Landing without specifying any exact routes of withdrawal and without designating a second-in-command. For the remainder of the Seven Days, he had no direct command of the battles. The Union retreat across the Chickahominy after Gaines's Mill was a psychological victory for the Confederacy, signaling that Richmond was out of danger.|$|E
25|$|The town is {{near the}} {{confluence}} of the rivers Corve and Teme. The oldest part is the medieval walled town, founded in the late 11th century after the Norman conquest of England. It is centred on a small hill which lies on the eastern bank of a bend of the River Teme. Atop this hill is Ludlow Castle and the parish church, St Laurence's, the largest in the county. From there the streets slope downward to the River Teme, and northward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Corve. The town is in a sheltered spot beneath Mortimer Forest and the Clee Hills, which are clearly visible from the town.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of November 24, Forrest's cavalry drove Capron's men through Cox's line south of Columbia and began probing attacks {{in an attempt to}} break through. The line straddled the Mount Pleasant Pike (present day U.S. Route 43) just north of Bigby Creek and then {{continued}} eastward across the Pulaski Pike into the town, curving northward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> By November 25, this line was supplemented with an interior line that roughly encompassed the entire residential area of Columbia. The Confederates bombarded the lines with artillery and a number of skirmishes occurred, but it became apparent to the Union defenders that only a single infantry division with some dismounted cavalry were participating in the attacks and that Hood was merely demonstrating, intending to cross the Duck River either upstream or downstream and cut off the Union force from Thomas, who was assembling the remainder of his force in Nashville.|$|E

25|$|Major General Mansfield Lovell, Commander of Department 1, Louisiana, {{was left}} with one tenable option after the Union Navy broke through the Confederate ring of fortifications and defense vessels {{guarding}} the lower Mississippi: evacuation. The inner ring of fortifications at Chalmette was only intended to resist ground troops; few of the gun batteries were aimed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Most of the artillery, ammunition, troops, and vessels in the area were committed to the Jackson/St. Phillips position. Once this defense was breached, there remained to face Union troops and warships only three thousand militiamen with sundry military supplies and armed with shotguns. The city itself was a poor position to defend against a hostile fleet. With high water outside the levees, Union ships were elevated above the city and able to fire down into the streets and buildings below. Besides the ever-present danger of weather-caused breaks in the levees, now an even greater threat to New Orleans was {{the ability of the}} Union military to cause a break in a major levee that would lead to flooding most of the city, possibly destroying it within a day.|$|E
500|$|The 42 {{men of the}} 2nd Platoon, B Company, 23rd Infantry held outpost {{positions}} on seven hills covering a [...] front along the east bank of the Naktong north of Pugong-ni. Across the river in the rice paddies they could see, in the afternoon of August 31, two large groups of North Korean soldiers. Occasionally artillery fire dispersed them. Just before dark, the platoon saw a column of North Koreans {{come out of the}} hills and proceed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> They immediately reported to the battalion command post. The artillery forward observer, who estimated the column at 2,000 people, thought they were refugees. Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column, reducing its number. However the North Koreans continued their advance.|$|E
500|$|Still expecting von Kluge to {{withdraw}} his {{forces from the}} tightening Allied noose, Montgomery had for some time been planning a [...] "long envelopment", by which the British and Canadians would pivot left from Falaise <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Seine while the US Third Army blocked the escape route between the Seine and the Loire, trapping all surviving German forces in western France. In a telephone conversation on 8 August, the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, recommended an American proposal for a shorter envelopment at Argentan. Montgomery and Patton had misgivings; if the Allies did not take Argentan, Alençon and Falaise quickly, many Germans might escape. Believing he could always fall back on the original plan if necessary, Montgomery accepted the wishes of Bradley as {{the man on the}} spot, and the proposal was adopted.|$|E

500|$|The {{position}} where Cornwallis hid his army was well-chosen. [...] To the left, impassable swampy terrain sloped down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> [...] To the right, {{there was more}} marshy ground and a few ponds. [...] The access {{from the rest of}} the mainland toward the ferry was via a [...] causeway from the Green Spring Plantation that was surrounded by marshlands that an advancing army would have to negotiate. [...] The earl arranged his army in two lines, with the 76th and 80th regiments along with part of the 43rd and Banastre Tarleton's British Legion on the left, and the Brigade of Guards, and Hessian auxiliaries on the right. [...] Both wings also included light infantry companies. [...] Cornwallis left a small company of German jägers and a few men from the Legion to give the appearance of a rear guard picket, and gave them specific orders to resist the American advance as much as possible.|$|E
500|$|... 1st Airborne Division's {{commanding}} officer, Major General Roy Urquhart, {{originally planned}} [...] for the 2nd Battalion {{to lead the}} 1st Parachute Brigade into Arnhem to secure the road, rail and pontoon bridges over the Lower Rhine. Frost chose Major Digby Tatham-Warter's A Company to lead the battalion's march from the drop zones to the bridges, knowing him to be [...] "a thruster if ever there was". A company was in action almost at once, ambushing a small German recce group near the drop zone. The company moved off through the woods <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> road, with each platoon taking turns to lead. There was a brief plan to advance the platoons by jeep once out of the woods, but German forces were encountered shortly afterwards and the idea was not followed up. Grayburn had just arrived at a road junction and headed north when the men behind him came under enemy fire. After laying a smokescreen he led a charge that cleared the enemy positions. Tatham-Warter lacked confidence in the Airborne radio equipment and had trained his platoons to use bugle calls; {{it was with the}} charge that Grayburn signalled that the advance could be resumed.|$|E
