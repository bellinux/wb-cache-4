25|$|Resilience in {{children}} refers {{to individuals who}} are doing better than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, {{it is not a}} trait or something that some children simply possess. There is no such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common. Resilience {{is the product of a}} large number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children who experience some sort of risk to continue to develop competently (while other children do not).|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is not the whole story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E

[...] For example, consider the question [...] "How many books does Adam own?" [...] The answer may be [...] "zero" [...] (we know that he owns none) or [...] "null" [...] (we do not know how many he owns).

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "Pixar's ninth {{consecutive}} wonder", {{saying it was}} imaginative yet straightforward. He said it pushed the boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones, and that {{the main difference between}} the film and other science fiction projects rooted in an apocalypse was its optimism. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter declared that WALL-E surpassed the achievements of Pixar's previous eight features and probably their most original film to date. He said it had the [...] "heart, soul, spirit and romance" [...] of the best silent films. Honeycutt said the film's definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger WALL-E's romantic leanings. He praised Burtt's sound design, saying [...] "If there is such a <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aural sleight of hand, this is it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1923, in {{collaboration}} with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though {{at first it was}} a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: [...] "Drivel That They Paid to Hear". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of [...] "relentless cacophony". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as [...] "harmless". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: [...] "The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention." [...] In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, [...] "as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water". Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward. The last was so outraged by the avant-garde nature of Sitwell's verses and the staging, that he marched out ostentatiously during the performance. The players did not like the music: the clarinettist, Charles Draper asked the composer, [...] "Mr Walton, has a clarinet player ever done you an injury?" [...] Nevertheless, the work soon became accepted, and within a decade Walton's music was used for the popular Façade ballet, choreographed by Frederick Ashton.|$|E

Neither of these claims to great antiquity were in fact possible as at both periods there was no such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inheritable coat of arms.
