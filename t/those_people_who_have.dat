25|$|It {{is thought}} that during the hunt only <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been {{selected}} by {{the spirit of the}} sea could kill the whale. The hunter has to please the killed whale: it must be treated as a guest. Just like a polite host does not leave a recently arrived dear guest alone, thus similarly, the killed whale should not be left alone by the host (i.e. by the hunter who has killed it). Like a guest, it should not get hurt or feel sad. It must be entertained (e.g. by drum music, good foods). On the next whale migration (whales migrate twice a year, in spring to the north and in the autumn back), the previously killed whale is sent off back to the sea {{in the course of a}} farewell ritual. If the killed whale was pleased to (during its being a guest for a half year), then it can be hoped that it will return later, too: thus, also the future whale hunts will succeed.|$|E

500|$|Calcium levels {{initially}} {{tend to be}} low, but as {{the situation}} improves calcium is released from where it has precipitated with phosphate, and vitamin D production resumes, leading to hypercalcemia (abnormally high calcium levels).

500|$|Article 6 of the Constitution {{states that}} [...] "The people {{make use of}} state power {{through the agency of}} the National Assembly and the People's Councils, which {{represent}} the will and aspirations of the people, are elected by them and responsible to them".

500|$|But {{where he}} will be missed the most will be among <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been sharers of his bounty. [...] Their name is legion. [...] He gave quietly, but he gave liberally. [...] It was true of him {{that he did not}} let his right hand know what his left hand did. [...] Very {{frequently}} the recipient of his bounty could only guess from whence the gift came. [...] He aided the needy in distress in thousands of ways. [...] He seemed to have some occult way of finding out that people needed assistance at certain times, and then he knew how to come to their aid without offending. [...] Hundreds whom the public would never dream had needed his assistance blessed his name as they gazed upon his features for the last time, because he came to them in a substantial way at a critical time. [...] This is where and by whom he will be missed the most. [...] Truly he was a great man.|$|E

60|$|The {{doctor was}} not a lover of money--and {{he did his best}} to get rid of such pernicious thoughts.

50|$|The Arabic word saiqal means a polisher, and the Sikligar are <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> the {{hereditary}} duty of polishing weapons. Many {{administrators of}} the British Raj, such as H. A.

2500|$|... "Immigrants" [...] are <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> found {{themselves}} in a novel spiritual realm and are trying to adjust themselves to this newfound identity and its community. [...] "Immigrants" [...] can be best understood as those SBNRs who are [...] "trying on" [...] a radically new spiritual environment but have yet to feel completely settled there. It {{is important to note that}} for these SBNRs, although they are hoping to become fully integrated in their newfound spiritual identities, the process of acclimation is difficult and often disconcerting.|$|E
2500|$|... {{foreign workers}} who have owned a green card in eight of the last 15 years and choose to {{relinquish}} it {{will be subject to}} the expatriation tax, which taxes unrealized gains above $600,000, anywhere in the world. However this will only apply to <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a federal tax liability greater than $139,000 a year or have a worth of more than $2 million or have failed to certify to the IRS that they have been in compliance with U.S. federal tax obligations for the past five years.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2008, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman {{completed}} a four-year investigation, described by Equitable's chief executive as the [...] "best chance of compensation". Her 2,819-page report accused the regulators, i.e. the DTI, GAD, and FSA, of [...] "comprehensive failure", found the Government guilty of ten counts of maladminstration, {{and called for}} a compensation scheme [...] "to put <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> suffered a relative loss back into the position that they would have been in, had maladministration not occurred". Equitable's chairman estimated that 30,000 policyholders had already died without receiving compensation. In December, the European Parliament issued a press release describing the regulatory failure as an outrage.|$|E
50|$|The {{seats were}} {{distributed}} among the provinces not upon {{the basis of}} the population but upon {{the basis of the}}ir importance {{in the eyes of the}} government, on the basis of communities, and property was one of the main basis to determine a franchisee. <b>Those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a property, taxable income & paid land revenue of Rs. 3000 were entitled to vote.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1820s, Senkovsky started {{publishing}} {{in the popular}} periodicals of Kondraty Ryleyev and Faddei Bulgarin. He is best remembered for having edited the first Russian [...] "thick journal," [...] Library for Reading (1833-1856), whose lively and humorous style (as Nikolai Gogol put it) attracted to literary journals even <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never held a book in their hands.|$|R

2500|$|Eliot's {{childhood}} {{infatuation with}} literature can be ascribed to several factors. Firstly, {{he had to}} overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double inguinal hernia, he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socializing with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books and was absorbed in tales depicting savages, the Wild West, or Mark Twain's thrill-seeking Tom Sawyer. In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot [...] "would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living." [...] Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: [...] "It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I {{feel that there is}} something in having passed one's childhood beside the big river, which is incommunicable to <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is a {{punishment}} on those Hunkingtons," [...] Miss Clapperclaw remarks: [...] "upon <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been always living beyond their little incomes, and always speculating upon {{what the old}} man would leave them, and always coaxing him with presents which they could not afford, {{and he did not}} want. It is {{a punishment}} upon those Hunkingtons to be so disappointed." ...|$|E
60|$|Since this care is needful to {{the life}} of children, to neglect them is to murder them; again, to give them up to be managed by <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> none of that needful affection placed by nature in them, is to neglect them in the highest degree; nay, in some it goes farther, and is a neglect in order to their being lost; so that 'tis even an {{intentional}} murder, whether the child lives or dies.|$|E
50|$|They did {{not want}} to take direct control of local {{administration}} in villages for several reasons.They {{did not want}} to annoy <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> traditionally enjoyed power and prestige in the village. To keep powerful people happy and collect better revenue, Cornwallis introduced the Permanent Settlement. As per permanent system, rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars, who were supposed to collect the land revenue from the peasants.|$|R

Fascism does not, generally speaking, believe {{in the possibility of}} utility or perpetual peace. It therefore discards pacifism as a cloak for cowardly supine contradistinction to self-sacrifice. War alone keys up all human energies to their maximum tension and sets the seal of nobility on <b>those</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> the courage to face it."—Mussolini ...|$|R
50|$|Brereton's next {{assignment}} {{was back in}} his home county in England; operating in a new position created by an Act of Parliament, he was to manage the county's roads.

He succeeded, and {{when he left the}} post, the Prince of Wales was amongst those signing his testimonial of appreciation.|$|R
