5|$|Lactifluus piperatus forms part of {{an unusual}} and highly {{regarded}} dish in North America, being one of several species parasitized by <b>the</b> <b>lobster</b> mushroom Hypomyces lactifluorum. Once colonized by the parasite, an orange-red crust forms {{over the surface of}} the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as the parasite infiltrates its host's tissues. It is also a common source of food among red squirrels.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once lobster harvesting and cod fishing was reestablished, most fishermen found that <b>the</b> <b>lobster</b> and cod had migrated away from the shores.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lobsters</b> hosted <b>the</b> first match, and Ginepri put the Freedoms {{in front}} early with a 5-2 set win in men's singles. <b>The</b> <b>Lobsters</b> took <b>the</b> women's singles {{by the same}} score to tie the match at 7. Ginepri and Melo {{followed}} by winning the men's doubles set, 5-3, to give the Freedoms a 12-10 lead. But <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> won <b>the</b> women's doubles set by the same score to tie the match at 15, heading to the final set. Melo and Townsend converted two of three break point opportunities while thwarting all five break point opportunities they gave <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> and won <b>the</b> set, 5-2, for a 20-17 victory.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, <b>the</b> reincarnated <b>Lobsters</b> {{presented}} {{themselves as}} a continuation of <b>the</b> original <b>Lobsters</b> that folded after the 1974 season in promotional materials and media guides, since they had paid for that privilege.

5|$|While off the United States East Coast, the {{hurricane}} caused numerous shipping incidents, {{most notably the}} stranding of the Swedish freighter Laponia off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on September 16. Two other boat incidents resulted in two deaths. The hurricane also brought strong winds of tropical storm-force and snow over areas of New England. In Atlantic Canada, a strong storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.3 m) above average sunk or damaged several ships and inundated cities. In New Brunswick, the waves hurt <b>the</b> <b>lobster</b> fishing industry. In Nova Scotia, strong winds disrupted telecommunication and power services. The winds also severely damaged crops. Roughly half of apple production in Annapolis Valley was lost during the storm, resulting in around $1.49 million in economic losses. Strong winds in New Brunswick caused moderate to severe infrastructural damage, and additional damages to crops occurred there. Overall, {{the hurricane}} caused three fatalities, with two off the United States and one in New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{from the}} {{hurricane}} was comparatively less in New Brunswick than in Nova Scotia, {{but was still}} considerable. The rough seas impacted ships offshore the province, disrupting <b>the</b> <b>lobster</b> industry. Two groups of lobster fishermen went missing in the Northumberland Strait; they were later found. Thousands of lobster traps and several wharves were either damaged or destroyed in the strait. Hundreds of boats were set adrift or sunk in the strait as well. Several boats in Rothesay and Westfield were also lost. A man in Dixon Point lost CA$1,000of live lobsters due to the storm. A wharf in Shediac was washed away. Fifty boats were sunk off Cap-Pelé, while in Greville, four scows were destroyed. The rising seawater inundated a bridge crossing the Millstream River under 3ft (0.9m) of water. A bridge crossing the Little River and another bridge in Cocagne were also damaged. Dykes in the Baie Verte area were damaged, resulting in {{thousands of dollars in}} damages. Further inland, winds caused infrastructural and agricultural damage. Winds peaked at 85mph (135km/h) at Lakeburn Airport. The strong winds disrupted power and telecommunication services in Moncton. Streets were blocked by trees blown down by strong winds. Offshore, three yachts were destroyed. A tree fell onto the Gagetown United Church {{as a result of the}} winds, causing considerable damage. Grain and apple crops were also destroyed in Gagetown. In Saint John, chimneys were toppled. Flying debris injured several people, and power outages also greatly affected the city. High waves in conjunction with strong gusts scattered boats in the nearby Saint John River. Tents in the Sussex Military Camp were destroyed. The hurricane's effects resulted in a car accident which injured eight people. Though no fatalities were confirmed in New Brunswick, a person went missing in Bathurst, who was later presumed dead.|$|E

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> {{played their}} 1975 home opener in Boston on May 22, against the New York Sets, {{they were already}} 0-7, having lost three road matches and four neutral-site matches. <b>The</b> <b>Lobsters</b> were dominated, 25-12, by the Sets who were led by Billie Jean King (whom the {{franchise}} had traded to the Sets a few months before) and fell to 0-8. The season opener drew 2,191 fans to the Walter Brown Arena. The following day, <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> played two home matches in Providence. They won the first, 27-17, against the Indiana Loves and lost the second, 27-21, to the Sets as WTT made its debut in Providence in front of 4,317 fans, the largest home crowd <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> would draw all season. <b>The</b> <b>Lobsters</b> continued to struggle and lost their final three matches before WTT took a break for Wimbledon to fall to 6-18.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lobsters</b> hit <b>the</b> {{road the}} {{following}} evening looking to avenge their home loss against the Feeedoms. Hadad and Gambill opened the match with a 5-3 set win in men's doubles. Pelletier followed {{by taking the}} women's singles, 5-2. After the Freedoms won the mixed doubles set, Kops-Jones and Pelletier dominated women's doubles, 5-1, to give <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> an 18-11 lead. Gambill closed out the match by winning a tiebreaker in men's singles that gave <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> a 23-15 victory. In {{the midst of a}} tight playoff race, the split in the season series gave <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> a tiebreaker edge over the Freedoms on the basis of games won in head-to-head meetings, 44-37.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the WTT Draft on March 16, 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> traded <b>the</b> top-ranked American player John Isner to the Springfield Lasers for {{undisclosed}} consideration {{which was}} presumably financial, since no other players or draft choices were moved {{in connection with}} <b>the</b> deal. <b>The</b> <b>Lobsters</b> used <b>the</b> first overall pick in the marquee portion of the draft to select Eugenie Bouchard. In the roster portion of <b>the</b> draft, <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> didn't protect any players from their 2014 roster. They selected Irina Falconi, Scott Lipsky, Chase Buchanan and Arantxa Parra Santonja.

50|$|In January 2008, {{after playing}} their home matches during the {{previous}} three seasons {{on the campus of}} Harvard University, <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> announced plans to move to the North Shore region.

Lobsters owner and CEO Bahar Uttam said a stadium with a seating capacity between 1,500 and 2,000 would be constructed {{on the grounds of the}} club. Uttam said that studies conducted by the team revealed that the North Shore had the highest concentration of tennis players in Greater Boston. <b>The</b> <b>Lobsters</b> had also considered moving to the Bass River Tennis Club, but that club only has indoor courts and scrapped plans to build an outdoor stadium, because management felt the $40,000 rent <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> offered to pay did not justify the projected $300,000 stadium construction costs. While announcing <b>the</b> move, <b>the</b> <b>Lobsters</b> also named Tim Mayotte their new head coach, replacing Anne Smith.|$|R
