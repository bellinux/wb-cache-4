According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea contained the families Lemuridae (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (aye-aye), and <b>Tarsiidae</b> (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, É. Geoffroy first named the suborder Strepsirrhini, {{in which he}} included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared {{the structure of the}} nose and reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used. Since then, primate taxonomy has shifted between Strepsirrhini-Haplorhini and Prosimii-Anthropoidea multiple times.|$|E

The infraorder Simiiformes (simian primates, consisting of monkeys and apes) emerged about 40 mya, possibly also in Asia; if so, they dispersed across the Tethys Sea from Asia to Africa soon afterwards. There are two simian clades, both s: Catarrhini, which developed in Africa, consisting of Old World monkeys, humans and the other apes, and Platyrrhini, which developed in South America, consisting of New World monkeys.

50|$|Afrotarsius is a primate {{found in}} the Paleogene of Africa.The first species to be named, Afrotarsius chatrathi, was named in 1985 {{on the basis of}} a single lower jaw from the Oligocene of Fayum, Egypt, and {{tentatively}} referred to the tarsier family (<b>Tarsiidae).</b> However, this relationship immediately proved controversial, and in 1987 the animal was placed in a separate family Afrotarsiidae related to simians. A tarsier-like tibiofibula was allocated to Afrotarsius in 1998, but the identity of this bone is controversial. In 2010, a second species of the genus, Afrotarsius libycus, was named from the Eocene of Dur At-Talah, Libya, on the basis of isolated upper and lower teeth. Features of these teeth were interpreted as additional evidence for a relationship between Afrotarsius and anthropoids. A second afrotarsiid genus, Afrasia, was named in 2012 from the Eocene Pondaung Formation of Myanmar. In the same paper, Afrotarsiidae was placed together with the Asian Eosimiidae in an infraorder Eosimiiformes, closely related to crown-group simians.

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of the epididymal sperm of Tarsius bancanusis described. The sperm {{possess the}} typical eutherian pattern of a dorsoventrally flattened, ovate sperm head, comprising a nucleus capped by a symmetrical acrosome, and a distinct midpiece and principal piece containing a 9 + 9 + 2 arrangement of outer coarse fibres and microtubules. However, unique features are also present. The overall head length (9 μm) equals the greatest for any primate yet examined, and the subacrosomal space ("perforatorium" or "pseudoperforatorium") tilted at 30 ° to the sagittal {{axis of the}} sperm, is described {{for the first time}} for mammals. The acrosome extends only a short distance beyond the length of the nucleus of the mature sperm, and a significant reduction in the acrosome to nuclei ratio appears to occur during the final stages of sperm maturation. In contrast to earlier predictions based on the spermatid of Tarsius syrhicta, the mature spermatozoa of Tarsiusshows greatest morphological similarity with the sperm of the Anthropoidea, which have a short symmetrical acrosome, than with the Strepsirhini, which have a relatively long acrosome that can be either symmetrical (Lemuriformes) or asymetrical (Lorisiformes). Four proposed phylogenies of the Primates are assessed using comparative sperm ultrastructure. Placing the <b>Tarsiidae</b> as a sister group to the Lorisidae appears the least likely. The sperm data are consistent with the <b>Tarsiidae</b> being a sister group to the Anthropoidea, to the Strepsirhini, or even to the extant primate groups as a whole.

40|$|Three new {{specimens}} {{reported here}} are referable to the Omomyidae and Lorisidae, and represent {{only the second}} and third prosimian primates found in the Oligocene rocks of the Fayum, Egypt. The Fayum omomyid extends the range of the Omomyidae into Africa, while the Fayum lorisid is the oldest record of the Lorisidae world-wide. Afrotarsius established ?<b>Tarsiidae</b> as a third prosimian family present in Oligocene rocks of the Fayum region of Egypt (Simons 2 ̆ 6 Bown, 1985). These new occurrences significantly reorient paleogeographic study of primate origins. In a fauna famed for the presence of about a thousand specimens of early Anthropoidea-viz. Apidium, Parapithecus, Qatrania, Propliopithecus, Oligopithecus, and Aegyptopithecus, the three prosimian families are documented to date from only four specimens.

40|$|Leaping {{primates}} are specialized for hindlimb-propelled locomotion within arboreal habitats. As a group, {{they include}} members of Galagonidae, Lemuriformes and <b>Tarsiidae.</b> Postcranial characters analysed here include humeral and femoral diaphyseal rigidity, articular surface areas and lengths. Data for leaper taxa are compared with corresponding data for less specialized small primates. The more generalized comparative primates include both closely related prosimians and distantly related platyr-rhines (New World monkeys). In addition, the leapers are subdivided for further analysis according to body size and taxonomic association. Questions addressed concern the identi®cation of functionally and/ or phylogenetically linked traits in leaper postcrania. Results indicate that leapers {{as a group}} have relatively higher femoral diaphyseal rigidity and longer femora than do more generalized primates. These traits are also present in Pithecia pithecia, a platyrrhine leaper included for comparison. These enhanced properties probably function in resisting large hindlimb forces incurred during leaping, and in producing longer, more ef®cient leaps.

40|$|As {{the closest}} living sister group of anthropoids, tarsiers (Family <b>Tarsiidae)</b> are an {{important}} group in primate evolution. However, their fossil record is poor: only four species have been described, two from the Eocene of China and two from the Miocene of Thailand. All are from outside {{the range of the}} living species, which occur only on islands off Southeast Asia. Here, we describe a new fossil tarsier from Pakistan, a significant range extension. This record consists of two lower molars, an upper molar, and a lower premolar found in the Miocene Manchar Formation (~ 18 - 16 Ma [millions of years ago]) of Sindh Province, southern Pakistan. The Pakistani tarsier is morphologically distinct from all living and fossil tarsiers, but most similar to the middle Miocene Thai species Tarsius thailandicus. Though living tarsiers have traditionally been classified in a single genus, a recent revision proposed a division into three genera, which is strongly supported by molecular data. The Pakistani species is not referable to any of these genera, and we create for it and T. thailandicus a new tarsiid genus. This discovery broadens our understanding of the geographic range and morphological diversity of Miocene tarsiers and helps to put the living tarsiers into their evolutionary context. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The first third (ca. 1200 bp) of exon 1 of {{the nuclear}} gene {{encoding}} the interstitial retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) has been sequenced for 12 representative primates belonging to Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes, Tarsiiformes, Platyrrhini, and Catarrhini, and combined with available data (13 other primates, 11 nonprimate placentals, and 2 marsupials). Phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood on nucleotides and amino acids robustly support the monophyly of primates, Strepsirrhini, Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes, Anthropoidea, Catarrhini, and Platyrrhini. It {{is interesting to note}} that 1) <b>Tarsiidae</b> grouped with Anthropoidea, and the support for this node depends on the molecular characters considered; 2) Cheirogaleidae grouped within Lemuriformes; and 3) Daubentonia was the sister group of all other Lemuriformes. Study of the IRBP evolutionary rate shows a high heterogeneity within placentals and also within primates. Maximum likelihood local molecular clocks were assigned to three clades displaying significantly contrasted evolutionary rates. Paenungulata were shown to evolve 2. 5 - 3 times faster than Perissodactyla and Lemuriformes. Six independent calibration points were used to estimate splitting ages of the main primate clades, and their compatibility was evaluated. Divergence ages were obtained for the following crown groups: 13. 8 - 14. 2 MY for Lorisiformes, 26. 5 - 27. 2 MY for Lemuroidea, 39. 6 - 40. 7 MY for Lemuriformes, 45. 4 - 46. 7 MY for Strepsirrhini, and 56. 7 - 58. 4 MY for Haplorrhini. The incompatibility between some paleontological and molecular estimates may reflect the incompleteness of the placental fossil record, and/or indicate that the variable IRBP evolutionary rates are not fully accommodated by local molecular clocks.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1988 Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a resurgence of}} interest in the functional morphology and ecology of the prosimian primates. Napier and Walker's (1967) vertical clinging and leaping hypothesis focused interest on the presence of saltatory adaptations in the hindlimb of certain prosimians. This dissertation presents a functional analysis of locomotor and postural adaptations in the hindlimb of leaping and quadrupedal prosimians designed to test morphological aspects of the vertical clinging and leaping hypothesis. Osteological measurements were taken on the pelvis, femur, and tarsus of a total of 277 post-cranial skeletons representing 8 families and 16 genera. Lengths of the long bones and the skeletal trunk length (Biegert and Maurer 1972) were also collected for each specimen; the former were used in studies of overall limb proportions and skeletal allometry, and the latter was used as an estimator of bodily size. A series of ratios was calculated for the pelvic, femoral, tarsal, and limb proportion data, and multiple discriminant function analysis was utilized in the analysis of pelvic and femoral data. Regression analysis was used to study allometric patterns in forelimb and especially hindlimb length. My results indicate the presence of two very different morphological patterns in the hindlimb of extant prosimian leapers. Galagidae and <b>Tarsiidae</b> are linked by the possession of a series of specialized traits in the pelvis, proximal femur, and especially, by an elongate tarsus. The hindlimb among Indriidae and Lepilemuridae, along with that of other "hindlimb-dominant" Lemuriformes, demonstrates a very different gestalt. These different patterns can be seen in both bivariate and multivariate analyses, and in allometric investigations. The functional and biomechanical significance of hindlimb traits of leaping prosimians is discussed, along with the implications of these results for the vertical clinging and leaping hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{combination}} of methods that (i) portrays quantitative {{characteristics of a}} DNA sequence as an image, (ii) computes distances between these images, and (iii) uses these distances to output a map wherein each sequence is a point in a common Euclidean space. In the resulting "Molecular Distance Map" each point signifies a DNA sequence, and the geometric distance between any two points reflects the degree of relatedness between the corresponding sequences and species. Molecular Distance Maps present compelling visual representations of relationships between species and {{could be used for}} taxonomic clarifications, for species identification, and for studies of evolutionary history. One of the advantages of this method is its general applicability since, as sequence alignment is not required, the DNA sequences chosen for comparison can be completely different regions in different genomes. In fact, this method can be used to compare any two DNA sequences. For example, in our dataset of 3, 176 mitochondrial DNA sequences, it correctly finds the mtDNA sequences most closely related to that of the anatomically modern human (the Neanderthal, the Denisovan, and the chimp), and it finds that the sequence most different from it belongs to a cucumber. Furthermore, our method can be used to compare real sequences to artificial, computer-generated, DNA sequences. For example, it is used to determine that the distances between a Homo sapiens sapiens mtDNA and artificial sequences of the same length and same trinucleotide frequencies can be larger than the distance between the same human mtDNA and the mtDNA of a fruit-fly. We demonstrate this method's promising potential for taxonomical clarifications by applying it to a diverse variety of cases that have been historically controversial, such as the genus Polypterus, the family <b>Tarsiidae,</b> and the vast (super) kingdom Protista.

40|$|The {{function}} of {{the central nervous system}} cannot be understood from inspection of a single region, for each cell and fiber has discrete connections. Therefore, a study of the nervous system requires distinct approaches. One fundamental approach has been the study of comparative neuroanatomy. In a comparative study of the evolution of the primates and subsequently man, the investigator is confronted with a variety of animal forms. Each form represents an end product of a long vertical line of evolutionary development. The problem is to try to reconstruct the vertical line (ancestral forms) from the horizontal end products (extant forms). The order Primates has two suborders: (1) the Prosimii - composed of six families - Tupaiidae, Lemuridae, Indriidae, Daubentoniidae, Lorisidae, and <b>Tarsiidae</b> and (2) the Anthropoidea - also composed of six families including the Old and New World monkeys, the great apes and man. One group of the suborder Prosimii is the family Lorisidae. The living members of the family are represented by the lorises of India and Southeast Asia and the galagoes and pottos of Africa. Characters these animals share with the higher anthropoid primates are seen in the osteology of the middle ear and the medial wall of the orbit (Le Gros Clark, 1959). They also have orbits encircled by bone, three kinds of teeth, a well developed caecum, true nails and a pseudo-opposable thumb. In habit, these animals are omnivorous, nocturnal and arboreal. In progression, the lorisoids are less tied to the quadrupedalism of many lemurs (Osman Hill, 1953). The lorises have a slow deliberate mode of hand-over-hand locomotion, their limbs are subequal in length. In contrast, the galagos locomote by a rapid, saltatory behavior and have pelvic limbs much longer than pectoral limbs. Both of these means of progression effect an orthograde (erect or semi-erect) posture of the trunk and a tendency for a different mode of balancing the head on the spine. Some authors regard the vertical clinging and leaping of galagos as the earliest locomotor specialization of primates (Napier and Walker, 1967; Napier, 1967). From the post-cranial osteology of early Miocene Lorisidae (Walker, 1970) and from a comparative osteological, behavioral and paleontological study (Napier and Walker, 1967), it appears that this locomotor pattern was present in early Eocene and subsequent Miocene prosimians. These authors conclude that vertical clinging and leaping is the earliest known primate locomotor specialization and preadaptive to some or possibly all subsequent patterns of primate progression—quadrupedalism, brachiation and bipedalism. Although comparative neuroanatomical investigations have utilized the anthropoid primates, (mainly Macaca) rodents and carnivores (chiefly the cat), the prosimian primates have been relatively ignored. Yet their locomotor behavior and their propensity toward bipedalism make them an interesting model for a study of central nervous pathways related to locomotion...|$|E
