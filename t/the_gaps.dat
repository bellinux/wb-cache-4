5|$|General Mack {{thought that}} Austrian {{security}} relied on sealing off <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> through the mountainous Black Forest area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars.

Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centerpiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.|$|E

5|$|Henry's wealth {{allowed him}} to {{maintain}} what was probably the largest curia regis, or royal court, in Europe. His court attracted huge attention from contemporary chroniclers, and typically comprised {{a number of major}} nobles and bishops, along with knights, domestic servants, prostitutes, clerks, horses and hunting dogs. Within the court were his officials, ministeriales, his friends, amici, and the familiares regis, the king's informal inner circle of confidants and trusted servants. Henry's familiares were particularly important to the operation of his household and government, driving government initiatives and filling <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> between the official structures and the king.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Colonel F. O. Chilton's 2/2nd Infantry Battalion {{found that}} it was best to keep skirmishing forward {{throughout}} this advance, because going to ground {{for any length of time}} meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties. The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion.

40|$|The {{breakdown}} of <b>the</b> air <b>gaps</b> {{is of great}} importance for the high voltage applications. One of the most determinant factors of the dielelectric strength of <b>the</b> air <b>gaps</b> is <b>the</b> field strength distribution in <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> <b>The</b> corona space charges in <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> influence <b>the</b> distribution of the field strongly, and the breakdown voltage of <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> In <b>the</b> present paper the arrangements of a rod-plate air gap {{with or without a}} barrier for the two different cases with the rod or the plate grounded are experimentally investigated and analyzed, using the Finite Element Method. Values of the field strength in <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> when stressed by the breakdown voltage, are recorded and analyzed. The results show that the distribution of the field along the axis of <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> is strongly affected by the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> and especially by the grounded electrode (Ground Effect). The values of the breakdown voltage depend on the maximum value of the field strength in <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> and <b>the</b> value of the corona leakage current through <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> A charged barrier between the electrodes influences the distribution of the field significantly as well as the breakdown voltage...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>gap</b> {{has been}} a major {{thoroughfare}} between the Piedmont and the Shenandoah Valley since before the European colonization of the area. Native Americans originally cut a trail through <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> that continued to be used by white settlers. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> was known as Williams' <b>Gap</b> until <b>the</b> early 1780s, when the modern name began to be used. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> derived its name from Edward Snickers, who owned <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> and surrounding land and operated a ferry across the Shenandoah River on the western side of <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> By <b>the</b> late 18th century the Snickersville Turnpike and <b>the</b> Snickers <b>Gap</b> Turnpike were completed, and Snickers <b>Gap</b> became <b>the</b> main thoroughfare between Loudoun County and the Shenandoah, bypassing Keyes Gap, which to that point had been the preferred route. The two turnpikes joined at Snickersville (present-day Bluemont) and then proceeded over <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to Winchester. <b>The</b> toll at <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> persisted well into the 20th century. <b>The</b> Snickers <b>Gap</b> turnpike was eventually made into Virginia State Route 7, and the toll was dropped. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> was <b>the</b> scene of many small American Civil War skirmishes, and part of the Battle of Cool Spring (sometimes referred to as the [...] "Battle of Snicker's Gap") took place there.|$|R

5|$|Adler's memoirs were {{published}} in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture of his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture of his time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin.
