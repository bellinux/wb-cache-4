5|$|Liverpool {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{supported}} clubs in Europe. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200officially recognised Club of the LFC Official Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly and Reclaim The Kop. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.|$|E

5|$|The {{title of}} the film, Thiruvilaiyadal, is {{justified}} {{in the beginning of}} the film as a voiceover. It begins with salutation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> and it quotes the literary epic of Shiva, Thiruvilaiyadal. The narrator briefs that whatever Shiva does, it is to test the patiece of his disciples and the god plays games which invokes more devotion in the minds of his worshippers. Hence the title symbolically means the games played by Shiva. By opening in media res, the film follows a nonlinear narrative. According to Hari Narayan of The Hindu, Thiruvilaiyadal valorises the deeds of a god (Shiva) by narrating some miracles performed by him.|$|E

After a poor start, with a sole point in an entire championship, Napoli was readmitted to Serie A's forerunner, the Divizione Nazionale, by the Italian Football Federation ("FIGC"), and began to improve thanks in part to Paraguayan-born Attila Sallustro, who was the first fully fledged hero <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans.</b> He was a capable goal-scorer and eventually set the all-time goal-scoring record for Napoli, which was later bested by players like Diego Maradona and Marek Hamšík.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that the reason he rallied them to voice their support before the show was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is no going back. He praised Netflix for their support while making the show, and thanked the fans for putting up a great fight to keep it alive. On June 10, 2017, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, explicitly commented the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the NHL's {{collective}} bargaining agreement (CBA) expiring in September, teams reassigned players on two-way or entry-level contracts to minor league affiliates. The Canucks assigned 27 players, including Christopher Tanev, Eddie Lack, Zack Kassian and 2012 second-round draft pick Alexandre Mallet to the Chicago Wolves, while first round pick Brendan Gaunce was sent to his junior team, the Belleville Bulls. When the CBA expired on September 15, the NHL enforced a lockout until a new agreement could be reached. Canucks management posted {{a message from the}} team <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> stating that they would continue with community initiatives throughout the lockout, which they hoped would be resolved as soon as possible, and thanked fans for their loyalty and patience. They also reduced their employees work week to four days and instituted a 20% pay reduction.|$|E

50|$|Another {{method of}} {{reducing}} <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> speed is {{by moving the}} 5 V wire in the classical Molex power connector {{in the place of}} the Ground wire going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan,</b> thereby delivering +7 V (12 V − 5 V = 7 V) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b> However, this is a potentially risky method, because +5 V PSU line is intended to source current only, not sink it, so the PSU is likely to get damaged in case of load on 5 V PSU line being below the load generated by 7 V fans (e.g. when PC enters idle/sleep state). Also, the components inside the computer using +5 V power might be exposed to over 5 V in case of a short circuit in <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|R

5|$|Soon afterward, however, McCarthy leaves Homer {{for another}} client. Without McCarthy {{to keep him}} in shape, Homer starts eating again and gains all the weight back. Homer can no longer fit into his costume or even his trailer, and the movie begins to go over budget. The studio {{executives}} and Comic Book Guy worry that the film will not be successful. The final version of the movie features scenes with the fat Homer and the physically fit Homer merged, upsetting and confusing the audience. After the premiere of the film, McCarthy returns and offers to get Homer into shape again, which Homer accepts. The studio executives offer to let Comic Book Guy direct the sequel, on the condition that Comic Book Guy lie <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> and say he liked the film. Though pleased by the offer, Comic Book Guy rejects it and openly criticizes the movie online, and thus it becomes a box office failure and Everyman is never adapted again.|$|E
5|$|The club's home kit {{has always}} {{consisted}} of a black-and-white vertically striped shirt, with black shorts and white or black socks. The width of {{the black and white}} stripes has varied from season to season, as has the colour of the shirt numbers, which have usually been red, black, white or yellow. Atlético's traditional away kit is all-white shirts, shorts and socks, but has had slight variations. An all-black third kit was introduced in the 2000 season, being used again in 2015. In 2008, a black-and-gold vertically striped third kit was launched to commemorate the club's centenary, featuring the first crest. Squad number 12 is retired from the club's kits, dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E
