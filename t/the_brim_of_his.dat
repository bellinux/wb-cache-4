25|$|He {{wore the}} collar of his dark-blue {{overcoat}} turned up and <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat pulled down.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Edward Dane {{shook his}} head. He was {{fingering}} <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Happy to know you, sir.' Mr Folair touched <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{hat with}} his forefinger, and then shook hands. 'A recruit, sir, I understand?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Buck Mulligan at {{once put}} on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had {{suddenly}} withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll's head to and fro, <b>the</b> <b>brims</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: ...|$|R
60|$|I bowed. Sir Thomas stood very stiffly, {{looking at}} me {{severely}} from under <b>the</b> broad <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat.|$|R
500|$|He kept a {{reputation}} as an [...] "unusually tall, robust" [...] man throughout his life, with an adult height of about [...] Measurements taken from his uniform show that at his death he had a waist size of [...] and <b>the</b> inside <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat measured [...] in circumference. Though Brock was noted as a handsome man who enjoyed the company of women, he never married.|$|R
60|$|Thorne {{leaned against}} the side of the wagon, though she noticed that he first pulled <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soft hat lower down over his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, everything." [...] She stopped, {{and leaning}} forward, {{suddenly}} caught <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soft felt hat, and drawing it down smartly over his audacious eyes, said, [...] "Everything BUT THAT." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, mum," [...] said he, {{touching}} <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{wreck of}} a hat, [...] "measter seed ye coming. He sent {{to say as}} 'ow 'e were in the five-acre lot." ...|$|E
60|$|Startled, Levasseur and his {{officers}} {{looked up and}} round. On {{the crest of the}} dunes behind them, in sharp silhouette against the deep cobalt of the sky, they beheld a tall, lean figure scrupulously dressed in black with silver lace, a crimson ostrich plume curled about <b>the</b> broad <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat affording <b>the</b> only touch of colour. Under that hat was the tawny face of Captain Blood.|$|R
60|$|Martin-Roget threw a quick, {{suspicious}} glance on his companion. Darkness and <b>the</b> broad <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sugar-loaf hat effectually concealed {{even the}} outlines of Chauvelin's face, and Martin-Roget fell to musing over one or two things which Carrier had blurted out awhile ago. The whole of France was overrun with spies these days--every one was under suspicion, every one {{had to be on}} his guard. Every word was overheard, every glance seen, every sign noted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I have an {{hour before}} me," [...] said Grant, and without another word threw up the window and jumped out into the garden. He did not walk {{straight}} up {{to the doctor and}} lunatic, but strolling round the garden path drew near them cautiously and yet apparently carelessly. He stood a couple of feet off them, seemingly counting halfpence out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> trousers pocket, but, as I could see, looking up steadily under <b>the</b> broad <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat.|$|R
60|$|He was a tall, slender {{young man}} with a light brown moustache. Imminent little drops of rain hung at <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat and the collar of his jacket-coat was turned up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'For vich reasons,' {{continued}} Sam, plucking nervously at <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat--'for vich reasons, he's drawn it out to-day, {{and come}} here vith me to say, leastvays to offer, {{or in other}} vords--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, child," [...] said Eustace, pulling <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cap {{over his}} eyes, as if {{preparing}} for a nap. [...] "I can tell you a dozen, as good or better, if I choose." ...|$|E
60|$|She was now attired {{in a long}} dress, almost but {{not quite}} an evening gown, that became her well; but Leland was {{blackened}} all over, {{and there were many}} singed holes in his clothes, wet and smeared with ashes, and part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wide <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat was missing. The men seemed to notice the contrast between the pair, and there was a little good-humoured laughter. Carrie Leland smiled at them in turn, though she would have borne herself very differently to these rough men a few months ago.|$|R
60|$|Gaining {{the bank}} of the river at last, he soon came up to the fisher, who was of sturdy build, though {{somewhat}} frail from age, and dressed in brown tweed garments, with a dirty white wideawake, the crown of which was richly decorated with casting-lines and hooks, ranging from small brown hackle to salmon-fly. But the striking thing about him was that his whole person was soaking wet. Water dripped from the pockets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shooting coat, dribbled from <b>the</b> battered <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wideawake, and, flowing from his straightened locks, trickled off the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Roman nose.|$|R
60|$|Again Mr. Dennant's eyebrows quivered as if {{they had}} been tweaked; he had been found out, and he disliked it. The colour in his face had died away; it was calm, wrinkled, dead-looking under <b>the</b> flattened, narrow <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> black hat; his grey {{moustache}} drooped thinly; the crow's-feet hardened round his eyes; his nostrils were distended by the queerest smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me I am the proper judge, on each side," [...] Mr. Brand declared. He got up, holding <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat against his mouth and staring at Felix through the dusk.|$|E
60|$|Stiffening slightly, Mrs. Tucker turned inquiringly to Mr. Patterson. But that gentleman's usual {{profound}} melancholy {{appeared to}} be intensified by the hilarity of his companion. He only sighed deeply and rubbed his leg with <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat in gloomy abstraction.|$|E
60|$|As Buckley swung along {{upon the}} trail {{he felt the}} {{beginning}} of the suffocating constriction about his throat, the cold sweat under <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat, the old, shameful, dreaded sinking of his heart as it went down, down, down in his bosom.|$|E
6000|$|... "I met Supplehough," [...] he continued, [...] "plodding {{through the}} mud this wet night, going to preach at Milldean {{opposition}} shop. As I told you, I heard Barraclough bellowing {{in the midst of}} a conventicle like a possessed bull; and I find you, gentlemen, tarrying over your half-pint of muddy port wine, and scolding like angry old women. No wonder Supplehough should have dipped sixteen adult converts in a day--which he did a fortnight since; no wonder Barraclough, scamp and hypocrite as he is, should attract all the weaver-girls in their flowers and ribbons, to witness how much harder are his knuckles than <b>the</b> wooden <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tub; as little wonder that you, when you are left to yourselves, without your rectors--myself, and Hall, and Boultby--to back you, should too often perform the holy service of our church to bare walls, and read your bit of a dry discourse to the clerk, and the organist, and the beadle. But enough of the subject. I came to see Malone.--I have an errand unto thee, O captain!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} not very {{unreasonable}} to suspect from what had already passed, that Mr Swiveller {{was not quite}} recovered {{from the effects of}} the powerful sunlight to which he had made allusion; but if no such suspicion had been awakened by his speech, his wiry hair, dull eyes, and sallow face would still have been strong witnesses against him. His attire was not, as he had himself hinted, remarkable for the nicest arrangement, but {{was in a state of}} disorder which strongly induced the idea that he had gone to bed in it. It consisted of a brown body-coat with a great many brass buttons up the front and only one behind, a bright check neckerchief, a plaid waistcoat, soiled white trousers, and a very limp hat, worn with the wrong side foremost, to hide a hole in <b>the</b> <b>brim.</b> <b>The</b> breast <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat was ornamented with an outside pocket from which there peeped forth the cleanest end of a very large and very ill-favoured handkerchief; his dirty wristbands were pulled on as far as possible and ostentatiously folded back over his cuffs; he displayed no gloves, and carried a yellow cane having at the top a bone hand with the semblance of a ring on its little finger and a black ball in its grasp. With all these personal advantages (to which may be added a strong savour of tobacco-smoke, and a prevailing greasiness of appearance) Mr Swiveller leant back in his chair with his eyes fixed on the ceiling, and occasionally pitching his voice to the needful key, obliged the company with a few bars of an intensely dismal air, and then, in the middle of a note, relapsed into his former silence.|$|R
60|$|This {{might have}} been less or more than the truth. Mrs. Gould, {{accompanying}} her husband all over the province {{in the search for}} labour, had seen the land with a deeper glance than a trueborn Costaguanera could have done. In her travel-worn riding habit, her face powdered white like a plaster cast, with a further protection of a small silk mask during the heat of the day, she rode on a well-shaped, light-footed pony in the centre of a little cavalcade. Two mozos de campo, picturesque in great hats, with spurred bare heels, in white embroidered calzoneras, leather jackets and striped ponchos, rode ahead with carbines across their shoulders, swaying in unison to the pace of the horses. A tropilla of pack mules brought up the rear in charge of a thin brown muleteer, sitting his long-eared beast very near the tail, legs thrust far forward, <b>the</b> wide <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat set far back, making a sort <b>of</b> halo for <b>his</b> head. An old Costaguana officer, a retired senior major of humble origin, but patronized by the first families on account <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Blanco opinions, had been recommended by Don Jose for commissary and organizer of that expedition. The points <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grey moustache hung far below his chin, and, riding on Mrs. Gould's left hand, he looked about with kindly eyes, pointing out the features of the country, telling the names of the little pueblos and of the estates, of the smooth-walled haciendas like long fortresses crowning the knolls above the level of the Sulaco Valley. It unrolled itself, with green young crops, plains, woodland, and gleams of water, park-like, from the blue vapour of the distant sierra to an immense quivering horizon of grass and sky, where big white clouds seemed to fall slowly into the darkness of their own shadows.|$|R
60|$|My {{first look}} was at Romayne. He {{took off his}} hat, {{and handed it to}} me with a smile. His adversary's bullet had cut a piece out of <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat, on the right side. He had {{literally}} escaped by a hair-breadth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'More like forty,' {{broke in}} an old milkman near, in a long white pinafore or 'wropper,' and with <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat tied down, so that {{he looked like a}} woman. ''A was born before our Great Weir was builded, and I hadn't man's wages when I laved water there.' ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{not gone}} a mile when he saw walking before him a clergyman whose form, after consideration, he recognized, {{in spite of a}} novel {{whiteness}} in that part of his hair that showed below <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat. Swithin walked much faster than this gentleman, and soon was at his side.|$|E
60|$|Within {{the antique}} frame which so {{recently}} had enclosed a sable waste of canvas now appeared a visible picture-still dark, indeed, in its hues and shadings, but thrown forward in strong relief. It was a half-length {{figure of a}} gentleman in a rich but very old-fashioned dress of embroidered velvet, with a broad ruff and a beard, and wearing a hat <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> which overshadowed <b>his</b> forehead. Beneath this cloud the eyes had a peculiar glare which was almost lifelike. The whole portrait started so distinctly out of the background that it {{had the effect of}} a person looking down from the wall at the astonished and awe-stricken spectators. The expression of the face, if any words can convey an idea of it, was that of a wretch detected in some hideous guilt and exposed to the bitter hatred and laughter and withering scorn of a vast surrounding multitude. There was the struggle of defiance, beaten down and overwhelmed by the crushing weight of ignominy. The torture of the soul had come forth upon the countenance. It seemed as if the picture, while hidden behind the cloud of immemorial years, had been all the time acquiring an intenser depth and darkness of expression, till now it gloomed forth again and threw its evil omen over the present hour. Such, if the wild legend may be credited, was the portrait of Edward Randolph as he appeared when a people's curse had wrought its influence upon his nature.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vase above. The {{layers of}} glass {{that form the}} vase can be seen.|$|R
6000|$|A strange unaccountable thrill {{ran through}} the boy's frame. He stooped, looked under <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hat, and beheld his father! ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} so entirely unexpected and so thoroughly startling in {{this mode of}} salutation in so peaceful a place, that Ralph leaped two or three feet in his fright, {{and at the same}} time saw the hole in <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat, which showed how near the deadly missile had come to him.|$|E
60|$|The elegant {{figure of}} Webster {{interrupted}} his reverie. Sam {{had never seen}} Webster before, and it was with no pleasure that he saw him now. He had come to regard this lane as his own private property, and he resented trespassers. He tucked his legs under him, and scowled at Webster under <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you once}} more for--for {{understanding}} me," [...] {{she went on}} warmly. He interrupted her with a certain effect of roughness. I didn't like him speaking to this frank creature so much from under <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat, as it were. And he produced a faint, rasping voice quite {{like a man with}} a parched throat.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} it, my lord. Full to <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> themselves, for that reason, the Tapparians are the emptiest of mortals." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, leaving herself in his hands. He went over <b>the</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> declivity {{and began to}} climb down.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> her linen hat {{kept the}} sun from her face, but {{her head was}} {{drooping}} like a flower's head at noon.|$|R
