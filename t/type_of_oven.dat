2500|$|The {{simplifications}} of consonant clusters {{are done}} selectively; bookish-style words and proper nouns are typically pronounced with all consonants {{even if they}} fit the pattern. For example, the word [...] is pronounced in a simplified manner [...] for the meaning of 'Dutch oven' (a popular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>oven</b> in Russia) and in a full form [...] for 'Dutch woman' (a more exotic meaning).|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the dough}} was placed {{directly}} on the heated stones of a cooking fire or in a griddle or pan made of clay or iron (...) [...] In {{the time of the}} First Temple, two types of oven were used for baking bread: the jar oven and the pit-oven. The jar-oven was a large pottery container, narrowing into an opening toward the top; fuel was burned on the inside to heat it and the dough was pressed against the outside to bake. The pit-oven was a clay-lined excavation in the ground in which the fuel was burned and then pushed aside, and the loaves were baked on the heated surface. People also began placing a convex dome, initially earthenware and later metal, over the pit-oven and cooking the flatbreads on the dome instead of on the ash-covered surface; this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>oven</b> is probably what was meant by the biblical machabat, often translated as “griddle”.|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} one day, Rabbi Eliezer {{employed}} every imaginable {{argument for the}} proposition that a particular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>oven</b> was not susceptible to ritual impurity, but the Sages did not accept his arguments. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, then let this carob tree prove it," [...] and the carob tree moved 100 cubits (and others say 400 cubits) out of its place. But the Sages said that no proof can be brought from a carob tree. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let this stream of water prove it," [...] and the stream of water flowed backwards. But the Sages said that no proof can be brought from a stream of water. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let the walls of this house of study prove it," [...] and the walls leaned over as if to fall. But Rabbi Joshua rebuked the walls, telling them not to interfere with scholars engaged in a halachic dispute. In honor of Rabbi Joshua, the walls did not fall, but in honor of Rabbi Eliezer, the walls did not stand upright, either. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let Heaven prove it," [...] and a Heavenly Voice cried out: [...] "Why do you dispute with Rabbi Eliezer, for in all matters the halachah agrees with him!" [...] But Rabbi Joshua rose and exclaimed {{in the words of}} [...] "It is not in heaven." [...] Rabbi Jeremiah explained that God had given the Torah at Mount Sinai; Jews pay no attention to Heavenly Voices, for God wrote in [...] "After the majority must one incline." [...] Later, Rabbi Nathan met Elijah and asked him what God did when Rabbi Joshua rose in opposition to the Heavenly Voice. Elijah replied that God laughed with joy, saying, [...] "My children have defeated Me, My children have defeated Me!" ...|$|E

Different cuisines will use different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>ovens.</b> For example, Indian culture uses a tandoor oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature. Western kitchens use variable temperature convection ovens, conventional ovens, toaster ovens, or non-radiant heat ovens like the microwave oven. Classic Italian cuisine includes the use <b>of</b> a brick <b>oven</b> containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, gas, electric, or oil-fired.|$|R

50|$|The {{fourth step}} is the baking process. Also known as “pastry lift” or “dough lift,” the dough expands as water is {{converted}} to steam, thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer.
