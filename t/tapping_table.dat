60|$|The {{housekeeper}} {{looked up}} from the menu she was writing, and <b>tapped</b> the <b>table</b> impatiently with her pencil.|$|R
60|$|The pen {{with which}} she had been <b>tapping</b> the <b>table</b> was {{suddenly}} motionless. She turned a little farther around.|$|R

60|$|The two {{men were}} alone. Hardaway, who had not taken a seat, {{deliberately}} drew off his glove, and <b>tapped</b> the <b>table</b> with his fingertips.|$|R
60|$|Fledgeby again {{made his}} small eyes smaller, as he glanced with great {{complacency}} at Twemlow, who was timorously <b>tapping</b> the <b>table</b> with a folded letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{will not}} do, Ratcliffe," [...] said the procurator; [...] "you must speak out--out--out," [...] <b>tapping</b> the <b>table</b> emphatically, as he {{repeated}} that impressive monosyllable.|$|R
60|$|He <b>tapped</b> the <b>table</b> {{with his}} fingers, restlessly. A new hope was forming in his brain. This, indeed, {{might be the}} end of all his troubles.|$|R
60|$|As many {{of those}} present knew each other, there was a {{considerable}} buzz and talk in the room, until Captain Tempe <b>tapped</b> the <b>table</b> for silence, and then rose to speak.|$|R
6000|$|... “It all fits in!” cried Doctor Clay, {{drawing a}} deep sigh. He <b>tapped</b> the <b>table</b> with {{the tips of}} his fingers. “I wonder where it will end?” he mused, half to himself.|$|R
60|$|Isobel {{interrupted}} the discussion with an imperative little <b>tap</b> upon the <b>table.</b>|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a general}} giggle, and again Miss Fosbrook was as bad as any: while David, looking affronted, <b>tapped</b> the <b>table</b> with the handle of his spoon, and repeated, [...] "I want to know." ...|$|R
60|$|Selingman <b>tapped</b> on the <b>table</b> {{in front}} of him with his pudgy forefinger.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, come!' {{said the}} person of the house, <b>tapping</b> the <b>table</b> near her in a business-like manner, and shaking her head and her chin; 'you know what you've got to do. Put down your money this instant.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{feel that}} I {{know the truth}} about {{anything}} till I've read them both!" [...] said Mrs. Plumer brightly, <b>tapping</b> the <b>table</b> of contents with her bare red hand, upon which the ring looked so incongruous.|$|R
50|$|If the two K*bots have locked {{together}} {{and are not}} moving, after 45 seconds the referee can <b>tap</b> the <b>table</b> by lifting and dropping {{each end of the}} competition table in sequence, until the K*bots start moving again.|$|R
6000|$|... "The rubber {{will never}} be begun {{if you go on}} talking {{nonsense}} much longer," [...] Lady Peggy declared, <b>tapping</b> the <b>table</b> impatiently. [...] "I believe I hear the motors outside. We shall have the whole crowd here directly." ...|$|R
60|$|The man in {{the chair}} took no notice. There was a {{retrospective}} light in his dark eyes. He <b>tapped</b> upon the <b>table</b> again with his skinny forefinger.|$|R
5000|$|A player may fold by {{surrendering}} one's cards. (Some games {{may have}} specific rules regarding how to fold: {{for example in}} stud poker one must turn one's upcards face down.) A player may check by <b>tapping</b> the <b>table</b> or making any similar motion. All other bets are made by placing chips {{in front of the}} player, but not directly into the pot ("splashing the pot" [...] prevents other players from verifying the bet amount).|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} emptied {{his glass}} and pushed it away from him. He looked down for a little, and then, leaning over the <b>table,</b> <b>tapped</b> Will three times upon the forearm with a single finger. 'The time has come!' he said solemnly.|$|R
6000|$|Major Pendennis {{returned}} thanks {{with the}} utmost gravity and {{in a speech in}} which he used the words, 'the present occasion,' at least the proper number of times. Pen cheered with his feeble voice from his armchair. Warrington taught Miss Laura to cry [...] "Hear! hear!" [...] and <b>tapped</b> the <b>table</b> with his knuckles. Pidgeon the attendant grinned, and honest Doctor Goodenough found the party so merrily engaged, when he came in to pay his faithful gratuitous visit.|$|R

50|$|A {{landscaped}} area incorporating trees, {{garden bed}} and park furniture is situated near the fence of the neighbouring property {{to the north}} of the monument area. A seat, picnic <b>table,</b> <b>tap</b> and large, green metal utility box in this area are not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
50|$|At the 1975 Bermuda Bowl, Facchini and Zucchelli {{were accused}} of {{communicating}} by means of foot <b>tapping</b> under the <b>table.</b> A committee {{was unable to find}} specific correlation between the foot movements observed and the bidding or play of the hands, a factor usually considered essential to conclusive proof of cheating.|$|R
50|$|Manrow’s House,was {{built in}} 1851 by J.P. Marrow, a {{successful}} civil engineer {{and also a}} judge advocate of a vigilance committee with high reputation in the city. He reported paranormal activities at his house {{in the form of}} “visitations, <b>table</b> <b>tapping,</b> rapping and so forth”. These accounts were published in newspapers of San Francisco.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the player}} places their last card, {{but failed to}} say [...] "Last card" [...] {{at the end of}} their {{previous}} turn, then they must pick up two cards from the remaining deck (even if the player had multiple cards). A player can also declare their final card by 'knocking', usually by <b>tapping</b> the playing <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|He <b>tapped</b> the <b>table</b> {{with his}} knuckles, and the glasses, waking up, jingled a thin, plaintive finale to his speech. Carter stood {{leaning against the}} sideboard. He was amazed by the {{unexpected}} turn of the conversation; his jaw dropped slightly and his eyes never swerved for a moment from Lingard's face. The silence in the cabin lasted only a few seconds, but to Carter, who waited breathlessly, it seemed very long. And all at once he heard in it, for the first time, the cabin clock tick distinctly, in pulsating beats, as though a little heart of metal behind the dial had been started into sudden palpitation.|$|R
60|$|Bill wavered. The {{music had}} started again now, {{one of those}} twentieth-century eruptions of sound that begin like a train going through a tunnel and {{continue}} like audible electric shocks, that set the feet <b>tapping</b> beneath the <b>table</b> and the spine thrilling with an unaccustomed exhilaration. Every drop of blood in his body cried to him 'Dance!' He could resist no longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, I know not," [...] {{answered}} Hugh. [...] "But {{her hand}} was at least as white as her face: that I can swear. Well, gentlemen, I trust you find everything in my house to your satisfaction. When the fire needs renewing, or the wine runs low, be pleased to <b>tap</b> on the <b>table.</b> I shall appear {{with the speed of}} a sunbeam." ...|$|R
50|$|The game may {{be related}} to 3-card Loo. Tippen is German for tapping and refers to the {{practice}} of players <b>tapping</b> on the <b>table</b> to indicate that they are not passing. Dreiblatt refers to the 3 cards, and Vierblatt to the 4 cards each player holds in the respective variants. In an 1829 Danish game anthology a variant was described under the name Trekort.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{no reply}} through the horn, but a <b>tapping</b> on the <b>table</b> gave a {{doubtful}} [...] "Yes," [...] and I crept slowly forward {{and took a}} seat at Mrs. Smiley's right hand. [...] "I am {{very close to the}} ultimate mystery, Mrs. Smiley," [...] I said, as I placed my hand upon her wrist. [...] "Proceed, 'Wilbur.' Let me hear your voice now." ...|$|R
5000|$|In public cardrooms, {{placing a}} single chip {{in the pot}} of any value {{sufficient}} to call an outstanding bet or raise without a verbal action declaring otherwise always constitutes a call. If necessary, any [...] "change" [...] from the chip {{will be returned to}} the player {{at the end of the}} betting round, or perhaps even sooner if this can conveniently be done. If, when it is a player's turn to act, the player already has an oversized chip in the pot that has not yet been [...] "changed" [...] and that is of sufficient value to call an outstanding bet or raise, then the player may call by <b>tapping</b> the <b>table</b> as if checking.|$|R
