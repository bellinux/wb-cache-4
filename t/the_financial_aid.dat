5|$|Upon graduating, Harding had stints as {{a teacher}} and as an {{insurance}} man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 in partnership with others to purchase a failing newspaper, The Marion Star, weakest of the growing city's three papers, and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff. During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was annoyed at having to praise the Democratic presidential nominee, New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the election. Afterward, with <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> of his father, the budding newspaperman redeemed the paper.|$|E

5|$|S.S.C. Napoli was {{expelled}} from the professional league in 2004. Thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., the sports title was transferred to Napoli Soccer (later the new Napoli) in the same year, while the old Napoli was liquidated. On the eve of bankruptcy, the club was in deep financial trouble to achieve positive operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading). At that time the club was using cash plus player swap to boost short term profit (€28,329,090 in 2000–01; €17,721,534 in 2001–02 season), but also increased the long term cost (as amortization) by purchasing players. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the non-standard accounting practice of amortization. {{it was due to}} Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and prime minister of Italy, introducing Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B. Napoli dramatically reduced the amortization from €33,437,075 to €1,659,088 + €4,660,123, due to €46,601,225 of the intangible asset (player contracts), which was deferred to amortize in 10-year installments, instead of varying from 1 to 5 years by the length of player contract. However, the practice was unable to save the club from <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> from a sugar daddy, when the owner withdrew.|$|E

25|$|Hawking {{attended}} Radlett School, {{an independent}} {{school in the}} village of Radlett in Hertfordshire, for a year, and from September 1952, St Albans School, an independent school in the city of St Albans in Hertfordshire.

His family could not afford the school fees without <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans. A positive consequence was that Hawking remained with a close group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception. From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, Hungary {{were not}} able to qualify for any {{international}} tournaments save for the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta. The 1980s were considered as the most bitter years of the Hungarian football, but the 1990s proved to be the worst. In 1996, Hungary reached its lowest FIFA World Raking, 87th. The fall of the Hungarian Communist regime caused financial problems to many Hungarian clubs. Formerly successful clubs like Ferencváros and Újpest faced financial crisis and bankruptcy. This {{had a profound effect on}} the Hungarian national team as well since earlier the biggest clubs from Budapest (Ferencváros, Újpest, Honvéd and MTK) produced the players for the national side. Another important reason for the decline can be attributed to the Bosman ruling.
