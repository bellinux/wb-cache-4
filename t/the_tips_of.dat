5|$|Dendrobatid poison dart frogs, {{especially}} those in the genus Phyllobates, secrete toxins such as Pumiliotoxin 251D and Allopumiliotoxin 267A powerful enough to be used to poison <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> blowpipe darts.|$|E
5|$|After sacrificing an animal, another {{important}} rite of Hajj is shaving head or trimming hair (known as Halak). All male pilgrims shave their head or trim their {{hair on the}} day of Eid al Adha and women pilgrims cut <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> their hair.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from active}} flight, thrips, even {{wingless}} ones, {{can also be}} picked up by winds and transferred long distances. During warm and humid weather, adults may climb to <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> plants to leap and catch air current. Wind-aided dispersal of species has been recorded over 1600km of sea between Australia and South Island of New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|T. m. caurinus breeds in {{southeast}} Alaska through coastal British Columbia to Washington and northwest Oregon. It winters from southwest British Columbia south to {{central and southern}} California and east to northern Idaho. It is very slightly smaller than the nominate subspecies and very dark-headed. The white on <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> the outer two tail feathers is restricted.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has four}} main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, solid red of various shades. Red {{includes}} sable (red where <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> the hairs are black, known as overlay) and red sable (red with brown overlay).|$|E
5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> the ears.|$|E
2500|$|The Nāsāgre dṛṣṭi ( [...] ; meaning [...] "to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nose") has {{the eyes}} fixed on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nose. Purportedly {{strengthens}} the eye muscles.|$|R

5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, with only <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> their long antennae showing, {{as a means}} of avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E
5|$|Most spiders that hunt actively, {{rather than}} relying on webs, have dense tufts of fine hairs between the paired claws at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> their legs. These tufts, known as scopulae, consist of {{bristles}} whose ends are split into as many as 1,000 branches, and enable spiders with scopulae to walk up vertical glass and upside down on ceilings. It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces. Spiders, like most other arachnids, keep at least four legs on the surface while walking or running.|$|E
5000|$|The Nāsāgre dṛṣṭi ( [...] ; [...] नासाग्रे; meaning [...] "to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nose") has {{the eyes}} fixed on <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nose. Purportedly {{strengthens}} the eye muscles.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece and <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reed {{is known as}} <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> opening. <b>The</b> <b>tip</b> opening has little effect on tone, which is more affected by {{the design of the}} mouthpiece's chamber (interior space).|$|R
50|$|Head: Roundish to {{slightly}} oval, substantial, wide. Arched forehead that flows in a smooth, continuous curve from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beak to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peak. Wattle small and neat.|$|R
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> shoots {{but it is}} seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} {{manufacture}} {{varied between the}} various cultures that used them. Initially <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> the limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as siyahs, which are made {{as an integral part}} of the wooden core of the bow.|$|E
5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> the toes.|$|E
50|$|In November 1989 Zorba was {{recorded}} as weighing 343 lb. Zorba stood 37 {{in at the}} shoulder and was 8 ft from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> his nose to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> his tail.|$|R

5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, {{which are also}} found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> the papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.|$|E
5|$|The spores are hyaline (translucent), smooth, and {{ellipsoid}} {{with the}} ends truncate. They have dimensions of 11.5–20 by 5–9µm, and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous cells interspersed among the asci, or spore-producing cells) are 5–8µm wide at the tip, branched, septate (with partitions that divide the cells into compartments), and constricted at the septa. The asci are cylindrical, and measure 300–360 by 10–13µm; <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> the asci stain blue with Melzer's reagent. The finely cylindrical paraphyses have slightly swollen tips and are forked at the base.|$|E
5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. <b>The</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> {{his fingers were}} severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He {{found that there was}} only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E

Pronation (eversion) and supination (inversion) occur along the oblique axis of the ankle joint.|$|R
50|$|The ganglioside-converting enzyme plasma {{membrane}} ganglioside sialidase (PMGS), which {{is involved in}} the activation <b>of</b> TrkA at <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> neutrites, is required for the elongation of axons. PMGS asymmetrically distributes to <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neurite that is destined to become the future axon.|$|R
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E
5|$|Floral buds are {{produced}} year-round on <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> new growth, but only those initiated between November and May {{go on to}} flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from axillary buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance.|$|E
30|$|We {{used the}} tip-apex {{distance}} to assess differences in {{position of the}} implants. Tip-apex distance {{is the sum of}} the distance from <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lag screw to the apex of the femoral head on an anteroposterior radiograph and this distance on a lateral radiograph, after controlling for magnification. For the SHS, we used <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sliding screw as a point of measurement, while for the dual screw cephalomedullary nails, we used <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal screw as a point of measurement.|$|R
