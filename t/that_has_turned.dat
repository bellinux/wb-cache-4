Thus, they party sees a strong convergence of the countries as an important goal. Reducing the economic differences between the Western and the Eastern part of the European Union and the development of the Eastern regions are key elements of the new EU-policy of Jobbik. According to the party, for the lack of development Eastern Central European governments and the European Union, <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> a blind eye on corruption, are equally responsible. Therefore, Jobbik played {{a leading role in the}} formation of the Wage Union European Citizens' Initiative, that started its work on 14 March 2017 with the participation of representatives from 8 Central European countries.|$|E

And what need of Aladdin's lamp when a man can build a palace with a patent pill? The office of the poet seems to be reversed, and he must give back these miracles of the understanding to poetry again, and find out what there is imaginative in steam and iron and telegraph-wires. After all, there is as much poetry in the iron horses that eat fire as in those of Diomed that fed on men. If you cut an apple across you may trace in it the lines of the blossom that the bee hummed around in May, and so the soul of poetry survives in things prosaic. Borrowing money on a bond does not seem the most promising subject in the world, but Shakespeare found the [...] "Merchant of Venice" [...] in it.
