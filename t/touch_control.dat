The capacitive <b>touch</b> <b>control</b> is adjustable in sensitivity to fit for various cover materials and a ROM library assists the application development.|$|E

50|$|Addressing the {{complaints}} many had with tacked-on touchscreen features, Nanostray 2 boasts three control schemes—classic control, left-handed <b>touch</b> <b>control,</b> and right-handed <b>touch</b> <b>control,</b> classic being the default scheme. The classic scheme employs the A and B buttons for {{primary and secondary}} weapons, the D pad for movement, and the shoulder buttons (L and R) to change satellite drone placement. The <b>touch</b> <b>control</b> scheme employs the stylus/touch screen for movement, the D pad or face buttons {{for use of the}} primary weapon, and the shoulder buttons for use of the secondary weapon. Like the previous game, gameplay focuses more on graphic quality rather than touch-screen control. Customization is now {{a key part of the}} experience: at the start of a level, players have the ability to adjust which special weapons they'll take into the fight, alter the angle of their side-mounted guns as they get mounted on the front, sides and rear of the ship, and even the ship's sensitivity to D pad commands. Besides the main single-player mode, Nanostray 2 also has a Challenge mode, where players can try to get a set number of points, collect a set number of coins, or survive for a specific time limit.|$|E
