A special <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> was mounted on the rear of the tank so that communication wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.|$|E

50|$|<b>Terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> (also called <b>terminal</b> boards or strips) {{provide a}} {{convenient}} means of connecting individual electrical wires without a splice or physically joining the ends. They are usually used to connect wiring among various items of equipment within an enclosure {{or to make}} connections among individually enclosed items. Since <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> are readily available {{for a wide range}} of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. Some disadvantages are that connecting wires is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable and the terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.|$|R

50|$|The actual icky-pick {{compound}} is a {{very thick}} petroleum-based substance with very high flammability, and consequently is only rated for outdoor use, frequently direct-buried in the ground. An outdoor cable spliced onto an indoor <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> is prone to leak the gelatin which is a fire hazard, hence in many situations the icky-pic cable is spliced (usually outside the building) to a short run of normal cable which is run in a protective conduit into the building and then terminated.

50|$|The Big Board {{was sold}} as an {{unpopulated}} {{printed circuit board}} with sockets for integrated circuits, with documentation and options to purchase additional components.The Big Board design was simple enough to build a system around that many people with no prior electronics experience were able to build and bring up a capable computer system of their own at a cost far less than that of a fully assembled system of the time. In this way, the Big Boards anticipated the DIY PC clones that became popular later. In its most popular form, the fully assembled and tested Big Board need only be connected to a power supply, one or two eight inch floppy disk drives, a composite monitor, and an ASCII encoded keyboard in order to provide a fully functioning system. A serial terminal could be used in place of the monitor and keyboard, further simplifying assembly. The only tool required for basic assembly was a screwdriver for the <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> power connections.|$|E
40|$|Thermoplastic poly(ester–siloxane) s (TPES) and poly(ester–ether–siloxane) s, (TPEES), {{based on}} poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) as the hard segment and {{different}} siloxane-prepolymers as the soft segments, were prepared. The TPES and TPEES were synthesized by catalyzed two-step transesterification from dimethyl terephthalate, (DMT), 1, 4 -butanediol, (BD) and a siloxane-prepolymer. Incorporation of dicarboxypropyl- or disilanol-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) s (PDMS) into the polar poly(butylene terephthalate) chains resulted in rather inhomogeneous TPES copolymers, {{which was a}} consequence of a prononuced phase separation of the polar and non-polar reactants during synthesis.
