50|$|The Mi-X1 is {{designed}} to have a take-off weight of just 10 tons, seat 25 passengers and fly to 1,500 km. It has one main rotor and a rear mount lift rotor.

This phenomenon occurs at airspeeds of some 300 km/h, and leads to vibrations that may ultimately destroy the rotor. Mil’s solution to fighting the onset of the RBS is to offload the rotor {{with the help of the}} proprietary Stall Local Elimination System (SLES).
