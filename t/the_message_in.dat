25|$|The {{auditory}} {{findings are}} further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message {{in one ear}} {{is supposed to be}} shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in frequency in <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>in</b> the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance our experience and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.|$|E

Lord Mersey observed that it was his job to get at the truth, and thereafter became more critical of Admiralty evidence.|$|E

25|$|Qur'anic {{commentators}} seem to {{have concluded}} the denial of the crucifixion of Jesus by following material interpreted in Tafsir that relied upon extra-biblical Judeo-Christian sources, venturing away from the message conveyed in the Qur'an, with the earliest textual evidence having originated from a non-Muslim source; a misreading of the Christian writings of John of Damascus regarding the literal understandings of Docetism (exegetical doctrine describing spiritual and physical realities of Jesus as understood by men in logical terms) as opposed to their figurative explanations. John of Damascus highlighted the Qur'an's assertion that the Jews did not crucify Jesus being very different from saying that Jesus was not crucified, explaining {{that it is the}} varied Quranic exegetes in Tafsir, and not the Qur'an itself, that denies the crucifixion, further stating that <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>in</b> the 4:157 verse simply affirms the historicity of the event.|$|E
25|$|While with Wordsworth, Coleridge {{was able}} to read the poem and provide his {{response}} to the ode's question within an early draft of his poem, Dejection: an Ode. Coleridge's answer was to claim that the glory was the soul and it is a subjective answer to the question. Wordsworth took a different path as he sought to answer the poem, which was to declare that childhood contained the remnants of a beatific state and that being able to experience the beauty that remained later was something to be thankful for. The difference between the two could be attributed to the differences in the poets' childhood experiences; Coleridge suffered from various pain in his youth whereas Wordsworth's was far more pleasant. It is possible that Coleridge's earlier poem, The Mad Monk (1800) influenced the opening of the ode and that discussions between Dorothy and Wordsworth about Coleridge's childhood and painful life were influences on the crafting of the opening stanza of the poem. However, <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>in</b> the ode, as with Tintern Abbey, describes the pain and suffering of life as able to dull the memory of early joy from nature but it is unable to completely destroy it. The suffering leads Wordsworth to recognise what is soothing in nature, and he credits the pain as leading to a philosophical understanding of the world.|$|E

McAlphine awarded [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] four stars out of five.

McAlphine wrote that as a result the song depicts a more realistic abusive relationship and could be featured in a campaign for women's shelters. He praised Eminem's accuracy and understanding of the topic. Winston Robbins from Consequence of Sound attributed the song's poignancy to Rihanna's past abusive relationship, and a theme of infidelity and abuse.|$|E

500|$|Robinett {{kept the}} Gray Dot a secret {{for over a}} year, and did not mention it to anyone at Atari prior to his departure. He was unsure {{of whether or not}} it would be {{discovered}} by other Atari personnel prior to publishing; the dot was not mentioned in the game's manual, as the manual's author was unaware of the dot's existence. [...] After the game was released, Adam Clayton, a fifteen-year-old from Salt Lake City, discovered the Dot and sent a letter to Atari explaining how to retrieve it. Robinett had already quit the company by this point, so Atari tasked designers with finding the responsible code. The one who found it said that if he were to fix it, he would change <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>in</b> the game to say [...] "Fixed by Brad Stewart". Further, the cost of creating a new read-only memory (ROM) mask, or memory chip, was around $10,000 US {{at the time of the}} game's release, making this change a costly endeavor. Steve Wright, the director of software development of the Atari Consumer Division, argued for retaining the message, believing it gave players additional incentive to find it and play their games more, and suggested these were like Easter eggs for players to find. Atari eventually decided to leave the Dot in-game, and dubbed such hidden features Easter eggs, saying they would be adding more such secrets to later games. Wright made it an official policy at Atari that all future games should include Easter eggs, often limited to being the initials of the game developer.|$|E
500|$|Maxentius {{organized}} his forces—still {{twice the}} size of Constantine's—in long lines facing the battle plain, with their backs to the river. Constantine's army arrived at the field bearing unfamiliar symbols on either its standards or its soldiers' shields. According to Lactantius, Constantine was visited by a dream the night before the battle, wherein he was advised [...] "to mark the heavenly sign of God on the shields of his soldiers... by means of a slanted letter X with the top of its head bent round, he marked Christ on their shields." [...] Eusebius describes another version, where, while marching at midday, [...] "he saw with his own eyes in the heavens a trophy of the cross arising from the light of the sun, carrying <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> <b>In</b> Hoc Signo Vinces or [...] "with this sign, you shall win"; in Eusebius's account, Constantine had a dream the following night, in which Christ appeared with the same heavenly sign, and told him to make a standard, the labarum, for his army in that form. Eusebius is vague about when and where these events took place, but it enters his narrative before the war against Maxentius begins. Eusebius describes the sign as Chi (Χ) traversed by Rho (Ρ): ☧, a symbol representing the first two letters of the Greek spelling of the word Christos or Christ. In 315AD a medallion was issued at Ticinum showing Constantine wearing a helmet emblazoned with the Chi Rho, and coins issued at Siscia in 317/318AD repeat the image. The figure was otherwise rare, however, and is uncommon in imperial iconography and propaganda before the 320s.|$|E

Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment.

[...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>in</b> the song.

'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment.
