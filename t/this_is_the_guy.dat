It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2003, during warm-ups in Chicago {{during a}} tight pennant race, Newman {{took a turn}} in the batter's box during warm-ups to take some fun hits. Shortly after completion, Newman {{collapsed}} {{on the field and}} was immediately rushed to the hospital. After several tests, it was determined he had suffered a brain hemorrhage. His wife Deborah and Twins general manager Terry Ryan remained at the hospital with him throughout the stay where he remained unconscious until September 26. During that time, Gardenhire struggled to keep his team focused while all dealt with their feelings for Newman. Minnesota Twins center fielder Torii Hunter said of Newman, [...] "For me, I think it hurt me more than anybody to see him go down like that, because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who pretty much taught me the game, and how to play the game hard." [...] While Newman was away from the team, his jersey, number 62, was hung in the dugout for each game as a salute. On October 4, 2003, after being released from the hospital, Newman threw out the first pitch prior to Game 3 of the Twins American League Divisional Series versus the New York Yankees. Gardenhire waved Newman's jersey to fans and was visibly emotional to have him back on the field with him after his long hospital stay.|$|E

These sounds are layered, bent, treated and kicked {{in and out}} of the mix, a Minóy trademark. On side two it appears our sins have been purged, We're treated to an airy, uplifting blend of sound, giving the impression that you might be flying and making that last connection out of purgatory.

5000|$|In 2012, Mohager {{signed to}} Warner Music Group {{for the release}} of his third {{full-length}} album, Daydream Forever. The album is described as a continuation of the synth-heavy, reverb-laden dreams that made Mohager’s debut album, Wayward Fire, an immediate favorite of the retro set. Production is thicker here, with more elastic bounces. If that means it feels like you’ve stepped into an 1980s night at the local bar (as one reviewer humorously put it), then Mohager has clearly succeeded. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who wasn’t moved to make music until hearing Tears for Fears in the movie Real Genius, says the legend; when tracks such as “Ordinary Fools,” “You,” “Moksha," [...] and “Death Metal Punk” hit you firmly across the ears with their indelible 1980s-styled hooks, everything is working according to his lo-hi-tech plans. Elements of Tears for Fears, Duran Duran, OMD, and M83 coalesce into a party of their own. “Plum” ends things on a slightly darker Prefab Sprout-style tone.|$|E

5000|$|Health {{has been}} {{described}} as having [...] "artfully crafted noise and raw synth, haunting monotone vocals, and drum skills that are borderline insane.” Guardian Unlimited writer, Louis Pattison, describes the Crystal Castles version of [...] "Crimewave" [...] as [...] "melancholy electro-pop built from pixelated synths and depressed vocals that hint at a past programme of busy and sustained serotonin depletion.” The band's unusual sound can be partially credited {{to the use of the}} Zoothorn, which is a permutation of microphone and guitar pedal and an occasional atonal sound without a symmetrical structure. Lyrically, the band describes the role of lyrics as being [...] "purposely kept vague for the listener" [...] "...Lyrics sort of begin to bring out this more individual quality to the whole thing like, ‘These are the lyrics, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> is singing them, so I can relate to that.’ Which is really not something we want. We wanted the vocals to have an even, unaffected feel. A softness, like a Zombies melody, or even a Gregorian chant. We aren’t just interested in being a noisy screaming band." ...|$|E

[...] Of the pilot episode, Conroy wondered if an abandoned rail yard would have a working pump car, a working gasoline engine, and nearby fueled-up lawn mowers, and wondered how much [...] "support" [...] Hackett received during the project.
