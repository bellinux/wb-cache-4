25|$|In {{the park}} on a Sunday some time later, George {{sketches}} a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters {{on the arm of}} Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man ("Gossip"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday ("The Day Off"). As the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try {{to attract the attention of}} a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice ("Everybody Loves Louis").|$|E
500|$|Lord {{traveled}} on the RMS Olympic, Titanics sister ship, {{when he was}} a boy and the experience gave him a lifelong fascination with the lost liner. As he later put it, he spent his time on the Olympic [...] "prowling around" [...] and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> [...] "such a huge thing" [...] sinking. He started reading about and drawing Titanic at the age of ten and spent many years collecting Titanic memorabilia, causing people to [...] "take note of this oddity." [...] He majored in history at Princeton University and graduated from Yale Law School before joining the New York-based advertising agency J. Walter Thompson. Writing in his spare time, he interviewed 63 survivors of the disaster.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Garfield {{was cast}} as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, {{opposite}} Emma Stone as his love interest Gwen Stacy, in Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of the Spider-Man film series. After Stone {{was cast in}} The Amazing Spider-Man, which was confirmed in October 2010, Marc Webb, the film's director, noted that the chemistry between Garfield and Stone made her the clear choice. Garfield saw his casting as a [...] "massive challenge in many ways", having to make the character [...] "authentic" [...] and [...] "live and breathe in a new way". Garfield described Peter as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him {{since he was a}} child. For the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, did yoga and pilates in order to be as flexible as possible, and drew from his life experiences as inspiration. Garfield admitted to shedding tears and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> [...] "a better actor in the suit" [...] upon first wearing his costume. When filming, Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as challenging and exhausting. Released in July 2012, The Amazing Spider-Man earned a worldwide total of $752,216,557. Garfield's performance was generally well received. The Guardian Peter Bradshaw acclaimed his portrayal as the [...] "definitive Spider-Man", Tom Charity of CNN commended his [...] "combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor", and Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone, said Garfield gave a stellar performance. Associated Press' Christy Lemire elaborated that Garfield's Spider-Man gave the film a [...] "restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger." [...] Garfield reprised his role in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014).|$|E

500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites him {{on the back of his}} neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E
2500|$|From 1989 to 1990, Coupland {{lived in}} the Mojave Desert working on a {{handbook}} about the birth cohort that followed the Baby Boom. He received a $22,500 advance from St. Martin's Press to write the nonfiction handbook. Instead, Coupland wrote a novel, [...] It was rejected in Canada before being accepted by an American publishing house in 1991. Reflecting on the writing of his debut novel years later, Coupland said, [...] "I remember spending my days almost dizzy with loneliness and feeling like I'd sold the family cow for three beans. I suppose it was this crippling loneliness that gave Gen X its bite. I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> a life for myself on paper that certainly wasn't happening in reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{musical score}} of Sonic Mania was {{composed}} by Tee Lopes of PagodaWest Games, consisting of rearranged pieces from previous Sonic games alongside new material. Lopes was chosen {{due to his}} popularity on YouTube for producing arrangements of various Sonic tracks, and {{for his work on}} the Sonic 2 HD project. Lopes initially wanted his score to resemble the Sonic CD soundtrack, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what a sequel to it might have sounded like. As development progressed, he took inspiration from several other older Sonic and Sega games, such as The Revenge of Shinobi and Sega Rally. Lopes also looked to popular music from the 1990s, such as the work of Michael Jackson, for further inspiration. The game's opening theme, [...] "Friends", was composed by the electronic music group Hyper Potions. A vinyl LP featuring Lopes' original tracks was published by the music label Data Discs in 2017.|$|E

2500|$|VanderWaal began {{composing}} {{her first}} songs at age three, using a wireless microphone. As a preteen, she found songwriting inspiration by watching movies and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what a character was feeling, and [...] "what {{it would be}} like if I were them, and wrote a song." [...] She was inspired to learn the ukulele after watching a family friend play and seeing a Twenty One Pilots video on YouTube. She then bought one, using money she had received for her 11th birthday, and watched more videos to teach herself how to play. She has also played the saxophone in her school's marching band. After learning to play the ukulele, VanderWaal began to perform during open mic events at small venues near her home and to study music theory. In July 2016, after her audition on AGT, VanderWaal performed at the Lafayette Theatre in Suffern and at the Ramapo Summer Concert Series at Palisades Credit Union Park.|$|E
