40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{of this research was}} to develop a fundamental understanding of the corn flaking process and determine how processing conditions (i. e. tempering) affect the final product in terms of quality and starch fragmentation. With the assistance of a cereal company, studies were designed and performed to show the effects of cooking, drying, <b>tempering,</b> and <b>milling</b> on corn flaking grits during the corn flaking process. The development, application, and verification of a novel rheometry device to monitor and measure the mechanical properties of a single corn grit during the processes of cooking, drying, and tempering was used in this study. It was proposed from this work that this method may find suitable applications in industrial online/at-line systems due to its non-invasiveness, little to no modification of testing samples, and its ability to obtain quick and instantaneous measurements. The process of tempering corn flaking grits was more thoroughly investigated with the novel rheometry device and mechanisms were identified that were shown to promote a reorganization of structure after gelatinization. State diagrams of the viscoelastic properties of corn flaking grits during the process of tempering were obtained and shown to be affected by moisture, temperature, and time. Tempered grit rheology was shown to greatly influence the milling process in terms of flake thickness, process-induced fragmentation, and glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the milled flakes prior to toasting. A relationship with Tg and overall product quality in terms of percent water uptake of the cereals and sensory quality characteristics was also obtained.

50|$|Printed {{circuit board}} milling (also: {{isolation}} milling) {{is the process}} of removing areas of copper from a sheet of printed circuit board material to recreate the pads, signal traces and structures according to patterns from a digital circuit board plan known as a layout file. Similar to the more common and well known chemical PCB etch process, the PCB milling process is subtractive: material is removed to create the electrical isolation and ground planes required. However, unlike the chemical etch process, PCB milling is typically a non-chemical process and as such it can be completed in a typical office or lab environment without exposure to hazardous chemicals. High quality circuit boards can be produced using either process. In the case of PCB milling, the quality of a circuit board is chiefly determined by the system's true, or weighted, milling accuracy and control as well as the condition (sharpness, <b>temper)</b> of the <b>milling</b> bits and their respective feed/rotational speeds.

Comprehensive improvement of strip shape and surface quality could also be realized by optimizing the rolling force, strip elongation rate, and tension [66]. Under the premise of ensuring good strip shape, the flux, concentration, and temperature of the emulsion were optimized to prevent slipping and thermal scratching between the strip and rolls [67].

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} on {{the influence of}} processing conditions on tempering grit rheology and the resulting molecular fragmentation of starch that occurs during the milling of conventional processed grit corn flakes. Corn grits were <b>tempered</b> and <b>milled</b> under a range of combinations of processing conditions which included low and high percent moistures and tempering temperatures. Starch fragmentation was determined using hot and cold water-soluble fractionation methods and an intermediate-pressure size-exclusion chromatograph with multi-angle laser light scattering and refractive index detection. Rheology of the tempered grits was obtained using a broad band frequency squeezing flow technique. Results showed that tempered grit moisture content and tempering temperature and time directly influence the rheology of the tempered corn grits. Rheology of the tempered corn grits was shown to directly influence mill gap width and roll vibrations. Corn grits processed under low moisture-low tempering temperatures were significantly harder. Generally, moisture content was the principal component governing final grit hardness and milled flake thickness in experiments using the same flaking roll setting. Processing conditions resulting in increased shear forces at the flaking mill produced increased amounts of fragmented amylopectin with decreasing average molecular weights. Overall, thinner flakes produced a higher degree of starch fragmentation, yet processing conditions can be modified to yield a range of starch fragmentation for any given milled flake thickness. Characterization of the fragmented starch occurring during milling is presented. Depending on processing conditions, the average molecular weight of the branched polymer was 1. 5 × 10 6 to 1. 1 × 107 Da. Resulting starch fragmentation was shown to strongly impact bowl life and overall sensory quality of the finished corn flakes. Corn flake samples containing high amounts of starch fragmentation were positively correlated to increased water uptake and increased leaching of starch fragments into water. Processing conditions resulting in corn flakes of the same milled flake thickness, but containing different amounts of starch fragmentation, further corresponded to different bowl lives with the flake sample containing the highest amount of starch fragmentation yielding the poorest bowl life. ...|$|R

Drying experiments were conducted at 60, 70, and 80 C and relative humidities ranging from 13 to 83 %. High drying air relative humidities (greater than 63 %) maintained both the kernel surface and core in a rubbery state during drying, whereas low drying air relative humidities caused rapid transitioning of the surface layers from a rubbery to a glassy state. Long-grain pureline cultivar, Wells, medium-grain pureline cultivar, Jupiter, and long-grain hybrid cultivar, CL XL 729, were dried from harvest moisture content to 12. 5 % moisture content in a single-pass. Immediately after drying, samples were tempered in the drying container or in sealed plastic bags at the drying air temperature for 0, 30, and 60 min, after which they were spread in thin layers and cooled to ambient conditions.

Minimal reduction to milling quality was observed at the low drying-air relative humidities when samples were tempered immediately after drying in sealed plastic bags and at the drying air temperature for at least 60 min: tempering in containers having large headspaces or for shorter durations failed to reduce the intra-kernel stresses created during drying due to differences in material state between the surface and the core, thereby causing kernel fissuring and breakage during subsequent milling.

A broad {{objective of the}} “rice drying process”, which comprises drying and tempering, is to maximize the yield of “whole, intact milled kernels”, quantified by the “head rice yield” (HRY). Since rough rice is commonly dried using cross-flow (CF) dryers in the United States of America, {{the aim of this}} research was to assess the effect of drying and <b>tempering</b> treatments on <b>milling</b> yields when rice was dried in an experimentally-simulated CF drying column. First, because airflow rate was found to be the least-studied “drying variable”, its effect on drying air conditions and rice moisture content profiles was assessed. Additionally, the impact of airflow rate on the material state behavior of rice kernels was considered as a means to explain head rice yield reductions (HRYRs). Second, the effect of tempering approach following CF drying on milling yields was investigated. For the same rice and drying conditions, tempering approach significantly affected HRYs, especially HRYs of samples that were located near the heated-air plenum during CF drying. Third, drying treatments were selected based on the glass transition temperature of rice kernels and applied in the drying column. When kernels did not undergo material state transitions during drying, there was negligible HRYR, regardless if samples had been tempered or not. But, when kernels underwent material state transitions during drying, significant HRYRs occurred, and HRYRs of tempered samples were significantly less than those of non-tempered samples...|$|R
