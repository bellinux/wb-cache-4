5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates <b>those</b> <b>details</b> from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E

25|$|On 1 April 1865 the {{regiment}} arrived at Shreveport, but their stay was short lived. On April 6 {{the regiment}} received another movement order from Major General Churchill which {{stated that the}} division would move at sunrise on April 8 towards Marshall, Texas. The 36th Arkansas arrived in Marshall six days later with a reported strength of 598 soldiers having lost one soldier in a skirmish with Federal cavalry, two captured and having to leave behind two soldiers that were too sick to travel any further. At Marshall, they immediately began to construct defenses {{on the east side}} of the town. On 11 May 1865 as the work on the town defenses continued, the regiment lost its last three soldiers, all from Company C, captured by Federal cavalry as they were on picket duty. An order from the division commander halted work on the defenses on 14 May without any further details. <b>Those</b> <b>details</b> came twelve days later, on 26 May 1865 when the 36th Arkansas was surrendered with the remainder of General Kirby Smith’s army. The strength of the regiment that day was 587 officers and soldiers.|$|E

500|$|Although the British Regency {{lasted only}} from 1811 to 1820, Heyer's romances were set between 1752 and 1825. As noted by {{literary}} critic Kay Mussell, the books revolved around a [...] "structured social ritual — the marriage market {{represented by the}} London season" [...] where [...] "all {{are in danger of}} ostracism for inappropriate behavior". Her Regency romances were inspired by the writings of Jane Austen, whose novels were set in the same era. Austen's works, however, were contemporary novels, describing the times in which she lived. According to Pamela Regis in her work A Natural History of the Romance Novel, because Heyer's stories took place amidst events that had occurred over 100years earlier, she had to include more detail on the period in order for her readers to understand it. While Austen could ignore the [...] "minutiae of dress and decor", Heyer included <b>those</b> <b>details</b> [...] "to invest the novels... with 'the tone of the time'". Later reviewers, such as Lillian Robinson, criticized Heyer's [...] "passion for the specific fact without concern for its significance", and Marghanita Laski pointed out that [...] "these aspects on which Heyer is so dependent for her creation of atmosphere are just those which Jane Austen... referred to only when she wanted to show that a character was vulgar or ridiculous". Others, including A. S. Byatt, believe that Heyer's [...] "awareness of this atmosphere — both of the minute details of the social pursuits of her leisured classes and of the emotional structure behind the fiction it produced — is her greatest asset".|$|E

2500|$|His {{argument}} is that, {{just as an}} astrologer must consider cultural differences [...] "lest he mistake the appropriate customs and manners by assigning, for example, marriage with a sister to one who is Italian by race, instead of to the Egyptian as he should", {{it is necessary to}} consider the age in life that important astrological events occur. This is to ensure the prediction will [...] "harmonise <b>those</b> <b>details</b> which are contemplated in temporal terms with that which is suitable and possible for persons in the various age-classes" [...] and avoid out-of-context predictions such as imminent marriage for a young child, or [...] "to an extremely old man the begetting of children or anything else that fits younger men".

2500|$|Criticism of Wooden {{with regard}} to his {{stewardship}} of the UCLA basketball program has most often focused on his failure to investigate or curtail his players' involvement with Sam Gilbert, a UCLA booster who was a prominent figure in the players' circle in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. A 1981 investigation by the Los Angeles Times found that Gilbert had regularly helped athletes get discounts on items such as automobiles, stereos and airline tickets for UCLA players, and in so doing, apparently committed numerous violations of NCAA regulations. The investigation did not uncover evidence that Wooden had explicit personal awareness of Gilbert's activities. However, Gilbert's overall influence {{in the lives of}} the players was no secret. This led the Times reporters to conclude that if Wooden was not aware of the specifics of Gilbert's favors for players, it was only because Wooden made no effort to discover <b>those</b> <b>details.</b> For his part, Wooden acknowledged that he had always felt uneasy about Gilbert's relationship with the players, but steadfastly denied having knowledge at the time of anything done by Gilbert that was in violation of NCAA regulations. He also asserted that both he and UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan had advised players to steer clear of Gilbert, but that ultimately they could not control the players' or Gilbert's actions. Given what later came to light, however, Wooden granted that he may have had [...] "tunnel vision" [...] and that he perhaps [...] "trusted too much". Nonetheless, Wooden said that his [...] "conscience [...] clear" [...] {{with regard to}} his own role in the matter.|$|E
