The roadway curves {{to the northeast}} before returning to a due eastward course north of Munro Lake along the Hebron–Munro township line.. The landscape changes to include more farm fields once road passes the lake. C-66 intersects I-75 at exit326 along the latter. On {{the east side of}} the interchange, Levering Road passes Sea Shell City, a tourist trap, and turns northeastward into Hebron Township. C-66 then turns easterly again before it crosses into Beaugrand Township, taking the additional name Cheboygan Road. The roadway crosses branches of <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Black</b> River and passes to the south of the Cheboygan County Airport. East of the airport, C-66 enters the city of Cheboygan and follows State Street into town; this area is residential in nature. State Street crosses the North Central State Trail, a rail trail, before turning to the southeast. The roadway passes into the northern end of downtown near several smaller businesses.. C-66 terminates at a four-way intersection with Main Street one block west of the Cheboygan River; this intersection also marks the northern terminus of M-27. As a county-designated highway, C-66 is maintained by the Emmet and Cheboygan county road commissions (ECRC, CCRC) in their respective counties.|$|E

25|$|The {{state is}} well known in the country for its music and dance. The fandango is a dance brought over from Spanish. Today the state has two varieties: the jarocho and the huasteco. Indigenous and folk dances in the state are most often {{associated}} with rituals and religious festivals. These include one called Los Lisceres also called the Tigres from the Los Tuxtlas region. Participants wear Olmec style masks which represent the rain god Tlalóc. Another is Los Guaguas in which the participants pay homage to the sun, and Los Santiagos, which is related to the veneration of Saint James, patron saint of Hernán Cortés. One last one is called Los Negritos (<b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Black</b> Ones) which was created by African slaves. According to tradition, the origin of this dance lies in a story about a boy who was bitten by a snake and the rituals his family held to heal him.|$|E

500|$|Accusations {{of racism}} in Blyton's books were first made by Lena Jeger in a Guardian article {{published}} in 1966, {{in which she was}} critical of Blyton's <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Black</b> Doll, published a few months earlier. Sambo, the black doll of the title, is hated by his owner and the other toys owing to his [...] "ugly black face", and runs away. A shower of rain washes his face clean, after which he is welcomed back home with his now pink face. Jamaica Kincaid also considers the Noddy books to be [...] "deeply racist" [...] because of the blonde children and the black golliwogs. In Blyton's 1944 novel The Island of Adventure, a black servant named Jo-Jo is very intelligent, but is particularly cruel to the children.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Homer discovers that all of his white shirts have turned pink because Bart put his red hat in with the laundry. [...] Homer {{has no choice but}} to wear a pink shirt to work and as a result, his co-workers poke fun at him. [...] Mr. Burns suspects him of being a [...] "free-thinking anarchist". [...] Homer is sent home with a 20-question psychiatric quiz that he has to fill in so that Dr. Marvin Monroe can assess his sanity. [...] Homer is too lazy to finish the quiz on his own and lets Bart fill it in. [...] When Dr. Monroe sees the results, he determines that Homer is insane. [...] Homer is sent to a mental institution, and is put in a cell with a large white man who seems to believe he is Michael Jackson (referred to as [...] "the big white guy who thinks he's <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>black</b> guy"), and who introduces himself as such. [...] Being unfamiliar with the real Michael Jackson, Homer believes and quickly befriends him.|$|E

[...] The Heinzelmännchen of Cologne resemble short, naked men, and the Klabautermann, a kobold from the beliefs of fishermen and sailors of the Baltic Sea, typically appears as a small, pipe-smoking humanlike figure wearing a yellow nightcap-style sailor's hat and a red or grey jacket.|$|E
