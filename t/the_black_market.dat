5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a black market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food on <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> was extremely expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration were involved in <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E

5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} is <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market.</b> FairTax supporters state that <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> is largely untaxed {{under the current}} tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in January 2007 by publisher Eidos Interactive, {{and a year later}} a Christmas 2008 release was planned. Its release was later postponed to the third quarter of 2009. A demo for the game, released on 4 March 2010, attracted more than two million players. According to studio founder Christofer Sundberg, the demo was envisioned as a smaller version of the game so players could fully experience its open-ended gameplay. After Japanese publisher Square Enix acquired Eidos Interactive, it announced that the game would be released in North America on 23 March 2010 and in Europe on 26 March. Pre-orders received a map of Panau and access to <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Market</b> Chaos Pack.

5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased on <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen queueing at a chemist dealing in illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|Sea turtles are {{protected}} by law in Costa Rica, but poaching remains common.

5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters {{public support for the}} protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile.

5|$|Braham's {{return to}} Britain {{was not a}} welcome one. His family found him {{exceptionally}} difficult to live with. His short temper and aggressiveness manifested themselves when journalists came to the family's home in Leicestershire searching for a war-story to print. Braham, who despised publicity, physically ejected them from his property. His decision to shut the media {{out of his life}} likely explains why, even {{as one of the most}} successful aces, he was virtually unknown in Britain outside the RAF. Braham had also become despondent about the political climate in a country that reduced Winston Churchill to Leader of the Opposition, where <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> was rife and rationing was set to become an indefinite feature of post-war Britain into the 1950s.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. South Africa is {{currently}} {{not considered a}} wine-drinking nation. The consumption per capita rate is very low, especially for a wine-producing country. To date, the wine industry has grown due to exports allowed since sanctions were lifted in 1994. With the export market set to decelerate {{over the next few}} years, the wine industry will have to develop the domestic <b>market,</b> especially <b>the</b> <b>black</b> consumer <b>market</b> for future growth. <b>The</b> emerging <b>black</b> <b>market</b> of South Africa has materialised as the strongest buying influence in the economy. They have an overwhelming desire to have access to a lifestyle, which in the past was not possible. While they are status and lifestyle orientated, they want products and brands that are aspirational and close to them. Understanding this market and the potential they pose is vital for the wine industry’s future. Wine marketers need to understand this target market’s thoughts and perceptions around wine, as this market is still largely untapped. <b>The</b> emerging <b>black</b> <b>market</b> has had little exposure to wine compared with other alcoholic drinks such as beer, brandy and the ready-to-drink category and the wine industry will have to look at a comprehensive strategy to target them. It is {{the purpose of this study}} to provide detailed insights into <b>the</b> emerging <b>black</b> <b>market</b> of South Africa in connection with wine consumption. Initially, a literature review was conducted to investigate this target market and the wine industry’s current situation. Various marketing tools were discussed designed to specifically target <b>the</b> emerging <b>black</b> <b>market.</b> Based on this information, a consumer survey was conducted amongst black MBA students of the University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB). The data was analysed and conclusions were drawn that answered the questions and objectives of this study. The analyses showed that the wine industry should focus on the women segment of <b>the</b> emerging <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> as they are the current group interested in wine. Other main findings included that wine needed to be positioned as an aspirational product; that brand ambassadors in large social networks should be identified; and finally that the wine industry and all its stakeholders should work together to educate <b>the</b> emerging <b>black</b> <b>market</b> and collectively apply the various marketing techniques found to be popular...|$|R

5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.|$|E

Birmingham distributed their share by ballot among those supporters who had followed the team in the earlier rounds of the competition; 22,000 had attended the semi-final, so many thousands were left disappointed. Of the remaining tickets, 4,640 were allocated to the FA, 40,640 to County Associations, 20,090 to Football League clubs, 2,550 to FA members and 2,080 to the FA Council and stadium authorities. An enquiry into <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>market</b> held following the previous year's Cup Final meant ticket touts kept a lower profile than usual.
