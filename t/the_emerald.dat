5|$|Castafiore {{leaves for}} Milan {{to perform in}} the opera La gazza ladra (Italian: The Thieving Magpie). Tintin realises that the true culprit {{responsible}} for the theft of <b>the</b> <b>emerald</b> and the scissors is a magpie. He explains to Haddock that the scissors must have fallen out of the nest only to be found by Miarka. Tintin retrieves <b>the</b> <b>emerald</b> {{and hands it to}} Thomson and Thompson to return to Castafiore. The stonemason mends the broken step, only for Haddock to step on it again.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from most terrestrial doves found on Tawi-Tawi. <b>The</b> <b>emerald</b> dove {{is most likely}} {{to be confused with the}} bleeding-heart, but <b>the</b> <b>emerald</b> dove is distinguished by a larger and whiter shoulder patch, a white supercilium, and dark chestnut underparts. Two bleeding-hearts are kept as pets and may escape on Tawi-Tawi; the Sulu bleeding-heart differs from the Luzon bleeding-heart by not having the Luzon bleeding-heart's purple nape and back, and from the Mindanao bleeding-heart by lacking prominent gray wing-bars and an orange belly.|$|E
5|$|The Wiz {{was filmed}} at Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The {{decaying}} New York State Pavilion from the 1964 New York World's Fair {{was used as}} the set for Munchkinland, Astroland at Coney Island was used for the Tinman scene with The Cyclone as a backdrop, while the World Trade Center served as <b>the</b> <b>Emerald</b> City. The scenes filmed at <b>the</b> <b>Emerald</b> City were elaborate, utilizing 650 dancers, 385 crew members and 1,200 costumes. Costume designer Tony Walton enlisted the help of high fashion designers in New York City for <b>the</b> <b>Emerald</b> City sequence, and obtained exotic costumes and fabric from designers such as Oscar de la Renta and Norma Kamali. Albert Whitlock created the film's visual special effects, while Stan Winston served as the head makeup artist.|$|E
50|$|The next day, Knuckles restores <b>the</b> Master <b>Emerald,</b> but Angel Island {{falls into}} the sea once again when Chaos attacks him and Eggman. Chaos reabsorbs <b>the</b> Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and locates <b>the</b> seventh inside the crashed Tornado II. Having {{acquired}} all seven Chaos Emeralds, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, draining <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> of their negative energy, and destroys Station Square in a massive flood. <b>The</b> <b>Emeralds</b> are re-gathered by Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big, and the Flicky that fueled Gamma, who bring <b>the</b> <b>emeralds</b> to Sonic.|$|R
5|$|However, the unfazed Eggman awakens a {{creature}} named Chaos from a huge gem called <b>the</b> Master <b>Emerald.</b> <b>The</b> animals fight {{a losing battle}} to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named Tikal, who entombed herself and Chaos in <b>the</b> Master <b>Emerald</b> millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses <b>the</b> Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> to become Super Sonic, he defeats Chaos, who returns to <b>the</b> Master <b>Emerald</b> with Tikal.|$|R

5|$|Boston Common, {{located near}} the Financial District and Beacon Hill, is the oldest public park in the United States. Along with the {{adjacent}} Boston Public Garden, {{it is part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Emerald</b> Necklace, a string of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted to encircle the city. <b>The</b> <b>Emerald</b> Necklace includes Jamaica Pond, Boston's largest body of freshwater, and Franklin Park, the city's largest park and home of the Franklin Park Zoo. Another major park is the Esplanade, located {{along the banks of the}} Charles River. The Hatch Shell, an outdoor concert venue, is located adjacent to the Charles River Esplanade. Other parks are scattered throughout the city, with the major parks and beaches located near Castle Island; in Charlestown; and along the Dorchester, South Boston, and East Boston shorelines.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Robotnik {{managed to}} capture all of <b>the</b> Chaos <b>Emeralds,</b> but an {{accident}} in the testing phase of his new ultimate weapon, the [...] "Atomic Destroyer", scatters <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> all across <b>the</b> island. While Sonic and Tails are out to retrieve them, they are cut short by Knuckles the Echidna. Robotnik finds <b>the</b> yellow <b>Emerald</b> first, and dupes Knuckles into believing Sonic and Tails are out to steal <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds.</b>|$|R
50|$|A new logo, {{based upon}} Sasquatch, {{was adopted by}} <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> in 2012. In 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> partnered with Voodoo Doughnut to offer a bacon maple bratwurst as a {{specialty}} food item. Following the 2014 season, <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> switched from being an affiliate of the San Diego Padres to the Chicago Cubs, who signed Eugene to a two-year deal through 2016. The player development contract was extended through the 2018 season on June 14, 2016.|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to steal <b>the</b> six Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and harness their power, the game's antagonist, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, has trapped the animal {{inhabitants}} of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt Robotnik's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting <b>the</b> <b>emeralds</b> himself. If <b>the</b> player collects all <b>the</b> Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and completes <b>the</b> game, an ending sequence is shown. If all <b>the</b> <b>emeralds</b> are not collected, Robotnik taunts the player while juggling any of <b>the</b> Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> not collected by the player.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Emerald</b> Drive interchange {{was scheduled for}} the year 1971. While the El Camino Real interchange was already a diamond interchange, the state planned to add traffic signals to the ramps to accommodate more congestion from the nearby mall. <b>The</b> <b>Emerald</b> Drive interchange was completed in September, {{and the rest of}} the project was to be completed by the end of the year, leaving Jefferson Drive as the only remaining traffic signal. Construction on the Jefferson Street interchange began in early 1972; the section from I-5 east to Melrose Drive (along the routing of the Vista Way Freeway) had been upgraded to full freeway standards as of 1973.|$|E

5|$|First {{played in}} 2002 {{when it was}} called the Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl, {{organizers}} announced a new name in May 2004 for that year's iteration of the annual game for the 2004–05 NCAA football bowl season. The new title for the game was derived from <b>the</b> <b>Emerald</b> Nuts brand owned by the game's primary sponsor, Diamond Foods. Originally, the game was to feature the sixth bowl eligible team from the Pacific-10 Conference and the third eligible team from the Mountain West Conference.|$|E
50|$|Tikal discovers <b>the</b> Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and <b>the</b> Master <b>Emerald</b> and befriends Chaos, the Emeralds' {{peaceful}} guardian, {{as well as}} the Chao.

50|$|They are {{the basis}} {{of many of the}} games' plots, and the player is {{frequently}} required to collect them all to fully defeat Doctor Eggman and achieve the games' good endings, super forms, or both. The methods used to acquire <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> and <b>the</b> end-results after collecting them differ between titles in the series. Most early games require the player to find <b>the</b> <b>emeralds</b> in Special Stages, while some modern games implement <b>the</b> <b>emeralds</b> as a plot element. In certain games, such as Sonic R and the 8-bit versions of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the player is required to find <b>the</b> Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> within <b>the</b> zones themselves.|$|R
50|$|The plot {{begins with}} the theft of <b>the</b> chaos <b>emeralds</b> from South Island by Dr. Robotnik. Since the peace and {{integrity}} of the island depend upon the presence and unity of all six <b>emeralds,</b> <b>the</b> theft causes earthquakes and turmoil. Sonic and Tails learn from Flicky the Bluebird that <b>the</b> <b>emeralds</b> have been taken from the island's North Cave. They then {{chance to see the}} evil Dr. Robotnik flying away with <b>the</b> red chaos <b>emerald.</b> In order to prevent South Island from eventually collapsing into the ocean, Sonic and Tails set out to reclaim <b>the</b> <b>emeralds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Having {{suffered}} from long-standing recurrent kidney disease {{that made it}} necessary, from the 1880s, for him to conduct sitting down, Sullivan died of heart failure, following an attack of bronchitis, at his flat in London on 22 November 1900. His unfinished opera, <b>The</b> <b>Emerald</b> Isle, was completed by Edward German and produced in 1901. His Te Deum Laudamus, written to commemorate {{the end of the}} Boer War, was performed posthumously.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} of invasive pests, techniques of pest control {{are often used}} in combination. An example is <b>the</b> <b>emerald</b> ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of <b>the</b> <b>emerald</b> ash borer. Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Emerald</b> City, Glinda {{confronts the}} Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as {{identical}} to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, {{and the cause}} of her green skin. He breaks down in agony, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda orders the Wizard to leave Oz and sends Madame Morrible to prison for murdering Nessarose.|$|E

50|$|In August 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> {{announced}} their relocation to the University of Oregon's PK Park for the 2010 season. <b>The</b> <b>Emeralds</b> cited Civic Stadium's need of substantial renovations, major problems with irrigation and electrical systems, {{as well as}} broken seats, and estimated that modernization could {{cost as much as}} $15 million.|$|R
5|$|Kentucky Extension specialists suggest {{selecting}} uncommon {{species to}} replace removed ashes in the landscape. Previous generations created monocultures by planting ash trees in an overabundance, {{a factor in}} the extent of the devastation caused by <b>the</b> <b>emerald</b> ash borer. Favoring instead a diversity in species helps keep urban forests healthy. University of Kentucky scientists suggest choosing monotypic species such as the pawpaw, yellowwood, Franklin tree, Kentucky coffeetree, Osage orange, sourwood, and baldcypress.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles {{encounters}} Rouge and Eggman, who try {{to steal}} the Master Emerald. He stops them by shattering <b>the</b> <b>emerald</b> and searches for the scattered shards. Rouge, spying for the government, heads to Eggman's base and the ARK. There, Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another superweapon created by Gerald, and discloses his plan: to charge the cannon with Chaos Emeralds {{and use it to}} take over the world. Rouge appears, offering them a Chaos Emerald to gain their trust.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this meaning is found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. <b>The</b> <b>Emerald</b> City in this story {{is a place where}} {{everyone}} wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.|$|E
25|$|Knuckles restores <b>the</b> Master <b>Emerald,</b> but Angel Island falls {{again when}} Chaos attacks him and Eggman. Chaos reabsorbs <b>the</b> Chaos <b>Emeralds</b> and locates <b>the</b> seventh inside the crashed Tornado II. Chaos {{transforms}} into Perfect Chaos, draining <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> of their negative energy, and destroys Station Square in a flood. Sonic's friends gather <b>the</b> <b>emeralds</b> and Tikal appears, demanding that Chaos be sealed back in <b>the</b> Master <b>Emerald.</b> Sonic objects, saying Chaos's heart {{would still be}} filled with anger and sadness. Instead, Sonic uses the Emeralds' positive energy to become Super Sonic and defeat Perfect Chaos. Chaos discovers the Chao thrive in Station Square, quelling its anger. Tikal and Chaos disappear before Sonic chases a fleeing Eggman.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{accounts}} on {{the exploitation of}} minerals silver, copper, iron and gold vary, the chroniclers agree on <b>the</b> <b>emeralds.</b> To extract <b>the</b> <b>emeralds</b> from <b>the</b> surrounding rock, the Muzo used pointed wooden poles, called coa. The veins containing the minerals were cleaned with water. After extraction, the Muzo people elaborated the minerals.|$|R

5|$|Selective mirrors {{to create}} {{interference}} effects are formed of micron-sized bowl-shaped pits lined with {{multiple layers of}} chitin in the wing scales of Papilio palinurus, <b>the</b> <b>emerald</b> swallowtail butterfly. These act as highly selective mirrors for two wavelengths of light. Yellow light is reflected directly from the centres of the pits; blue light is reflected twice by {{the sides of the}} pits. The combination appears green, but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope.|$|E
5|$|That season, an {{economic}} recession factored into the selections. In general, bowl officials attempted to select teams in close geographic proximity {{to compensate for}} an anticipated drop in ticket sales. Maryland, however, stated {{that they would not}} accept a berth to face in-state rival Navy in the nearby EagleBank Bowl due to a conflict with the school's final exams. <b>The</b> <b>Emerald</b> Bowl was not seen as a viable choice due to Maryland's participation in it the year prior.|$|E
5|$|The island's lush vegetation, {{a product}} of its mild climate and {{frequent}} rainfall, earns it the sobriquet <b>the</b> <b>Emerald</b> Isle. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas {{in the world at}} similar latitudes. This {{is a result of the}} moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South-Western Atlantic.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, a {{treasure}} hunter named Nack the Weasel {{takes advantage of}} the fact that they are all distracted with fighting one another, in order to take <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds</b> for himself. He does not know of the power of <b>the</b> <b>Emeralds,</b> only that they'd be worth a lot of money, so he sets out to take them for himself before the others do.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> mining of <b>emeralds</b> was {{conducted}} using coas, long thick wooden poles. The people dug holes {{during the rainy}} seasons next to the emerald-containing rocks and <b>the</b> <b>emeralds</b> from sedimentary rocks would wash into the holes that dried up and provided <b>the</b> clean <b>emeralds.</b> Emeralds from veins in metamorphic rocks were excavated using sharp poles.|$|R
