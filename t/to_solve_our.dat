500|$|On 30 March 2010, Alan Johnson, {{the then}} Home Secretary, {{announced}} mephedrone {{would be made}} illegal [...] "within weeks" [...] after the ACMD sent him {{a report on the}} use of cathinones. The legislation would make all cathinones illegal, which Johnson said would [...] "stop unscrupulous manufacturers and others peddling different but similarly harmful drugs". The ACMD had run into problems with the UK Government in 2009 regarding drugs policy, after the government did not follow the advice of the ACMD to reclassify ecstasy and cannabis, culminating in the dismissal of the ACMD chairman, David Nutt, after he reiterated the ACMD's findings in an academic lecture. Several members resigned after he was sacked, and prior to the announcement that mephedrone was to be banned, the trend continued when Dr Polly Taylor resigned, saying she [...] "did not have trust" [...] in the way the government would use the advice given by the ACMD. Eric Carlin, a member of the ACMD and former chairman of the English Drug Education Forum, also resigned after the announcement. He said the decision by the Home Secretary was [...] "unduly based on media and political pressure" [...] and there was [...] "little or no discussion about how our recommendation to classify this drug would be likely to impact on young people's behaviour." [...] Some former members of the ACMD and various charity groups expressed concern over the banning of the drug, arguing it would inevitably criminalise users, particularly young people. Others expressed concern that the drug would be left in the hands of black market dealers, who will only compound the problem. Carlin's resignation was specifically linked to the criminalisation of mephedrone, he stated: [...] "We need to review our entire approach to drugs, dumping the idea that legally-sanctioned punishments for drug users should constitute a main part of the armoury in helping <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>our</b> country’s drug problems. We need to stop harming people who need help and support".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{model of}} dynamic parking {{facility}} location is proposed in this research. A dynamic p-median problem of parking facility is considered. One important characteristic {{of this study}} is that the parking demand predicted in our model is changing over a given time horizon, i. e., the demand is time dependent. Besides, the parking facilities are built one at a time at given times. Once a new facility is built, some of the drivers (customers) will use its services and some of them will patronize an existing facility. At any given time, drivers patronize the closest parking facility under enough capacity. The problem is to find the best parking facility location for the new facilities. The problem is formulated and the potential algorithm is proposed for this present time. However, a standard mathematical programming code AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming) is adopted here <b>to</b> <b>solving</b> <b>our</b> formulated problem...|$|R
