25|$|The {{ruling is}} controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol {{industry}} complained that this rule overstates the {{environmental effects of}} corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} is being tied to US ethanol production. The initial reference value set for 2011 for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs. CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> will be plenty of time and economic incentive to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.|$|E

40|$|As a {{topic of}} my diploma work I {{decided to make a}} {{research}} of today's student' s attitudes to their approach of ideal male/female.

There was 100 participants in my research, all of them were students of various universities in Prague, in age from 19 to 36 years. As a representatives of humane branch there are students of Hussite Theological Faculty (HTF) and Philosophical Faculty (FF) of Charles University in Prague. The non-humane branch is represented by Agricultural University (ČZU) and by Faculty of Engineering of Czech Technical Unversity (ČVUT) ...|$|R

60|$|The {{observation}} is just: a show may bring {{some people to}} a shop, {{but it is the}} fame of business that brings business; and nothing raises the fame of a shop like its being a shop of good trade already; then people go to it, because they think other people go to it, and because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is good choice of goods; their gilding and painting may go a little way, but it is the having a shop well filled with goods,[29] having good choice to sell, and selling reasonable--these are the things that bring a trade, and a trade thus brought will stand by you and last; for fame of trade brings trade anywhere.|$|E

6000|$|Other {{philosophers}} since Berkeley {{have also}} held that, although the table {{does not depend}} for its existence upon being seen by me, it does depend upon being seen (or otherwise apprehended in sensation) by some mind--not necessarily the mind of God, but more often the whole collective mind of the universe. This they hold, as Berkeley does, chiefly because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> can be nothing real--or at any rate nothing known to be real except minds and their thoughts and feelings. We might state the argument by which they support their view in some such way as this: 'Whatever {{can be thought of}} is an idea {{in the mind of the}} person thinking of it; therefore nothing can be thought of except ideas in minds; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is inconceivable cannot exist.' ...|$|E

He says: [...] "Are not Abana and Pharpar rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them and be clean?" [...] But some of my readers have forgotten who Naaman was, long ago. Naaman was the commander of the Syrian armies. He was the favorite of the king and lived in great state. [...] "He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper."
