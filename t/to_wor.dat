Her daily woman's-advice show presented a kind and witty grandmother figure with a Missouri-drawl. In 1937, she launched on the national CBS radio network a similar and highly successful show. As Mary Margaret McBride, she interviewed figures well known in the world of arts, entertainment, and politics for 45 minutes, using a style recognized as original to herself. In the 1940s the daily audience for her housewife-oriented program numbered from six to eight million listeners.|$|E

COPD manifests after extended inhalation exposure to toxic agents such as cigarette smoke [3], and continued exposure among those with established disease is associated with worse disease severity [1]. We have previously shown that indoor air pollution, particularly particulate matter less than 2. 5 micron in diameter (PM 2. 5), even at relatively low concentrations observed in US homes, was associ-ated with increased respiratory symptoms and risk of severe COPD exacerbations in former smokers with moderate to severe COPD [4].

50|$|The English {{language}} flagship is WOR, which {{acquired the}} radio {{rights to the}} Mets during the 2013 offseason. The Mets had previously aired their games on WFAN since the station was founded in 1987, and factoring in the station's predecessors the relationship dated back to 1983. The relationship with WFAN ended following the 2013 season when the station acquired the radio rights to the New York Yankees from corporate sibling WCBS. The Mets' move <b>to</b> <b>WOR</b> makes the team the first professional team since the now-Brooklyn Nets to air its games on the station; the Nets, along with their then-arenamates the New Jersey Devils, were picked up by WFAN following the station's loss of broadcast rights for the New York Knicks and New York Rangers in 2004. WEPN is the Spanish flagship.|$|E
50|$|WOR's most renowned {{program was}} its morning show Rambling with Gambling, which aired {{continuously}} from March 1925 to September 2000 across {{three generations of}} hosts: John B.

Gambling's edition of the show was dropped, he moved to WABC, where he hosted a late-morning show until January 2008. He returned <b>to</b> <b>WOR</b> mornings in May 2008. Although never a favorite of young listeners, WOR was this group's radio station of record in the New York metropolitan area during bad winter weather. Students of all ages dialed up 710 AM on their radios as the Gamblings dutifully announced a comprehensive list of school closings for New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, in strict alphabetical order. Currently, Gambling hosts middays on 970 WNYM, after retiring from WOR in December 2013.|$|E

Grant's ratings {{were not to}} blame for his departure, {{according}} to the New York Post, which mentioned that the decision was reached because the station's other shows had niche audiences to garner more advertising dollars. On January 16, 2006, shortly after Grant's last WOR show, Grant appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show and TV program Hannity & Colmes, where his former competitor paid tribute to him. Having left his options open for [...] "an offer he cannot refuse," [...] Grant returned <b>to</b> <b>WOR</b> in February 2006, doing one minute [...] "Straight Ahead" [...] commentaries which aired twice daily after news broadcasts until September 2006. On September 8, 2006 Grant again appeared on Hannity's show to provide a post-retirement update, which led to premature rumors that Grant was returning to WABC. Grant then made various isolated radio appearances. He appeared as a guest host on WFNY (now WBMP) on December 7, 2006, and was interviewed by attorney Anthony Macri for Macri's WOR show on February 24, 2007.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, Golub merged his two {{professional}} interests, Judaism and broadcasting, {{to create}} the 501c3 organization, Jewish Education in Media, Inc (JEM). JEM's first production was a weekly radio-magazine Golub produced and hosted called [...] "L'Chayim," [...] which premiered on the first Sunday of February 1979 and which since then has never missed a Sunday. “Highlighting the people, issues and events of importance to the Jewish community," [...] L'Chayim did on radio what Sh'ma magazine had done in print; it created a forum for dialogue among Jews from every sector of the Jewish community. The program premiered on WMCA Radio, moved <b>to</b> <b>WOR</b> Radio, and in 1990 premiered on television as well. L'Chayim is currently seen weeknights as the flagship program of Shalom TV. In 1991, after Chavurot Aytz Chayim sponsored Jewish families from the former Soviet Union immigrating to America during Operation Exodus, Golub teamed up with immigrant Michael Pravin, {{to create the}} first Russian-language television channel in the United States to {{serve the needs of}} thousands of Jews from the FSU who could not speak English. Calling it The Russian Television Network of America, RTN premiered as a channel on Cablevision in October 1992. RTN was enthusiastically received by the Russian-speaking communities of Brooklyn and the Bronx, and soon was soon a topic of conversation in Russian communities across the country.Golub speaks almost no Russian but he developed a presence on the channel as the president and a friend to all, and over time he established a devoted following and is now beloved among the Russian Jewish community, especially in Brighton Beach and other Russian-populated parts of Brooklyn and the surrounding areas. Golub has received multiple honors for his work as the creator of RTN.|$|E
