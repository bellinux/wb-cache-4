The Green Deal {{has also been}} criticized by the Citizens Advice Bureau for its lack of protection for consumers, particularly those inheriting a Green Deal when <b>taking</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>property</b> The policy has also been criticized by senior Conservative MPs, when it was revealed that for any work on a property to get planning permission it would also be forced to take on a Green Deal. This has been dubbed a 'conservatory tax' by the media. Consumer Focus has also raised concerns about the lack of consumer redress, particularly for those who inherit a Green Deal. This secondary mis-selling would mean that unless the Green Deal provider issued a transferable warranty for the works under current contract law, the new occupiers who had not agreed the original contract would be unable to get compensation or repairs if the Green Deal installation was later found to be faulty, for example causes damp.|$|E
