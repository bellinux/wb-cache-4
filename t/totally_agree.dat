Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in many regions, except in Latin America, {{where it has been}} poorly studied. The objective was to determine the Trauma Evaluation and Management course effectiveness, and whether greater effectiveness is achieved in basic- or clinic-cycle students, as well as student perception. Material and methodsDescriptive, observational, longitudinal and prospective study. Two tests were performed, pre- and post-course; the manual was read by the students prior to both tests. Students were divided into 2 groups: group A (consisting of 71 basic-cycle medical students) and group B (consisting of 44 clinical-cycle medical students). ResultsGroup A achieved a 2. 45 increase (p 0. 05) from pre- to post-course tests. There was a significant difference between groups in both evaluations (pre-course test p 0. 05), with no difference in improvement (p> 0. 05). Using a questionnaire, 92. 17 % of the students <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> that the course improved their trauma knowledge, 76. 52 % that it increased their trauma clinical skills, with 94. 78 % being totally satisfied with the course, and 86. 09 % <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> that Trauma Evaluation and Management course should be in Medicine curriculum.

He is almost always in command {{at a crime scene}} or in the field if Captain Raydor is not present. His years of experience as a detective give him keen insight on criminal behavior which serves the MCD well while working cases. He is often mentoring the younger detectives in his unit whether he wants to or not. Respecting Provenza's many years experience as a seasoned homicide detective, Captain Raydor often asks Provenza for his assessment of a case or incident. When Raydor first takes over the squad, she and Provenza clash often as Provenza feels he should be in charge and she barely outranks him. He also doesn't like her policy of deal-making. However, as the show goes on, he grows to respect her and acts as a fatherly figure to her adopted son Rusty. In one early episode, when Rusty accuses Raydor of not caring about him, Provenza berates him, telling him he may not like Raydor, but she clearly cares very deeply about Rusty. Provenza's words cause Rusty to realize his mistake and make amends with Raydor. As the show goes on, Provenza gets more supportive of Raydor, occasionally referring to her by her first name and comforting her at times. The two come to have an easy working relationship with mutual respect and Raydor relies on him a lot.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} concrete structures is directly tied to two factors: concrete durability and strength. When assessing {{the durability of}} concrete structures, {{the study of the}} water penetration is paramount, because almost all reactions like corrosion, alkali–silica, sulfate, etc., which produce their deterioration, require the presence of water. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has shown to be very sensitive to water variations. On this basis, the objective of this experimental study is, firstly, to analyze the correlation between the water penetration depth in concrete samples and the GPR wave parameters. To do this, the samples were immersed into water for different time intervals and the wave parameters were obtained from signals registered when the antenna was placed on the immersed surface of the samples. Secondly, a procedure has been developed to be able to determine, from those signals, the reliability in the detection and location of waterfront depths. The results have revealed that GPR may have an enormous potential in this field, because excellent agreements were found between the correlated variables.
