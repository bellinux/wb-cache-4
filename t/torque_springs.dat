Modular resistive packs comprising constant <b>torque</b> <b>springs</b> provide constant force opposing the withdrawal of an exercise cable from the device. In addition to uses within the space program, the compact resistive packs of the CFREU allow the unit to be small enough for easy use as a home gym for personal use, or as a supplement for rehabilitation programs. Resistive packs may be changed conveniently out of the CFREU according to the desired exercise regimen. Thus, the resistive packs replace the need for expensive, heavy, and bulky traditional weight plates. The CFREU may be employed by hospitals, rehabilitation and physical therapy clinics, and other related professional businesses...|$|E

40|$|Spring brake {{orthosis}} (SBO) concentrates purely on {{the knee}} to generate the swing phase of the paraplegic gait with the required hip flexion occurring passively {{as a consequence of}} the ipsilateral knee flexion, generated by releasing the torsion spring mounted at the knee joint. Electrical stimulation then drives the knee back to full extension, as well as restores the spring potential energy. In this paper, genetic algorithm (GA) and its variant multi-objective GA (MOGA) is used to perform the search operation for the ‘best’ spring parameters for the SBO spring mounted on an average sized subject simulated in the sagittal plane. Conventional torsion spring is tested against constant <b>torque</b> type <b>spring</b> in terms of swing duration as, based on first principles, it is hypothesized that constant <b>torque</b> <b>spring</b> would be able to produce slower SBO swing phase as might be preferred in assisted paraplegic gait. In line with the hypothesis, it is found that it is not possible to delay the occurrence of the flexion peak of the SBO swing phase further than its occurrence in the natural gait. The use of conventional torsion spring causes the swing knee flexion peak to appear rather faster than that of the natural gait, resulting in a potentially faster swing phase and hence gait cycle. The constant <b>torque</b> type <b>spring</b> on the other hand is able to stretch duration of the swing phase to some extent, rendering it the preferable spring type in SBO...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Resorption of {{the root}} of the maxillary incisors during ectopic {{eruption}} of the maxillary canines is not an uncommon phenomenon, and must be considered in all patients with seriously diverging eruption of the maxillary canines. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on the diagnosis and treatment of a 10 -year-old Chinese boy with severe crowding and risk of root resorptions caused by impacted canines in the upper arch and reverse overjet. With the aid of cone-beam computed tomography, the upper right canine crown of our patient was positioned in close proximity to the right lateral incisor while the left canine crown was hitting the root apex of the left lateral incisor. To avoid any progress of root resorption, use of an upper fixed palatal appliance with <b>torquing</b> <b>spring</b> to move the root of lateral incisors away from the canines, plus extraction of upper primary first molars, was selected as an interceptive treatment.

The work described in this paper includes the design and testing of a mechanical pitch change mechanism based on a constant <b>torque</b> <b>spring</b> for an off-the-shelf propeller. A propeller performance prediction code, based on the vortex lattice method, in combination with a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize a propeller for given motor performance data.

40|$|Stability of SCC mixes {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} requirements since SCC mixes are balancing on a thin line between stability and segregation, due to the basic philosophy behind those mixes: combining a high fluidity and a high resistance to segregation. Since SCC mixes tend to be matrix dominant, experiments were first of all carried out on the different SCC pastes. Instability of the SCC pastes means that the density in the top region of those pastes decreases, due to the sinking of the heavy particles of the dispersion to the bottom of the recipient. The more unstable the SCC paste, the more the density decreases. The evolution of the density in the top region in function of time is measured using Archimedes’ Law. Since an object, hanging in a liquid, undergoes a buoyance force which is function of the surrounding density of the liquid; the evolution in time of the density (and so the stability of the SCC paste) can be followed up by recording the upward force in time. Rheology of the SCC pastes is studied by means of a (miniature) vane shear test. The test consists of inserting a four-bladed vane in the end of a SCC paste sample and rotating it at a constant rate to determine the torque required to cause a cylindrical surface to be sheared by the vane. The torque is measured by a calibrated <b>torque</b> <b>spring</b> that is attached directly to the vane and converted to a unit shearing resistance of the cylindrical surface area. By those test setups, different fillers and different paste compositions are studied in order to find optimum fillers, mixes respectively. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The soil {{mechanics}} surface sampler {{was designed to}} dig, scrape, and trench the lunar surface and to transport lunar surface material while being photographed so that {{the properties of the}} lunar surface could be determined. The sampler was mounted below the television camera and consisted primarily of a scoop approximately 120 mm long and 50 mm wide. The scoop consisted of a container, a sharpened blade, and an electric motor to open and close the container. A small footpad was attached to the scoop door to present a flat surface to the lunar surface. The scoop was capable of holding a maximum quantity of approximately 32 mm diameter of solid lunar material and a maximum of 100 cm³ of granular material. The scoop was mounted on a pantograph arm that could be extended about 1.5 m or retracted close to the spacecraft motor drive. The arm could also be moved from an azimuth of +40 to -72 degrees or be elevated 130 mm by motor drives. It could also be dropped onto the lunar surface under force provided by gravity and a spring. The surface sampler performed seven bearing tests, four trench tests, and 13 impact tests. The total operating time was 18 hours, 22 minutes on 10 separate occasions. Measurements of motor currents and forces applied to the surface were not obtained due to the state of the spacecraft telemetry following landing on the lunar surface. However, estimations were possible. The small spring constant of the <b>torque</b> <b>spring</b> precluded the determination of density from the impact tests. Penetrations of 38 to 50 mm were obtained from the bearing tests, and a 175 mm depth was reached during trenching operations. The design of the mechanism and its electronic auxiliary was more than adequate for the lunar surface operations.|$|R

50|$|Another {{reason to}} add a lever to the {{mousetrap}} bar {{is to reduce the}} amount of torque applied to the wheels. If too much torque is applied to the wheels, the force between the wheels and the ground will exceed the maximum frictional force due to the coefficient of friction between the wheel and ground surfaces. When this happens, the wheels slip and energy stored in the spring is wasted. Using a long lever on the mousetrap bar reduces the tension in the string due to the <b>spring's</b> <b>torque,</b> and thus reduces the torque applied to the car's wheels.|$|R

50|$|A common hammer {{design has}} the hammer able to slide and rotate on a shaft, with a spring {{holding it in}} the {{downwards}} position. Between the hammer and the driving shaft is a steel ball on a ramp, such that if the input shaft rotates ahead of the hammer with enough <b>torque,</b> the <b>spring</b> is compressed and the hammer is slid backwards. On {{the bottom of the}} hammer, and the top of the anvil, are dog teeth, designed for high impacts. When the tool is used, the hammer rotates until its dog teeth contact the teeth on the anvil, stopping the hammer from rotating. The input shaft continues to turn, causing the ramp to lift the steel ball, lifting the hammer assembly until the dog teeth no longer engage the anvil, and the hammer is free to spin again. The hammer then springs forward {{to the bottom of the}} ball ramp, and is accelerated by the input shaft, until the dog teeth contact the anvil again, delivering the impact. The process then repeats, delivering blows every time the teeth meet, almost always twice per revolution. If the output has little load on it, such as when spinning a loose nut on a bolt, the torque will never be high enough to cause the ball to compress the spring, and the input will smoothly drive the output. This design has the advantage of small size and simplicity, but energy is wasted moving the entire hammer back and forth, and delivering multiple blows per revolution gives less time for the hammer to accelerate. This design is often seen after a gear reduction, compensating for the lack of acceleration time by delivering more torque at a lower speed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Series elastic {{actuators}} primarily use linear {{springs in}} their drivetrains, which introduces a design tradeoff: soft <b>springs</b> provide higher <b>torque</b> resolution {{at the cost}} of system bandwidth, whereas stiff springs provide a fast response but lower <b>torque</b> resolution. Nonlinear <b>springs</b> (NLSs) poten-tially incorporate the benefits of both soft and stiff springs, but such springs are often large. An NLS design was recently proposed that combines a variable radius cam with a rubber elastic element, enabling a compact spring design. However, the rubber introduces hysteresis, which can lead to poor torque tracking if not accounted for in the controller. To overcome this limitation, we here propose a state observer that captures hysteretic effects exhibited by the rubber to provide an accurate estimate of actuator torque. We perform torque-control experiments with this observer on an actuator testbed and compare the performance of the NLS to both soft and stiff linear metal springs. Experiments show that the NLS exhibits improved output impedance compared to both linear springs, and comparable bandwidth to the stiff linear spring up to 1. 5 Hz. However, the hysteresis in the urethane rubber introduces instability in higher-frequency conditions, suggesting that future NLS designs can be improved by use of a different rubber as the elastic element.

40|$|This work is an {{an early}} stage of a larger project aiming at {{answering}} the question whether or not the Preisach map is really fingerprinting magnetic materials. More precisely, we are interested whether Preisach model of magnetic hysteresis indeed contains any physics or is just a convenient modeling tool. To this extent we study a very simple mechanical system, thus fully tractable, subjected to the external force. Despite of its simplicity, our model captures all the fundamental features of real magnetic materials, namely their hysteretic behavior, coercivity, remanent magnetization and saturation at high fields. Both the overall shape of major hysteresis loop as well as First Order Reversal Curves (FORC's) are reproduced quite correctly; they are very similar to those observed in magnetic materials. The model essentially consists of a single, spring loaded, rigid and rotative bar with non-zero friction torque. The length of a projection of this bar onto the direction of an external force is identified with magnetization.

40|$|This {{research}} identifies an eleven {{degree of}} freedom dynamic model of MABEL, a new robot {{for the study of}} bipedal walking and running. Model parameters are identified on the basis of fourteen angles measured by encoders and the commanded torque of the robot’s four independent actuators. The identification process is modular and begins with the cable-driven transmission mechanism of the robot. By blocking an appropriate pulley, the springs {{that are part of the}} transmission can be removed from the initial portion of the identification process. Furthermore, by selectively connecting and disconnecting cables in the transmission, experiments are designed for each actuated coordinate in order to determine inertias, friction coefficients, motor constants, and power amplifier biases of the transmission system. With the identified transmission model and estimates of the inertial parameters of the torso and legs from a CAD package, a priori estimates of the robot’s overall dynamic model can be constructed. These a priori estimates are initially validated by comparing predicted response of the combined legs and transmission system to experimental data excited by common torque commands. At this point, the compliant elements in the transmission are brought back into the system and are identified with a set of static experiments. Specifically, spring stiffness is estimated from the <b>spring</b> <b>torques</b> and deflections. A second unplanned source of compliance is accounted for next.

40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the spring loaded rack and pinion. This spring loading arrangement consists of yoke nut, spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The spring loading arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this <b>torque</b> requirement, the <b>spring</b> loading can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in spring loading. The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R

Results: There was a significant difference between the error at higher <b>torques</b> in the <b>spring</b> wrenches compared with the friction wrenches (P< 0. 05). At higher torques, an error greater than 10 % was more common in the friction wrenches (29. 4 %) than in the spring wrenches (4. 3 %). No significant differences were observed regarding the duration instruments usage and the mean numerical error at high and low torque.

At higher torques the Straumann system produced the least error and the Biohorizon system produced the greatest error which was significantly greater than the other systems (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Our results indicate that spring wrenches produce more accurate results than friction wrenches; however, friction wrenches are more reliable at lower torques than higher torques. The length of time in use and sterilization of torque wrenches does not affect the function of the instruments significantly. The precision of the instrument system used is also important...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} external force manipulations on movements in different directions, while keeping the amplitude invariant. Subjects (n= 10) performed a series of cyclical anteroposterior, mediolateral, and oblique line-drawing movements (star drawing task) with their dominant limb in the horizontal plane. To dissociate kinematics from the underlying patterns of muscle activation, spring loading {{was applied to the}} forearm of the moving limb. Whereas spring loading of the arm resulted in considerable changes in the overall amount of muscle activation in the elbow and shoulder muscles, invariance was largely maintained at the kinematic level. Subjects produced the required movement directions and amplitudes of the star drawing largely successfully, irrespective of the force bias induced by the spring. These observations demonstrate motor equivalence and strengthen the notion that the spatial representation of drawing movements is encoded in the higher brain regions in a rather abstract form that is dissociated from the concrete muscle activation patterns underlying a particular movement direction. To achieve this goal, the central nervous system shifted between two or more muscle grouping strategies to overcome modulations in the interaction among posture-dependent (joint stiffness), dynamic (inertial), and elastic (<b>spring)</b> <b>torque</b> components in the joints. Spring loading induced general changes in the overall amount of EMG activity, which was largely muscle but not direction specific, presumably to represent the posture-dependent biasing force of the spring. Loading was mainly shown to increase muscle coactivation in the elbow joint. This indicates that the subjects tended to increase stiffness in the elbow to compensate for changes in the spring bias forces in order to minimize trajectory errors. Changes in muscle grouping of the shoulder antagonists were mainly a consequence of movement direction but were also affected partly by loading, presumably reflecting the influence of dynamic force components. Taken together, the results confirmed the hypothesis that changes of movement direction and direction of force in the end-effector generated specific sets of muscle grouping to overcome the dynamic requirements in the joints while keeping the kinematics largely unchanged. This suggests that directional tuning in muscle activity and changes in muscle grouping reflects the formation of appropriate internal models in the CNS that give rise to motor equivalence. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Each {{year there}} are several {{thousand}} reported cases of vehicles rolling over in the United States, with 80 % of all fatal accidents involving rollover in Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs), trucks or vans.

Determining whether a vehicle will roll over before the event occurs provides advanced warning and the ability to apply active and/or passive safety countermeasures.

We present a vehicle rollover prediction algorithm that gives the current state as well as future states, allowing the system to determine if the conditions necessary for rollover will be achieved before the conditions are measured by the sensors, increasing lead time to perform preventative countermeasures. ^ We develop a control strategy to prevent rollover utilizing fully active suspension to generate a roll prevention torque on the vehicle.

We consider actuation rate and magnitude limits for such systems based on existing hardware and implement the control on a simulation model in CarSim. Using simulation we demonstrate the prevention of rollover in both the flick turn and fishhook turn maneuvers subject to the actuation constraints. It is shown that this control strategy is able to increase the lateral acceleration limitation before rollover is achieved, verified on highly dynamic maneuvers where the lateral load transfer is maximized. ^ Our goal is to achieve improved roll prevention without requiring the system to be constantly active as such approach has negative effects on the efficiency of the vehicle overall. We show in simulation results that activation of the controller only once liftoff has been predicted increases the maximum sustained lateral accelerations that the vehicle can encounter without rolling over. It is shown with realistic actuation torque limitations that such system can reduce the risk of rollover for highly dynamic steering inputs that maximize lateral load transfer. ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the output}} of an impact wrench, when hammering, is a very short impact force, the actual {{effective}} torque is difficult to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed torque, the actual output torque changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the specified amount of torque in some specified time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an impact wrench is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or overtightened using an impact wrench. Special socket extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an impact wrench to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output <b>torque.</b> Designed with <b>spring</b> steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some impact wrenches designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an impact wrench is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many air impact wrenches incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the reversing valve, allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|R
40|$|International audienceModel {{exchange}} coupled composite media, namely ͓Co/ Pd͔ 5 / Pd͑(t) / ͓Co/ Ni͔ 3 / Co multilayers, deposited onto prepatterned substrates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in bit patterned recording. Optimizing {{the thickness of the}} Pd interlayer allows decreasing the switching field ͑Hc and switching field distribution SFD ͒while maintaining thermal stability. The dependence of the remanent coercivity on the external field angle indicates that the gain in H C and SFD originates from the incoherent magnetization reversal introduced by slightly decoupling the hard and soft multilayer stacks. This tendency is confirmed by further reductions in H C and SFD, when inserting another Pd interlayer within the hard ͓Co/ Pd͔ 5 stack. Bit patterned recording ͑BPR͒ is a leading candidate to extend the densities in magnetic data storage beyond those achievable by conventional continuous perpendicular magnetic recording ͑PMR͒ based on granular media. BPR involves a lithographically patterned media, where each magnetic island corresponds to a single bit. At remanence, each discrete island maintains a single domain state with its uniform magnetization aligned to a well defined uni-axial aniso-tropy axis ͑commonly perpendicular to the disk͒. The thermal stability of a BPR magnetic bit is given in the macrospin approximation by the product K u V, where K u is the magnetic anisotropy energy density and V is the volume of one island. The bits are considered thermally stable for KuV = 60 k B T, where k B is the Boltzman constant and T is the temperature. Increasing the areal density implies decreasing V. However, any loss in V needs to be compensated for by an increase in K u in order to maintain a proper thermal stability. But the maximum anisotropy is limited by the maximum field that the write head can provide in a hard disk drive. Therefore, improving both thermal stability and writability of bit pat-terned media ͑BPM͒ is an important issue for reaching areal densities higher than 1 Tb/ in 2. Another critical issue for implementing BPM is that the switching field distribution ͑SFD͒, i. e., the bit-to-bit variation in coercive field needs to be narrow enough to secure exact addressability of individual predefined bits without overwrit-ing adjacent bits. The SFD has the two following main components: the dipolar interactions between neighboring islands within the array and the so-called intrinsic SFD of each individual island. 1, 2 Depending on the head field gradient, the head-media spacing and the write-synchronization tolerances, a SFD value lower than 1 kOe is required for areal density beyond 1 Tb/ in 2, considering a media with a static coercive field of around 5 to 7 kOe ͑Ref. 3 ͒. This value is about two times lower than the SFD measured in current PMR media. While in a single spin approximation, writability, and thermal stability are correlated via K u, it has been recently demonstrated that an improved PMR writability to thermal stability ratio can be achieved by changing the magnetization reversal mechanism. For instance, incoherent reversal is obtained in exchange-spring or exchange coupled composite ͑ECC͒ structures. 4, 5 These heterogeneous systems consist of at least two coupled layers with different anisotropies. During the reversal process, the soft layer ͑SL͒ moment starts reversing first and forces the hard layer ͑HL͒ moment to follow via the interlayer exchange coupling. The <b>torque</b> or the <b>spring</b> produced by the SL moment allows decreasing the switching field of the HL stack, while conserving thermal stability. A large number of theoretical calculations 6 and experimental studies have been reported on PMR media...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{due to a}} need {{to reduce}} emissions, the {{automotive}} industry has focused on increasing vehicle efficiency. One of the areas being examined for potential improvement is the automatic transmission; specifically, the torque converter clutch damper. The better {{the performance of the}} damper, the more time the torque converter can be kept in the optimum locked position, thus increasing vehicle efficiency. Currently a large number of vehicle manufacturers use transmission technology sourced from external OEMs; {{due to a lack of}} available performance data or validated simulations, sometimes vehicle manufacturers are not able to fully understand the behaviour of the damper. If damper performance (or interactions with other components) cannot be fully assessed during the design development phase, key issues may become known too late in the development process. Thus a deeper understanding of the processes of experimentally characterising and simulating torque converter dampers is required. This thesis describes the development of an arc <b>spring</b> <b>torque</b> converter damper simulation, including the gathering of the experimental data required to validate the simulation. The simulation is used to draw conclusions on the impact of excitation signal form on damper behaviour, leading to new knowledge on the signals required to experimentally characterise a damper. In this thesis a methodology for (and implementation of) the characterisation of torque converter dampers is detailed. It was found that existing available technologies (e. g. fired engines, electric dynamometers) were either too inflexible or prohibitively expensive; thus a novel high frequency mechanical pulsation generator was developed. This solution was developed from a 4 cylinder motored diesel engine; the cylinders are filled with compressed air and the crankshaft driven using an electric dynamometer. Simulation and experimental data has confirmed that mean torque can be controlled using the input dynamometer, with the compressed air producing fluctuations of up to 900 Nm amplitude. However, it was found that the frequency of the output pulsations varied from a fired engine; this is due to reactions between the pulsation generator and the stiffness and inertias of other components on the rig. A review of the performance of the novel pulsation generation concept against other damper excitation methods was also conducted. It was determined that fired engines and electric motors are more suitable for durability testing; the flexibility of the electric motors and the low running costs of the pulsation generator suit damper performance tests. The second phase of this project was to develop a simulation of a two-stage arc spring turbine damper. This damper consists of three inertias, separated by two spring sets; the outer spring set has 3 individual arc springs, while the inner spring set has 5 nested pairs. The principle of conservation of angular momentum is applied to each of the three inertias in order to calculate their individual accelerations. This method is also applied when calculating the acceleration and movement of the springs; the arc springs are discretised into mass and (massless) spring segments. Two features not previously seen in literature are included in the simulation; hardstops and nested springs. The physical hardstops limit the movement of the spring sets (relative movements of the inertias). In this study, the nested springs were simulated as a pair of parallel springs, rather than as a single stiffer arc spring; this is due to the friction that occurs between the springs (the inner race of the larger spring forms the housing for the inner spring). These two features highlight the need for hardware examination before simulation development; disassembling the hardware also allows the location of hardstops (and other features) to be measured rather than relying on the test data. Once a damper simulation was designed, a methodology for simulation parameterisation was required; parameterisation is the process of improving simulation performance through iterations of estimated parameters. The simulated damper was excited using sampled experimental data; to maximise parameterisation process efficiency, each time a parameter change was made, a set of key test points were selected in order to assess simulation performance change. It is not recommended that single test points be examined individually; parameter changes may improve simulation performance at one test point but have an adverse reaction at another. A clear causal relationship between simulation timestep and accuracy (as well as simulation run time) was found; a link between the number of discretised segments and simulation accuracy (and run time) was also confirmed. It was determined that 8 segments was optimal for the inner springs and 18 outer segments offered the best balance between computing power and simulation time. A variety of methods for analysing damper (and simulation) performance are presented in this thesis; it was found that for the 2. 5 bar torque curve experimental data set the simulation performs excellently, with on average less than 5 % error. Overall torque error is less than 10 % across the tested speed range (900 to 2800 rpm), with mean torque differences between simulated and tested order magnitudes of less than 5 Nm. It has been determined that hysteresis loops are not an accurate predictor of real-world damper performance; while they can approximate general trends, they do not cover the normal operating condition. In the final phase of this thesis, the validated simulation has been used to investigate excitation signal, areas of poor damper performance and the link between speed and damper stiffness. By subjecting the simulation to a variety of sinusoidal input signals, it was established that if a sinusoidal signal approximates the 3 most dominant frequencies in a real signal, the damper will behave in a representative manner. Additional orders that have lower frequencies than the dominant order will have a greater impact on the attenuation behaviour of the damper; the effect of additional orders on attenuation behaviour is also linked to their magnitude (relative to the dominant order). A methodology for efficient damper mapping is proposed; the key aim is to produce a dataset that will minimise the length of the parameterisation process while capturing key damper behaviours. It was found that the magnitude of the torque oscillations used to excite the damper is linked to parameter adjustment impact, though this relationship is not linear for all parameters; an approximate level of 300 Nm should be used for excitation. Parameters such as spring stiffness and plate inertias are more likely to have a substantial impact on damper performance at frequencies below 70 Hz; friction tuning factors are impacted more by magnitude changes at frequencies above 150 Hz. It has been demonstrated that while speed can have an effect on magnification ratio, this effect is far less significant at mean torques above the knee point and when sinusoidal input magnitude is kept at or above 300 Nm. It was concluded that neither engine speed nor precise excitation magnitude must be replicated in order to predict approximate performance. During the investigation into areas of poor damper performance, it was confirmed that the trend of increasing magnification ratio with lower frequencies (< 30 Hz) seen in experimental data continued. Simulation testing above 140 Hz revealed that there is not a linear relationship between increased frequency and increased magnification ratio; these areas of magnification ratio spikes are likely due to system resonances. It has been confirmed that while fluctuation magnitude does impact magnification ratio, fluctuation frequency has the most significant (dominant) impact. Finally, the effect of speed on apparent damper stiffness was investigated for both hysteresis loop testing and across a range of outer spring vibration angles; it was confirmed that increasing speed does result in non-homogeneous compression of the springs. It was established that while speed can have an effect on spring stiffness, this effect will vary significantly depending on the movement range (vibration angle) of the spring. The largest increase in spring stiffness with speed is seen when segments of the spring become inactive (cease to move), hence why the effect of speed is more substantial at vibration angle of < 10 °. The simulation was used to confirm the theories linking speed and stiffness found in the literature; higher speeds increase frictional forces, slowing damper segments, resulting in reduced movement. The findings of this thesis are relevant to damper simulation and testing engineers; by expanding knowledge of damper behavioural responses to high frequency excitation signals, as well as demonstrating an effective method for producing validated damper simulations, it is hoped that the vehicle design process will be more efficient and damper modifications more effective...|$|R
