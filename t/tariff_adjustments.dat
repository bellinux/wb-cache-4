40|$|Since privately financed {{infrastructure}} (PFI) {{projects are}} usually natural monopolies, their tariffs should be regulated to ensure socially desirable outcomes. In reality, the regulation is usually realized through <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanisms. There are four basic <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> frameworks for PFI projects - adjustment based on sale price, revenue, operating income and profit after tax. They have different risk exposures and incentives. The adjustment {{based on the}} sale price provides the project company with the highest potential to increase profit but exposes it to the highest risk, while the adjustment based on the guaranteed ROR exposes the project company to the lowest risk but provides the least potential for increasing profit. Adjustments based on the revenue or the operating income are somewhere in between. In practice, a hybrid {{of two or more}} adjustment frameworks may be adopted to adapt to specific project environments. A well-designed <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> framework can create a 'win-win' solution for both the public and private sectors.

40|$|Abstract — Under the {{enhanced}} single buyer model of electricity supply industry in Thailand, tariff regulation {{is needed to}} prevent unfair pricing for consumers. Retail electricity tariff, being separated into base tariff and automatic <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism, has been regulated by multiple regulatory bodies. Findings reveal that Thai electricity base tariff regulations tended to favor electric utilities rather than consumers, basing on rate of return regulatory approach. In addition, the automatic <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism attached greater importance to operators than to the consumers, enabling the former to fully pass the fuel and power purchase burdens through to the consumers. The results of adoption of current regulatory regime are excess capacity in electricity supply industry and excessive profits for electric utilities. This paper, thus, proposed tariff regulatory alternatives that could enhance efficiency of operators while simultaneously sharing these benefits with consumers...|$|R

2500|$|Creation of a {{regulatory}} agency. In 2006 the sector reforms were complemented by {{the creation of}} {{a regulatory}} agency, the Egyptian Water Regulatory Agency. The creation of an [...] "autonomous" [...] regulatory agency for utilities was a standard recommendation made by donors for infrastructure sector reforms in developing countries at that time. The agency's tasks include reviewing proposals for <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustments,</b> monitoring the application of technical standards and reviewing customer complaints. The agency also has a mandate to both promote and regulate private sector participation. These tasks overlap with the tasks of other agencies, such as the Holding Company (which also reviews proposals for <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustments,</b> alongside the Ministry of Housing and the Cabinet), the public companies (which also review complaints) and the PPP Central Unit (which also promotes private sector participation). Five years after its creation, the regulatory agency remains a relatively weak and marginal entity whose autonomy is doubtful.|$|E

This study sets out to examine the potency of fiscal policy as a tool for poverty alleviation. The study uses a static real-side computable general equilibrium model as the framework. Three counterfactual scenarios were examined. These are transfers to the poor household, targeting of government expenditure and import <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The study observed that targeting of government expenditure seems to be the most potent tool for effective poverty reduction. Moreover, <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> tends to aggravate income disparity/ poverty amongst households. In this light, the study proposes that in the quest for poverty reduction in Nigeria, fiscal policy should be designed so that government expenditure is properly focused to ensure that goods required by poor households are provided through public means...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} climate mitigation regime, {{notably the}} Kyoto Protocol, {{has so far}} proven to be largely unsuccessful at slowing down the trend of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Incomplete participation {{and the lack of}} any enforcing mechanism in IEAs are cited as the reason for the failure climate agreements like Kyoto. Coalition stability literature suggests the use of trade restrictions like border carbon adjustments complementary to climate policy with respect to their potential to generate greater cooperation and serve as enforcement of international environmental agreements. A variety of political, economic and legal reasons have so far prevented any meaningful use of border adjustments in conjunction with IEAs. Therefore, to assess the implications of border adjustments for participation and stability of climate coalitions, I develop a model of multilateral trade extended to climate concerns by way of domestic carbon prices and a border <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> levied on outsiders to the coalition. The model is solved analytically by allowing players to strategically optimize their carbon pricing decisions with and without the adjustment in a partial cooperation setting. Using the concept of internal and external stability, comparison between scenarios produces the result that a border <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> levied on imports unambiguously increases participation in the IEA as well as stability of larger coalitions. Further, the imposition of the border measure proves to be both credible and environmentally effective because it increases the welfare of the coalition and {{the world as a whole}} as well as reduces emissions by depressing output...|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the impact}} of the 1997 East Asian {{financial}} crisis the contracts were renegotiated through a [...] "Restated Cooperative Agreement" [...] signed in October 2001. The agreement also foresaw the creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) as an [...] "independent" [...] regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for tariff increases on behalf of the Governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works. Initially, PAM Jaya had the responsibility to monitor the performance of the two private companies on behalf of the city government in addition to being an asset holding company. By creating the regulatory body the regulatory function was to be clearly separated from the asset holding function, thus avoiding a possible perception of a conflict of interest. In April 2001 the City Council approved a tariff increase of 35 percent, while leaving tariffs in the two poorest consumer categories unchanged. After the signing of the new contract, lengthy negotiations began with the assistance of external advisors brought in {{with the support of the}} Asian Development Bank about the so-called [...] "rate rebasing" [...] for the period 2002-2007. During the negotiations, two other tariff increases were approved in April 2003 and January 2004, again leaving tariffs for the poorest unchanged. For the first time since 1998, in 2003 average water tariffs became higher than water charges, standing at 5,000 and 4,000 Rupiahs per cubic meter respectively. In July 2004 the City Council approved an automatic <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> (ATA) every six months over a five-year period to allow the provincial government to pay its arrears to the private operators.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{adjusting}} water tariffs differs greatly from one location to another. In many large countries (China, France, Germany, India, Mexico, South Africa and the United States) {{the process of}} price adjustment {{takes place at the}} municipal level. Rules for price adjustments vary greatly. In the case of public service provision, tariffs are typically adjusted through a decision by the municipal council after a request by the municipal utility. Some countries, such as Germany, stipulate by law that all the financial costs of service provision must be recovered through tariff revenues. Other countries define cost recovery as a long-term objective, such as in Mexico. In the case of private service providers <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> rules are often laid out in concession or lease contracts, often providing for indexation to inflation.|$|R

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{implementing}} water supply projects {{based on the}} build, operate and transfer approach is risk allocation. Project risks should be allocated to the best competent party through proper contractual arrangements or through government support so as to achieve a low water tariff. The details of tariff design in BOT water supply projects are identified, and a minimum feasible tariff model is proposed for effective risk allocation arrangements. Risk analysis based on a real project in Malaysia is performed to demonstrate {{the application of the}} simulation model on the key factors of inflation, exchange rates and demand risk. The analysis shows that for inflation risk, a pre-set <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> formula is useful in lowering minimum feasible tariff. For exchange rate risk, the reference rate should be set lower than the best estimate. Lowering of minimum feasible tariff can also be achieved if the tariff for additional demand is lower than the tariff for guaranteed demand.

30|$|Grain tariff changes do {{not result}} in {{significant}} effects on agricultural exports, including the rice, wheat, and other grain sectors. It is interesting that grain exports in the GTR 2030 scenario are less {{than they are in}} the BAU 2030 scenario, and grain exports in the GTI 2030 scenario are higher than they are in BAU 2030. It is likely because China imports more grain products due to the grain tariff reduction. There is sufficient grain supply in the domestic market, so China is expected to have extra grain to export. In the GTI 2030 scenario, it is the opposite case than the GTR scenario. The majority of domestic grain production has to be allocated to the domestic market, so there is less remaining for the export market. The changes in the export growth rates for the agricultural sectors due to grain <b>tariff</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies are lower than 1 %, compared with the BAU 2030 scenario.|$|R
