5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 35-yard line following the post-touchdown kickoff and a short return. The Bears began to run out the clock, rushing the ball more than passing it, as had been the trend throughout the game. Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38yards, J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>a</b> total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush {{that resulted in a}} touchdown. The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.|$|E
5|$|In 1624, a {{fatality}} occurred {{following a}} match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes, now in East Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck {{on the head}} by the batsman, Edward Tye, {{who was trying to}} hit <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>a</b> second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey, now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>a</b> second time. When the first Laws of Cricket were encoded in 1744, it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>a</b> minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
50|$|In {{all these}} cases the radial {{deformation}} of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> against <b>the</b> rifling grooves would permit {{a more efficient}} spinning of <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> drawback, <b>the</b> very deformation rendered the bullet aerodynamically less efficient.|$|R

6000|$|... 1497. To {{counteract}} this interfering influence, I {{made the}} interval n = 0.79 and interval o = 0.58 of an inch. Then, when <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>A</b> and B were inductric positive, the discharge was about equal at both intervals. When, {{on the other}} hand, <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>A</b> and B were inductric negative, there was discharge, still at both, but most at n, as if <b>the</b> small <b>ball</b> negative could discharge a little easier than <b>the</b> same <b>ball</b> positive.|$|R
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>a</b> lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat {{with the help of a}} runner and passes his half-century, {{reducing}} the required runs to an attainable total. The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>a</b> short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals no ball. Bhuvan returns to bat and swings extremely hard at the next ball, hitting the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell backpedals and catches it, gleefully believing that the British team has won — until he realises that he has caught the ball beyond the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Orange Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1996, exactly {{one year after}} the Hokies' {{previous}} bowl game. Instead of New Orleans, however, the Hokies were playing in stormy Miami, Florida at Pro Player Stadium. Neither team scored until late in the first quarter when Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller put Virginia Tech on the board with a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Hokies' 7–0 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter didn't last long, however. Nebraska scored a field goal early in the second quarter and tacked on a touchdown to take a 10–7 lead halfway through the second quarter. Then Nebraska got its biggest play of the game as Tech's Druckenmiller fumbled <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>A</b> Nebraska player scooped up the ball, returning it 31yards for a touchdown. Tech was able to score a touchdown before halftime, but Nebraska still held a 17–14 lead as the second half began.|$|E
6000|$|... 1494. When the {{intervals}} n and o were each made = 0.9 of <b>an</b> inch, and <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>A</b> and B inductric positively, the discharge was all at n from <b>the</b> small <b>ball</b> of <b>the</b> conductor to <b>the</b> large <b>ball</b> of <b>the</b> discharging train, and mostly by positive brush, though once by <b>a</b> spark. When <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>A</b> and B were made inductric negatively, the discharge was still from <b>the</b> same small <b>ball,</b> at n, by a constant negative brush.|$|R
50|$|Gaelic {{football}} defines tackling as wresting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from <b>an</b> opponent's hands. Bumping {{is allowed}} on the player with <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> but <b>a</b> player cannot be grabbed.|$|R
50|$|Law 33: Handled <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> If <b>a</b> batsman {{wilfully}} handles <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> with <b>a</b> {{hand that}} is not touching the bat {{without the consent of}} the opposition, he is out.|$|R
5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>a</b> 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>a</b> third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the second}} half, no substitutions {{were made by}} either teams as Galatasaray kicked-off the match. During the third minute, Vieira picked Parlour, but his shot hit {{the outside of the}} goal. Galatasaray almost scored the opening goal, when Okan Buruk played in Hakan Şükür, whose shot hit the right post. Arsenal {{attempted}} to strike, with Sylvinho passing Hagi, and finding Henry, who in turn put in a cross for Keown, only for his shot to go over. Later throughout the match, Parlour sent a long ball into the Galatasaray midfield, but no Arsenal player was there to pick up <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>A</b> free-kick was given to Bergkamp after a foul on Overmars, which was cleared with a Popescu header. Galatasaray attempted an attack on the counter – Capone gave the ball to Hagi, who lost his balance while preparing to take a shot. After receiving a pass, Hagi put in a wide cross for Şükür, but he was denied a shot on target after a clearance. Arsenal had another chance, when Henry snatched the ball from Korkmaz, and entered the penalty area, only to see his shot to go off target.|$|E
25|$|For step 4, it {{has already}} been shown that <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> minus <b>a</b> point admits a {{paradoxical}} decomposition; it remains to be shown that <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> minus <b>a</b> point is equidecomposable with <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Consider <b>a</b> circle within <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> containing <b>the</b> point at the center of <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Using <b>an</b> argument like that used to prove the Claim, one can see that the full circle is equidecomposable with the circle minus the point at <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> center. (Basically, <b>a</b> countable set of points on the circle can be rotated to give itself plus one more point.) Note that this involves the rotation about a point other than the origin, so the Banach–Tarski paradox involves isometries of Euclidean 3-space rather than just SO(3).|$|R
50|$|Oliver was a slap hitter {{who rarely}} tried to drive <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>As</b> an outfielder, {{his arm and}} speed were already well above average, while his graceful style {{prompted}} baseball historian Fred Lieb to compare him to Joe DiMaggio and Tris Speaker.|$|R

5|$|Leyland {{missed a}} {{substantial}} amount of cricket in 1937 with a broken finger, barely playing in July, and missing the Test series against New Zealand. He scored 1,306 runs at 36.27 and took 19 wickets. Injuries continued to trouble him in 1938. He scored 1,884 first class runs at 43.81, but a shoulder strain early in the season adversely affected his form. He was not selected for the first three Tests against Australia, not least as the England side contained several promising batsmen. However, he had his best season with <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>A</b> succession of hard, dry wickets gave fewer opportunities to orthodox spinners and Leyland took 63 wickets at 19.32. Early in the season, he took eight for 63 against Hampshire, the best figures of his career. Just as his batting form returned, and when he was likely to be recalled to the England side, Leyland broke his thumb in a match against Middlesex. However, he recovered in time to play in the final Test of the series. Australia's victory in the fourth Test had given the team a 1–0 lead.|$|E
25|$|Another main {{difference}} {{is the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>A</b> smaller ball to the men's version is often used to minimise hand injuries when (marking) the ball.|$|E
25|$|Netball {{strategy}} involves {{several types}} of passes, including centre passes, penalty passes and short passes. A centre pass occurs after a goal has been scored, when the Centre passes <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>A</b> short pass is a pass between two players on the same team, where {{the length of the}} pass is so short that a defensive player cannot get between the two opposing players to intercept <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>A</b> penalty pass is a pass where the ball is returned from the sideline into play. This pass occurs after a penalty has been called.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{there are}} no {{explicit}} definitions within the rules for what constitutes a 'reasonable opportunity' to dispose of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> when <b>a</b> player has had no prior opportunity, nor what constitutes a 'genuine attempt' to dispose of <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>As</b> is <b>the</b> case for prior opportunity, the umpires can determine this at their discretion and {{at the direction of}} the umpiring coaches.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A large force {{applied for}} a very short duration, such as a golf shot, is often {{described}} as the club giving <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>an</b> impulse.|$|R
60|$|Then Lady <b>Ball</b> said <b>a</b> {{great deal}} more about <b>the</b> <b>Ball</b> money, giving it as her decided opinion that Margaret owed herself and her money to <b>the</b> <b>Balls.</b> <b>As</b> she could not induce her son to do anything, she wrote a {{rejoinder}} to her niece.|$|R
25|$|In 1647, another {{fatality}} {{was recorded}} at Selsey, West Sussex, when a fielder called Henry Brand was {{hit on the}} head by a batsman trying to hit <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>a</b> second time.|$|E
25|$|Tyldesley was an {{outstanding}} fielder who specialised in deep positions, mostly at third man or deep long on, and was noted for his speed {{and ability to}} quickly gather and accurately return <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>A.</b> A. Thomson gave the view that Tyldesley and David Denton were the two best outfielders in England.|$|E
25|$|The {{fatality}} {{occurred after}} Vinall, a fielder, was struck {{on the head}} by the batsman {{who was trying to}} hit <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>a</b> second time to avoid being caught. Vinall is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner’s court, which returned a verdict of misadventure.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} ability to land <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on <b>a</b> {{strategically}} optimum line and length, the main weapons of the bowler are his ability to move <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> sideways as it approaches the batsman {{and his ability to}} deliver <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at <b>a</b> high velocity.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, a curveball, thrown with topspin, creates a higher {{pressure}} zone {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> which deflects <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> downward in flight. Instead of counteracting gravity, the curveball adds additional downward force, thereby gives <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>an</b> exaggerated drop in flight.|$|R
50|$|Other {{than the}} ability to land <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on <b>a</b> {{strategically}} optimum line and length, the main weapons of the bowler are his ability to move <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> sideways as it approaches the batsman {{and his ability to}} deliver <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at <b>a</b> high velocity.|$|R
25|$|The crucial {{aspect of}} any good pass is it being {{difficult}} to intercept. Good passers can pass {{the ball with}} great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>A</b> special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. This is called a no-look pass.|$|E
25|$|A skilled {{player can}} dribble without {{watching}} the ball, using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision {{to keep track}} of the ball's location. By not having to focus on <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>a</b> player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{defensive}} strategies: zone defense and man-to-man defense. In a zone defense, each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court. Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>a</b> manoeuver known as a trap. In a man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards a specific opponent.|$|E
2500|$|A {{completed}} {{catch is}} now when a receiver gets two feet down and has control of <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Previously, <b>a</b> receiver {{had to make}} [...] "a football move" [...] {{in addition to having}} control of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for <b>a</b> reception.|$|R
5000|$|With Slaughter running, Walker lined <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to left-center field, where Culberson fielded <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>As</b> {{he threw}} a relay to shortstop Johnny Pesky, Slaughter rounded third base, ignored third base coach Mike González's stop sign, and {{continued}} for home.|$|R
