40|$|ABSTRACT Determinants of <b>training</b> <b>workshop</b> {{on natural}} rubber {{technologies}} were studied by selecting 51 participants invited for <b>training</b> <b>workshop</b> at Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria (RRIN) main station Iyanomo. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, {{multiple regression analysis}} and Z- test statistic at 5 % probability level. The result indicated that males dominated the training; {{all of the participants}} were literate and had one form of formal education or the other. Z- test analysis shows a significant relationship between pre- and post training score. Result of the multiple regression analysis showed that the postulated regressors explained about 70. 40 % of the variations in the regressand. The entire estimated coefficients carried the expected positive sign, which indicated that an increase in these variables would lead to increase in the knowledge of trainees on rubber innovation. Education, depth of coverage, calibre of facilitators and practical exercises / field visits were the major determinants of <b>training</b> <b>workshop</b> and have significant effects on training at various probability levels. It is thus recommended that regular <b>training</b> <b>workshop</b> should be conducted for capacity building of end users in the rubber industry in Nigeria...|$|R
