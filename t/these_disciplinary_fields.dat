40|$|As {{critical}} {{communication and}} cultural studies {{have taken a}} more sociological turn, it is increasingly recognized that the theoretical assumptions of critical perspectives create tensions within projects of empirically informed social analysis. This dissertation explores the epistemological commitments and liabilities {{of a set of}} analytic concepts that address the domain of "lived experience" and interprets how and why they displace the very phenomena that they claim to study. Drawing on Foucauldean discourse analysis, I develop a critical perspective that is grounded in the analysis of "discursive operators," the analytic concepts that work to legitimate claims to knowledge within different traditions of research. My research maps out the work of these operators across a range of positions and projects, and diagnoses the relations of power that structure these particular discursive regimes. I focus on four key discursive formations in critical communication and cultural studies and their objects of study: emotion and symbolic interactionism; the structure of feeling and literary humanism; subcultural and media ethnography; agency, identity and discursive conceptions of power. In the course of my analysis, I find a consistent regularity, a logic of deferral and displacement, in which the complexity and limit-less character of actual contexts of research are displaced in favor of powerful discursive operators such as intersubjectivity, the popular, resistance, and various conceptualizations of domination. Their influence contributes to the reproduction of theoretical orthodoxies and the marginalization of theoretical and practical innovation in <b>these</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>fields.</b> After isolating the problem, I describe a number of strategies that attempt to contend with the determinations of powerful discursive operators, especially a form of conjuncturalist analysis developed in cultural studies...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with enhancing the utility of social capital by developing and testing a comprehensive and measurable framework {{as a tool for}} researchers, policy-makers, and development theorists and practitioners. A framework was developed for measuring the degree to which different forms of social capital reside in a community and for distinguishing community-to community variations. The Framework was also designed to identify the accumulation of social capital in relation to structural characteristics within a community, and to identify what advantages might be associated with variants of social capital. The pursuit of the understanding of social capital has been convened within narrow disciplinary fields and has reduced the notion in definition, purpose, and utility. Much of the literature and past research has focused on approximations to identify social capital that are field-specific and representative of, at best, markers of social capital, rather than social capital itself. For this reason, this dissertation {{is concerned with}} developing a robust framework that has the potential to embrace {{the nature and extent of}} social capital across <b>these</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>fields,</b> while providing insight into the forms, influences, and trajectories of social capital. The utility of the Social Capital Framework that was developed for this dissertation was examined by transforming the Framework into a survey tool for administering in two communities to identify applicability and sensitivity for identifying the degree to which variants of social capital reside. The results showed that the Framework was able to distinguish the degree to which different forms of social capital existed, and how the social capital accumulates in relations to structural variables, in particular, gender. The Framework’s utility was not universal across all forms of social capital and showed that further enhancements are required, particularly, if it is to enable social capital to be attributed to forms of advantage. The results also identified areas where future research would be of value, particularly, in examining the trajectory of people’s forms of social capital...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to give a textual genetic {{analysis}} of the 1936 - 1937 correspondence between the linguist Lucien Tesnière and the physician and grammarian Édouard Pichon. In 1935, Tesnière wrote a review of the third volume of Damourette and Pichon’s Essai de grammaire de la langue française. The draft of this review is highly interesting since it reveals that Tesnière takes a very different stance than that expressed in the published version of the review. This is what I show by comparing three versions of the review: the draft, the typescript version kept in Tesnière’s archives, and lastly the exchange with Pichon about the review. It appears that Tesnière defended clinical medicine as a paragon of scientific rigor, bemoaning the absence of such rigor in linguistics, and criticizing (quite bluntly in his draft) the attitude of his colleagues in linguistics. He then complimented Pichon for his methods, whereas Pichon refused to reduce his work to that of a medical practitioner. The debate is epistemological as well as a precious historical documentation, showing how <b>these</b> two <b>disciplinary</b> <b>fields</b> constituted themselves in relationship to each other in the first half of the 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough Ludwig Wittgenstein, Peter Strawson, John Austin and Paul Grice {{emphasized}} in the 1950 s that observation of the usage of natural languages should be the privileged object of inquiry for philosophy of language, this idea was not really taken into account {{and put into practice}} by linguists until forty years later. This situation could be described as “paradoxical”, since appealing to usage is in itself a sine qua non condition for the elaboration of any linguistic theory, yet it remains true that the real consideration of usage through linguistic approaches {{at the end of the}} eighties resulted in upsetting the well-established order between syntax, semantics and pragmatics. Understood to be the cause behind the change in linguistic forms and no longer as the updating of a system, the observation of usage questioned the Chomskian postulate on the autonomy of grammar and this theoretical break brought a paradigm shift taking full advantage of the semantic and pragmatic properties of the utterances in usage to construct syntax. The aim of this communication is to propose an analysis of the theoretical changes induced by usage-based approaches to language. To do this, we will draw up a map of these changes and this study will lead us to show that the reciprocal restructuring of the domains of syntax, semantics and pragmatics also resulted in the revision of pivotal concepts within <b>these</b> three <b>disciplinary</b> <b>fields.</b> We will then highlight the domains, such as learning or the language-memory link, that usage-based approaches can more easily explain. The two previous studies will then offer us the opportunity to clarify why when usage becomes the privileged object of inquiry language can then be conceived as a natural and social system in continual evolution...|$|R

We look at an external requirement for interdisciplinarity and internationality of Research Training Groups (RTGs) and study how their performance is affected. We expect to observe two countervailing effects with changes in interdisciplinarity and/or internationality: first, increased performance due {{to an increase in}} productive resources and a second, decreased performance due to increased team problems (communication, conflicts etc). Since both effects are expected to vary with the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>field</b> of research, we separate our analysis for the Humanities & Social Sciences in comparison to the Natural & Life Sciences and indeed find different effects in the different <b>disciplinary</b> <b>fields.</b> Furthermore, we separately analyze the effects of interdisciplinarity {{on the one hand and}} internationality on the other hand. We conclude that the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism varies substantially between the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>fields</b> and for the type of heterogeneity under consideration. Therefore governance of research should be either precisely engineered to a particular <b>disciplinary</b> <b>field</b> and a given type of heterogeneity or it should offer a menu of options that allows research teams to choose from according to their specific needs. governance of Ph.

40|$|My thesis {{proposes a}} {{critical}} {{framework for understanding}} the digital interface in interactive new media installations. I aim at dispelling the instrumental, cybernetic, “action-reaction” myth that surrounds {{the functions of the}} interface and that constitutes one of the main limitations in its conceptualization today. I argue that a rethinking of the digital interface in terms of its aesthetic and cultural properties is essential if we are to take digital interfaces seriously as devices that inform or even, to some extent, structure our relationship with technology. Theorists who work in the interdisciplinary field of interface studies have historically been preoccupied with the technical and instrumental functions the interface performs – specifically with how it acts and reacts to pre-programmed information. To do this, they have predominantly drawn on computer science and engineering perspectives. Thus digital interfaces have commonly been understood as the symbolic software that enables humans to use computers. My thesis approaches the digital interface from a different direction, concentrating on the aesthetic and cultural aspects of the digital interface, and drawing on scholarship from the fields of art history and media studies. In particular, I focus on critically examining how various interfaces are defined within art environments and how they influence the way subjects, objects, and the relationships and processes that exist between them are understood in <b>these</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>fields</b> and practices. Throughout, I propose a more expansive definition of the digital interface in interactive new media installations, positioning it as a dynamic, hybrid, aesthetic and cultural process. I thus reformulate the problem of the digital interface as a problem of making the often invisible aspects of the device legible. Ultimately, I argue that the interface mediates, thus creates, to an extent, relationships between viewer/participants, artists and artworks as well as influences the movements and perceptions of those interacting with it. This reading enables me to conclude that the digital interface can be seen as an important actor in positioning and (re) shaping specific ways in which the self relates to technology, to artistic practice and to other human and nonhuman beings in the current media culture. At the heart of this thesis is the notion that the digital interface matters and that a critical exploration of it in aesthetic contexts can help us understand and possibly reconfigure our human relationship with technology...|$|E

Amid the diversity of uses and concepts, we recognize the need for rigorous conceptual demarcation about networks in the field of health. Such concern aims to preserve the strategic potential of this concept in the research and planning in the field, overcoming uncertainties and distortions still observed in its discourse-analytic circulation in public health. To this end, we will introduce the current uses of network in different <b>disciplinary</b> <b>fields,</b> emphasizing dialogues with the field of public health. With this, we intend to stimulate discussions about the development of empirical dimensions and analytical models that may allow us to understand the processes produced within and around health networks...|$|R

40|$|O estudo tem como objeto a profissionalização docente, com destaque ao processo de recrutamento de {{professor}}es para a instrução pública. Tenho como foco a administração do Ministro dos Negócios do Estado Coutto Ferraz, procurando explorar principalmente três questões: Que perfil de professor atenderia às políticas públicas impostas pelo Governo? Que medidas tomadas pelo Governo vão tentar organizar, definir e controlar o cargo do professor público? Quais as reações encontradas à essa intervenção? Para tal exercício tratei de explorar a hipótese de que o concurso se constitui em medida auxiliar no processo de modelação do ofício, buscando examinar o efeito das regras instituídas na constituição do modelo de profissional para o Estado imperial. Para tal empreendimento o trabalho foi organizado em cinco capítulos: o primeiro procurou caracterizar a sociedade imperial a fim de perceber a forma como ela associa a idéia de Civilização com Instrução. Nesta perspectiva, pretendi destacar as estratégias produzidas pela administração do Estado imperial em relação à educação da população como um dos meios de controle e manutenção da ordem monárquica. No segundo capítulo, procurei refletir sobre o processo de estabelecimento das ordens desenvolvido em meio à construção do próprio Estado monárquico. Para isso destaquei as ordens: religiosa, médica e militar pela forte ligação destes campos com a questão da instrução no século XIX. Este esforço teve por fim, entender o processo de profissionalização desses agentes sociais no Brasil, aproximando-os da questão da qualificação e recrutamento do profissional desejado para estas diferentes ordens, percebendo os possíveis isomorfismos e desvios entre as formas de construção desses campos disciplinares. No terceiro capítulo, analisei as fontes (legislativas, relatórios, provas, atas, requerimentos e ofícios diversos) com as quais trabalhei na intenção de compreender a forma como a ordem docente foi configurada no processo de recrutamento e profissionalização do magistério primário, secundário e superior, procurando entender o sentido do recrutamento de professores no período estudado. Na quarta parte deste estudo, tratei da identidade destes profissionais, examinando o estatuto dos professores do século XIX, formas de adequação e de afastamento em relação às normas de controle e a contribuição para o processo de profissionalização docente ocorrido no período. No quinto e último capítulo procurei analisar as técnicas de recrutamento baseado em representações da classe, produzidas a partir de diferentes posições de Governo. This work aims the lecturing professionalization, {{particularly the}} recruiting process of teachers {{to the public}} education. I focus on {{the administration of the}} Minister Coutto Ferraz, trying to address three main questions: What sort of teacher would attend the Government demands? What measures, undertaken by the Government, define and control the position of public teacher? What reactions to this intervention occurred? To achieve these objectives I studied the hypothesis that the examination constitutes itself as an auxiliary measure in the teaching modeling, and aims to determine the effect of the rules of the Imperial State professional Model constitution. In order to successfully consider all facts involved, this work has been organized in five chapters: the first has the objective of describing the imperial society {{in such a way that}} it becomes comprehensible how it associates the concept of Civilization with the one of Lecturing. From this point of view, I intended to mark the strategies developed by the Imperial State regarding people education as a way of control and support of the monarchist order. In the second chapter I considered the process of the orders establishment developed at the same time of the Monarchy itself. To that purpose I pointed out the religious, military and medical orders, strongly related to the theme lecturing in the 19 th century. As a result it was possible to understand the process of professionalization of these social agents in Brazil. This way they could be studied considering the professional qualification and recruiting issues to the mentioned orders. Eventually the isomorphism and deviations between the construction form of <b>these</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>field</b> could be noticed. In the third chapter I analyzed the sources (legislative, reports, exams, records, solicitations and several official letters) which I made use in order to comprehend how the teaching order was configured during the process of the primary, secondary and superior professorship recruiting and professionalization, trying to determine the meaning of the recruiting of teachers in the studied period. In the forty part, the professionals identity was studied, the 19 th century teachers statute, ways of suitability and removal regarding the control rules and the contribution to the process of lecturing professionalization were considered as well. In the fifth and last chapter I intended to analyse the recruiting techniques based on representations of the class, derived fron different Government...|$|R
