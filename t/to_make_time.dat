25|$|In most {{film and}} radio adaptations of the story, Bombadil is notable by his absence (an {{exception}} is the Mind's Eye recordings). Peter Jackson stated that the reason the character was omitted from his film was because, in the view him and his co-writers, Bombadil does little to advance the story, and would make their film unnecessarily long. Christopher Lee concurred, stating the scenes were left out <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>time</b> for showing Saruman's capture of Gandalf. Some of Bombadil's dialogue, {{as well as the}} scene in which the hobbits meet Old Man Willow, are transferred into scenes which Merry and Pippin share with Treebeard in Jackson's adaptation, included in the extended edition DVD.|$|E

25|$|Events at the {{beginning}} of the film are condensed or omitted altogether. In the book the time between Gandalf leaving the Ring to Frodo and returning to reveal its inscription, which is 17 years, is compressed for timing reasons. Frodo also spends a few months preparing to move to Buckland, on the eastern border of the Shire. This move is omitted, and associated events, including the involvement of Merry and Pippin, are changed and combined with him setting out for Bree. Characters such as Tom Bombadil and the incidents in the Old Forest and the Barrow Downs are left out to simplify the plot and increase the threat of the Ringwraiths. Such sequences are left out <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>time</b> to introduce Saruman, who in the book doesn't appear until Gandalf's account at the Council of Elrond. While some characters are left out, some are referenced such as Tom, Bert, and William to show how The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series intertwine. Saruman's role is enhanced: he is to blame for the blizzard on Caradhras, a role taken from Sauron and/or Caradhras itself in the book. Gandalf's capture by Saruman is also expanded with a fight sequence.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} on the Marne, Moltke ordered a {{retirement}} to the Aisne by the 1st and 2nd armies on the German right wing and a withdrawal to Reims {{and a line}} eastwards past the north of Verdun, by the 3rd, 4th and 5th armies. The 6th and 7th armies were ordered to end their attacks and dig in. The withdrawal was intended <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>time</b> for the 7th Army to be transferred from Alsace, to the right wing near the Oise but Franco-British attacks led to the 7th Army being sent {{to fill the gap}} between the 1st and 2nd armies instead. Moltke was replaced by Falkenhayn on 14 September, by when the 1st Army had reached the Aisne, with its right flank on the Oise and the 7th Army had assembled on the Aisne, between the 1st and 2nd armies. Further east the 3rd, 4th and 5th armies had dug in from Prosnes to Verdun, secure from frontal attacks. The 1st Army was still vulnerable on its northern flank, to attacks by French troops transferred from the south, which could be moved faster over undamaged railways, than German troops using lines damaged during the Great Retreat. General Wilhelm Groener, head of the Railway Department of the OHL, suggested three alternatives, a frontal attack from the new positions, a defence of the line of the Aisne while reserves were transferred to the right flank or to continue the withdrawal and comprehensively regroup the German armies, ready to conduct an offensive on the right flank.|$|E

Hitler provided Eva and her sister with a three-bedroom apartment in Munich that August, [...] {{and the next year}} the sisters were provided with a villa in Bogenhausen at Wasserburgerstr. 12 (now Delpstr. 12). By 1936, Braun was at Hitler's household at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden whenever he was in residence there, but she lived mostly in Munich. Braun also had her own apartment at the new Reich Chancellery in Berlin, completed to a design by Albert Speer.|$|E

Taylor and Clough then decided to replace goalkeeper John Middleton with Peter Shilton, whom they purchased for £270,000; Taylor reasoned: [...] "Shilton wins you matches." [...] After spending some time secretly following Kenny Burns {{he came to the}} conclusion that Burns's reputation as a hard drinker and gambler was exaggerated and he sanctioned a £145,000 move for the player, who would become FWA Footballer of the Year in 1977–78 after being converted from centre-forward to a sweeper role. Clough and Taylor were appointed joint-managers of the England youth team in December 1977, but the pair resigned after less than a year in charge as Forest's success meant they struggled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>time</b> to also coach the England players.|$|E
500|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli brought its white-banded medium compound tyre as {{the harder}} [...] "prime" [...] tyre and the yellow-banded soft compound as the softer [...] "option" [...] compound, {{as opposed to}} the previous year where the company brought the hard compound as the prime and medium compound as the option. Sauber's Head of Track Engineering, Giampaolo Dall'Ara, praised the updated choice, summing up that it will challenge teams <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>time</b> in the corners in addition to going for pure top speed, putting on a better show for the fans. However, Pirelli had received criticism from several drivers and commentators following tyre failures on Nico Rosberg's and Sebastian Vettel's cars at the Belgian Grand Prix.

500|$|In {{one scene}} of [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", Weevil (Francis Capra) accuses Logan (Jason Dohring) of having hit Lilly during their relationship.

However, the storyline was abandoned in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>time</b> for other story arcs. Thomas commented, [...] "At {{the end of the}} day, I don't want people thinking that Logan hit Lilly. I did, however, want Weevil to believe it." [...] Although Veronica concludes in this episode that she had consensual sex with Duncan while they were both under the influence of roofies, more information about the night is later revealed in the show's second season finale, [...] "Not Pictured", in which it is revealed that Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas raped her. When asked whether the writers knew that Beaver would be eventually revealed as the rapist when writing [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", Thomas responded, [...] "I wish I could claim that we were that clever." [...] The writers realized that there was a moment in the episode's script where Beaver could have raped Veronica roughly a month after its airing.|$|E

After reaching the outpost at Aïn Séfra, Eberhardt meets a French officer, Major Hubert Lyautey (Peter O'Toole). Despite their differences, the two respect each-other and soon become friends. Lyautey requests Eberhardt travel to Morocco to ask a marabout for permission to pursue a bandit into his territory. Eberhardt is conflicted about working for the French, though agrees to do it. After arriving in Morocco, however, she finds the marabout unwilling <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>time</b> to see her, and she becomes sick with malaria while waiting. Eberhardt is taken to a military hospital back in Aïn Séfra. Slimene vists her, and Eberhardt asks him to take her with him. Slimene takes her back to his small hut, and returns in the heavy rain to get medicine for her. While he is out he realises Eberhardt will be in danger from the growing amount of water, {{but he does not}} make it back to the hut in time to save her. Inside her hut, Eberhardt realises she is in danger when it is too late and declares she wants to live an instant before a wall of water caves in the house, killing her. Eberhardt reads the final paragraph from her short story [...] "The Breath of Night" [...] in a voice over, as images of the desert and water appear on screen.|$|E
500|$|Similar fossils were {{reported}} in 1902 from nearby Mount Field, {{another part of the}} Stephen formation. These may have been why Charles Doolittle Walcott visited Mount Field in 1909. While taking photographs there Walcott found a slab of fossils that he described as [...] "Phyllopod crustaceans". From late August to early September 1909, his team, including his family, collected fossils there, and in 1910 Walcott opened a quarry that he and his colleagues re-visited in 1911, 1912, 1913, 1917 and 1924, bringing back over 60,000 specimens in total. Walcott was Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1907 to his death in 1927, and this kept him so busy that he was still trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>time</b> for analyzing his finds two years before his death. Although he drew attention to the exceptional detail of the specimens, which were the first known fossils of soft-bodied animals from the Cambrian period, he also had other research interests: the Early Paleozoic stratigraphy of the Canadian Rockies, which took up the great majority of his time there; and Precambrian fossils of algae and bacteria, to which he assigned as much importance as to the fossils of animals. He managed to publish four [...] "preliminary" [...] papers on the fossil animals in 1911 and 1912, and further articles in 1918, 1919 and 1920. Four years after Walcott's death his associate Charles Resser produced a package of additional descriptions from Walcott's notes. Walcott's classifications of most of the fossils are now rejected, but were supported at the time, and he accepted a change for one of the few where his conclusion was disputed. Many of the later comments were made with the benefits of hindsight, and of techniques and concepts unknown in Walcott's time.|$|E
