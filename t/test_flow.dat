40|$|Data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{particular}} form of testing that identifies data <b>flow</b> relations as <b>test</b> objectives. Data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> has recently attracted new interest {{in the context of}} testing object oriented systems, since data flow information is well suited to capture relations among the object states, and can thus provide useful information for testing method interactions. Unfortunately, classic data <b>flow</b> <b>testing,</b> which is based on static analysis of the source code, fails to identify many important data flow relations due to the dynamic nature of object oriented systems. This thesis presents Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing,</b> a technique which rethinks data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> to suit the testing of modern object oriented software. Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> stems from empirical evidence that we collect on the limits of classic data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> techniques. We investigate such limits by means of Dynamic Data Flow Analysis, a dynamic implementation of data flow analysis that computes sound data flow information on program traces. We compare data flow information collected with static analysis of the code with information observed dynamically on execution traces, and empirically observe that the data flow information computed with classic analysis of the source code misses a significant part of information that corresponds to relevant behaviors that shall be tested. In view of these results, we propose Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing.</b> The technique promotes the synergies between dynamic analysis, static reasoning and test case generation for automatically extending a test suite with test cases that execute the complex state based interactions between objects. Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> computes precise data flow information of the program with Dynamic Data Flow Analysis, processes the dynamic information to infer new test objectives, which Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> uses to generate new test cases.
