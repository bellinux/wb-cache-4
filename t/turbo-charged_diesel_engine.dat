40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the present status and future projections for emerging technologies that can be utilized in light-duty vehicles in the next five to ten years to significantly reduce their CO 2 emissions. The emerging technologies considered are modern clean <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> and hybrid-electric powertrains using batteries and/or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Throughout the study, six classes of vehicles –compact passenger cars to large SUVs-were considered. For each vehicle class, computer simulations (Advisor 2002) and cost analyses were performed for conventional ICE and mild and full parallel hybrids using port-fuel injected and lean burn gasoline <b>engines</b> and direct-injection <b>turbo-charged</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> to determine the fuel economy and differential costs for the various vehicle designs using the conventional gasoline PFI engine vehicle as the baseline.

40|$|AbstractOne {{of the key}} {{technologies}} {{for the improvement of}} the diesel engine thermal efficiency is the reduction of the engine heat transfer through the thermal insulation of the combustion chamber. This paper presents a numerical investigation on the effects of the combustion chamber insulation on the heat transfer, thermal efficiency and exhaust temperatures of a 1. 6 l passenger car, <b>turbo-charged</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine.</b> First, the complete insulation of the engine components, like pistons, liner, firedeck and valves, has been simulated. This analysis has showed that the piston is the component with the greatest potential for the in-cylinder heat transfer reduction and for Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) reduction, followed by firedeck, liner and valves. Afterwards, the study has been focused on the impact of different piston Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) on heat transfer, performance and wall temperatures. This analysis has been performed using a 1 -D engine simulation code coupled with a lumped mass thermal model, representing the engine structure. A time-periodic wall conduction model has been used to calculate the wall temperature swings along the combustion chamber surface and within the engine cycle. Two different TBC materials, Yttria-Partially Stabilized Zirconia (Y-PSZ) and anodized aluminum, and different layer thicknesses have been simulated...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines {{the effect on}} performance and emission outputs of a compression ignition engine operating on biodiesels of varying carbon chain length {{and the degree of}} unsaturation. A well-instrumented, heavy-duty, multi-cylinder, common-rail, <b>turbo-charged</b> <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> was used to ensure that the results contribute in a realistic way to the ongoing debate about the impact of biofuels. Comparative measurements are reported for engine performance as well as the emissions of NOx, particle number and size distribution, and the concentration of the reactive oxygen species (which provide a measure of the toxicity of emitted particles). It is shown that the biodiesels used in this study produce lower mean effective pressure, somewhat proportionally with their lower calorific values; however, the molecular structure has been shown to have little impact on the performance of the engine. The peak in-cylinder pressure is lower for the biodiesels that produce a smaller number of emitted particles, compared to fossil diesel, but the concentration of the reactive oxygen species is significantly higher because of oxygen in the fuels. The differences in the physicochemical properties amongst the biofuels and the fossil diesel significantly affect the engine combustion and emission characteristics. Saturated short chain length fatty acid methyl esters are found to enhance combustion efficiency, reduce NOx and particle number concentration, but results in high levels of fuel consumption...|$|E
