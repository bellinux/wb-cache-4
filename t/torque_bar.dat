40|$|The {{relative}} <b>bar</b> <b>torques</b> for 45 galaxies {{observed at}} $K$- band with the 4. 2 m William Herschel Telescope {{are determined by}} transforming the light distributions into potentials and deriving the maximum ratios of the tangential forces relative to the radial forces. The results are combined with the <b>bar</b> <b>torques</b> for 30 other galaxies determined from our previous $K$-band survey (Buta & Block 2001). Relative <b>bar</b> <b>torques</b> determine the degree of spiral arm forcing, gas accretion, and bar evolution. They differ from other measures of bar strength, such as the relative amplitude of the bar determined photometrically, because they include the bulge and other disk light {{that contributes to the}} radial component of the total force. If the bulge is strong and the radial forcing large, then even a prominent bar can have a relatively weak influence on the azimuthal motions in the disk. Here we find that the relative <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> correlates only weakly with the optical bar type listed in the Revised Shapley-Ames and de Vaucouleurs systems. In fact, some classically barred galaxies have weaker relative <b>bar</b> <b>torques</b> than classically unbarred galaxies. The optical class is a poor measure of azimuthal disk forcing for two reasons: some infrared bars are not seen optically, and some bars with strong bulges have their azimuthal forces so strongly diluted by the average radial force that they exert only small torques on their disks. The Hubble classification scheme poorly recognizes the gravitational influence of bars. Applications of our <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> method to the high-redshift universe are briefly discussed.

40|$|We use a {{gravitational}} <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> {{method to}} compare bar strengths (the maximum tangential force normalized by radial force) in B and H-band images of 152 galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. Our main motivation is to check {{how much the}} difference in the rest-frame wavelength could affect comparisons of bar strengths in low and high redshift observations. Between these two bands we find an average bar strength ratio Q B/H = 1. 25 which factor is nearly independent of the morphological type. We show that Q B/H> 1 is mostly due to reduced bulge dilution of radial forces in the B-band. The <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> method needs an estimate for the vertical scale height of the galaxy, based on the radial scale length of the disk and the galaxy’s morphological type. Since these two might not always be possible to determine at high redshifts in a reliable manner, we also checked that similar results are obtained with vertical scale heights estimated from the radii corresponding to the K-band surface brightness of 20 mag/arcsec 2. Also, we made a simple test of the usability of the <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> method at high redshifts by checking the effects of image degradation (nearest neighbour sampling without any adjustment of noise levels) : we found that the estimated bar strengths varied by± 10 % at most as long as the total extent of the bar was at least 10 pixels.

The galaxies are mostly barred {{and many of them}} show multiple structures including bars and ovals, typical for S 0 s. The new images are of sufficient quality to reveal new detail on the morphology of the galaxies. For example, we report a hitherto undetected nuclear ring in NGC 1387, a nuclear bar in NGC 1326, and in the residual image also a weak primary bar in NGC 1317. For the galaxies we (1) measure the radial profiles of the orientation parameters derived from the elliptical isophotes, (2) apply Fourier methods for calculating tangential forces, and particularly, (3) apply structural decomposition methods. For galaxies with multiple structures a 2 -dimensional method is found to be superior to a 1 -dimensional method, but only if in addition to the bulge and the disk, at least one other component is taken into account. We find strong evidence of pseudo-bulges in S 0 s: ten of the galaxies have the shape parameter of the bulge near to n = 2, indicating that the bulges are more disk-like than following the R^ 1 / 4 -law. Also, six of the galaxies have either nuclear rings, nuclear bars or nuclear disks. In all non-elliptical galaxies in our sample the B/T < 0. 4, as typically found in galaxies having pseudo-bulges. In two of the galaxies the B/T flux ratio is as small as in typical Sc-type spirals. This might be the hitherto undiscovered link in the scenario in which spirals are transformedinto S 0 s.

40|$|From {{this vast}} subject, I will pick out and review three {{specific}} topics, namely {{the formation and}} evolution of bars, the formation of bulges, and the evolution during multiple major mergers. Bars form naturally in galactic discs. Their evolution {{is driven by the}} exchange of angular momentum within the galaxy. This is emitted mainly by near-resonant material in the inner disc (bar), and is absorbed by near-resonant material in the outer disc and in the halo. As a result of this, the bar becomes stronger and rotates slower. Bulges are not a homogeneous class of objects. Based on their formation history, one can distinguish three types. Classical bulges are mainly formed before the actual disc component, from collapses or mergers and the corresponding dissipative processes. Boxy/peanut bulges are parts of bars seen edge-on. Finally, disc-like bulges are formed by the inflow of material to the center due to <b>bar</b> <b>torques.</b> Major mergers bring strong and fast evolution and can turn discs into ellipticals.

The bars of Sb galaxies are ∼ 3 × longer than the bars in Sc types, consistent with our previous study (Durbala et al. 2008).

We find that the distribution of bar strength declines smoothly with increasing Q_b, with more than 40 % of the sample having Q_b <= 0. 1. In the context of recurrent bar formation, this suggests that strongly-barred states are relatively short-lived compared to weakly-barred or non-barred states. We do not find compelling evidence for a bimodal distribution of bar strengths. Instead, the distribution is fairly smooth in the range 0. 0 <= Q_b < 0. 8. Our analysis also provides a first look at spiral strengths Q_s in the OSU sample, based on the same torque indicator.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of stellar streams in rotating barred potentials is explained {{for the first}} time. Naturally, neighbouring stream stars reach pericentre at slightly different times. In {{the presence of a}} rotating bar, these neighbouring stream stars experience different bar orientations during pericentric passage and hence each star receives a different <b>torque</b> from the <b>bar.</b> These differing <b>torques</b> reshape the angular momentum and energy distribution of stars in the stream, which in turn changes the growth rate of the stream. For a progenitor orbiting in the same sense as the bar's rotation and satisfying a resonance condition, the resultant stream can be substantially shorter or longer than expected, depending on whether the pericentric passages of the progenitor occur along the bar's minor or major axis respectively. We present a full discussion of this phenomenon focusing mainly on streams confined to the Galactic plane. In stark contrast with the evolution in static potentials, which give rise to streams that grow steadily in time, rotating barred potentials can produce dynamically old, short streams. This challenges the traditional viewpoint that the inner halo consists of well phase-mixed material whilst the tidally-disrupted structures in the outer halo are more spatially coherent.

We explore the relationship between the inner slope and several galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass, maximum rotational velocity, central surface brightness (μ 0), bar strength and bulge-to-total ratio. Even with our limited dynamical range, we find a trend for low-mass galaxies to exhibit shallower rotation curve inner slopes than high-mass galaxies, whereas steep inner slopes are found exclusively in high-mass galaxies. This trend may arise from the relationship between the total stellar mass and the mass of the bulge, which are correlated among them. We find a correlation between the inner slope of the rotation curve and the morphological T-type, complementary to the scaling relation between dRvc(0) and μ 0 previously reported in the literature. Although we find that the inner slope increases with the Fourier amplitude A 2 and decreases with the <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> Qb, this may arise from the presence of the bulge implicit in both A 2 and Qb. As previously noted in the literature, the more compact the mass in the central parts of a galaxy (more concretely, the presence of a bulge), the steeper the inner slopes. We conclude that the baryonic matter dominates the dynamics in the central parts of our sample galaxies. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

In particular, we quantify the steepness of the rotation curve by measuring its slope dv(c) (0). We explore the relationship between the inner slope and several galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass, maximum rotational velocity, central surface brightness (mu(0)), bar strength and bulge-to-total ratio. Even with our limited dynamical range, we find a trend for low-mass galaxies to exhibit shallower rotation curve inner slopes than high-mass galaxies, whereas steep inner slopes are found exclusively in high-mass galaxies. This trend may arise from the relationship between the total stellar mass and the mass of the bulge, which are correlated among them. We find a correlation between the inner slope of the rotation curve and the morphological T-type, complementary to the scaling relation between v(c) (0) and mu(0) previously reported in the literature. Although we find that the inner slope increases with the Fourier amplitude A(2) and decreases with the <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> Q(b), this may arise from the presence of the bulge implicit in both A(2) and Q(b).

40|$|We have {{performed}} smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations {{to study the}} response of the central kiloparsec region of a gaseous disk to the imposition of nonaxisymmetric bar potentials. The model galaxies are composed of the three axisymmetric components (halo, disk, and bulge) and a non-axisymmetric bar. These components are assumed to be invariant in time in the frame corotating with the bar. The potential of spherical γ-models of Dehnen is adopted for the bulge component whose density varies as r −γ near the center and r − 4 at larger radii and hence, possesses a central density core for γ = 0 and cusps for γ> 0. Since the central mass concentration of the model galaxies increases with the cusp parameter γ, we have examined here the effect of the central mass concentration by varying the cusp parameter γ on the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies. Our simulations show that the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals are formed by hydrodynamic spiral shocks driven by the gravitational <b>torque</b> of the <b>bar</b> for the models with γ = 0 and 0. 5. On the other hand, the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals in the models with γ = 1 and 1. 5 are explained by gas density waves. Thus, we conclude that the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies changes from the hydrodynamic shocks to the gas density waves when the central mass concentration increases from γ = 0 to 1. 5...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{near-infrared}} survey of early-type galaxies designed to provide information on bar strengths, bulges, disks, and bar parameters in a statistically well-defined sample of S 0 -Sa galaxies. Early-type galaxies have the advantage that their bars are relatively free {{of the effects of}} dust, star formation, and spiral structure that complicate bar studies in later type galaxies. We describe the survey and present results on detailed analysis of the relative Fourier intensity amplitudes of bars in 26 early-type galaxies. We also evaluate the symmetry assumption of these amplitudes with radius, used recently for bar-spiral separation in later-type galaxies. The results show a wide variety of radial Fourier profiles of bars, ranging from simple symmetric profiles that can be represented in terms of a single gaussian component, to both symmetric and asymmetric profiles that can be represented by two overlapping gaussian components. More complicated profiles than these are also found, often due to multiple bar-like features including extended ovals or lenses. Based on the gravitational <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> indicator Q_b, double-gaussian bars are stronger on average than single-gaussian bars, at least for our small sample. We show that published numerical simulations where the bar transfers a large amount of angular momentum to the halo can account for many of the observed profiles. The range of possibilities encountered in models seems well-represented in the observed systems. Comment: Accepted for publication in AJ. 20 pages, 10 figures, uses emulateapj.
