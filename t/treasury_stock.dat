25|$|In the {{lifecycle}} of buildings, {{the replacement}} of assets (capital repairs) requires significant funds which can be obtained {{through a variety of}} ways: assessments on current owners; sales of <b>Treasury</b> <b>Stock</b> (former rental units) to new shareholders; draw downs of reserves; unsecured loans; operating surpluses; fees on the sales of units between shareholders and new and increases to existing mortgages.|$|E
50|$|Unissued {{stock is}} stock {{that has been}} {{authorized}} in a company's charter, but has never been sold. It differs from <b>Treasury</b> <b>stock</b> (in the UK, Treasury shares, as <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> means something else), in that <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> has been issued, and bought back by the company, whereas unissued stock has never been issued.|$|E
50|$|Money {{magazine}} {{estimated that}} the potential {{negative impact on the}} United States stock market may come about when Chinese investors begin to seek out relatively stable U.S. investments in <b>treasuries,</b> <b>stocks,</b> and cash, and further strengthen an already-strong U.S. dollar, thereby raising the prices on U.S. goods and diminishing export profits.|$|R
50|$|Historically, gilt names {{referred}} to their purpose of issuance, or signified how a stock had been created, such as 10¼% Conversion Stock 1999; or different names {{were used for}} different gilts simply to minimise confusion between them.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950's the United State's Treasury became a begrudging {{supplier}} of silver at $ [...]905 an ounce. Bennett {{warned that the}} lack of supply versus the high demand would cause the deficit to fall on the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Stocks.</b> By 1961 the <b>Treasury</b> <b>Stocks</b> had unnecessarily been depleted. In 1963 the government only had 30 million ounces of free silver against the annual coinage requirement for the United States of more than 75 million ounces. The price of silver per ounce was now $ 1.2929 but if the United States bought extra silver the price would go above $ 1.29. The Silver Purchase Act of 1963 was supported by Bennett, the act repealed [...] "existing silver purchase requirements and the transfer of tax of silver bullion." [...] It also allowed the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 notes to replace [...] "silver certificates or the denominations thus making 1.6 billion ounces of silver available to the United States Treasury." ...|$|R
50|$|One way of {{accounting}} for <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> {{is with the}} cost method. In this method, the paid-in capital account is reduced in the balance sheet when the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is bought. When the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is sold back on the open market, the paid-in capital is either debited or credited if it is sold for less or more than the initial cost respectively.|$|E
5000|$|In either method, any {{transaction}} involving <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> cannot {{increase the}} amount of retained earnings. If the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is sold for more than cost, then the paid-in capital <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is the account that is increased, not retained earnings. In auditing financial statements, it is a common practice to check for this error to detect possible attempts to [...] "cook the books." ...|$|E
50|$|Another common way for {{accounting}} for <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is the par value method. In the par value method, {{when the stock}} is purchased back from the market, the books will reflect the action as a retirement of the shares. Therefore, common stock is debited and <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is credited. However, when the <b>treasury</b> <b>stock</b> is resold back to the market the entry in the books {{will be the same}} as the cost method.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1934, {{the price}} of silver in the United States was {{effectively}} set by the government as it would support that price through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $.45 per troy ounce. In 1958, {{with the return of}} lend-lease bullion, the <b>Treasury's</b> <b>stock</b> of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to vend the metal at $.91 per ounce to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that there was not enough silver to make these sales and maintain coinage operations.|$|R
50|$|Two years later, in 1999, {{services}} to Europe were inaugurated through a code share service with Air France, to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{an optimal}} investment and management strategy for a bank under constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) and hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility functions. We {{assume that the}} bank can invest in <b>treasuries,</b> <b>stock</b> index fund and loans, in an environment subject to stochastic interest rate and inflation uncertainty. The interest rate and the expected rate of inflation follow a correlated Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes and the risk premia are constants. Then we consider the portfolio choice under a power utility that the bank's shareholders can maximize expected utility of wealth at a given investment horizon. Closed form solutions are obtained in a dynamic portfolio optimization model.

50|$|The Mint's {{production}} of coins rapidly depleted the <b>Treasury's</b> <b>stock</b> of silver. Prices for the metal were rising {{to such an}} extent that, by early June 1965, a dollar in silver coin contained 93.3 cents' worth of it at market prices. On June 3, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson announced plans to eliminate silver from the dime and quarter in favor of a clad composition, with layers of copper-nickel on each side of a layer of pure copper. The half dollar was changed from 90% silver to 40%. Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1965 in July, under which the Mint transitioned from striking 1964-dated silver quarters to striking 1965-dated clad quarters. Beginning on August 1, 1966, the Mint began to strike 1966-dated pieces, and thereafter it resumed the normal practice of striking the current year's date on each piece.|$|R

500|$|On June 3, 1965, President Johnson sent {{a special}} message to Congress, asking it to pass {{legislation}} allowing the dime and quarter to be made from base metal, and to reduce the silver content of the half dollar to 40 percent.

40|$|Using {{data from}} 1983 to 2010, we propose a new fear measure for Treasury markets, {{akin to the}} VIX for equities, labeled TIV. We show that TIV {{explains}} {{one third of the}} time variation in fund- ing liquidity and that the spread between the VIX and TIV captures flight to quality. We then construct Treasury bond variance risk premia as the difference between the implied variance and an expected variance estimate using autoregressive models. Bond variance risk premia display pronounced spikes during crisis periods. We show that variance risk premia encompass a broad spectrum of macroeconomic uncertainty. Uncertainty about the nominal and the real side of the economy increase variance risk premia but uncertainty about monetary policy has a strongly neg- ative effect. We document that bond variance risk premia predict excess returns on <b>Treasuries,</b> <b>stocks,</b> corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Fur- thermore, this predictability is not subsumed by other standard predictors. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how emerging bond markets react to macroeconomic announcements. Global bond spreads respond to rating actions {{and changes in}} global interest rates rather than domestic data and policy announcements. All announcements affect market volatility. Data and policy announcements reduce uncertainty and stabilize the trading environment, while rating actions cause greater volatility. Results are broadly robust to country-specific and panel analyses, assuming conditional variance and controlling for the surprise content of news. In subsamples, announcements are found to matter less for countries with more transparent policies and higher credit ratings. In a crisis, rating actions become less important, and investors focus more on simple and timely indicators, like CPI.
