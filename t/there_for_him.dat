5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the corridors, and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS in the secondary control room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} speak to the Doctor again but will be <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E

5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

25|$|In 1906, the novitiate {{constructed}} a chapel {{attached to the}} main building. It was sponsored by Mrs. Thomas F. Ryan and dedicated to New York's Archbishop John Farley. St. Andrew also had another chapel, dedicated to Our Lady of the Way, near the entranceway to the property. James D. Murphy built the primary building as well as this chapel, the latter of which he built at his own expense. Publisher P. J. Kenedy later became the chapel's beneficiary, and built a mortuary called Della Strada <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and his family to be buried in. The chapel's construction began on October 2, 1905, the cornerstone was laid July 8, 1906, and the building was dedicated November 19, 1907. In 1918-19, the Via Regis, a covered walkway to the chapel, was created. Prior to that, the Jesuits would have to cross the open courtyard or walk around the open cloisters. The courtyard was landscaped in 1904 and held a statue of the Sacred Heart in its center until construction of the Via Regis.|$|E

So he obviously cared about Lyn, but then she came back and haunted him." [...] His relationship with Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall) at times can be fiery, of this Dennis said: [...] "I want to see Paul and Rebecca be like Angie and Dirty Den. I think Rebecca is capable of that. She plays a fiery character and is a very strong. Paul needs somebody who is absolutely <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and adores him, but will take no shit from him and stand up and fight as hard as she does." ...|$|E

All of that somehow makes his 'evil' actions all the more despicable, because we know that there was the potential in <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to be a better person."

2500|$|As Iorga recalled, both of Moruzi's novels were {{accomplished}} and [...] "vibrated youthful, brave, nationalism", but were also [...] "hardly ever {{picked up and}} read". According to critic Radu Dragnea, Moruzi did not fit the stylistic mold of the 1910s, [...] "as {{if there is no}} literature out <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to acknowledge"; also, according to Carp, the Knyaz detested the work of Romanian Symbolists, showing similarities with traditionalists such as Ion Gorun, George Panu, and Mihail Sadoveanu. Dragnea therefore concluded that Moruzi [...] "does not write for us, his contemporaries, who aren't satisfied with anything [...] His entire work will stand as a precious document in days to come". While repeatedly refusing to write an actual autobiography, Moruzi had begun work on Moartea lui Cain ("Death of Cain"), which was only published posthumously. In some ways a sequel to Înstrăinații, it details the peasants' revolt of 1907.|$|E

Herrera worked as a farm hand, marrying and raising a family in El Paso before moving to Phoenix, Arizona with his American wife Ramona and three children, Mary, Elva, Silvestre, Jr. and his uncle. [...] When the United States entered World War II Herrera was drafted into the Texas National Guard, 36th Division.

[...] The kilns were abandoned, and the workers dispersed. [...] A gift of 16 itemized pieces to Gaozong in 1151 is recorded; a rather tiny quantity by imperial standards, suggestive of their rarity. [...] The same source records that when in 1179 the aged retired emperor visited a garden, a Ru vase was placed <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to admire. [...] In the south a form of official Guan ware, more green than blue, seems to have acted as a rather inadequate substitute for the court.|$|E
