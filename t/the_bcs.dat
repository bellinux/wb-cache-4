5|$|By contract, the top {{two teams}} in <b>the</b> <b>BCS</b> Poll at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season were invited to <b>the</b> <b>BCS</b> national championship game. In 2000, <b>the</b> <b>BCS</b> Poll was a combination of four different systems: media and coaches' polls (Associated Press college football poll and USA Today Coaches' Poll), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under <b>the</b> <b>BCS,</b> the site of the national championship game rotated every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl. The national championship game rotated to a different location each year, and the other three games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, <b>the</b> <b>BCS</b> National Championship was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the national championship game.|$|E

Spread bettors predicted Virginia Tech would win the game. Various betting organizations favored the Hokies by four or 4.5points. The matchup was a repeat of the inaugural ACC Championship game, and according to observers, the Seminoles' presence appeared to mark a resurgence for Florida State, which performed below expectations in the final years of Bowden's tenure. For Virginia Tech, there were hopes of breaking a trend of losing to Florida State. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was 1–8 against Florida State, and the Hokies overall were 11–22–1 against the Seminoles.|$|E
