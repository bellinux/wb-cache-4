5000|$|Townsend, Holst and Oosterhuis {{also put}} forward an {{alternative}} hypothesis, considering the augmented emission of electrons by the cathode caused by impact of positive ions. This introduced <b>Townsend's</b> second <b>ionisation</b> coefficient {{the average number}} of electrons released from a surface by an incident positive ion, according to the following formula: ...|$|R
40|$|Steady-state {{ionisation}} currents under {{uniform field}} conditions have been measured in SF 6 {{over the range}} 110 ÃÂ¿E/pÃÂ¿ 1000 V cmÃÂ¿ 1 torrÃÂ¿ 1 with gas pressures varying from 1 to 10 torr, at 20 ÃÂ°C. Sparking potentials Vs were also measured for a range 1 ÃÂ¿pdÃÂ¿ 20 torr-cm. <b>Townsend's</b> primary <b>ionisation</b> (ÃÂ¿/p) and electron-attachment (ÃÂ¿/p) coefficients were found to depend on E/p only. The values of secondary-ionisation coefficient (ÃÂ¿) were also determined over the range 140 ÃÂ¿E/pÃÂ¿ 600 V cmÃÂ¿ 1 torrÃÂ¿ 1.
