5|$|On November 6, 2012, Warren {{defeated}} incumbent Scott Brown with a {{total of}} 53.7% of the votes. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts, as part of a sitting U.S. Senate that had 20 female senators in office, the largest female U.S. Senate delegation in history, following the November 2012 elections. In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Banking</b> Committee, the committee that oversees the implementation of Dodd–Frank and other regulation of the banking industry. Warren was sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden on January 3, 2013.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposal}} {{to revive the}} three-cent piece was made in 1911, when Mayors Brand Whitlock of Toledo, Ohio, and Newton D. Baker of Cleveland sent a joint memorial to Congress urging its return. The following year, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures held a hearing on bills to authorize a copper-nickel three-cent piece and to change {{the composition of the}} cent to copper-nickel. Mint Director George E. Roberts testified and indicated he had no objection to a three-cent piece, as there was at least limited demand for a coin larger than the cent and smaller than the nickel. In 1936, a bill for a three-cent nickel was among various coin legislation considered by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Banking</b> Committee. In 1942, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary the temporary authority to change the composition of the nickel because of wartime metal shortages, and if public demand for the five-cent piece required it, the Mint could strike three-cent pieces. Nothing came of any of the proposals. The three-cent piece was made fully legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965, which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to any amount for payment of public and private debt. By then, that coin had long since passed from the scene.|$|E
25|$|NCPC {{and city}} {{officials}} attempted to remove the 1949 bar on the Marshall Heights redevelopment in 1954. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Banking</b> and Currency Committee approved legislation in May 1954 that would have removed the prohibition from the books, but this provision was deleted in conference committee.|$|E

50|$|The idea {{of owning}} {{government}} bonds initially became ideal to investors when Liberty Loan drives encouraged this possession in America during World War I. This strive for dominion persisted into the 1920s. After World War I, the United States became the world’s creditor and was depended upon by many foreign nations. “Governments {{from around the}} globe looked to Wall Street for loans”. Investors then started to depend on these loans for further investments. Chief counsel of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Bank</b> Committee, Ferdinand Pecora, disclosed that National City executives were also dependent on loans from a special bank fund as a safety net for their stock losses while American banker, Albert Wiggin, “made millions selling short his own bank shares”.|$|R

25|$|He {{was unable}} to return to {{teaching}} until at least 1929. However, in the early 1930s, he continued to issue criticisms of the railroad industry labor practices. In 1931, he had also testified at a Senate banking inquiry, urging the curbing of investment trusts. In 1932, he appeared at <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Banking</b> and Currency Committee, and demanded public inquiry into the financial affairs of corporations and authored {{a series of articles}} in the New York Times stressing the importance of railroad economics to the country's economy.

25|$|This time, the DVLMF {{commemorative}} coin act {{originated in the}} House of Representatives. Representative Dennis Moore (D-Kansas) introduced H.R. 634 in January 2007, and it passed the House 416-to-0 in May. Senator Tim Johnson then introduced companion legislation (S. 2119) in the Senate in October 2007. The DVLMF told members of Congress that the foundation had raised roughly $43 million of the $65 million needed to build the memorial, and that {{commemorative coin}} sales would allow it to complete fundraising in 2008. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Banking</b> Committee favorably reported the legislation on May 20, 2008, with clarifying legislation from Senator Johnson. The Senate adopted the amended bill by a unanimous vote on June 10, and the House adopted the Senate bill on June 18.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, while {{testifying before}} Senator Arlen Specter and the Senate Judiciary Committee about Mack, Pequot Capital and the SEC lack of oversight, {{he warned that}} SEC {{enforcement}} was dangerously lax. He said that the SEC had recovered a mere $110,000 from hedge fund insider trading over one year when the Committee itself had found evidence that over a one-year period, more than 41% of all mergers and acquisitions of over a billion dollars involved insider trading. Aguirre warned that lack of effective oversight of rampant corruption was allowing Wall Street the same unregulated market abuse and leveraging that caused the Wall Street crash of 1929. In 2008, he delivered a similar message at the Sibos conference in Vienna. Just prior {{to the collapse of}} Bear Stearns, he wrote a letter to <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Banking</b> Committee that the nation's banks, and particularly Bear Stearns, were at risk because of subprime debt exposure and credit default swaps. In September 2008, during the debate on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Aguirre's projections on the costs of the taxpayer bailout were cited {{on the floor of the}} U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to gain {{acceptance}} for the new composition, the Mint distributed approximately three dozen examples to {{various members of the}} House Banking and Currency Committee and <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Banking,</b> Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Nine congressmen and four senators received examples, along with some Treasury officials. Additional specimens were given out by then Mint Director Mary Brooks. Ultimately, the proposal was rejected in Congress, due mainly to the efforts of the copper-mining and vending machine industries, which felt the coins would cause mechanical problems. Opposition also came from pediatricians and pediatric radiologists who pointed out the radiodensity of the metal inside the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was close to that of soft tissue, and therefore would be difficult to detect in X-ray imaging. In addition, the price of copper declined enough that making copper cents would again be economically viable, and conversely made hoarding pointless. The idea of changing the composition of the cent would not be explored again until the 1980s. In 1982, the composition of the coin was changed to the current 99.2% zinc and 0.8% copper core alloy with a plating of pure copper, resulting in a 20% weight reduction.|$|E

50|$|As {{economic}} conditions worsened in 2007 and 2008, Steel helped design the federal government's response. In April 2008, Steel testified before <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>Banking</b> Committee regarding <b>the</b> rescue of Bear Stearns.

500|$|As {{a result}} of the hearings, several {{additional}} bills were introduced, and additional hearings were held before a Senate subcommittee on June 6. [...] Brooks testified again, and responding to criticism that only the two least popular denominations were to be changed, indicated her support for a Bicentennial quarter as well. [...] On June 13, a bill, S. 1141 which provided for a circulating Bicentennial quarter, half dollar and dollar, gave permission for coins to be struck at West Point and allowed for 40% silver clad versions of the new coins for collectors was reported favorably by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Banking</b> Committee. [...] It passed the Senate on July 13. [...] However, amendments authorizing US citizens to own gold, and to implement the Hatfield proposal were attached to the bill. [...] A similar bill passed the House of Representatives on September 12, differing from the Senate bill in lacking any provision relating to gold, and in not authorizing silver versions of the new coins.|$|E
