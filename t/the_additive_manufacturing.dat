EBF3 is a NASA-patented additive manufacturing process designed to build near-net-shape parts requiring less raw material and finish machining than traditional manufacturing methods. EBF3 {{is a process}} by which NASA plans to build metal parts in zero-gravity environments; this layer-additive process uses an electron beam and a solid wire feedstock to fabricate metallic structures. The process efficiencies of the electron beam and the feedstock make the EBF3 process appropriate for in-space use. Since 2000, {{a team of researchers}} at the NASA LaRC have led the fundamental research and development of this technique for additive manufacturing for metallic aerospace structures. Additive manufacturing encompasses processes in which parts are built by successively adding material rather than by cutting or grinding it away as in conventional machining.

The process involves heat and pressure to enhance {{the properties of the}} urethanes during casting. The casting process has found use in the medical industry. In 2008, Solid Concepts branded and trademarked ID-Light, which is a method of printing SLA and FDM parts that is 1/12 the weight of regular SLA and FDM parts. The process has allowed lighter props for movies involving huge set pieces, such as the robots in Real Steel. Solid Concepts was ranked in the top twenty manufacturing companies in the greater San Fernando Valley by San Fernando Business Journal in 2007. In 2013, the company was awarded a Platinum Source Preferred Supplier by Northrop Grumman.
