5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{calculation}} of Taylor series {{of a large number}} of functions. One can attempt to use the definition of <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> series, though this often requires generalizing the form of the coefficients according to a readily apparent pattern. Alternatively, one can use manipulations such as substitution, multiplication or division, addition or subtraction of standard Taylor series to construct <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> series of a function, by virtue of Taylor series being power series. In some cases, one can also derive <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> series by repeatedly applying integration by parts. Particularly convenient is the use of computer algebra systems to calculate Taylor series.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil War, all aircraft, equipment, materiel, and {{facilities}} belonging to the Liberian Air Force were badly damaged, rendering the force inoperable. During the Civil War <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> government made a variety of different air support arrangements; a seemingly inoperable Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8, one in Anti-Terrorist Unit markings, could be seen at Spriggs Payne Airport in central Monrovia in mid-2005, apparently a hangover from the war. Meanwhile, during <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> era, the Navy consisted of a couple of small patrol craft. However, on shore, both late 1990s and 2005 sources indicate the Navy included the 2nd Naval District, Buchanan, the 3rd Naval District, Greenville, and the 4th Naval District, Harper.|$|E
5|$|East–west-directed {{compression}} from subduction off {{the west}} coast affected the area in later Mesozoic and early Tertiary time by folding and thrust faulting strata. Evidence for the Sevier Orogeny part of this period {{can be seen in}} <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> Creek area in the Kolob section of the park. Chunks of Moenave strata have been compressed to the point of thrusting themselves over the same formation in <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> Creek Thrust Fault Zone, located on the east flank of the Kanarra anticline.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, such as formal analysis, {{it is more}} {{convenient}} to work directly with the power series themselves. Thus one may define a solution of a differential equation as a power series which, one hopes to prove, is <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> series of the desired solution.|$|E

5|$|Anfield could {{accommodate}} {{more than}} 60,000 supporters at its peak, {{and had a}} capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s. <b>The</b> <b>Taylor</b> Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater stadium {{in time for the}} 1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276. The findings of <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> Report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> Report {{demanded that}} the stadium be all-seated, Easter Road had vast banks of {{terracing}} on three sides, which meant that it could hold crowds in excess of 60,000. The record attendance of 65,860, {{which is also a}} record for a football match played in Edinburgh, was set by an Edinburgh derby played on 2 January 1950. Such vast crowds were drawn by the success of the Famous Five.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 1990s the {{downward}} trend was starting to reverse: at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, and <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums {{in the aftermath of the}} Hillsborough disaster, was published in January of that year.|$|E

5|$|Coloured {{seats and}} a police room {{were added to the}} Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough {{disaster}} in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action. The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.|$|E
5|$|Despite treatment, Taylor died at 10:35p.m. on July 9, 1850. He was 65 years old. After his death, Vice President Fillmore {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} and completed Taylor's term, which ended on March 4, 1853. Soon after taking office, Fillmore signed into law the Compromise of 1850, which settled {{many of the issues}} faced by <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> administration.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of <b>the</b> <b>Taylor</b> Report in January 1990, Sunderland was obliged to make plans to turn their Roker Park home into an all-seater stadium. Roker Park was a ground that mainly {{consisted}} of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held far fewer spectators than before. Enclosed by residential streets on all sides, expansion was practically impossible. So, by 1991, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray began investigating the possibility of relocation to a new stadium.|$|E
5|$|Highbury {{could hold}} more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, {{and had a}} {{capacity}} of 57,000 until the early 1990s. <b>The</b> <b>Taylor</b> Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium {{in time for the}} 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint.
