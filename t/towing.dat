40|$|The {{concept of}} using an {{unmanned}} <b>towed</b> glider for high altitude scientific research {{had been previously}} proposed. This paper examines the feasibility of this concept by determining what impact the various characteristics of the <b>tow</b> line, glider and <b>tow</b> aircraft have on <b>tow</b> line drag. A description of the analysis and computer code used to generate the results is given. The parameters examined were glider altitude, <b>tow</b> aircraft glider separation distance, velocity, <b>tow</b> line drag coefficient and <b>tow</b> line material properties. The results from the analysis show that the <b>tow</b> line drag increases significantly with <b>tow</b> aircraft/glider separation. The drag increased from 940 N (211 lb) with a <b>tow</b> aircraft/glider separation of 3 km to 11, 970 N (2691 lb) with a <b>tow</b> aircraft/glider separation of 10 km. The results also show that by varying some of the initial assumptions significant reductions in <b>tow</b> line drag and weight can be obtained. The variables which had the greatest effect on reducing the <b>tow</b> line drag were the decrease in <b>tow</b> aircraft/glider separation distance, the increase in <b>tow</b> line strength and the decrease in glider Mach number...|$|R

5|$|The {{second and}} last mission—Operation Fustian—began at 19:30 on 12July, {{when the first}} {{aircraft}} carrying the 1st Parachute Brigade took off from North Africa. Following behind the parachute force were the glider-towing aircraft, comprising twelve Albemarles and seven Halifaxes, <b>towing</b> eleven Horsa and eight Waco gliders. The first glider casualties occurred on takeoff, when two aircraft <b>towing</b> Waco gliders crashed. While en route, one glider was released prematurely by its <b>towing</b> aircraft and crashed into the sea. Arriving over Sicily, having lost the element of surprise, four gliders were shot down by coastal anti-aircraft batteries. By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones, two hours had lapsed {{since the start of}} the parachute landings. With the German defences alerted, only four Horsa gliders managed to land mostly intact, all the others being caught by German machine-gun fire and destroyed on their approach. The surviving Horsas had been carrying three of the brigade's anti-tank guns, which were now included in their defence of Primosole Bridge.|$|E
5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve with guns and six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s <b>towing</b> the guns and another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two <b>towing</b> Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.|$|E

These aircraft, again supplied by No. 38 Wing, comprised 12 Albemarles and seven Handley Page Halifaxes, <b>towing</b> 11 Horsa gliders and eight Waco gliders.

40|$|A 16 -person {{full-scale}} {{life raft}} was <b>towed</b> in a <b>tow</b> tank in calm water, regular and irregular waves. The objectives were {{to assess the}} raft motion response, occupant motion, <b>tow</b> force, effect of <b>tow</b> speed, effects of different test variables (drogue deployment, floor inflation, weight distribution and ballast), {{and the likelihood of}} occupant motion sickness. Comparisons of RAOs obtained in regular and irregular waves demonstrated that irregular waves {{could be used as a}} cost effective means to determine raft response with a high degree of confidence. They also show that the life raft <b>tow</b> performance is different in waves than in calm water. For example, mean <b>tow</b> force is 20 % higher in the sea state tested than in calm water. Floor inflation, drogue deployment, even weight distribution and <b>tow</b> speed increase mean <b>tow</b> force and <b>tow</b> force variation about its mean. The data also show that the same ballast types should be used to access the effects of different variables because manikin and water bag ballast produce different results. Measured occupant heave acceleration was about the same as the raft heave acceleration. From occupant heave acceleration, it was estimated that after 20 hours in the raft, 20 % of occupants would vomit. Formulae were proposed to predict <b>tow</b> force in different sea states. Mean <b>tow</b> forces predicted using calm water <b>tow</b> resistance and RAOs derived from regular wave <b>tow</b> tests compared well with measured mean <b>tow</b> force in irregular waves.

5|$|Two aircraft, each <b>towing</b> one glider, left Scotland on {{the night}} of 19 November 1942. All managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but none were able to reach their objective. The first pair {{suffered}} from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash-landing, with its <b>towing</b> aircraft returning to base; eight airborne troops were killed outright, four were severely injured and five unhurt. The survivors were captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons; the aircrew and several men were killed outright, and those who survived were taken prisoner. None of the prisoners survived for very long, being either poisoned or executed as a result of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order, which stated that all British Commandos personnel were to be killed immediately when captured.|$|E
