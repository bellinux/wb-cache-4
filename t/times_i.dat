5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several <b>times</b> <b>I</b> would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E

25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last <b>times</b> <b>I</b> saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch {{was talking about how}} much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going to}} neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't know anyone in boxing who won't miss him. I don't know anyone in boxing that can take his place.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} aims {{to test the}} {{hypotheses}} that are central to Karasek's Job Demand Control Model in relation to workplace bullying. Particular contributions are, first, the focus upon both targets and perpetrators of workplace bullying, and second, the two-wave design with a 6 -month time lag. We assume that (a) workload at <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> associates positively with being a target/perpetrator at Time 2, (b) job autonomy at <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> associates negatively with being a target/perpetrator at Time 2, and (c) the positive relationship between workload at <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> and being a target/perpetrator at Time 2 is stronger under the condition of low (vs. high) job autonomy at <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> (i. e., interaction between workload and job autonomy). Moderated hierarchical regression analyses (N = 320) revealed lagged main effects for being a target, and interaction effects for being a perpetrator. In particular, <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> workload was positively and <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> job autonomy negatively associated with being a target at Time 2. Job autonomy at <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> reduced the positive relationship between workload at <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> and being a perpetrator at Time 2. Overall, our results suggest that high strain jobs relate to both being a target and to being perpetrator of workplace bullying, yet through different processes: main effects and interactions, respectively. status: publishe...|$|R
