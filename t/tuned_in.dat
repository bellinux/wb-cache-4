5|$|Blue's Clues premiered in the U.S. on September 8, 1996. It was a smash hit, {{largely due}} to the producers'extensive research, and became crucial to Nickelodeon's growth. Within 18 months of its premiere, Blue's Clues was as {{well-known}} as more established children's shows such as the 30-year-old Sesame Street. It became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on commercial television. By 2002, 13.7 million viewers <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> each week.|$|E

5000|$|Until the 1970s it was {{traditional}} to play {{a single}} tune {{for the duration of}} a contra dance (about 5 to 10 minutes). Since then, contra dance musicians have typically played <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> sets of two or three related (and sometimes contrasting) tunes, though single-tune dances are again becoming popular with some northeastern bands. In the Celtic repertoires it is common to change keys with each tune. A set might start with a <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> G, switch to a <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> D, and end with a <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> Bm. Here, D is related to G as its dominant (5th), while D and Bm share a key signature of two sharps. In the old-time tradition the musicians will either play the same tune for the whole dance, or switch to <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> the same key. This is because the tunings of the five-string banjo are key-specific. An old-time band might play a set of <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> D, then use the time between dances to retune for a set of <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> A. (Fiddlers also may take this opportunity to retune; tune- or key-specific fiddle tunings are uncommon in American Anglo-Celtic traditions other than old-time.) ...|$|R

5|$|An episode {{featuring}} a storyline about a school shooting garnered the series {{an all-time high}} audience of 930,000 Canadian viewers. A second episode with a storyline about oral sex also earned just under 1,000,000 viewers. Overall, the season averaged an audience of 600,000 and was the top domestic drama for Canadian teenagers aged 12 to 17, and adults in three age brackets; ages 18 to 34, ages 18 to 49, and ages 25 to 54. In the US, the season received an 80% larger audience compared to season three, and one episode received 540,000 viewers and drew a Nielsen rating of 2.7 for teenagers and 4.7 for female teenagers, meaning that on average 2.7% of the nation's teenagers, and 4.7% of the nation's female teenagers were <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> at any given moment.|$|E

5|$|It {{was decided}} {{early on that}} most of the budget be spent on the writing and voice actors. The {{original}} story was written in French by Jean-Luc Cano, and converted into a game script by the co-directors and design team. It was subsequently handed over to Christian Divine and Cano to be fine <b>tuned</b> <b>in</b> English. Story and character development were highlighted over point-and-click puzzles, making choice and consequence integral to how the narrative unfolds. Hannah Telle auditioned for Max Caulfield in July 2014 and was offered the part; Ashly Burch auditioned for both Max and her given role Chloe Price.
