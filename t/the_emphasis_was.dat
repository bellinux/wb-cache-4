5|$|Feed {{the public}} {{little more than}} rural comedies, {{fast-moving}} detective dramas and, later, sexy dolls. No old people; <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on youth. No domestic servants, the mass audience wouldn't identify with maids. No serious problems to cope with. Every script had {{to be full of}} action. No physical infirmities.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the desired {{performance}}, Lockheed chose a minimalist approach: a design that would achieve high performance by wrapping the lightest, most aerodynamically efficient airframe possible around a single powerful engine. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on minimizing drag and mass.|$|E
5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square.|$|E
5000|$|In Western {{countries}} <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on psychiatry or psychology; typically, in Latin America, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> {{ability to}} [...] "pass", and in Thailand <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on cross-living experience.|$|R
50|$|Simply, in a caff√® latte, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> coffee, {{while in}} a latte macchiato, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> milk.|$|R

5|$|As Stone & Webster {{began work}} on the {{production}} facilities, {{it became clear that}} building the township as well would be beyond its capacity. The Army therefore engaged the architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to design and build the township. The John B. Pierce Foundation were brought in as a consultant. In turn, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill brought in numerous subcontractors. This first phase of construction became known as the East Town. It included some 3,000 family dwellings, an administrative center, three shopping centers, three grade schools for 500 children each and a high school for 500, recreation buildings, men's and women's dormitories, cafeterias, a medical services building and a 50-bed hospital. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on speed of construction and getting around wartime shortages of materials. Where possible, fiberboard and gypsum board were used instead of wood, and foundations were made from concrete blocks rather than poured concrete. The work was completed in early 1944.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} SaGa 1 was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu, {{and that of}} SaGa 2 by Uematsu and Kenji Ito, while the music of SaGa 3 was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Chihiro Fujioka. Uematsu has stated that while SaGa 1s music could be made of better quality, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on enjoying the game, and not solely its appearance or sound. The Game Boy's sound hardware was {{different from that of}} the Famicom, which Uematsu was used to composing for at the time, with new stereo and waveforms and only three notes; as a result, Uematsu struggled with deciding how to work with these, developing new themes for the music in the process despite SaGa 1s director Akitoshi Kawazu's desire to have the music be in the same vein as Square's preceding Final Fantasy titles. Uematsu has stated that the Game Boy was a system he would like to compose for again. SaGa 2 was the first soundtrack or album that Kenji Ito worked on.|$|E
50|$|Track {{days are}} also often {{held in the}} guise of racing schools where <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on {{nurturing}} <b>the</b> finer skills of machine control and race craft, often under the tutelage of experienced former racers. Whatever the interpretation, primarily track days are all about having fun, whether motorbike or car, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on enjoyment in a controlled and suitable environment.|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} three centuries <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on the veneration of martyrs, as a {{continuation}} of the yearly celebrations of their death, e.g. as noted in the early Christian text on the Martyrdom of Polycarp.|$|E
25|$|Bedford Purlieus {{has been}} {{owned by the}} Forestry Commission since 1933. Throughout the war and post-war years <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on {{maximising}} timber production. The 1970s saw a new interest in the ecological value of the woods, and the possibilities for both leisure and conservation.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{immunology}} began over 90 {{years ago}} with the theoretic modeling of malaria epidemiology. At that time, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on the use of mathematics to guide the study of disease transmission. Since then, the field has expanded to cover all other aspects of immune system processes and diseases.|$|E
40|$|This Section {{introduces}} {{the area of}} tire modelling {{with a focus on}} the modelling of tire behavior to support the simulation of vehicles both on-road and off-road. For on-road work <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on empirical models, for off-road work <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> physical modelling of the tire. The most recognized tire models in these areas, the Magic Formula and FTire are both also briefly introduced...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of the 163d, this was already the case in the F-4 and even in the F-100 days. In the early days of F-16 {{operations}} <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> more on air defense than on the attack role. With the absence of modern targeting pods the deployment of air-to-ground weapons was somewhat hampered since other units had to be called upon to perform the target designation.|$|E
25|$|By 1959, Tengku Jalal Nasir {{established}} the Patani National Liberation Front (BNPP), the first Malay rebel group. At {{the time of}} their foundation the goal of the nationalist movements, such as the Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO) established in 1968, was secession. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> laid in pursuing an armed struggle towards an independent state where Patani people could live with dignity without having alien cultural values imposed on them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> put on toys {{that had an}} {{educational}} purpose to them, such as puzzles, books, cards and board games. Religiously themed toys were also popular, including a model Noah's Ark with miniature animals and objects from other Bible scenes. With growing prosperity among the middle class, children had more leisure time on their hands, {{which led to the}} application of industrial methods to the manufacture of toys.|$|E

40|$|Practices {{in reading}} {{readiness}} programs vary considerably (Spache & Spache, 1973). In some programs <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> upon language development; in other programs <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> upon perceptual 1 and/or perceptual-motor training. In fact, in some programs (e. g., Kephart, 1960; Frostig, 1961), {{little or no}} attention is given to language development, and even in programs that have a language-development component, some emphasis on perceptual and/or perceptual-motor training is common...|$|R
50|$|Basic {{services}} in HiperLAN/2 are data, sound, and video transmission. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> quality {{of these services}} (QoS).|$|R
25|$|The {{main idea}} of racial antisemitism, as {{presented}} by racial theorists such as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau, {{is that the}} Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to the European nations. <b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on the non-European origin {{and culture of the}} Jews, meaning they were beyond redemption even if they converted to Christianity. This modern antisemitism emphasized hatred of the Jews as a race and not only the Jewish religion.|$|E
25|$|Social media {{networks}} {{are used in}} two distinct ways during conflicts: as organizing tools and as broadcasting platforms. During {{the civil war in}} Libya <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on broadcasting {{to the rest of the}} world, because only a relatively few Libyans (5%) had access to the Internet, because the Internet was already being filtered by the government prior to the start of protests in mid-February, and because the Internet in Libya was almost completely shutdown by the government starting in early March.|$|E
25|$|Green's engines {{were noted}} for their reliability, and Green {{reinforced}} that reputation with entries into Government competitions; in 1910 the D.4 won the ¬£1.000 prize {{donated to the}} winner by Patrick Alexander. There was a maximum power test, the D.4 achieving 67.8hp at 1,210rpm, but <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on endurance: the engine had to produce two non-stop 12 hr runs and average more than 58.5hp. In the event, the D.4 averaged 61.6hp with few signs of wear on inspection afterwards.|$|E
50|$|In {{the applied}} sciences, <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on nanotechnology, process technology, engineering, {{information}} & communication technology, and the biomedical sciences.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> for war {{supplies}} {{as soon as}} possible, {{regardless of}} cost and inefficiencies. Industry quickly absorbed the slack in the labor force, and the tables turned such that employers needed to actively and aggressively recruit workers. As the military grew, new labor sources were needed to replace the 12million men serving in the military. Propaganda campaigns started pleading for people {{to work in the}} war factories. The barriers for married women, the old, the unskilled‚Äîand (in the North and West) the barriers for racial minorities‚Äîwere lowered.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century three {{localised}} {{areas of}} textile production could be identified in Lancashire. Linen was woven in the west of the county and in Manchester while in upland Pennine regions, woollens were woven and in central Lancashire <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on fustians, cloth made with a linen warp and wool weft. In central Lancashire weavers subsequently switched to calico, cloth with a cotton warp and a cotton weft. In the 1790s, the demand for calico expanded and more towns switched to cotton weaving producing cloth for the emerging printing industry.|$|E
25|$|In England a Baron was a peerage title, {{this was}} not the case in Scotland. He or she held their land {{directly}} from the King or Queen. After c1700 <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> on administration, a good neighbourhood and economic and other rules for the benefit of those living within the Barony. In 1747 the criminal jurisdiction of a Baron Court was much restricted. The Barony was largely a self-governing community, however there was a system of appeals to the Sheriff and the Central Courts.|$|E
