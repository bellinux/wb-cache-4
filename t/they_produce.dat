5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders because <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also important because <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass on. All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereum is {{the single}} genus in the fungal family Amylostereaceae. The genus {{currently}} comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or dead wood. The Amylostereaceae cause white rot in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin. <b>They</b> <b>produce</b> crust-like, partially wavy fruit bodies {{on the surface of}} infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year during}} the warmer months of September through December, male banded sea kraits gather on land and in the water around gently sloping areas at high tide. Males prefer to mate with larger females because <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> larger and more offspring.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> Transambient for Channel 4 in the UK. From 2000 to 2005 <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> the DJ/VJ music series Mixmasters for the UK's ITV1.|$|R

50|$|In 1996, F. Korbel & Bros., Inc. {{acquired}} a 50 {{percent stake in}} the winery. In 1999, Korbel acquired the remaining 50 percent and bought out the founders. Under Korbel's management, Kenwood nearly doubled in size. In 1996, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> less than 300,000 cases. In 1999, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> more than 500,000 cases.|$|R
5|$|Frigatebirds {{remain in}} the air and do not settle on the ocean. <b>They</b> <b>produce</b> very little oil from their uropygial glands so their {{feathers}} would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative to body size, they would have great difficulty taking off again.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Marta Sebregondi read The Songlines and {{proposed}} to her employer, Modo & Modo, an Italian design and publishing company, that <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> moleskine notebooks. In 1997, {{the company began}} to sell these books and used Chatwin's name to promote them. Modo & Modo was sold in 2006, and the company became known as Moleskine SpA.|$|E
5|$|Like all cetaceans, {{killer whales}} depend heavily on {{underwater}} sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. <b>They</b> <b>produce</b> {{three categories of}} sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks {{are believed to be}} used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.|$|E

5|$|Like other boletes, Boletus pinophilus has small pores on the {{underside}} of its cap rather than gills. These are coloured white at first, becoming yellow with age and olivaceous-brown at full maturity. The spores are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil drops and dimensions 15.520 by 4.55.5µm. <b>They</b> <b>produce</b> an olive-brown spore print.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} classification is a discipline {{in its own}} right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, etc. However, the most common academic method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses {{the means by which}} <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{recently}} discovered archaeal involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions. These reactions {{are particularly important}} in the oceans. The archaea also appear crucial for ammonia oxidation in soils. <b>They</b> <b>produce</b> nitrite, which other microbes then oxidize to nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Littlemore started {{producing}} pop music, {{teaming up}} with London producer Nellee Hooper, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> Gwen Stefani's debut solo single [...] "What You Waiting For". In Los Angeles <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> six more songs with her. [...] "What You Waiting For" [...] went on to be the number 1 single in Australia {{for a number of}} weeks.|$|R
50|$|Upon meeting Georges Pichard, the two began a {{partnership}} that would span several works {{and a few}} genres. Initially <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> Ténébrax in 1964, for the short-lived magazine Chouchou; its serialisation continued in the Italian magazine Linus. For Pilote, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> the family-friendly superhero parody, Submerman. The following series Blanche Épiphanie, serialised in V Magazine in 1968, was of a different character however, and its erotic qualities caused mixed public reaction. In this genre, <b>they</b> also <b>produced</b> Ulysse for Charlie Mensuel in 1969.|$|R

5|$|Sounds and {{gestures}} help {{keep track of}} other dolphins in the group, and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food. Lacking vocal cords, <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> sounds using six air sacs near their blow hole. Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle).|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of hurricane forecast models can vary significantly from storm to storm. For some storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are relatively straightforward, and the models {{are not only}} accurate but <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> similar forecasts, while for other storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are more complex and different models produce very different forecasts.|$|E
5|$|The lichen's cortex and medulla react {{positively}} with potassium hydroxide (K), turning yellow. Cortex and medulla react {{positively with}} para-phenylenediamene (Pd) as well, also turning yellow. <b>They</b> <b>produce</b> no reaction with calcium or sodium hypochlorite (bleach – C), nor with KC (potassium hydroxide quickly followed by bleach). Among the substances {{produced by the}} lichen are atranorin and zeorin.|$|E

5|$|The olive {{appears to}} come from the region of Persia and Mesopotamia, at least 6,000 years ago. It spread from there to nearby areas, and has been {{cultivated}} since the early Bronze Age (up to 3,150 BC) in southern Turkey, the Levant, and Crete. The ten countries with the largest harvests (in 2011) are all near the Mediterranean (Portugal being the tenth largest): together, <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> 95% of the world's olives.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most bony fish, {{sharks are}} K-selected reproducers, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> {{a small number}} of {{well-developed}} young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. Fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle. Sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish. For example, lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13–15.|$|E
5|$|Wild orangutans (P. pygmaeus wurmbii) in Tuanan, Borneo, were {{reported}} to use tools in acoustic communication. They use leaves to amplify the kiss squeak sounds <b>they</b> <b>produce.</b> The apes may employ this method of amplification to deceive the listener into believing they are larger animals.|$|E

50|$|The first {{orders were}} for small {{engineering}} machines and components but the firm quickly expanded into bigger items. <b>They</b> <b>produced</b> an iron seagoing steamer in 1868 and in 1874 <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> the steam boat S.S. Sabrina for the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal Co {{that was used}} on the canal between Gloucester and Sharpness. The Sabrina is still in use on the Thames.|$|R
5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to timbre and volume was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same {{standard}} lest <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{rates of}} {{diffusion}} and perfusion, and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known, and vary considerably. However mathematical {{models have been}} proposed that approximate the real situation {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. These models predict whether symptomatic bubble formation is likely to occur for a given dive profile. Algorithms based on these models produce decompression tables. In personal dive computers, <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> a real-time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
