5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion <b>tunnels</b> were sealed at the opening and halfway through the <b>tunnels</b> with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the <b>tunnels</b> following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway <b>tunnels.</b> The inner diversion <b>tunnels</b> were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the <b>tunnels</b> for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|A post-war {{review of}} rail {{transport}} in the London area produced {{a report in}} 1946 that proposed many new lines and identified the Morden branch as being the most overcrowded section of the London Underground, needing additional capacity. To relieve the congestion {{and to provide a}} new service south of Morden, the report recommended construction of a second pair of <b>tunnels</b> beneath the northern line's <b>tunnels</b> from Tooting Broadway to Kennington and an extension from Morden to North Cheam. Trains using the existing <b>tunnels</b> would start and end at Tooting Broadway with the service in the new <b>tunnels</b> joining the existing <b>tunnels</b> to Morden. The extension to North Cheam would run in tunnel. Designated as routes 10 and 11, these proposals were not developed by the London Passenger Transport Board or its successor organisations.|$|E
5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane <b>tunnels</b> on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem. By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at the <b>tunnels,</b> especially during the summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials {{to work with the}} turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other <b>tunnels</b> followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the <b>tunnels</b> or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Applied FLUENT {{simulation}} software {{to research the}} influence of <b>tunnel</b> length, <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity, <b>tunnel</b> equivalent diameter and <b>tunnel</b> buried depth four important factors on the <b>tunnel</b> wind cooling system in Shenyang area. The results show that, {{with the increase of}} <b>tunnel</b> length and <b>tunnel</b> buried depth and with the decrease of <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity and <b>tunnel</b> equivalent diameter, the outdoor air which passed into the <b>tunnel</b> cooling amplitude increases. For the <b>tunnel</b> wind cooling system optimization design in Shenyang area and the surrounding areas, the advices are that <b>tunnel</b> buried depth should not be more than 6 m and <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity should not be more than 5 m/s...|$|R

5|$|Before the first-section groundbreaking, in 1937 {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} sent workers {{to assess the}} former railroad <b>tunnels.</b> In September of that year, a contract was awarded to drain water from the <b>tunnels.</b> After this, workers cleared rock slides and vegetation from the tunnel portals before evaluating the nine tunnels' condition. It was decided that six of the nine former South Pennsylvania Railroad <b>tunnels</b> {{could be used for}} the roadway. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was in too poor a condition for use, and the Quemahoning and Negro Mountain <b>tunnels</b> would be bypassed with rock cuts through the mountains; The Quemahoning Tunnel had been completed and used by the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad.|$|E
5|$|Five days of filming {{were spent}} at the London Underground <b>tunnels.</b> Filming took place on actual tube <b>tunnels,</b> albeit disused ones. As the crew were {{scouting}} the disused Aldwych <b>tunnels,</b> they found the ex-Northern line 1972 stock train stabled in the tunnel for maintenance, training, and filming purposes. When Sam Miller called Cross about the development, the writer included it as a last minute addition to the script, and the sequence was shot the next day. As a way to scare the audience, Cross included a homeless woman living in the train. The filming crew present disliked filming the Underground sequences because while filmed during the summer, it became hot locations to work in. The crew were prohibited from bringing food or drink into the <b>tunnels,</b> as it would attract rats. Furthermore, break times had to be longer than usual because {{it would take a}} while for a crew member to leave the <b>tunnels,</b> have a break and then return. The FSB base was filmed in the London Docklands, near the ExCeL London.|$|E

5|$|On December 24, 2014, the PTC {{announced}} it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Six options are being considered, three of which would include building bypasses via rock blasting (like what {{was done with the}} Laurel Hill Tunnel) while the other three would include boring two new <b>tunnels,</b> presumably three lanes each to accommodate the PTC's long-term plans to widen the entire mainline turnpike to six lanes except at the existing <b>tunnels.</b> If the PTC goes through with building new <b>tunnels,</b> the existing Allegheny Mountain <b>Tunnels</b> would be shut down. Although the projected costs for building a bypass would be {{less than half of the}} projected costs to bore new <b>tunnels</b> (as well as $3 million in annual maintenance on each tunnel), the aforementioned hunting group opposes the bypass options. Funding has not been identified for the project, which would open to traffic in a best-case scenario in the early 2020s.|$|E

5|$|Eusociality {{involves}} cooperative {{brood care}} (including brood care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. Few organisms outside Hymenoptera exhibit this behavior; the only beetle {{to do so is}} the weevil Austroplatypus incompertus. This Australian species lives in horizontal networks of <b>tunnels,</b> in the heartwood of Eucalyptus trees. It is one of more than 300 species of wood-boring Ambrosia beetles which distribute the spores of ambrosia fungi. The fungi grow in the beetles' <b>tunnels,</b> providing food for the beetles and their larvae; female offspring remain in the <b>tunnels</b> and maintain the fungal growth, probably never reproducing.
