40|$|Preprint / Technische Universität Ilmenau, Institut für Mathematik; 15 - 05 We {{show that}} <b>the</b> Kronecker <b>{{canonical}}</b> form (which is a canonical decomposition for pairs of matrices) is {{the representation of}} a linear relation in a finite dimensional space. This provides a new geometric view upon <b>the</b> Kronecker <b>canonical</b> form. Each of the four entries of <b>the</b> Kronecker <b>canonical</b> form has a natural meaning for the linear relation which it represents. These four entries represent the Jordan chains at finite eigenvalues, the Jordan chains at infinity, the so-called singular chains and the multi-shift part.

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} <b>the</b> <b>canonical</b> quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation {{of general relativity}} (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E

5|$|In QFT, {{the demand}} for {{relativistic}} invariance enters, among other ways in that the S-matrix necessarily must be Poincaré invariant.

The attack differs from <b>the</b> <b>canonical</b> murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen, and many experts do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.|$|E
