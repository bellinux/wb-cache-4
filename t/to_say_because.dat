500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{accessing}} the very deep emotions {{called for by}} her character, Mulligan stated, [...] "I really took my cue from the book". She noted that her role did not require her to have much <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t quite sure where I was going with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E
500|$|David Leitch {{directed}} a scene featuring Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in December 2016, which {{was believed to}} be intended as a post-credits scene for the 2017 film Logan. This was meant to tease the film Deadpool 2, which Leitch had been hired to direct a month earlier. However, this report was denied by Reynolds, Logan director James Mangold, and star Hugh Jackman. After Logans runtime was extended by three minutes shortly before its release, there was new speculation that a post-credits scene had been added to tease an upcoming X-Men film, but Mangold denied this again, saying that he wanted to [...] "make a movie that begun and ended on its own terms. There was nothing else <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> we had said it." [...] Instead, a Deadpool scene was shown as a teaser for Deadpool 2 before Logan, confirmed to be the scene directed by Leitch in December 2016. It was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of the Deadpool films.|$|E

[...] He didn't like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> uncle <b>because</b> Reginald didn't look old enough, {{and he knew}} {{he ought}} not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> brother, <b>because</b> the elder brother in England would {{certainly}} have had the property.|$|R

500|$|Hybrid Theory {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters {{commented that the}} band was a [...] "far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late", and claimed that [...] "they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds." [...] Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory {{four out of five}} stars. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the album a [...] "two-star honorable mention rating", citing [...] "Papercut" [...] and [...] "Points of Authority" [...] as highlights of the album. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone gave the album {{two and a half stars}} and commented that Hybrid Theory had [...] "as much potency as albums by Limp Bizkit or Korn" [...] and called it an album that [...] "reflects the frustration of life". Considering that the album came out in the year 2000, and that it earned a Diamond certification, it may have exerted a similar rock influence on the up and coming Millennial generation that Nirvana's Nevermind (1991) did for Generation X. It might even be possible <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> of the popularity of this album, that Linkin Park could be thought of as the [...] "flagship" [...] rock band for the Millennials. This generation tends to gravitate more towards rap and pop music; and having these elements mixed into Linkin Park's style might have played a role in the album's success.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, Filatov made the Blue Jackets roster after {{training}} camp. Although healthy, he did not play in six of the team's first 18 games, a decision made by Columbus Head Coach Ken Hitchcock. Filatov was unhappy with his playing time and role on the team under Hitchcock and requested to be transferred back to his Russian club team. Hitchcock and the Blue Jackets coaching staff tried to improve Filatov's attention to defensive aspects of the game. [...] The Blue Jackets management agreed to Filatov's request to return to Russia {{for the remainder of the}} season. This arrangement resulted from direct dealings between the Blue Jackets and CSKA Moscow, where Filatov's salary was paid by the Russian club, and the Blue Jackets retained his rights. Shortly after his return to Russia, Filatov set a KHL record by scoring the game-winning goal in three consecutive games. He was named the League's best newcomer (defined by the KHL as [...] "a player born in 1987 or later, who has played no more than 20 top-level matches in previous national tournaments") for November, and the League's best rookie for the 11th week of the season. In his shortened season in Russia, Filatov played 26 games, scoring nine goals and adding 13 assists. Initial statements by both sides indicated the player would return to Columbus after the 2009–10 season, but since returning to Russia, Filatov has been less clear about his intentions for the 2010–11 season, stating, [...] "I hope I'll be back next year, but right now, it's really hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>because</b> it will again be a tough decision." [...] Howson did not comment on Filatov's stance, except to say that he expects Filatov to be at the team's training camp prior to the 2010–11 season. Subsequently, Filatov stated after the 2009–10 season that he intended to return to Columbus for training camp.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the band conducted on August 22, 2010 guitarist Brendt Allman answered a question about the probability of touring again after the European dates as follows: [...] "It's tough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>because</b> there's {{a lot of different things}} going on in a lot of people's lives, but if we can do it once, we can probably do it twice." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If you've {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> {{clear that}} woman's character," [...] said Moulder, [...] "you owe it <b>to</b> society <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it; <b>because</b> {{she is a}} woman, and because her enemies is villains." [...] And then again there was silence while they waited for him.|$|R
5000|$|... "And I {{honestly}} wish I didn't have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this, <b>because</b> {{it feels}} like kicking a man when he is down... but, really, it's terrible. Human sympathy strains in one direction; critical judgment the other. Terrible, terrible, terrible." ...|$|R
2500|$|In John Maynard Keynes's {{principal}} work [...] "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" [...] {{one finds}} in Chapter XVII a section [...] "Unemployment develops, that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> people want the moon; [...] There is no remedy but {{to persuade the}} public that green cheese is practically {{the same thing and}} to have a green cheese factory (i.e. a central bank) under public control." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{scrambled}} up the small hillock {{in order to}} take photographs of the remaining route, much as the French did in 1981, when they too were blocked from further progress. [...] As to which step they were seen on, Conrad Anker has stated that [...] "it's hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>because</b> Odell was looking at it obliquely ... you're at altitude, the clouds were coming in" [...] but that he believes [...] "they were probably {{in the vicinity of the}} First Step when they turned back, because the First Step itself is very challenging and the Second Step is more challenging.... o put them where they might have fallen in the evening and where Mallory's body is resting, because it's a traversing route, he couldn't have fallen off either the First or Second Step and ended up where he was at, they were well to the East of that descending the Yellow Band".|$|E
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E

6000|$|There was a silence. Denis {{finished}} his porridge and helped himself to bacon. For lack of anything better <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and <b>because</b> Mr. Scogan's absurd phrase was {{for some reason}} running in his head, he turned to Jenny and asked: ...|$|R

[...] "But they are very pleasant," [...] he added quickly, [...] "and very simple and unaffected, {{in spite of their}} rank; perhaps I ought <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>BECAUSE</b> of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{just waiting}} to see you {{get caught in the}} trap," [...] said the girl, {{standing}} up because the big creature pulled upon her arm.

50|$|The lawyers of Guantanamo details later corroborated {{the details}} of the Afghans claims, saying that they had been aware of the hunger strike as early as June 23, 2005, but had not been able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>because</b> of a DoD gag place on them.|$|R

6000|$|Verena {{gave him}} a bright natural stare. [...] "Any {{sacrifice}} for affection?"

60|$|I {{have just}} sent my 26th, and have nothing <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> I have other letters to write (pshaw, I began too high); but I must lay the {{beginning}} like a nest-egg: to-morrow I will say more, and fetch up this line to be straight.

6000|$|Staniford {{smiled at}} the countrified phrase; he had {{observed}} that when she spoke her mind she used an instinctive good language; when she would not speak it, she fell into the phraseology of {{the people with whom}} she had lived.

60|$|Grace {{had been}} wrong--very far wrong--in {{assuming}} that the letter had no reference to herself because Giles had turned away into the wood after its perusal. It was, sad <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>because</b> the missive had so much reference to herself that he had thus turned away. He feared that his grieved discomfiture might be observed. The letter was from Beaucock, written {{a few hours later}} than Melbury's to his daughter. It announced failure.|$|E
