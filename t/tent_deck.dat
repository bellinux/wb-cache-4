50|$|In 2010, NYIT and the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum {{announced}} a new partnership to incorporate project-based learning for NYIT’s undergraduate students with the reconstruction of an aircraft restoration <b>tent</b> on the <b>deck</b> of the aircraft carrier USS Intrepid through a design competition. Also in 2010, NYIT received a $1 million grant from National Science Foundation for interdisciplinary research on cyber-enabled learning.|$|R
60|$|One {{of these}} {{crystals}} was formed, {{usually in a}} <b>tent</b> on <b>deck,</b> by the attractive influence of smoke. It was consequently not a bright crystal, and included particles both refined and otherwise. Its music was gruff for the most part, sometimes growly. There was another crystal which varied its position occasionally--according {{to the position of}} the moon, for it was a crystal formed of romantic elements. One of its parts was a Scottish maiden whose voice was melodious, flexible, and very sweet. Her face and spirit had been made to match. She had many admirers, and a bosom-friend of kindly heart and aspect, with wealth of golden hair, in some respects like herself.|$|R
50|$|Before the 2013 Atlantic League season, the Lancaster Barnstormers made {{a series}} of {{improvements}} to Clipper Magazine Stadium. The first of these was a new playground for children along the third-base line featuring a foam-based protective floor. Other improvements included a renovated picnic area with new <b>tents</b> and a <b>deck</b> comprising synthetic materials instead of wood, a new right-field wall, landscaping beyond the outfield, and computerized irrigation controls.|$|R
60|$|They came to high words, Swend {{reproaching}} his ally with {{breaking his}} agreement. Harald distrusted his intentions, and, at night, did not, as usual, {{sleep in a}} <b>tent</b> on the <b>deck</b> of his ship, but left a billet of wood in his place. At midnight a man rowed silently up {{to the side of}} the ship, crept up to the tent, and struck so violent a blow with his axe, that it remained sticking in the wood, while the murderer retired to his boat, and rowed away in the dark.|$|R
25|$|Shipbuilders, {{probably}} Phoenician, a seafaring {{people who}} lived on the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, were the first to create the two-level galley that would be widely known under its Greek name, diērēs, or bireme. Even though the Phoenicians were among the most important naval civilizations in early Antiquity, little detailed evidence have been found concerning the types of ships they used. The best depictions found so far have been small, highly stylized images on seals which depict crescent-shape vessels equipped with one mast and banks of oars. Colorful frescoes on the Minoan settlement on Santorini (c. 1600 BC) show more detailed pictures of vessels with ceremonial <b>tents</b> on <b>deck</b> in a procession. Some of these are rowed, but others are paddled with men laboriously bent over the railings. This has been interpreted as a possible ritual reenactment of more ancient types of vessels, alluding to a time before rowing was invented, but little is otherwise known about the use and design of Minoan ships.|$|R
5000|$|The next witness was ship's mate Gaetano Paturzo, {{who claimed}} {{that he had seen}} Caroline sitting on Pergami's lap, but nothing more, while on a Mediterranean cruise. Ship's master Vincenzo Garguilo testified that Caroline and Pergami had shared a <b>tent</b> on <b>deck</b> and had kissed. Under cross-examination, he {{admitted}} that he had been paid to give evidence, but said that the payment was lower in value than the business he had lost through coming to England. Captain Thomas Briggs of HMS Leviathan, another vessel used by Caroline and Pergami during their journey, was also called as a prosecution witness. He said that the two had adjoining cabins on board and he had seen them arm-in-arm. Unlike the Italian witnesses, as an Englishman of some substance, the Lords considered Captain Briggs to be a more credible witness. After the conclusion of the cross-examination, however, Lord Ellenborough rose and asked Briggs directly, [...] "Did the witness see any improper familiarity between the Princess and Pergami? Had you any reason to suspect any improper freedom or familiarity between them?" [...] "No", replied Briggs.|$|R
50|$|Attracted by {{tales of}} the huge fish, high society turned its {{attention}} to Scarborough where sport was available {{only a few miles}} offshore. Special trains were run from London to bring the luminaries. Magazines published many sensational stories covering the personalities and the yachts that sailed to Scarborough. There were Lady Broughton, the African big-game hunter, who slept in a <b>tent</b> on the <b>deck</b> of her yacht; Colonel Sir Edward Peel of the wealthy aristocratic Peel family with his large Sudanese-crewed steam yacht St George; Lord Astor, the newspaper proprietor; Charles Laughton, the actor; Tommy Sopwith, who challenged for the America's Cup in 1934 and 1937; Lord Crathorne, later Chairman of the Conservative Party; and Lord Moyne of the Guinness family, later assassinated in Egypt.|$|R
50|$|The trial {{seemed to}} be going Caroline's way, {{especially}} after Sacchi's testimony was refuted by the nephew of the Duchess of Torlonia, Carlo Forti. Forti claimed that the Countess Oldi (Pergami's sister) sat between Caroline and Pergami in the carriage, which was also shared with Victorine (Pergami's daughter), and so there could have been no intimacy between them. However, the cross-examination of two of the witnesses damaged Caroline's case. Lieutenant John Flynn and Joseph Hownam had both been on the same Mediterranean cruise with Caroline and Pergami. Flynn said nothing incriminating but {{during the course of the}} cross-examination, he fainted, which left a bad impression. Pressed by Gifford, Hownam admitted that Caroline and Pergami had both slept in the same <b>tent</b> on <b>deck</b> because, he claimed, Caroline was afraid of pirates, and wanted a guard in the tent with her. In an attempt to regain ground, Brougham produced two Italian witnesses, Giuseppe Giroline and Filippo Pomi, who revealed that the prosecution witnesses had been paid 40 francs each, and given free food and board. The Whigs now claimed that the trial was tainted as there was prima facie evidence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by paying witnesses for their testimony. Lord Liverpool countered Whig demands to abandon the bill by saying that there was other evidence, from non-Italian witnesses, that could be relied upon.|$|R
