The amount of shear force transferred is dependent upon the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm and the frame stiffness;The results of 31 full-scale cantilever diaphragm tests are presented. Two different sheet profiles and three fastener patterns were used. The results are compared with the predicted stiffness from a plane truss computer analog. Test variables include openings in the sheeting, recessing of purlins in from the sheet ends, seams in the length of the sheet and placing the purlins flat;An analytical method and an empirical equation to be used in conjunction with testing are presented. The analytical method predicts the stiffness of the control diaphragms within 1. 5 % of that predicted by the plane truss computer analog. The empirical equation was fitted to steel diaphragms on steel frames and can be used to adjust for different diaphragm lengths, purlin spacings, and sheet thicknesses;It was found that the location and size of an opening does influence diaphragm stiffness. Openings with sheeting on two sides only will reduce diaphragm stiffness approximately twice as much as openings with sheeting on three or four sides. Fastener stiffness and location have the largest impact on diaphragm stiffness. Increasing the number of fasteners at seams in the length of the diaphragm will off-set the effect of the discontinuous sheet length. Fasteners {{near the edge of the}} sheet have a much larger impact on stiffness than those near the center of the sheet. The plane truss computer analog predicted the <b>test</b> <b>diaphragm</b> stiffness reasonably well;Several methods of modeling the diaphragm frame interaction are reviewed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This report {{describes}} a two-dimensional {{finite element model}} for ana-lyzing vertical and horizontal wood diaphragms. Central {{to the development of}} this model is the formulation of a nonlinear finite element that accounts for the dis-tribution and stiffness of fasteners connecting the sheathing to the framing. Linked with conventional beam and plane stress elements, which represent diaphragm framing and sheathing, respectively, the resulting model can be used to analyze a variety of wood diaphragms (walls, floors. ceilings, etc.). Load-displacement results from experimentally <b>tested</b> <b>diaphragms</b> and model predictions were found to be in good agreement. Parametric studies with the model show that diaphragm stiffness is significantly affected by nail stiffness, nail spacing, and the use of blocking. At code allowable diaphragm shear load levels, a variation of 20 % in nail stiffness resulted in a change in diaphragm stiffness of less than 10 %. Nail spacing was shown to have a more dominant effect on diaphragm stiffness than nail stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Recent work on fully opened rubber-lined {{diaphragm}} valves showed {{that due to}} the lack of geometric similarity, dynamic similarity could not be established.

Accurate loss coefficient data is critical for energy efficient hydraulic design. Saunders type straight-through {{diaphragm valves}} ranging from 40. mm to 100. mm were tested in the fully open, 75 %, 50 % and 25 % open positions, using a range of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. It was found that the laminar flow loss coefficient constant suggested by Hooper (1981) is sufficient for all valve diameters at Reynolds numbers below 10. However, for transitional and turbulent flow the same loss coefficients cannot be applied for more accurate designs for diaphragm valves from different manufacturers. A new correlation has therefore been developed to predict the loss coefficients for straight-through Saunders diaphragm valves at various openings from laminar to turbulent flow regimes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare two tests both {{frequently}} used for deter-mination of the state of the lumbar spine muscle system during static and dynamic loads. The sit-up test is a commonly used terrain <b>test,</b> while the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>test</b> is a more exact lab-oratory procedure. For both tests, measurements conducted by the muscular dynamometer SD 02 were used to assure congruency in evaluation. The tests are based on the general information that the muscles of the deep stabilizing spine system (DSSS) are interconnected and form one functional unit, and that dysfunction of just one of these muscles may cause total dysfunction of the whole muscle system. It is therefore expected that the participation and force generated by the largest muscles of the area, musculus rectus abdominis and musculus transversus abdominis, will be comparable also during the testing procedures. Forty-five healthy women joined in the research, with the average age of 21. 6 years. The results obtained were statistically evaluated using Statistica 6.

House mice (Mus musculus), Peromyscus spp., and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were used to test gnawing behavior on 4 kinds of diaphragms. Diaphragms with or without a rodent proof cure formula, which are used by GM, did not influence the gnawing of all <b>test</b> rodent species. <b>Diaphragms</b> with a lubricant (Paricin) were more attractive to gnawing by house mice than diaphragms without a lubricant.

The test model was 1 / 3 scale and three meters square in plan. Seven tests with {{a different kind of}} connection between the floor and the rigid lateral supports (which simulated a timber lateral load resisting system) have been performed. The results of the experimental testing are used to calibrate numerical models which are used to investigate the effects of the floor flexibility on the seismic behaviour of post-tensioned timber buildings. For the experimental tests, screw and nail fasteners were used to connected to floor unit to the lateral supports. These fasteners were embedded into the concrete slab or timber edge joints at different orientations. The stiffness of the diaphragm connections was vastly different for each detail. Screws installed at a 45 ? angle (inclined) to the lateral supports were four times stiffer than the screws installed orthogonal to the lateral supports. The initial stiffness of the inclined fasteners was similar for timber-to-timber and concrete-to-timber connections. For the timberto- timber connections the orientation did not seem to influence the strength of the connection. The <b>tested</b> <b>diaphragm</b> had an uncracked stiffness of 4000 kN/mm and a cracked stiffness of 300 kN/mm. For the tested floor unit it was concluded that the influence of the diaphragm flexibility was negligible compared to the connector flexibility. The floor flexibility can be idealized as three different parts, the deformation of the connectors, the shear deformation of the diaphragm and the flexural deformation of the diaphragm. The numerical analyses showed that in most perceivable situations the connection deformation will govern the in-plane seismic response of the floor. Hence, it is justified to model it as a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) element. The influence of the floor flexibility on the seismic response of post-tensioned timber buildings is small. In most cases neglecting the floor flexibility is a conservative approach for the structural design of the building. However, structures with stiff walls and long floor spans there can be a significant amplification of the seismic response. For that case, a simple SDOF representation is proposed. Code-based recommendations for predicting the peak floor accelerations are found to be inadequate. A methodology is proposed to more accurately predict the expected peak floor accelerations for desig...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{analysis}} {{programs and}} empirical formulae {{are often used}} to compute the period of vibration of single-storey steel buildings. Recent ambient vibration tests of buildings in Quebec and British Columbia {{have shown that the}} predicted period of vibration is typically much longer than that measured. Software and empirical formulae do not usually take into account the stiffening effects of the non-structural components; this could be the source of the discrepancy between the results in the field and the results obtained by computational methods. This research project concentrates on the roof diaphragm system of single-storey steel buildings and the contribution of the non-structural components to diaphragm stiffness. It is believed that the non-structural components, roofing materials such as gypsum board and fibreboard, add to the overall stiffness of the system. A roofing system called AMCQ SBS- 34 consisting of gypsum board, ISO insulation board and fibreboard, all hot bitumen adhered, was studied. The full roof system, as well as its individual components and connections, were first studied through laboratory testing. The flexural and shear stiffness of the fibreboard and gypsum panels, as well as the shear stiffness and equivalent flexural stiffness of the complete roof system and shear stiffness of the roofing connections were determined. Linear elastic finite element models, using the SAP 2000 software, were developed to replicate the behaviour of bare sheet steel and clad <b>diaphragm</b> <b>test</b> specimens. The test based properties of the roofing components and connections were incorporated into the definition of the elements. The models were then calibrated {{based on the results of}} large-scale <b>diaphragm</b> <b>tests</b> by Yang. Once the elastic behaviour of the diaphragms had been matched, a parametric study was performed in order to assess the importance of the contribution of the roofing assembly relative to the roof deck panel thickness.

To test this hypothesis we retrospectively reviewed chest radiograph findings and corresponding twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (TWPDI) results from 42 (17 female, age range 22 – 79 years) consecutive patients who underwent phrenic nerve stimulation studies. Chest radiographs were independently reviewed in a blind manner by two radiologists. The interobserver agreement was moderate, the kappa value ranging from 0. 48 (left hemidiaphragm) to 0. 59 (lung parenchyma). Hemidiaphragm dysfunction was diagnosed if TWPDI of corresponding hemidiaphragm was less than 3. 5 cm H 2 O.

METHODS:Eight patients affected by non-self-cleaning attic retraction pockets or attic cholesteatoma of the middle ear and normal tubal function (verified by type A tympanogram or Williams' test) underwent endoscopic surgery. Anatomic findings were noted and collected, with particular attention paid to middle ear folds. A control group was used for comparison. The prevalence of an isthmus blockage with a complete tensor fold in pathologic ears was compared between the study group and control group. RESULTS:The higher prevalence of an isthmus blockage associated with a complete tensor fold in the study group was found to be statistically significant (P =. 001). CONCLUSIONS:A selective epitympanic dysventilation syndrome is hypothesized; normal ET function seems to be insufficient for complete ventilation of the middle ear, and an open tympanic isthmus or an incomplete tensor fold may be necessary for epitympanic recess ventilation. The selective epitympanic dysventilation syndrome would consist of the contemporary presence of the following four conditions: attic retraction pocket or cholesteatoma, normal tubal function <b>tests,</b> complete epitympanic <b>diaphragm,</b> and isthmus blockage...|$|R
40|$|Floor {{diaphragms}} have {{an important}} role in the seismic behaviour of structures, as inertia forces are generated by their masses and then transferred to the lateral load resisting system. Diaphragms also link all other structural elements together and provide general stability to the structure. As with most other structural components, there is concern about damage to floor diaphragms because of displacement incompatibilities. This paper describes two different experiments on engineered timber floors connected to post-tensioned timber frames subjected to horizontal loading. First a full scale two-bay post-tensioned frame was loaded with lateral loads through a stressed-skin floor diaphragm. Different connection configurations between the floor units on either side of the central column were tested. Secondly a three dimensional, three storey post-tensioned frame building was tested on a shaking table. The diaphragm consisted of solid timber panels connected to the beams with inclined fully threaded screws. For all <b>tested</b> connections, the <b>diaphragm</b> behaviour was fully maintained throughout the testing and no damage was observed. The test results showed that careful detailing of the floor panel connections near the beam-column-joint and the flexibility of timber elements can avoid floor damage and still guarantee diaphragm action at high level of drifts in post-tensioned timber frame buildings...|$|R
40|$|Light gauge metal {{sheeting}} {{is often}} utilized {{in the building}} and bridge industries for concrete formwork. Although the in-plane stiffness and strength of the metal forms are commonly relied upon for stability bracing in buildings, the forms are generally not considered for bracing in steel bridge construction. The primary difference between the forming systems in the two industries is the method of connection between the forms and girders. In bridge construction, an eccentric support angle is incorporated into the connection details to achieve a uniform slab thickness along the girder length. While the eccentric connection is a benefit for slab construction, the flexible connection limits the amount of bracing provided by the forms. This paper presents results from {{the first phase of}} a research study investigating the bracing behavior of metal bridge deck forms. Shear <b>diaphragm</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted to determine the shear stiffness and strength of bridge deck forms, and modified connection details were developed that substantially improve the bracing behavior of the forms. The measured stiffness and strength of diaphragms with the modified connection often met or exceeded the values of diaphragms with conventional noneccentric connections. The experimental results for the diaphragms with the modified connection details dramatically improve the potential for bracing of steel bridge girders by metal deck forms...|$|R
