25|$|Some, {{such as the}} California Poison Control System, {{have claimed}} that {{tomatoes}} and tomato leaves contain solanine. However, Mendel Friedman of the United States Department of Agriculture contradicts this claim, stating that <b>tomatine,</b> a relatively benign alkaloid, is the tomato alkaloid while solanine is found in potatoes. Food science writer Harold McGee has found scant evidence for tomato toxicity in the medical and veterinary literature.|$|E
50|$|It {{is likely}} that {{hydrolysis}} of <b>tomatine</b> takes place, {{but it is not}} known if it is acid or glycosidase catalyzed. In vitro exposure of <b>tomatine</b> to 1 M HCl for 3 hours at 37 C did not hydrolyze <b>tomatine,</b> so probably the <b>tomatine</b> is also not hydrolyzed by acid in the digestive tract of humans. The hydroxylation of <b>tomatine</b> likely leads to the formation of tomatidine, which is the aglycon of <b>tomatine.</b> Tomatidine is a metabolite which may not be completely non-toxic; it could have effects on the human body.|$|E
50|$|According to in vivo {{studies with}} mice, rats and hamsters, <b>tomatine</b> {{seems to be}} {{non-toxic}} when orally consumed (LD50=500 mg/kg). Complex formation may be the reason why <b>tomatine</b> has a much lower oral toxicity than other glycoalkaloids. Due to formation of insoluble complexes with sterols, <b>tomatine</b> is eliminated in the feces and only small amounts of <b>tomatine</b> are absorbed by the digestive tract. The amount of plasma LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) decreases {{as the amount of}} dietary <b>tomatine</b> increases. The LD50 value of <b>tomatine</b> when served intravenous is determined to be 18 mg/kg body weight. When administered intraperitoneally, the LD50 value is equal to 25 mg/kg body weight. Generally, <b>tomatine</b> is less toxic than potato glycoalkaloids.|$|E
50|$|Until today, {{little is}} known about the bioavailability, {{pharmacokinetics}} and metabolism of the glycoalkaloids in humans. An important factor is the poor uptake of <b>tomatine</b> into general blood circulation. When <b>tomatine</b> is orally ingested, much <b>tomatine</b> may form complexes with cholesterol from the other food present in the stomach. The complexes of <b>tomatine</b> and cholesterol are not absorbed in the intestine, but are excreted. For the complexation with cholesterol to occur, the presence of a carbohydrate chain is essential. The aglycon tomatidine, which is <b>tomatine</b> without the sugars, does not form the complexes. The complexation probably occurs in the duodenum, because the acidic conditions in the stomach itself lead to protonation of the <b>tomatine,</b> and the protonated form of <b>tomatine</b> does not bind to cholesterol.|$|E
50|$|The {{possible}} {{risks of}} <b>tomatine</b> for humans {{have not been}} formally studied, so no NOAEL can be deduced. The toxicity of <b>tomatine</b> has only been studied on laboratory animals. The symptoms of acute <b>tomatine</b> poisoning in animals {{are similar to the}} symptoms of poisoning by solanine, a potato glycoalkaloid. These symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, drowsiness, confusion, weakness, and depression. Generally, <b>tomatine</b> is regarded to cause less toxic effects to mammals than other alkaloids such as solanine. The amount of <b>tomatine</b> absorbed by the human body as well as the possible metabolism is unknown. There is no evidence that consumption of tomatoes causes acute toxic or genotoxic effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{influence}} of <b>tomatine</b> on rat hearts {{has been studied}} by adding the compound to a culture medium of neonatal rat cells. At a concentration of 20 µg/ml <b>tomatine</b> the contraction frequency increased within two hours. At a concentration of 40 µg/ml <b>tomatine</b> the heart cells stopped beating for some minutes.|$|E
50|$|Fungal tomatinase enzymes can {{transform}} <b>tomatine</b> to deactivate it. Detoxification {{can take place}} by removing one glucose residue. Other fungal species hydrolyze <b>tomatine</b> to the less toxic aglycon tomatidine by removing all the sugar residues. Tomatidine can still inhibit some fungal species, but is less toxic than <b>tomatine.</b> The metabolic pathway of hydrolysis of <b>tomatine</b> is different for different types of fungi. Also, the level of toxicity depends {{on the type of}} fungus. The metabolite tomatidine can be hydrolyzed further by membrane-bound CYP-450 oxygenases.|$|E
50|$|There {{are further}} {{mechanisms}} by which <b>tomatine</b> can have effects on organisms. In a research on frogs, oral administration of low-concentration <b>tomatine</b> has a cationic effect on cardiac contractions. It {{is possible that the}} increased heart rate comes from alteration of the electric properties of heart cell membranes by positively charged <b>tomatine</b> ions, because of participation in acid-base equilibriums.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has proven}} that <b>tomatine</b> is only {{effective}} against fungi at pH 8 {{and not at}} pH 4. A possible explanation {{for this is that}} the <b>tomatine</b> only in the deprotonated form binds to cholesterol to form the earlier mentioned complexes. Other research has proven that <b>tomatine</b> disrupt liposome membranes containing 3-ß-hydroxy sterol while liposomes without 3-ß-hydroxy sterols are resistant against membrane disruption. Although, <b>tomatine</b> inhibits also the fungal types Ph. infestans and Py. aphanidermatum which do not have any sterols in their membranes, so another mechanism of action must be present.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tomatine</b> {{has been}} used as a reagent in {{analytical}} chemistry for precipitating cholesterol from solution. [...] Also, <b>tomatine</b> is known to be an immune adjuvant in connection with certain protein antigens.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tomatine</b> (sometimes called tomatin or lycopersicin) is a glycoalkaloid, {{found in}} the stems and leaves of tomato plants, and in the fruits at much lower concentrations. It has fungicidal, antimicrobial, and insecticidal properties. [...] Chemically pure <b>tomatine</b> is a white {{crystalline}} solid at standard temperature and pressure. <b>Tomatine,</b> {{as well as the}} closely related aglycon (or aglycone) derivative tomatidine have been shown to have multiple health benefits.|$|E
50|$|Injection of <b>tomatine</b> into mice {{caused a}} rapid drop in blood pressure. This is presumably {{the result of}} tomatine-induced {{disruption}} of red blood cell membranes. (Cholesterol seems to protect the erythrocytes. Intraperitoneal injection of <b>tomatine</b> results in a decrease of diuresis in rats. This effect is accompanied by increased corticosteroid and neutrophil levels {{and a decrease in}} the Na/K ratio in the serum. The oral administration of <b>tomatine</b> in doses of 15-30 mg/kg or the intramuscular administration in the dose range of 1-10 mg/kg induces a dose-dependent inhibition of induced edema similar anti-inflammatory effects are noted when <b>tomatine</b> is administered subcutaneously.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{injection}} of <b>tomatine</b> into mice also causes {{an increase in}} blood pressure due to hemolysis, and calcium release from bone tissue. When administered intramuscularly or orally to rats, <b>tomatine</b> inhibits induced edema.|$|E
50|$|In 1837, {{the first}} {{medicinal}} tomato pills were advertised in the United States {{because of their}} positive effects upon the biliary organs. The product “Phelp’s Compound Tomato Pills” was extracted from the tomato plant, and contained <b>tomatine.</b> The pills {{were made by the}} medic Guy R. Phelps, who stated that the alkaloid <b>tomatine</b> {{was one of the most}} useful discoveries ever made. <b>Tomatine</b> then was said to be an antidote to mercury.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tomatine</b> is {{considered}} to be a fungitoxic compound as it completely inhibits mycelial growth of the fungi C. orbiculare (MC100=2.0 mM), S. linicola (MC100=0.4 mM), and H. turcicum (MC100=0.13 mM). For the inhibition at a low pH, much more <b>tomatine</b> is required, so the compound is more effectively fungitoxic at a high pH, when the alkaloid is unprotonated. The unprotonated form of <b>tomatine</b> forms complexes with sterols such as cholesterol, which may cause disruption of cell membrane and changes in membrane permeability.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>tomatine</b> on frog embryos and frog skin were tested by {{fluorescence}} measurements. The membrane permeability of frog embryos increased by 600% when exposed with <b>tomatine.</b> In frog skin, the sodium-active transport decreased by 16%, which {{may lead to}} disruption of cell membranes.|$|E
50|$|Dietary supplementation with ∼0.04% tomatidine for 10 weeks reduces plasma {{cholesterol}} and atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice without evidence of toxicity. <b>Tomatine</b> has antimicrobial properties against certain classes of microbes although some microbes produce an enzyme called tomatinase which can degrade <b>tomatine,</b> rendering it ineffective as an antimicrobial.|$|E
50|$|The {{membrane}} disruptive {{properties of}} <b>tomatine</b> {{are caused by}} the ability to form 1:1 complexes with cholesterol. A possible mechanism of the membrane disruption by glycoalkaloids is displayed in figure 2. First, the aglycon part of <b>tomatine</b> binds reversible to sterols in the membrane (figure 2, part 2). When this reaches a certain density, the glycosidic residues of the glycoalkaloids {{interact with each other}} by electrostatic interactions. This interactions catalyze the development of an irreversible matrix of glycoalkaloid-sterol complexes (figure 2, part 4). In this way, the sterols from the external membrane are immobilized and membrane budding will arise. Tubular structures are formed, because of the structure of <b>tomatine</b> (figure 2, part 6).This membrane disruption causes cell death by cell leakage. Also, the disrupted membrane has an influence on sodium transport, by altering the membrane potential and reducing active sodium transport. When <b>tomatine</b> is orally ingested, the brush border of the intestine is damaged by the membrane-disruptive properties of <b>tomatine,</b> so increased uptake of macromolecules occurs. This damage to the epithelial barriers is dose-dependent.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} the {{glycoalkaloids}} (to which <b>tomatine</b> belongs), can be divided in two main parts: the disruption of cellular membranes and the inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. <b>Tomatine</b> is responsible in tomato plants for resistance against for example the Colorado beetle and to snails. It is also a defense against fungi.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tomatine</b> is {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} glycoalkaloid solanine, which is found in potatoes.|$|E
5000|$|The human {{consumption}} of moderate amounts of <b>tomatine</b> seems to occur without notable toxic effects. This {{is reinforced by}} the widespread consumption of “pickled green” and “fried green tomatoes” and the consumption of high-tomatine tomatoes (a variant of L. esculentum var. cerasiforme, better known as the [...] "cherry tomato", indigenous to Peru) with very high <b>tomatine</b> content (in the range of 500-5000 mg/kg of dry weight).|$|E
50|$|Oral {{administration}} of <b>tomatine</b> to frogs induces a cationic effect on cardiac contraction, producing symptoms of tachycardia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tomatine</b> {{may play}} a major role in {{resistance}} of the tomato plant against fungal, microbial, insect, and herbivoral attack.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 20th century, {{scientists}} from the US Department of Agriculture {{were the first to}} isolate <b>tomatine</b> from the wild tomato species Lycopersicon pimpinelifolium and the cultured species Lycopersicon esculentum.|$|E
50|$|In vitro {{studies showed}} that <b>tomatine</b> {{increased}} the permeability of the small intestinal mucosal cell, resulting in inhibition of active nutrient transport, and facilitation of the uptake of gut contents that normally would not be absorbed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tomatine</b> {{can also}} stimulate {{the immune system}} by {{participation}} in a sequence of the respiratory burst. This provides cellular release of hydrogen peroxide, which is an immune modulator. The respiratory burst uses peroxide to form hypochlorite, which in turn destroys bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Tomatoes {{were brought}} to Europe in the 1590s. The English {{botanist}} John Gerard {{was one of the}} first cultivators of the tomato plant. In his publication Grete Herball, he considered tomatoes as poisonous due to their levels of what would later be called <b>tomatine,</b> plus high acid content. Consequently, tomatoes were generally not eaten in Britain until the mid-18th century.|$|E
50|$|Leaves, stems, {{and green}} unripe {{fruit of the}} tomato plant contain small amounts of the toxic {{alkaloid}} <b>tomatine.</b> They also contain small amounts of solanine, a toxic alkaloid found in potato leaves and other plants in the nightshade family. Use of tomato leaves in herbal tea {{has been responsible for}} at least one death. However, levels of <b>tomatine</b> in foliage and green fruit are generally too small to be dangerous unless large amounts are consumed, for example, as greens. Small amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring without ill effect, and the green fruit is sometimes used for cooking, particularly as fried green tomatoes. Compared to potatoes, the amount of solanine in green or ripe tomatoes is low; however, even in the case of potatoes while solanine poisoning resulting from dosages several times normal human consumption has been demonstrated, actual cases of poisoning resulting from excessive consumption of potatoes that have high concentration of solanine are rare.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that α-tomatine is a precursor of esculeoside A. In order for alpha <b>tomatine</b> {{to be converted}} to esculeoside A, isomerization of the F-ring is required. The mechanism for this reaction is unclear at this time but research from Iijima and colleagues in 2009 suggest a glycosylation step in the putative pathway from α-tomatine to esculeoside A depends on the plant hormone ethylene.|$|E
50|$|Some, {{such as the}} California Poison Control System, {{have claimed}} that {{tomatoes}} and tomato leaves contain solanine. However, Mendel Friedman of the federal Department of Agriculture contradicts this claim, stating that <b>tomatine,</b> a relatively benign alkaloid, is the tomato alkaloid while solanine is found in potatoes. Food science writer Harold McGee has found scant evidence for tomato toxicity in the medical and veterinary literature.|$|E
50|$|Tomatoes {{were not}} grown in England until the 1590s. One of the {{earliest}} cultivators was John Gerard, a barber-surgeon. Gerard's Herbal, published in 1597, and largely plagiarized from continental sources, is also one {{of the earliest}} discussions of the tomato in England. Gerard knew the tomato was eaten in Spain and Italy. Nonetheless, he believed it was poisonous (in fact, the plant and raw fruit do have low levels of <b>tomatine,</b> but are not generally dangerous; see below). Gerard's views were influential, and the tomato was considered unfit for eating (though not necessarily poisonous) for many years in Britain and its North American colonies.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of the glycoalkaloid <b>tomatine</b> with monolayers of a phospholipid (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, DMPC), and sphingolipid (egg sphingomyelin), and cholesterol is compared. Using measurements of the surface pressure response {{as a function of}} the subphase concentration of <b>tomatine,</b> interfacial binding constants are estimated for mixed monolayers of DMPC and cholesterol and for those of egg sphingomyelin and cholesterol of mole ratio 7 : 3. The binding constants obtained suggest a stronger {{interaction of}} <b>tomatine</b> with DMPC and cholesterol mixed monolayers, reflecting easier displacement of cholesterol from its interaction with DMPC than from its interaction with egg sphingomyelin. Mixtures of <b>tomatine</b> and cholesterol are found to spread directly at the water–air interface and form stable monolayers, suggesting that cholesterol holds <b>tomatine</b> at the interface despite the absence of observed monolayer behavior for <b>tomatine</b> alone. The interaction of <b>tomatine</b> with DMPC and cholesterol monolayers is found to exhibit a pH dependence in agreement with previously reported results for its interaction with liposomes; in particular, the interaction is much less at pH 5 than at pH 7 or pH 9. It is found that while <b>tomatine</b> interacts strongly with monolayers containing sitosterol, it does not interact with monolayers containing sitosterol glucoside. The response of monolayers of varying composition of DMPC and cholesterol to <b>tomatine</b> is also examined. Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) reveals further evidence for formation of suspected islands of tomatine+cholesterol complexes upon interaction with mixed monolayers of lipid and sterol...|$|E
40|$|The iron-acetic acid reagent {{used for}} {{cholesterol}} determinations produces a color with <b>tomatine,</b> which {{is reported to}} be a more specific precipitant for cholesterol. To circumvent the interferene of <b>tomatine</b> found in a cholesterol-tomatinide complex, a standard solution containing st&chiometric amounts of <b>tomatine</b> and cholesterol was used and proved to be reliabte for the determination of free cholesterol in serum. A NEW precipitating agent, <b>tomatine,</b> a glycosidal alkaloid, has a greater specificity than digitonin for cholesterol (1). The use of toma-tine to precipitate cholesterol-like material and the subsequent direct colorimetric determination by the Zak method (2) resulted in a higher cholesterol content than was actually present. Others (3) reported that tomatme produced a color with the Zak cholesterol reagent; but when the excess <b>tomatine</b> was washed from the cholesterol-tomatinide no interference occurred. Our investigation has resulted in a quantitative Zak cholesterol method which call be carried out in the presence of <b>tomatine...</b>|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis presents data which shows that the steroid glycoside alkaloids (<b>Tomatine</b> and Gomatine) recently isolated from crown gall infected tomato stalks exert anti-inflammatory activity in experimental animals. The oral or parenteral administration of <b>Tomatine</b> one hour prior to injecting carrageenan into rat hind paws significantly inhibited paw swelling in both intact and adrenalectomized animals...|$|E
40|$|A {{biosensor}} for {{detection of}} <b>tomatine</b> in tomatoes {{has been developed}} using pH-sensitive field effect transistor as transducer and immobilised enzyme butyryl cholinesterase (BuChE) as a biorecognition element. The main analytical characteristics of the biosensor developed were studied for different conditions. The possibility to optimise these working parameters was investigated. By using this biosensor and enzyme inhibition effect, the <b>tomatine</b> {{can be measured in}} the concentration range of 0. 5 - 50 muM with a detection limit of 0. 2 muM. <b>Tomatine</b> concentrations in different tomato juice samples were determined by such a biosensor, and a good correlation with the known real content was revealed. A high reproducibility and operational stability of the biosensor developed were shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to purify and, it possible, to isolate an antihistamine-like principle(s) from the Hungarian oak gall. Although the study fell short of {{isolating}} the active principle(s), it succeeded in obtaining a highly purified tannin-tree fraction by silica gel G and sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography. According to the thin layer chromatography, the active tractions so obtained still contain at least 4 - 8 substances. The antihistamine-like activity of the purified oak gall extract was {{compared to that of}} <b>tomatine</b> and gomatine in the guinea pigs. All three substances significantly inhibited histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. <b>Tomatine</b> and gomatine significantly reduced the effects of both histamine and bradykinin but the purified oak gall extract only antagonized the histaminic affects. Gomatine and the purified oak gall extract but not <b>tomatine</b> exerted anti-anaphylactic activity. None of the three substances inhibited the PCA reaction...|$|E
