Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly the idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Feynman {{delivered}} the Caltech commencement {{address on the}} topic of cargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience {{due to a lack of}} [...] "a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty" [...] on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> not fool yourselfâ€”and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E

These pressured conditions led the company to mistitle the promotional releases as His Band and Street Choir and prepare an incorrectly ordered track listing. At the end of [...] "I'll Be Your Lover, Too" [...] an unedited conversation is left on the finished record, which Peter Mills notes {{is an example of}} the album's rough edges. Janet Planet designed the album cover and wrote the sleeve notes, which sound [...] "a little desperate", in the words of Brian Hinton, as she wrote, [...] "This is the album <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> sing with, dance to, you must find a place for these songs somewhere in your life." ...|$|E

500|$|Finding {{his former}} lover Shae in his father's bed, Tyrion {{strangles}} her. Confronting Tywin with a crossbow soon after, he murders him too. To Martin, [...] "the two actions are quite different, although they occur within moments of each other". The author continues, [...] "He's furious at Lord Tywin because {{he found out}} the truth about his first wife {{and what happened to}} her, and ... Lord Tywin is convinced that since he doesn't love Tyrion, then no one can possibly love Tyrion." [...] As Tywin repeatedly calls Tyrion's tragic first wife Tysha a [...] "whore," [...] Tyrion warns him to stop. Tywin has always taught his son <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> follow through on your threats if you are defied, so when he fails to heed Tyrion's warning, the dwarf kills him. [...] "And it will haunt him. Tywin was his father and that will continue to haunt him, probably {{for the rest of his}} life," [...] says the author.

500|$|Fincher {{supervised}} {{the composition of}} the DVD packaging {{and was one of the}} first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released in two DVD editions. The single-disc edition included a commentary track, while the two-disc special edition included the commentary track, behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, fake public service announcements, the promotional music video [...] "This is Your Life", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials. The director worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented the director's vision: [...] "The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it." [...] The studio developed the packaging for two months. The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title [...] "Fight Club" [...] was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, [...] "We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside." [...] Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design: [...] "From a retail standpoint, [...] has incredible shelf-presence." ...|$|E
500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{was well}} {{received}} by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release {{review of the}} Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L. Kent found that the flight mechanics and vast areas featured in Pilotwings 64 make {{it one of the}} most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, [...] "The graphics, sound, control, and all around excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride." [...] Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, [...] "You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, [...] "challenge without competition" [...] aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that [...] "The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, but the bottom line is that PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo." [...] A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: [...] "It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though Stein {{collected}} cubist paintings, {{especially those}} of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of CÃ©zanne. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: [...] "the whole field of the canvas is important" [...] (p.8). Rather than a figure/ground relationship, [...] "Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered {{as much as any}} other." [...] It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: [...] "The important thing is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{essential}} fatty acids <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> consume (omega-3 and omega-6). Experts say that you need to eat a balanced amount of omega-3s and omega-6s. However, some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega-6s than omega-3s. There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression, hyperactivity and schizophrenia, but it still lacking evidences. An omega-3 deficient diet increases omega-6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice. Sources of omega-3 include flax seeds, chia seeds, walnuts, sea vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and cold water fish. [...] You can find sources of omega-6 in walnuts, hazelnuts; sunflower, safflower, corn, and sesame oils.|$|E
2500|$|Proximate cause means <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> {{be able to}} {{show that}} the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for. The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a {{superseding}} intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. [...] A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.|$|E
