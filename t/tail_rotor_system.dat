25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the design was revised with the {{introduction}} of the Fenestron <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system,</b> an advanced rigid main rotor, composite materials, and resonance isolation systems. It was decided to pursue a full certification program, resulting in the production of two pre-production prototypes; at the same time, it was chosen to give the Bo 108 a new designation of EC135 to correspond with the newly created Eurocopter company. At this point, it was decided that the EC135 should be developed with the option of being powered by two competing engines, the Turbomeca Arrius 2B and the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW206B engines; two pre-production prototypes were built in 1994 powered by either engine, both powerplants proved to be successful and were used on subsequent production aircraft.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} three major {{alternative}} designs which attempt to solve the shortcomings of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|For smaller helicopters, {{it may be}} {{advantageous}} to use a NOTAR (from NO <b>TAil</b> <b>Rotor)</b> <b>system.</b> In this yaw-control method, air is blown out of vents along the tail boom, producing thrust via the Coandă effect.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{failures}} which occur {{from either}} a mechanical malfunction of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> control <b>system</b> or {{a loss of}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust authority, called [...] "loss of tail-rotor effectiveness" [...] (LTE).|$|R
50|$|Recent {{technology}} in emergency <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> recovery <b>systems</b> has been advanced by the US Army in an SBIR research award to EATTS. The emergency anti-torque thruster system (EATTS) {{would allow a}} helicopter that has encountered <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failure, or loss of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> effectiveness, to land safely. The system is designed to counteract the torque from the helicopter's main <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> during <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failure {{as a result of}} mechanical problems as well as loss of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> from RPG hits.|$|R
50|$|Freewheels {{are also}} used in rotorcraft. As a bicycle's wheels {{need to be able}} to rotate faster than the pedals, so do a rotorcraft's blades {{need to be able to}} spin faster than its drive engines. This is {{especially}} important in the event of an engine failure where a freewheel in the main transmission allows the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> to continue to spin independent of the drive system. This provides for continued flight control and an autorotation landing.|$|R
50|$|McDonnell Douglas {{developed}} the NOTAR (NO <b>TAil</b> <b>Rotor)</b> <b>system,</b> which eliminates having any rotating parts {{out in the}} open. The NOTAR system uses a variable pitch ducted fan driven by the helicopter's powerplant, but the ducted fan is mounted inside the fuselage ahead of the tail boom, and the exhaust passes through the tail boom to the end, where it is expelled out one side. This creates a boundary layer which causes the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tail boom according to the Coandă effect. This creates a force which cancels out the main rotor torque and provides directional control. The advantages of the system {{are similar to the}} Fenestron system discussed above.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, primary {{investor}} G & J Weir Ltd. {{revived the}} moribund Cierva Autogiro Company {{to develop an}} experimental helicopter to Air Ministry Specification E.16/43. The W.9 was to investigate James G. Weir's contention that a powered tilting hub-controlled rotor with automatic collective pitch control, and torque reaction control using jet efflux, was both safer and more efficient than the Sikorsky R-4 helicopter fitted with manually controlled main rotor cyclic and collective pitch and the anti-torque <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> The W.9 was completed late in 1944 and assigned serial PX203. It was damaged during ground-running due to incorrect control phasing arising from a high order of pitch-flap coupling, and did not start test flying until 1945.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the design was revised with the {{introduction}} of the Fenestron <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system,</b> an advanced rigid main rotor, composite materials, and resonance isolation systems.

50|$|One notable test {{performed}} with the RSRA {{was the use of}} the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> load measurement <b>system</b> to determine the vertical drag of the airframe.|$|R
50|$|Developing {{an entirely}} new {{helicopter}} from scratch would have involved designing and developing many accompanying subsystems and components, such as the turboshaft engines and the dynamic systems, such as the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> and the gearboxes. Due to the great difficulty posed by the prospects of designing and manufacturing a clean-design helicopter, which would have substantially increased the cost and timescale of the project, {{it was decided to}} base the attack helicopter upon an existing design. At the time, the SAAF operated two principal helicopter types - the Aérospatiale Alouette III and the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma. The Alouette III was a small helicopter which originated from the 1960s; due to the age of the design and a lack of engine power, it was not considered a favourable candidate for further development work.|$|R
2500|$|Igor Sikorsky's {{quest for}} a {{practical}} helicopter began in 1938, when as the Engineering Manager of the Vought-Sikorsky Division of United Aircraft Corporation, {{he was able to}} convince the directors of United Aircraft that his years of study and research into rotary-wing flight problems would lead to a breakthrough. [...] His first experimental machine, the VS-300, was test flown by Sikorsky on 14 September 1939, tethered by cables. In developing the concept of rotary-wing flight, Sikorsky was the first to introduce a single engine to power both the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>systems.</b> The only previous successful attempt at a single-lift rotor helicopter, the Yuriev-Cheremukhin TsAGI-1EA in 1931 in the Soviet Union, used a pair of uprated, Russian-built Gnome Monosoupape rotary engines of 120hp each for its power. For later flights of his VS-300, Sikorsky also added a vertical airfoil surface {{to the end of the}} tail to assist anti-torque but this was later removed when it proved to be ineffective.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> rotates airfoils, small wings called blades, {{that vary}} in pitch {{in order to}} vary the amount of thrust they produce. The blades most often utilize a {{composite}} material construction, such as a core made of aluminum honeycomb or plasticized paper honeycomb, covered in a skin made of aluminum or carbon fiber composite. Tail rotor blades are made with both symmetrical and asymmetrical airfoil construction. The pitch change mechanism uses a cable control system or control tubes that run from the anti-torque pedals in the cockpit to a mechanism mounted on the tail rotor gearbox. In larger helicopters, the pitch change mechanism is augmented by a hydraulic power control servo. In {{the event of a}} hydraulic system failure, the mechanical system is still able to control the tail rotor pitch, though the control resistance felt by the pilot will be considerably greater.|$|E
40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{parameters of}} helicopter tail rotors are {{required in the}} monitoring and evaluation of rotor aeroservoelastic instability incidents such as limit cycle oscillations (LCO). However, in-situ measurement of these parameters on helicopters is generally difficult due {{to the need to}} transfer vibration data across a rotating interface. This paper presents a novel center frequency scaling factor relationship of the aeroelastic parameters between the rotating and stationary frames. Together with the stochastic parameter identification technique, this methodology enables real-time estimation and tracking of the critical aeroelastic parameters in the rotating frame during LCO events based on vibration information measured exclusively in the stationary frame. The methodology has been validated using flight vibration data measured from both the rotating and stationary frames of a helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> during an LCO event. Moreover, this methodology has been applied to the analysis of vibration data measured from the teeter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> on the Canadian CH- 149 Cormorant helicopters to derive the critical aeroelastic parameters during several LCO events.

40|$|The safe-life and {{damage-tolerant}} design approaches discussed {{apply to}} both metallic and fibrous composite helicopter structures. The {{application of these}} design approaches to fibrous composite structures is emphasized. Safe-life and damage-tolerant criteria are applied to all helicopter flight critical components, which are generally categorized as: dynamic components with a main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system,</b> which includes blades, hub and rotating controls, and drive train which includes transmission, and main and interconnecting rotor shafts; and the airframe, composed of the fuselage, aerodynamic surfaces, and landing gear...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{main and}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> of a {{helicopter}} must be maintained in a damage-free condition {{to ensure the safety}} of the helicopter. The components of the <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> require regular maintenance and inspection, and some of the components are difficult to inspect. Accordingly, an integrated sensor system that continuously monitors the structural integrity of the <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> is needed to assure the safety of flight and reduce the cost of maintenance of the <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> This smart monitoring system could also provide immediate information on the dynamic loading in the <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> This information could define the performance limit of the helicopter based on the condition of the <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> The operator will then be able to adjust the flight condition and prevent damage from occurring or propagating. The challenges in designing this monitoring system are related to the operating conditions of the helicopter. These include significant aerodynamic and external damping in bending and torsion modes, moderate nonlinearities in the system, large dynamic loads, and difficulty in actuating pure interrogation signals in the airborne condition. In this paper, piezoceramic sensors and actuators and different techniques for damage detection that use symmetry properties of the structure and no structural model are tested in a static condition for health monitoring {{of a helicopter}} flexbeam. Testing under dynamic loading is needed as the next step in the development of the smart sensor system...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> drive <b>system</b> {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} the tail boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an angled drive for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> drive shaft from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in forward flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> or the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> flight controls fail. About 10% of the engine power goes to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{existing}} two-bladed semi-rigid, teetering <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> {{is being}} {{replaced with a}} four-bladed, hingeless, bearingless composite <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> The improvement in flight characteristics provided by the four-bladed configuration has led to increases in flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate-of-climb, payload and [...] reduced rotor vibration. The <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> has 75% fewer parts than that of four-bladed articulated systems, and the improved yokes allow for weight saving with {{the elimination of all}} bearings, hinges, and vibration absorbers in the rotor hub. The blades are made of carbon fiber-based composites, which have an increased ballistic survivability, and there is a semiautomatic folding system for stowage aboard Amphibious assault ships. Both helicopters will receive an upgraded, four-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and drive <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of mass and stiffness imbalance in a tail rotor induced by damage in forward flight. Design/methodology/approach – An aeroelastic analysis based on finite element {{in space and time}} and capable of modeling dissimilar blades is carried out to study the effect of damage occurring in one, two, and three blades in a four-bladed <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> in forward flight. The effect of damage growth on vibratory hub loads and blade responses is studied using a comprehensive aeroelastic code. Findings – The diagnostic chart which is the summary of damage analysis of tail rotor shows that the root hub vibration spectrum gives enough indication to predict damage growth in the tail rotor blade. Hence, this can be useful towards development of health monitoring system for tail rotor blades. Originality/value – The proposed analysis helps in understanding the basic physics behind the damaged tail rotor and also gives qualitative assessment of damaged tail rotor where obtaining the flight test data with damaged tail rotor is difficult...|$|E
40|$|Balancing is a {{rotating}} component {{is critical in}} any mechanism. Devoid of proper balancing, any vehicle-be it in air, land or sea, it will affect stability, control and safety. The same goes for rotor crafts. Imbalance of the helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> leads to vibrations in the entire vehicle and may cause accident. Typically, for the tail rotor of a helicopter, the blade {{is a source of}} vibration on the tail boom. This not only causes inconvenience to the pilot but also reduces the life span of the helicopter. There {{is a certain amount of}} vibration in the helicopter rotor systems especially the tail rotor. Hence, balancing procedure for rotating mass was conducted to reduce the vibration. This research focuses on balancing of the tail rotor for UTM Single Seat Helicopter. Experiments have been conducted in order to study the vibration level of the tail rotor. Adding and removing masses separately on the tail rotor exhibited different vibration levels. The responses were analyzed and used for balancing the tail of rotor system. The balancing effort was considered successful, although there was still some residual unbalance in the tail rotor...|$|E
40|$|The unique {{structural}} {{features of}} helicopter bearingless rotors {{call for the}} development of design and modeling methodologies for laminated composite flex-structures. Indeed, the flex-structure should be flexible enough to replace the flap, lead-lag, and feathering bearings, while maintaining high strength and stiffness in the axial direction. Laminated composite materials are a material of choice for such an application. Chordwise deformations, transitional zones between different cross sections and localized compressive stresses are all likely to be present in the flex-structure, rendering the validity of a beam model questionable. In this article a nonlinear anisotropic shallow shell model is developed that accommodates transverse shearing deformations, and arbitrarily large displacements and rotations, but strains are assumed to remain small. The displacement-based shell model has six degrees of freedom at each node and allows for an automatic compatibility of the shell and beam models. The model is validated by comparing its predictions with several benchmark problems. A four-bladed composite bearingless <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> is analyzed in detail using the shell model and compared with the predictions of a beam model. Significant differences are observed between the two models, especially in the torsional behavior...|$|E
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and the <b>systems</b> {{that provide}} {{power and control}} for it are {{considered}} critically important for safe flight. As with many parts on a helicopter, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> its transmission, and many parts in the drive system are often life-limited, meaning they are arbitrarily replaced after {{a certain number of}} flight hours, regardless of condition. Between replacements, parts are subject to frequent inspections utilizing visual as well as chemical methods such as fluorescent penetrant inspection to detect weak parts before they fail completely.|$|R
40|$|Contra-rotating {{rotor blade}} {{is a system}} that can deliver poised torque {{condition}} for any rotorcraft without the manifestation of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> contrivance. This <b>system</b> not only aids to sustain the stability of the aircraft, but also surges the aircraft’s overall efficiency discrete to the conventional single <b>rotor</b> <b>system.</b> Contra-rotation system is capable of operating in reduced size and henceforth is effusively researched and applied to the unmanned micro aerial vehicle (MAV) technology. This study intended to reconnoiter the effect of varying the axial spacing between the forward rotor and the aft rotor of an archetypal contra-rotating <b>rotor</b> blade <b>system.</b> The quantitative data has espoused that the variation of axial spacing between the forward and aft rotor affected the total efficiency of the contra-rotating <b>rotor</b> blade <b>system.</b> Furthermore, at larger spacing, the effects were more substantial contributing adversely to the overall efficiency of the system...|$|R
5000|$|Like other Kamov helicopters, it {{features}} Kamov's characteristic contra-rotating co-axial <b>rotor</b> <b>system,</b> which removes {{the need for}} the entire <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> assembly and improves the aircraft's aerobatic qualities—it can perform loops, rolls and [...] "the funnel" [...] (circle-strafing), where the aircraft maintains a line-of-sight to the target while flying circles of varying altitude, elevation and airspeed around it. The omission of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is a qualitative advantage, because the torque-countering <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> can use up to 30% of engine power. The Ka-50's entire transmission presents a comparatively small target to ground fire.|$|R
40|$|The {{tail rotor}} of a {{helicopter}} with a single main rotor configuration can experience {{a significant reduction in}} thrust when the aircraft operates in crosswind flight. Brown’s vorticity transport model has been used to simulate a main rotor and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> translating at a sideslip angle that causes the tail rotor to interact with the main rotor tip vortices as they propagate downstream at the lateral extremities of the wake. The tail rotor is shown to exhibit a distinct directionally dependent mode during which tail rotors that are configured so that the blades travel forward {{at the top of the}} disk develop less thrust than tail rotors with the reverse sense of rotation. The range of flight speeds over which this mode exists is shown to vary considerably with the vertical location of the tail rotor. At low flight speeds, the directionally dependent mode occurs because the tail rotor is immersed within not only the downwash from the main rotor but also the rotational flow associated with clusters of largely disorganized vorticity within the main rotor wake. At higher flight speeds, however, the tail rotor is immersed within a coherent supervortex that strongly influences the velocity field surrounding the tail rotor...|$|E
50|$|The <b>rotor</b> <b>system,</b> or {{more simply}} rotor, is the {{rotating}} {{part of a}} helicopter that generates lift. A <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> may be mounted horizontally, as main rotors are, providing lift vertically, {{or it may be}} mounted vertically, such as a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> to provide horizontal thrust to counteract torque from the main rotors. The rotor consists of a mast, hub and rotor blades.|$|R
25|$|The Bell 427 {{is powered}} by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW207D {{turboshaft}} engines with FADEC. Like the Bell 407, the 427 uses a four-blade main <b>rotor</b> <b>system</b> with a rigid, composite rotor hub and a two-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{model scale}} hover test was {{conducted}} in the Sikorsky Aircraft Model rotor hover Facility to identify and quantify {{the impact of the}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> on the demonstrated advantages of advanced geometry tip configurations. The test was conducted using the Basic Model Test Rig and two scaled main <b>rotor</b> <b>systems,</b> one representing a 1 / 5. 727 scale UH- 60 A BLACK HAWK and the others a 1 / 4. 71 scale S- 76. Eight alternate rotor tip configurations were tested, 3 on the BLACK HAWK rotor and 6 on the S- 76 rotor. Four of these tips were then selected for testing in close proximity to an operating <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> (operating in both tractor and pusher modes) to determine if the performance advantages that could be obtained from the use of advanced geometry tips in a main rotor only environment would still exist in the more complex flow field involving a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> The test showed that overall the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> effects on the advanced tip configurations tested are not substantially different from the effects on conventional tips...|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a wind tunnel investigation to determine the tail contribution to the directional aerodynamic characteristics of a 1 / 6 -scale model of the <b>rotor</b> <b>systems</b> research aircraft (RSRA) with a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> No main rotor was used during the investigation. Data were obtained with and without the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> over a range of sideslip angle and over a range of rotor collective pitch angle. The model with the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> was tested at several advance ratios with and without thrust from the auxiliary thrust engines on the RSRA fuselage. Increasing {{the space between the}} tail-rotor hub and the vertical tail reduced the tail-rotor torque required at moderate to high rotor thrust. Increasing the exit dynamic pressure of the auxiliary thrust engines decreases the tail contribution to the static directional stability. The tail-rotor thrust and its interference provide a positive increment to the static directional stability. The tail contribution increases with forward speed. The adverse yawing moment of the airframe would strongly affect the thrust required of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> when the helicopter is hovering in a crosswind...|$|R
