5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but {{what could he do}} but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
5|$|In {{remembrance of}} the victims there have been erected {{numerous}} memorial sites, funded by private initiatives and public bodies on the orders of the Berlin boroughs, the Berlin House of Representatives or the federal government, which are placed over various places in Berlin. The oldest date back to <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Wall was still standing. They include monuments, crucifixes and memorial stones, and were visited by foreign politicians during state visits. Together with the border installations, there were also some memorial sites that were removed when the Wall fell. Sites for fallen border guards were especially affected by this. Until the tenth anniversary of {{the building of the}} Wall, for every victim the private Berliner Bürger-Verein ("Berlin Citizen Association") placed a white wooden cross {{at the scene of the}} event. They were aided in their effort by the senate of West-Berlin. On 13 August 1971, the memorial site Weiße Keuze ("White Crosses") was inaugurated on the east side of the Reichstag building.|$|E

25|$|Debate on {{a second}} gas {{pipeline}} from Alberta to California served as {{a good example of}} changing values during this period. For decades, California consumers opposed rival pipelines for fear of having to pay higher gas prices to cover pipeline construction. Deregulation made the pipeline companies common carriers so that any producer or marketer could buy space on the pipeline to move its gas. Gone were <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> pipeline company moved the gas and also marketed it.|$|E
25|$|The word wicket is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to the cricket pitch itself. According to the Laws of Cricket, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives from <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers {{it is quite possible that}} the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} sole purpose of Jamaica College from 1903 onwards was to train {{potential}} university students in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> University of the West Indies did not exist, in practice most students did not go further than fourth or fifth forms. That was considered sufficient education for just about any managerial or clerical job in Jamaica. It was also considered uneconomical to run a school of less than eighty boys, and therefore a deliberate attempt to expand the school to include those of parents who were able to afford the fees was embarked upon. By the 1930s, the student population rose to over one hundred and fifty.|$|E

The group, chiefly {{consisting}} of teenage boys, gathered in the Sultan Razia Girls' School, where they began negotiating their surrender, but hundreds of them were ultimately killed. For almost two days as the group gathered in the abandoned Sultan Razia Girls' School and built up their fighting positions, the town officials and Northern Alliance attempted negotiations for their surrender, but the fighters vehemently refused, ultimately killing two peace envoys, one town mullah and a soldier escort. All the while they constantly fired at anyone who moved within the vicinity of the building, including civilian bystanders.|$|E
25|$|In the {{obituary}} of Wason written for The Times newspaper, he {{was described as}} a political Radical. He was said to be a frequent speaker in the House of Commons (unlike his brother Cathcart) and usually gave expression to advanced radical views. On one important radical issue of the day, women’s suffrage, he himself claimed to have always voted in favour. His support of Home Rule all Round was also indicative of radical sentiments. However, after he left Parliament, in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> old Liberal tradition was collapsing under the strains and stresses of party splits, the confusion of the electorate as to Liberal policy and the massive expansion of the electorate {{as a result of the}} Representation of the People Act 1918, Wason’s radicalism was tested. At the general elections of 1923 and 1924 in Wason’s home area of South Ayrshire no Liberal candidate could be persuaded to stand, leaving a straight fight between Labour and Conservative parties.|$|E
25|$|Corbett {{was born}} Bertie Oswald Corbett in Thame, Oxfordshire {{one of three}} sons of Rev. Elijah Bagot Corbett (Vicar of Thame 1872–1893). He was educated at Thame Grammar School and played soccer for Oxfordshire {{at the age of}} 15. He went on to Oxford University where he won his soccer blue. He later played soccer for the Corinthians and the Casuals, in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> famous amateur side could beat {{professional}} teams. He played in the game against Bury which the Corinthians won 10–3 to take the Sheriff of London Charity Shield. The team which Bury put into the field that day contained nine of the eleven players which had beaten Derby County F.C. in the 1903 FA Cup final by 6–0. Corbett made one appearance for the English football team, against Wales on 18 March 1901, playing at outside left. England won the match 6–0 thanks to four goals from Steve Bloomer. Throughout his career he played at outside-left and was noted for his pace and body swerve. He is highly regarded for his first history of the club The Annals of the Corinthian F. C. written in 1906.|$|E

25|$|The {{school now}} has six day houses – Holden, Rigaud, Sherrington, School, Broke and Felaw – into which all pupils are {{filtered}} from year 9/Upper 6th Form onwards, {{and a single}} large boarding house - Westwood. Those with relatives who attended the school are generally expected {{to be placed in}} the same house. There is a good deal of competition between the houses and every year, the houses compete for the Ganzoni Cup (house cup), which is won by gaining points from winning inter-house events. These include most sports as well as others such as debating and art. The final and most important event is Sports Day, in the Summer Term, on which the athletics competitions take place. Felaw has won more times than any other house, with Rigaud in second place; it is believed that School has not won {{since the days of the}} reign of Queen Victoria. However, School is the oldest house and dates from <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> boys lived and were taught in one house (called School House). It later became the boarding house which occupied a part of the main building on Henley Road.|$|E
500|$|Rigbey {{also wanted}} to make sure that {{everyone}} liked the character, and eventually nineteen year old, agricultural student Ruth Pritchard was created. Actress (later presenter) Felicity Finch was cast as Ruth. Finch had not listened to The Archers prior to her audition in 1987 and she tried to learn as much as she could about the history of the show before she came to the studio. Smethurst thought the decision to cast a Geordie was [...] "odd" [...] and wrote that it harked back to <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> show would cast lots of Scottish and Irish actors, irritating the audience. Finch's first scenes as Ruth were broadcast on 15 July 1987.|$|E
500|$|In the film, Hickok {{calls on}} his friends Earp, Calamity Jane, Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, Charlie Bassett, Luke Short and Bill Tilghman to help {{clean up a}} wild cowtown.

[...] Earp was described in the promotional copy as [...] "Deputy Sheriff to Bat Masterson of Dodge City, {{known as one of}} the three greatest gun-men that ever lived, along with Bat Masterson and 'Wild Bill' Hickok". In reality, Earp was a virtually unknown assistant marshal in Dodge City when Wild Bill Hickok was murdered in 1876.|$|E

500|$|Colleges {{began to}} keep barges moored {{on the side}} of the river on Christ Church Meadow from 1839; these would be used for crews to change, for spectators to watch the races and for social functions. Jesus shared a barge with New, St John's and Pembroke after 1857. In 1911, Jesus {{purchased}} their own barge from Salters, at a cost of £940.14s.8d (approximately £ as of [...] ). It had previously been owned by one of the Livery Companies of the City of London and had been used in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Lord Mayor's Show took place on the River Thames in London rather than through the streets. After sinking in 1955, it was salvaged and restored. In 1964, the college replaced the barge with a boathouse, which is shared with the boat club of Keble College). The barge was moved to Maidenhead where it was later restored. It returned to Oxford in 1987, but was badly damaged by fire in January 1988. After further restoration, it was moved to Richmond-upon-Thames, where it is moored alongside Richmond Bridge and used as a restaurant. The barge was decorated for some years in the college colours of green and white, with a Welsh red dragon on the prow; by 2009, however, it had been repainted with blue instead of green.|$|E
