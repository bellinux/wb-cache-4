CAD/CAM technology can allow for the immediate, same day delivery of these types restorations which are milled out of blocks of solid porcelain which matches the shade or color of the patients teeth. Traditionally, all-ceramic restorations have been made off site in a dental laboratory either out of feldspathic porcelains or pressed ceramics. This indirect method of fabrication involves molds and temporaries, but can yield quite beautiful end-results if communication between the laboratory and the dentist is sound. The greatest {{difference between these two}} differing modalities {{lies in the fact that}} the CAD/CAM route does not require <b>temporization,</b> while the laboratory-fabricated route does. Some argue that this lack of <b>temporization</b> can result in a decreased need for root canal therapy, as there is no temporary leakage between visits.|$|E

Deferred by virtue of the very principle of difference which holds that an element functions and signifies, takes on or conveys meaning, only by referring to another past or future element in an economy of traces. This economic aspect of différance, which brings into play a certain not conscious calculation in a field of forces, is inseparable from the more narrowly semiotic aspect of différance.|$|E

Kévorkian suggests, [...] "Armenians {{knew that they}} were doomed if they obeyed; yet, if they failed to, they would provide the vali with the pretext he needed to attack the city's Christian {{quarters}} and the rural areas. In other words, the Armenian leaders' strategy of <b>temporization</b> had become obsolete. The murder of Ishkhan on the night of 16 April and the arrest of Arshag Vramian - Van still did not know that he had been murdered - probably convinced the last Armenian leader left alive, Aram Manukian, to reject the authorities' injunctions and prepare the city for an attack that was now certain to come." [...] With Ishkhan and Vramian assassinated, Manukian remained only major Armenian leader in Van. Turkish forces attacked Aygestan, the old city of Van with a mixed Armenian-Turkish population, on 20 April.

Considering {{the large number}} of parameters which play a role in cardiac resynchronization therapy, a comprehensive numerical model of cardiocirculatory system could be a useful tool to support clinical decisions. A variable elastance model of ventricles was updated to model the interventricular septum and to simulate the interventricular and the intraventricular desynchrony, and the effect of the biventricular stimulation. In addition, a numerical model of the biventricular pacemaker, which drives the beginning of the heart chambers and interventricular septum contraction, was also developed. In order to validate the model, five patients affected by dilated cardiomyopathy were analysed by echocardiography and electrocardiography before implantation, 24 h and 3 months after the implantation. The developed numerical model permits to reproduce clinical data and to estimate the trend of parameters that are difficult to measure (i. e. left ventricular systolic elastance). Furthermore, the model permits to study the effect of different biventricular pacemaker <b>temporizations</b> on hemodynamic variables...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Mineral {{trioxide}} aggregate (MTA) {{has been}} used successfully for perforation repair, vital pulpotomies, and direct pulp capping. However, {{little is known about}} the interactions between MTA and glass ionomer cement (GIC) in final restorations. In this study, 2 null hypotheses were tested: (1) GIC placement time does not affect the MTA-GIC structural interface and hardness and (2) moisture does not affect the MTA-GIC structural interface and hardness. Methods: Fifty cylinders were half filled with MTA and divided into 5 groups. The other half was filled with resin-modified GIC either immediately after MTA placement or after 1 or 7 days of <b>temporization</b> in the presence or absence of a wet cotton pellet. The specimens were then sectioned, carbon coated, and examined using a scanning electron microscope and an electron probe microanalyzer (SEM-EPMA) for interfacial adaptation, gap formation, and elemental analysis. The Vickers hardness numbers of the interfacial MTA were recorded 24 hours after GIC placement and 8 days after MTA placement and analyzed using the analysis of variance test. Results: Hardness testing 24 hours after GIC placement revealed a significant increase in hardness with an increase of <b>temporization</b> time but not with a change of moisture conditions (P <. 05). Hardness testing 8 days after MTA placement indicated no significant differences among groups. SEM-EPMA showed interfacial adaptation to improve with <b>temporization</b> time and moisture. Observed changes were limited to the outermost layer of MTA. The 2 null hypotheses were not rejected.

40|$|Abstract. Recently {{the term}} Web Services Orchestration has been {{introduced}} to address composition and coordination of Web Services. Several languages to describe orchestration for business processes have been presented {{and many of them}} use concepts such as long-running transactions and compensations to cope with error handling. WS-BPEL is currently the best suited in this field. However, its complexity hinders rigorous treatment. In this paper we address the notion of orchestration from a formal point of view, with particular attention to transactions and compensations. In particular, we discuss webπ∞, an untimed subcalculus of webπ [15] which is a simple and conservative extension of the π-calculus. We introduce it as a theoretical and foundational model for Web Services coordination. We simplify some semantical and pragmatical aspects, in particular regarding <b>temporization,</b> gaining {{a better understanding of the}} fundamental issues. To discuss the usefulness of the language we consider a case study: we formalize an e-commerce transactional scenario drawing on a case presented in our previous work [12]. ...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{stability}} of the peri-implant bone, the peri-implant soft tissues and the esthetic success of immediately placed implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, scalloped-shaped implants were placed immediately and 1. 5  mm supracrestally after single-tooth extraction. All implants were immediately restored with an implant-supported temporary crown. Clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed on the day of tooth extraction with subsequent implant placement and <b>temporization,</b> after 6  months at delivery of the final crown, and after 1, after 3, and up to 5  years after crown delivery. RESULTS: All 31 implants were clinically successful and in function during the observation period (mean 3. 4  years). The peri-implant soft tissues were clinically healthy as indicated by a low mean plaque (below 0. 5) and sulcus bleeding index (below 0. 24) values. The distance between the implant shoulder and the first visible bone-to-implant contact (DIBrx) was measured at the mesial and distal aspects of each implant using periapical radiographs. Mean values for DIBrx of 1. 73  ±  0. 59  mm directly after implant placement and 2. 25  ±  0. 66  mm after the observation period demonstrated stable peri-implant bone levels. The mean distance from the implant shoulder to the gingival margin on the labial aspect (DIM vestibular) was 2. 21  ±  1. 09  mm directly after implant placement. Respective values at 1  year, at 3  years and at 5  years after crown delivery remained stable thus demonstrating little if any gingival recession. The assessed mean values for the pink (PES) and white (WES) esthetic score (0  =  0 - 33 % score, 1  =  34 - 66 % score, 2  =  67 - 100 % score) were 8 / 4 directly after implant placement and 9 / 10 after 1. 5 - 5. 5  years of observation.

40|$|Even though Husserl’s {{thinking}} {{has received a}} remarkable amount of attention over the last decades, {{the full extent of}} many of its central aspects still remains surprisingly unknown.

40|$|Background: Epidemiologic {{information}} on time trends of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) and ADR-related hospitalizations is scarce. Over time, pharmacotherapy {{has become increasingly}} complex. Because of raised awareness of ADR, a decrease in ADR might be expected. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine trends in ADR-related hospitalizations in the older Dutch population. Methodology and Principal Findings: Secular trend analysis of ADR-related hospital admissions in patients $ 60 years between 1981 and 2007, using the National Hospital Discharge Registry of the Netherlands. Numbers, age-specific and ageadjusted incidence rates (per 10, 000 persons) of ADR-related hospital admissions were used as outcome measures in each year of the study. Between 1981 and 2007, ADR-related hospital admissions in persons $ 60 years increased by 143 %. The overall standardized incidence rate increased from 23. 3 to 38. 3 per 10, 000 older persons. The increase was larger in males than in females. Since 1997, the increase in incidence rates of ADR-related hospitalizations flattened (percentage annual change 0. 65 %), compared to the period 1981 – 1996 (percentage annual change 2. 56 %). Conclusion/Significance: ADR-related hospital admissions in older persons have shown a rapidly increasing trend in the Netherlands over the last three decades with a <b>temporization</b> since 1997. Although an encouraging flattening in the increasing trend of ADR-related admissions was found around 1997, the incidence is still rising, which warrants sustaine...|$|E

Objective: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the accuracy of the master cast using open tray impression technique with conventional and novel splinting materials. Methodology: A mandibular reference model with four ADIN implants was done. Ten custom trays were fabricated using the light curable resin sheets. Medium body polyether impression material was used. These trays were randomly divided between the two groups, with five trays in each group. Impression techniques were divided into two groups namely: Group A: Direct impression technique with open tray impression copings splinted with autopolymerizing acrylic resin (GC pattern resin). Group B: Direct impression technique with open tray impression copings splinted with Pro-temp TM 4 (bis-GMA) syringable <b>temporization</b> material. Thus, final impressions were made.

40|$|Purpose: Patterned {{breathing}} allows standardized serial {{measurements of}} {{heart rate variability}} and baroreflex indices. The slow breathing augments these parameters, and regular exercises, including yoga breathing practices with even respiratory rates have long-term beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases. The role of <b>temporization</b> of breathing phases, i. e. the ratio of expiration to inspiration, is not known. In order to characterize the hemodynamic and autonomic responses during varying breathing phases 27 volunteers performed three short breathing sessions at 6 /minutes frequency with 5 : 5, 3 : 7 and 7 : 3 inspiration expiration ratios. Results: The immediate responses in arterial pressure and heart rate were negligible. The time domain parameters of heart rate variability (SDRR, PNN 50, RMSSD) increased significantly with patterned breathing. So did the spontaneous baroreflex gain of increasing sequences (up-BRS, from 12 ± 7 to 17 ± 10 ms/mmHg, p < 0. 05), and the cross-spectral low frequency gain, the LF alpha (from 11 ± 7 to 15 ± 7 ms/mmHg, p < 0. 05). None of these parameters differed significantly from each other while using any of tested inspiratory-expiratory patterns. Conclusion: The major determinant of autonomic responses induced by slow patterned breathing is the breathing rate itself. From our observations, it follows that slow breathing exercises performed either with diagnostic or therapeutic purpose could be simplified, allowing more extensive investigations.

The authors present a case of severe teeth erosion and wear secondary to a history of bulimia nervosa. 1 Their use of three successive occlusal bite splints of increasing thickness allowed a gradual increase in the patient’s vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO) to provide sufficient space to rehabilitate the worn dentition. As with any complex rehabilitation, establishment of a comfortable and functional VDO is essential prior to providing definitive restorations for the patient. Although it is relatively common to deliver temporary restorations chairside {{with a combination of}} premade stents from the diagnostic wax-up and considerable adjustment time chairside, generally some degree of tooth preparation is required to create sufficient space for retention and material strength. The authors intentionally avoided significant tooth preparation during the <b>temporization</b> phase by utilizing a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technique to design and mill the temporary restorations. This allowed them to utilize a high density, highly filled acrylic that was industrially fabricated in blocks. Because these materials are milled to shape, there is no volumetric change in size of the material due to polymerization shrinkage during fabrication. The blocks are free of porosity and voids, making them more color stable as well.

This technique utilizes a clear poly vinyl siloxane bite registration material to take a small impression without a tray and uses that impression as a die to force the unset light cured dental restorative material into the original anatomy, surface texture and occlusion that the patient had when the procedure started. Then the restorative material is cured through the clear bite registration material creating a hard smooth surface without an air inhibited, layer reducing or eliminating any finishing or polishing, and saving 5 to 10 minutes of chairtime. If the original surface is defective that defect is easily filled in with red border molding wax prior to taking the impression with a clear bite registration material.

The standardized access cavities were prepared and filled with: (1) Cavit; (2) Fuji II LC; (3) Fuji IX; (4) Voco Clip; (5) AdheSE and Tetric EvoCeram; (6) Excite and Tetric EvoCeram. The crown of each tooth was sectioned to obtain 5. 5 -mm-high disks, which were assembled in a standard setup for bacterial microleakage studies using Streptococcus mutans. The monitoring lasted 90  days. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed. ResultsThe lowest amount of leaking samples was found in AdheSE and Tetric EvoCeram (31. 3 %), Cavit (33. 3 %), and Excite and Tetric EvoCeram groups (35. 3 %), followed by Fuji II LC (66. 7 %), Voco Clip (83. 3 %). and Fuji IX (88. 2 %) groups. According to the day of microleakage, materials could be classified in three groups with statistically significant differences (P <  0. 05). In the first group were Cavit (70  days), AdheSE and Tetric EvoCeram (68  days), and Excite and Tetric EvoCeram (65  days), in the second group were Voco Clip (44  days) and Fuji II LC (43  days), and in the third group was Fuji IX (21  days). ConclusionNone of the tested materials were able to completely prevent bacterial microleakage. Adhesively bonded composites and Cavit offer better sealing compared with glass ionomer cements, resin modified glass ionomer cements, and composites without the use of an adhesive system...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the clinical, radiographic, and patient-reported outcomes of a 1 -piece alumina-toughened zirconia implant restored with single crowns (SCs) or 3 -unit fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) after 3 y of observation. Forty patients received 53 implants, placed in a 1 -stage operation with immediate <b>temporization.</b> Finally, 50 implants were restored with 24 SCs and 13 FDPs. To evaluate peri-implant bone loss, standardized radiographs were taken at implant insertion, at final restoration delivery, and after 1 and 3 y. Additionally, several soft tissue parameters and patient-reported outcome measures were evaluated. Linear mixed models with random intercept for each patient and patients as clusters were used to compare subgroups. Three patients did not receive a SC due to early implant loss, and 1 patient died. As a result, 36 patients with 49 implants were followed-up for 3 y, giving a cumulative survival rate of 94. 2 %. The average marginal bone loss amounted to 0. 79 mm (SCs, 0. 47 mm; FDPs, 1. 07 mm; P < 0. 001). After the delivery of the final prosthetic restoration, further bone loss was not statistically significant (0. 09 mm; P = 0. 700). Probing depth, clinical attachment level, and modified bleeding index increased significantly at the implant sites, whereas gingival recession decreased significantly. Compared with the pretreatment questionnaires, the patient-reported outcome measures showed a permanently improved perception of function, aesthetics, sense, speech and self-esteem. The survival rate of the investigated ceramic implant system seems to be comparable to reported survival rates of titanium implants when immediately restored. The recorded parameters suggest its potential for clinical utilization...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we present an {{efficient}} decision-making framework allowing optimization via simulation combining metaheuristics algorithms and DEVS formalism. A proposed object-oriented approach provides an universal interface between any existing DEVS models and some existing metaheuristics. To do this we explode the optimization algorithms into several actions {{involved in an}} optimization loop. Concerning the evaluation step which one can find in each metaheuristic we propose to externalize it into decision models using DEVS messages. This interconnection of components generates the following new concepts: (i) event-driven metaheuristic parametrization that allows an automatic execution of the associated algorithm; (ii) creation of dynamic and hydrid metaheuristics used for hard-optimization problems; (iii) decision support variables <b>temporization</b> that allows optimization on a specific time interval. We validated {{the effectiveness of the}} previous concepts through the implementation of the popular genetic algorithms and the more recent harmonic search algorithm. Furthermore the validation is completed on a real case example concerning medical treatment through a simple glycemic DEVS model. Simulation results show that the resulting treatement reduces the risk of over-tratement or under-treatement. 1. INTRODUCTION Modeling and simulation of complex systems are widely used in research and industry in order to study the behavior of systems. These studies include planning, prediction, prevision, computer-aided design, etc. tasks. To improve the performance of a studied system the modeling and simulation phases are integrated with an optimization technique. The simulation allows improving the purposes of a given model. The integration of optimization techniques into modeling and simulation relies on the evolution of the model using decisions based on previous simulation results. Usually a specialist of the domain performs the evolution manually. Therefore, it seems to be natural to try to find the set of parameters that optimizes the system performance...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the survival rate and marginal bone loss (MBL) of zirconia dental implants restored with single crowns or fixed dental prostheses. An electronic search was conducted up to November 2015 (without any restriction regarding the publication time) through the databases MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, and EMBASE to identify randomized controlled clinical trials and prospective clinical trials including > 15 patients. Primary outcomes were survival rate and MBL. Furthermore, {{the influence of}} several covariates on MBL was evaluated. Qualitative assessment and statistical analyses were performed. This review was conducted according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews. With the applied search strategy, 4, 196 titles could be identified. After a screening procedure, 2 randomized controlled clinical trials and 7 prospective clinical trials remained for analyses. In these trials, a total of 326 patients received 398 implants. The follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 mo. Implant loss was mostly reported within the first year, especially within the healing period. Thereafter, nearly constant survival curves could be observed. Therefore, separate meta-analyses were performed {{for the first and}} subsequent years, resulting in an implant survival rate of 95. 6 % (95 % confidence interval: 93. 3 % to 97. 9 %) after 12 mo and, thereafter, an expected decrease of 0. 05 % per year (0. 25 % after 5 y). Additionally, a meta-analysis was conducted for the mean MBL after 12 mo, resulting in 0. 79 mm (95 % confidence interval: 0. 73 to 0. 86 mm). Implant bulk material and design, restoration type, and the application of minor augmentation procedures during surgery, as well as the modes of <b>temporization</b> and loading, had no statistically significant influence on MBL. The short-term cumulative survival rates and the MBL of zirconia implants in the presented systematic review are promising. However, additional data are still needed to confirm the long-term predictability of these implants...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} project takes origin from a cooperation initiative named NEWCOM++ among {{research groups}} to develop 3 G wireless mobile system. This work, in particular, tries to focuse on the communication errors arising on a message signal characterized by working under WiMAX 802. 16 e standard. It {{will be shown}} how this last wireless generation protocol needs a specific flexible instrumentation and why an LDPC error correction code suitable in order to respect the quality restrictions. A chapter will be dedicated to describe, not from a mathematical point of view, the LDPC algorithm theory {{and how it can}} be graphically represented to better organize the decodification process. The main objective of this work is to validate the PHAL-concept when addressing a complex and computationally intensive design like the LDPC encoder/decoder. The expected results should be both conceptual; identifying the lacks on the PHAL concept when addressing a real problem; and second to determine the overhead introduced by PHAL in the implementation of a LDPC decoder. The mission is to build a NoC (Network on Chip) able to perform the same task of a general purpose processor, but in less time and with better efficiency, in terms of component flexibility and throughput. The single element of the network is a basic processor element (PE) formed by the union of two separated components: a special purpose processor ASIP, the responsible of the input data LDPC decoding, and the router component PHAL, checking incoming data packets and scanning the <b>temporization</b> of tasks execution. Supported by a specific programming tool, the ASIP has been completely designed, from the architecture resources to the instruction set, through a language like C. Realized in this SystemC code and converted in VHDL language, it's been synthesized as to fit onto an FPGA of the Xilinx Virtex- 5 family. Although the main purpose regards the making of an application as flexible as possible, a WiMAX-orientated LDPC implemented on a FPGA saves space and resources, choosing the one that best suits the project synthesis. This is because encoders and decoders will have to find room in the communication tools (e. g. modems) as best as possible. The whole network scenary has been mounted through a Linux application, acting as a master element. The entire environment will require the use of VPI libraries and components able to manage the communication protocols and interfacing mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|As principais alterações, agudas e crônicas, provocadas pelo exercício físico aeróbio (EF) sobre o organismo são, de maneira geral, bem conhecidas. No entanto, existe um efeito em {{particular}} do EF que começou a ser elucidado no começo da década de 90, em humanos, que tem a capacidade de alterar a relação temporal do organismo com o meio. A modificação da expressão dos ritmos circadianos, causada pelo EF, qualifica-o como sincronizador dos osciladores biológicos. O principal sincronizador da ritmicidade biológica é o ciclo geofísico claro/escuro. A alternância do dia e da noite, através de diferenças nos níveis de luminosidade, é percebida por meio de vias fóticas pelo sistema de temporização circadiana (STC). Esses estímulos, chamados fóticos, fornecem informações temporais para o STC sincronizando os osciladores biológicos com esse ciclo ambiental. Outros estímulos também são capazes de sincronizá-los e são chamados de sincronizadores não-fóticos. Esta revisão aborda o efeito do EF sobre o sistema de temporização e, ao mesmo tempo, discute as possíveis e prováveis aplicações cronobiológicas dos conhecimentos abordados. O EF pode afetar o STC através de vias não-fóticas, podendo beneficiar a saúde de indivíduos em diversas situações, tais como vôos transmeridianos, trabalhos noturnos e distúrbios do sono. Ressalta-se, também, que devem ser realizados mais estudos no cotidiano das pessoas para compreender melhor a relação entre, e a contribuição dos, diferentes sincronizadores em um contexto real. The main alterations, either acute or chronic, {{caused by}} aerobic physical exercise (PE) {{over the body}} are generally well-known. However, there is a particular effect of PE which started to be elucidated {{in the beginning of}} the 90 's in humans which has the capacity to alter the temporal relationship of the body with the environment. The modification of the expression of the circadian rhythms caused by PE qualifies it as a synchronizer of the biological oscillators. The main synchronizer of the biological rhythm is the light/dark geophysical cycle. The day/night rotation which occurs through differences in the luminosity levels is perceived through photic ways by the CTS. These stimuli, called photic, provide temporal information to the CTS synchronizing hence the biological oscillators to this environmental cycle. Other stimuli are also capable to synchronize them and are called non-photic synchronizers. This review writes about the effect of PE over the <b>temporization</b> system as well as discusses the possible and probable chronobiological applications of the mentioned knowledge. PE may affect the CTS through non-photic ways, being hence able to benefit health of individuals in several situations, such as transmeridian flights, night shift tasks and sleep disturbs. Moreover, we highlight that further studies should be conducted on individuals' routine in order to better understand the relationship between different synchronizers as well as their contribution in a real context...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the use of}} the elicitations in the film entitled The Day After Tomorrow. It is conducted to find out the types of the elicitations employed by the main characters, the way the main characters deliver the elicitations with respect to the participants' statuses and roles, and the reasons why the main characters employ certain elicitations in the film. This research deals with socio-pragmatics approach. It is a descriptive qualitative study, and it employs a purposive sampling as the sampling technique. The data are all the dialogs containing the elicitations, verbal and non-verbal response in the film, which have significant relationship with the problem statements. There are 61 data found in the film. The 61 data having the same characteristics are then reduced by using criterion-based selection. The data are then identified by using Tsui�s theory on elicitations to identify what types of the elicitations are employed by the main characters. The researcher uses SPEAKING formula, Brown and Levinson�s theory of politeness and the theory of intonation to reveal how the main characters employ the elicitations. The researcher also uses Holmes� social dimensions and Fishman�s domain of language use to find out the reasons why the main characters employ the elicitations in the film. The elicitations are an adjacency pair event; therefore, Tsui�s classification of the elicitations� responses is used to analyze the elicitations responses. The result of this research shows that there are five types of the elicitations employed by the main characters. They are elicit: inform (30 data), elicit: confirm (14 data), elicit: agree (7 data), elicit: repeat (1 datum), elicit: clarify (9 data). It is also found that each type of the elicitations is delivered by the main characters in various ways. It is closely related to the intonation and the key �the facial expression and the body language� presented by the participants when they have a conversation. It is found that the responses prospected given by the addressees and the receiver are also various. The responses found in the film are positive verbal response, positive non-verbal response, negative verbal response, and <b>temporization</b> verbal response. The researcher also finds that the appearances of certain types of the elicitations are influenced by some factors. They are the context of situations, the ends of the conversation, the social statuses and roles of the participants, the social dimensions and the domains of language use. The result of this research is expected to give input dealing with {{the use of the}} elicitations and their responses prospected related to the social factors for the students, lecturers, and other researchers. The researcher suggests other researchers who are interested in socio-pragmatics study to conduct a further research on the elicitations and their responses. They may relate it with other social factors such as gender and age. They can also try to conduct a field study to study the use of the elicitations and their responses related with certain social factors in a real life. �...|$|E
