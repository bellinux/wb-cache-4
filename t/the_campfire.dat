Production was smoother on set, and the crew shot scenes ahead of schedule. The crew fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain falls off El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated the forest floor and was rotated ninety degrees.|$|E

This causes Claire (Julie Bowen) to instantly say no for Haley, leading to Dylan running away. The families go off and look for him, during which Haley criticizes Claire for interfering and reveals she would not have accepted Dylan's proposal. It is also revealed that Dylan gets a job at the ranch and decides to permanently stay in Wyoming, breaking up with Haley.|$|E

The duo continued recording intermittently until late 2012, when large parts of the album were recorded. Influenced by film soundtracks from the 1970s, Tomorrow's Harvest features a more downtempo form of ambient music, similar to Boards of Canada's earlier releases.|$|E

The trio returns the monk to his Buddhist temple, where they are encouraged by the head monk to meditate. Alan is able to recall that they had been at the White Lion strip club, where they learn that Stu was sodomized by a kathoey stripper named Kimmy.

25|$|In {{addition}} to summer camps, the camp has also hosted diverse Scouting events. During {{the summer of}} 2006 the camp hosted more than 1,000 youth participants at the greater DC area Cub Scout Jamboree {{in association with the}} Entomological Foundation. On May 3, 2008 the camp hosted more than 4,000 at the council-wide spring camporee, which included a visit from McGruff the Crime Dog. On May 28-29, 2016 the camp hosted the joint Jewish and Islamic Committee on Scouting Annual Camporee. On October 29, 2016 the camp hosted simulations of both an airplane and a school bus crash where volunteer victims acted out fictional injuries for Scouts to practice emergency aid skills. More than 1,000 Scouts and leaders from the Bull Run, Occoquan, Patriot and Sully Districts participated along with representatives from the Amangamek Wipit Lodge, American Red Cross, Asymmetric Warfare Group, Aviation Institute of Maintenance, Cookies and Cream, Fairfax County Sheriff's Office, George Mason Reserve Officers' Training Corps Cadets, Halloween Spirit Store, Lowe's, Outback Steakhouse, Prince William County Department of Fire and Rescue, Prince William County Police Department, Shawn Landry & Quality Business Engineering, and the Virginia Airborne Search and Rescue Squad. From Jan 20, 2017 to Jan 22, 2017 the camp hosted the Sully District annual Klondike Derby which included competitions in: trail cooking, first aid, tomahawk throwing, pioneering, fishing, orienteering, log sawing, fire building, COPE games, a sled race, and a chili cook-off. <b>The</b> <b>campfire</b> show and awards ceremony were provided by arrowmen of the Amangamek-Wipit Lodge.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met Roselle Belline at {{a picnic}} on Chartiers Creek that {{attracted}} many young people from the Canonsburg area.

500|$|Overall, critics lauded Chrono Trigger for its [...] "fantastic yet {{not overly}} complex" [...] story, simple but {{innovative}} gameplay, and high replay value afforded by multiple endings. Online score aggregator GameRankings lists the original Super NES version as the 2nd highest scoring RPG and 24th highest scoring game ever reviewed. In 2009, Guinness World Records listed {{it as the}} 32nd most influential video game in history. Nintendo Power listed the ending to Chrono Trigger {{as one of the}} greatest endings in Nintendo history, due to over a dozen endings that players can experience. Tom Hall drew inspiration from Chrono Trigger and other console games in creating Anachronox, and used <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> scene to illustrate the dramatic depth of Japanese RPGs.|$|E
500|$|Shatner {{scheduled}} <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> {{scenes to}} be the last ones shot, after which the cast and crew had a small celebration before a traditional wrap party later. The cast celebrated the end of filming in the last week of December 1988, and gave a press conference on the set of the Enterprise bridge on December 28. Shatner returned to Paramount Studios a few days after principal photography had wrapped to organize the film's post-production schedule. This included showing a rough cut of the film— minus the special effects— to studio personnel. Shatner recalled that the film received praise and left the screening [...] "reveling" [...] in its reception; {{it turned out to be}} a [...] "momentary victory" [...] once he saw the special effects.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} scenes Asylum was given was the scene {{depicting}} the death of Amanda, in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire. The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland [...] was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag. Instead of creating a computer generated (CGI) model of <b>the</b> <b>campfire,</b> a real campfire was filmed. Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot. Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames. Another composite shot {{is used in the}} scene in which Chelsea is hit by a speedboat. Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of Willa Ford reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect.|$|E

500|$|The miniseries Stakes, which aired {{during the}} show’s seventh season, {{documents}} the reemergence {{of five of}} Marceline’s most powerful vampiric foes: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The quintet remerge after Bubblegum tries to extract Marceline’s vampiric essence, {{in an attempt to}} return Marceline to her normal half-demon state. The reappearance of these vampires forces Marceline, Bubblegum, Finn, Jake, and Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) to stake them one-by-one, although the Vampire King is neutralized through a scientific process that removes the vampiric essence from his body. Later, in the ninth season miniseries Elements, Marceline is temporarily transformed by elemental magic into [...] "Marhsmaline <b>the</b> <b>Campfire</b> Queen"a sentient marshmallow creature. In her candy form, Marceline is gregarious and playful, but a bit naive {{about the nature of the}} new world around her; for instance, when an enraged Flame Princess attacks her, Marceline mistakes the assault for [...] "wrasslin'". At the end of the miniseries, Marceline is returned to her usual self.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] {{was the second}} video Carey's directed. In it, she is the {{seemingly}} happy narrator of a tale of young love, {{as a young boy}} and a girl elope {{in the middle of the}} night. The video was filmed on location at Carey's sponsored charity, the Fresh Air Fund upstate New York camp. The video begins with scenes of Carey on a lakeside tire-swing, smiling and beginning to retell a story of young love. As she sits upon the swing, scenes of two children sneaking out of their bungalow in the middle of the night are shown. They frolic together beside a fireplace, soon coming up to the lakeside swing Carey had been on before. They soon go swimming wearing their clothes, much like Carey did in her video for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] though she does not jump into the water herself this time. As they jump into the water, Carey is then seen by <b>the</b> <b>campfire</b> they passed on their journey to the lake, smiling with friends and enjoying herself by the fire. Eventually the boy and girl are seen kissing underwater. The video concludes with scenes of the young boy and girl walking together back to their bungalow, walking hand-in-hand. Having possibly witnessed the entire event, Carey is seen once again by the large swing, chuckling and staring into the night's sky.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Volcano" [...] {{episode was}} in {{production}} when South Park debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around <b>the</b> <b>campfire,</b> the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an [...] "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized [...] "Volcano" [...] was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song [...] "Kumbaya" [...] around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.|$|E
