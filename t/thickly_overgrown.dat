5|$|Original to the house, and occupying its {{northwest}} terrace {{against its}} service wing, was an Italian garden with vine-clad pergolas on each side, symmetrical gravel paths, marble benches, and long stone balustrades, giving it {{characteristics of a}} hanging garden. The garden was below the house's first floor, and was built against the hillside, occupying {{a portion of the}} slope that falls far below it. The lower walls of the house were screened with a row of large cedars planted on the highest part of the garden. The garden formed an immense rectangular space, and on the four sides of the terrace there were pergolas <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with vines. In the center was a pool and a carved stone fountain imported from Rome. Walks and beds of flowers and shrubbery occupied the rest, visible from the west-facing windows of the house.|$|E
60|$|The woods passed, {{he began}} {{ascending}} a small hill. At {{the top of}} this was a level patch, <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with short brush.|$|E
60|$|It {{was growing}} dark when Bowie called a halt {{on the edge}} of a small {{clearing}} leading up to a hill <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with scrub pines.|$|E
60|$|The man {{lay in the}} {{dry grass}} of a tiny glade that ran down to the tree-fringed bank of the stream. On {{either side of the}} glade was a fence, of the old stake-and-rider type, though little of it was to be seen, so <b>thickly</b> was it <b>overgrown</b> by wild {{blackberry}} bushes, scrubby oaks and young madrono trees. In the rear, a gate through a low paling fence led to a snug, squat bungalow, built in the California Spanish style and seeming to have been compounded directly from the landscape of which it was so justly a part. Neat and trim and modestly sweet was the bungalow, redolent of comfort and repose, telling with quiet certitude of some one that knew, and that had sought and found.|$|R
60|$|For {{three days}} the little cavalcade marched {{slowly through the}} heart of this unknown and untracked forest, until finally, early in the fourth day, they came upon a little spot near the banks of a small river, which seemed less <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> than any ground they had yet encountered.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a strangely}} {{situated}} and strangely built abode. A long low building of deep yellow stone, half hidden by various creepers, and inaccessible {{on the side}} from which they approached it save to foot passengers. From {{the bottom of the}} winding path which they had to climb it seemed to hang almost sheer over the cliff side. A thickly growing patch of stunted pine trees rising abruptly in the background literally overtopped the tiled roof. From the summit of this plantation to the sea was one abrupt precipice, <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> for the first hundred feet or so by pine trees growing out {{from the side of the}} cliff in strange huddled fashion, the haunt of sea birds and a few daring rabbits.|$|E
60|$|This {{was what}} had happened. Just about {{the centre of}} the reef is a large flat-topped rock--it may be twenty feet in the square--known to the Bryngelly {{fishermen}} as Table Rock. In ordinary weather, even at high tide, the waters scarcely cover this rock, but when there is any sea they wash over it with great violence. On to this rock Geoffrey and Beatrice had been hurled by the breaker. Fortunately for them it was <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with seaweed, which to some slight extent broke the violence of their fall. As it chanced, Geoffrey was knocked senseless by the shock; but Beatrice, whose hand he still held, fell on to him and, {{with the exception of a}} few bruises and a shake, escaped unhurt.|$|E
6000|$|The natural {{platform}} {{to which we}} had clambered was <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with brambles, through which we soon discovered {{that it would have}} been impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance. When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if he thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little staggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply. At length he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute attention. When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said, ...|$|E
6000|$|Walter Dene, deacon, in his faultless Oxford {{clerical}} {{coat and}} broad felt hat, strolled along slowly, sunning {{himself as he}} went, after his wont, down the pretty central lane of West Churnside. It was just the idyllic village best suited to the taste of such an idyllic young curate as Walter Dene. There were cottages with low-thatched roofs, <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with yellow stonecrop and pink house-leek; there were trellis-work porches up which the scented dog-rose and the fainter honeysuckle clambered together in sisterly rivalry; there were pargeted gable-ends of Elizabethan farmhouses, quaintly varied with black oak joists and moulded plaster panels. At the end of all, between an avenue of ancient elm trees, the heavy square tower of the old church closed in the little vista--a church with a round Norman doorway and dog-tooth arches, melting into Early English lancets in the aisle, and finishing up with a great Decorated east window by the broken cross and yew tree. Not a trace of Perpendicularity about it anywhere, thank goodness: [...] "for if it were Perpendicular," [...] said Walter Dene to himself often, [...] "I really think, {{in spite of my}} uncle, I should have to look out for another curacy." ...|$|E
60|$|As I stood there, {{trembling}} at {{the thought}} of Herky and his comrades bound hand and foot, the first roar of the forest fire reached my ears. It threatened, but it roused my courage. I jumped as if I had been shot, and clattered down that crag with wings guiding my long leaps. No crevice or jumble of loose stones or steep descent daunted me. I reached the horse, and, grasping the bridle, I started to lead him. We had zigzagged up, we went straight down. Target was too spirited to balk, but he did everything else. More than once he reared with his hoofs high in the air, and, snorting, crashed down. He pulled me off my feet, he pawed at me with his great iron shoes. When we got clear of the roughest and most <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> part of the descent I mounted him. Then I needed no longer to urge him. The fire had entered the canyon, the hollow roar swept up and filled Target with the same fright that possessed me. He plunged down, slid on his haunches, jumped the logs, crashed through brush. I had continually to rein him toward the camp. He wanted to turn from that hot wind and strange roar.|$|E
60|$|From time to {{time his}} horse went through grass, and its dry, {{crackling}} rustle, showing how it would burn, was music to Slone. Gradually the monuments began to loom up, bold and black against the blue sky, with stars seemingly hanging close over them. Slone had calculated that the basin was smaller than it really was, in both length and breadth. This worried him. Wildfire might see or hear or scent him, and make a break back to the pass and thus escape. Slone was glad when the huge, dark monuments were indistinguishable from the black, frowning wall. He had to go slower here, because of the darkness. But at last he reached the slow rise of jumbled rock that evidently marked the extent of weathering on that side. Here {{he turned to the}} right and rode out into the valley. The floor was level and <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with long, dead grass and dead greasewood, as dry as tinder. It was easy to account for the dryness; neither snow nor rain had visited that valley for many months. Slone whipped one of the sticks in the wind and soon had the smoldering end red and showering sparks. Then he dropped the stick in the grass, with curious intent and a strange feeling of regret.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} {{twilight}} {{when the boat}} reached Tadoussac, and ran into a sheltered cove {{under the shadow of}} uplands on which a quaint village perched and dispersed itself on a country road in summer cottages; above these in turn rose loftier heights of barren sand or rock, with here and there a rank of sickly pines dying along their sterility. It had been harsh and cold all day when the boat moved, for it was running full {{in the face of the}} northeast; the river had widened almost to a sea, growing more and more desolate, with a few lonely islands breaking its expanse, and the shores sinking lower and lower till, near Tadoussac, they rose a little in flat-topped bluffs <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with stunted evergreens. Here, into the vast low-walled breadth of the St. Lawrence, a dark stream, narrowly bordered by rounded heights of rock, steals down from the north out of regions of gloomy and ever-during solitude. This is the Saguenay; and in the cold evening light under which the traveller approaches its mouth, no landscape could look more forlorn than that of Tadoussac, where early in the sixteenth century the French traders fixed their first post, and where still the oldest church north of Florida is standing.|$|E
60|$|He nodded {{twice at}} Lakamba sagaciously and gave {{himself up to}} silent musing, his solitary eye fixed {{immovably}} upon the straight wall of forest on the opposite bank. Lakamba lay silent, staring vacantly. Under them Lingard's own river rippled softly amongst the piles supporting the bamboo platform of the little watch-house before which they were lying. Behind the house the ground rose in a gentle swell of a low hill cleared of the big timber, but <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with the grass and bushes, now withered and burnt up in the long drought of the dry season. This old rice clearing, which had been several years lying fallow, was framed on three sides by the impenetrable and tangled growth of the untouched forest, and on the fourth {{came down to the}} muddy river bank. There was not a breath of wind on the land or river, but high above, in the transparent sky, little clouds rushed past the moon, now appearing in her diffused rays with the brilliance of silver, now obscuring her face with the blackness of ebony. Far away, {{in the middle of the}} river, a fish would leap now and then with a short splash, the very loudness of which measured the profundity of the overpowering silence that swallowed up the sharp sound suddenly.|$|E
60|$|He went {{straight}} to Isabel Temple's grave in the remote shore field of his farm. Isabel Temple had lived and died eighty years ago. She had been very lovely, very wilful, very fond of playing with the hearts of men. She had married William Temple, the brother of his great-grandfather, and as she stood in her white dress beside her bridegroom, {{at the conclusion of}} the wedding ceremony, a jilted lover, crazed by despair, had entered the house and shot her dead. She had been buried in the shore field, where a square space had been dyked off in the centre for a burial lot because the church was then so far away. With the passage of years the lot had grown up so thickly with fir and birch and wild cherry that it looked like a compact grove. A winding path led through it to its heart where Isabel Temple's grave was, <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with long, silken, pale green grass. Roger hurried along the path and sat down on the big grey boulder by the grave, looking about him with a long breath of delight. How lovely--and witching--and unearthly it was here. Little ferns were growing in the hollows and cracks of the big boulder where clay had lodged. Over Isabel Temple's crooked, lichened gravestone hung a young wild cherry in its delicate bloom. Above it, in a little space of sky left by the slender tree tops, was a young moon. It was too dark here after all to read Wordsworth, but that did not matter. The place, with its moist air, its tang of fir balsam, was like a perfumed room where a man might dream dreams and see visions. There was a soft murmur of wind in the boughs over him, and the faraway moan of the sea on the bar crept in. Roger surrendered himself utterly to the charm of the place. When he entered that grove, he had left behind the realm of daylight and things known and come into the realm of shadow and mystery and enchantment. Anything might happen--anything might be true.|$|E
6000|$|Poor St. Clare! If {{she could}} look back, with the {{thoughts}} and interests of the days of her mortality, {{to the world that}} she has quitted for ever, how sadly would she now contemplate the Holy Well which was once hallowed in her name and for her sake! But one arched wall, <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with ivy, still remains erect in the place that the old Oratory occupied. Fragments of its roof, its cornices, and the mouldings of its windows lie scattered on the ground, half hidden by the grasses and ferns twining prettily around them. A double cross of stone stands, sloping towards the earth, at a little distance off--soon perhaps to share the fate of the prostrate ruins about it. How changed the scene here, since the time when the rural christening procession left the church, to proceed down the quiet pathway to the Holy Well--when children were baptized in the pure spring; and vows were offered up under the roof of the Oratory, and prayers were repeated before the sacred cross! These were the pious usages of a past age; these were the ceremonies of an ancient church, whose innocent and reverent custom it was to connect closer together the beauty of Nature and the beauty of Religion, by such means as the consecration of a spring, or the erection of a roadside cross. There has been something of sacrifice as well as of glory, in the effort by which we, in our time, have freed ourselves from what was superstitious and tyrannical in the faith of the times of old--it has cost us the loss of much of the better part of that faith which was not superstition, and of more which was not tyranny. The spring of St. Clare is nothing to the cottager of our day but a place to draw water from; the village lads now lounge whistling on the fallen stones, once the consecrated arches under which their humble ancestors paused on the pilgrimage, or knelt in prayer. Wherever the eye turns, all around it speaks the melancholy language of desolation and decay--all but the water of the Holy Well. Still the little pool remains the fitting type of its patron saint--pure and tranquil as in the bygone days, when the name of St. Clare was something more than the title to a village legend, and the spring of St. Clare something better than a sight for the passing tourist among the Cornish moors.[1] ...|$|E
5000|$|The Irish name Muineachán {{derives from}} a {{diminutive}} plural {{form of the}} Irish word muine meaning [...] "brake" [...] (a <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> area) or sometimes [...] "hillock". Patrick Weston Joyce interpreted this as [...] "a place full of little hills or brakes". Monaghan County Council's preferred interpretation is [...] "land of the little hills", {{a reference to the}} numerous drumlins in the area.|$|E
5000|$|Oakley's {{original}} {{name was}} [...] "Oak Creek", {{derived from the}} name of a creek that ran just east of the present town site and that was <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with oak trees.

5000|$|Atop {{the tall}} hill {{on the west}} side of the parade ground were two more stations. In 1944, a single-story {{concrete}} bunker was built to house base end station #1 for Battery McCook.

Today, the structure is <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with trees and brush, but during World War II controlled burns kept the brow of the hill clear of obstructions.|$|E
50|$|The secluded sunken lane {{that runs}} from Haslemere past Aldworth is named Tennyson's Lane {{in memory of the}} poet. It is little changed from Arthur Paterson's {{description}} in 1905: Trees meet overhead, copsewood surrounds it, and later, it is hedged by high sandy banks <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with plant and scrub; squirrels and rabbits, and all other small woodland creatures, disport themselves over it. It twists and turns, and to the stranger appears to lead nowhere in particular.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the term}} neck bridge {{is also used}} for other types of castle, {{where there is a}} deep, dry moat on one or two sides, whilst the other sided are {{protected}} by inaccessible terrain. For example, a ditch may be cut across the neck of a spit or peninsula {{in the case of a}} lowland castle that is otherwise surrounded by water. Many old neck ditches have since become <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> and may only be made out with some difficulty.|$|E
50|$|Florida Bog Frogs occupy {{sluggish}} backwaters and seepages {{associated with}} clear, sand-bottomed streams. They prefer relatively open mucky {{areas that are}} thickly vegetated with low-lying herbaceous plant species, and are especially fond of areas dominated by sphagnum. The structure of their preferred microhabitats are maintained by the regular intrusion of fire and they will abandon habitats that become <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown</b> with woody shrubs. Suppression of hot summer fires that enter wooded stream bottoms {{has led to the}} loss and degradation of much of the species' historic breeding habitat.|$|E
50|$|On {{the south}} side of the parking lot is the First Day School building. It is a smaller timber frame gable-roofed {{structure}} with the same siding and color treatment as the meeting house. Since it was built on the site of the meeting's stable in the 1970s, it is considered a non-contributing resource to the property's historic character.Conversely, the cemetery, rising up the hillside to the west, is considered a contributing site. Its graves, some of which are <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown,</b> date from the late 18th century when the meeting was established to the present. The oldest with an identifiable name on its marker is that of Eugent Weeks, who died in 1805. Early markers are of sandstone, giving way to marble for later burials.|$|E

5000|$|The trio is journeying to Dread Mountain {{when they}} come across a spring. Although {{initially}} distrustful of its contents, they drink {{the water out of}} thirst, noting a nearby sign saying: [...] "Drink, gentle stranger, and welcome. All of evil will beware." [...] and several oddly shaped rocks encircling the spring. They decided to take a rest there and Lief awakens to find one of the [...] "rocks" [...] unfurling. It reveals itself to be a mammalian flying creature called the Kin, which most Deltorans believe to be extinct. It explains to Lief that the water from the spring makes one dream of whomever one is thinking of during ingestion. It also has a deadly, paralyzing effect on [...] "those with evil intent".The three head to Dread Mountain {{with the help of the}} Kin, landing there only to find the mountain <b>thickly</b> <b>overgrown,</b> deserted of its inhabitants, the Dread gnomes, and overrun by beasts. However, the companions find the entrance into the Mountain, and after avoiding the numerous traps the gnomes have set up to repel invaders, it was discovered that there is a monstrous toad named Gellick that was controlling the gnomes. The trio makes a bargain with the head of the gnomes to rid Gellick for them in return for freedom and the emerald that was studded onto Gellick the giant frog's head. The fight ends with Lief tossing water from the Dreaming Spring into Gellick's mouth, as it uses the deadly, paralyzing effect. The gnomes thank Lief by making peace with their longtime prey, the Kin, and agreeing to hamper the progress of their common enemy, the Shadow Lord in finding the trio. The companions then continue their journey to The Maze of the Beast.|$|E
