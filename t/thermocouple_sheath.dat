40|$|A self-verifying {{temperature}} sensor that employs advanced contact thermocouple probe technology was {{tested in a}} laboratory-scale, joule-heated, refractory-lined glass melter used for radioactive waste vitrification. The novel temperature probe monitors melt temperature at any given level of the melt chamber. The data acquisition system provides the real-time temperature for molten glass. Test {{results indicate that the}} self-verifying sensor is more accurate and reliable than classic platinum/rhodium <b>thermocouple</b> and <b>sheath</b> assemblies.

40|$|Some {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in the design and fabrication of blackbody sensors (BBSs) used to measure the temperature of a heater core in a vacuum furnace. Each BBS consists of a ring of thermally conductive, high-melting-temperature material with two tantalum-sheathed thermocouples attached at diametrically opposite points. The name "blackbody sensor" reflects the basic principle of operation. Heat is transferred between the ring and the furnace heater core primarily by blackbody radiation, heat is conducted through the ring to the thermocouples, and the temperature of the ring (and, hence, the temperature of the heater core) is measured by use of the thermocouples. Two main requirements have guided the development of these BBSs: (1) The rings should have as high an emissivity as possible in order to maximize the heat-transfer rate and thereby maximize temperature-monitoring performance and (2) the thermocouples must be joined to the rings in such a way as to ensure long-term, reliable intimate thermal contact. The problem of fabricating a BBS to satisfy these requirements is complicated by an application-specific prohibition against overheating and thereby damaging nearby instrumentation leads through the use of conventional furnace brazing or any other technique that involves heating the entire BBS and its surroundings. The problem is further complicated by another application-specific prohibition against damaging the thin tantalum <b>thermocouple</b> <b>sheaths</b> through the use of conventional welding to join the thermocouples to the ring. The first BBS rings were made of graphite. The tantalum-sheathed thermocouples were attached to the graphite rings by use of high-temperature graphite cements. The ring/thermocouple bonds thus formed were found to be weak and unreliable, and so graphite rings and graphite cements were abandoned. Now, each BBS ring is made from one of two materials: either tantalum or a molybdenum/titanium/zirconium alloy. The tantalum-sheathed thermocouples are bonded to the ring by laser brazing. The primary advantage of laser brazing over furnace brazing is that in laser brazing, it is possible to form a brazed connection locally, without heating nearby parts to the flow temperature of the brazing material. Hence, it is possible to comply with the prohibition against overheating nearby instrumentation leads. Also, in laser brazing, unlike in furnace brazing, it is possible to exert control over the thermal energy to such a high degree that it becomes possible to braze the thermocouples to the ring without burning through the thin tantalum <b>sheaths</b> on the <b>thermocouples.</b> The brazing material used in the laser brazing process is a titanium-boron paste. This brazing material can withstand use at temperatures up to about 1, 400 C. In thermal-cycling tests performed thus far, no debonding between the rings and thermocouples has been observed. Emissivity coatings about 0. 001 in. (. 0. 025 mm) thick applied to the interior surfaces of the rings have been found to improve the performance of the BBS sensors by raising the apparent emissivities of the rings. In thermal-cycling tests, the coatings were found to adhere well to the rings...|$|R
40|$|The {{instability}} sometimes {{encountered in}} metal-sheathed noble metal thermo-couples used {{for long periods}} at tem-peratures above 1300 °C is attributable to the presence within the sheath of mixed plat inum and rhodium oxide vapours f r o m which the pure plat inum limb can take up rhodium. Such instability can be avoided by removing residual air from the sheath and substi-tuting a n inert gas before the assembly i s hermetically sealed. Couples sheathed and sealed u p in this way have thermo-electric stabilities {{comparable to those of}} the normal unsheathed thermocouple where natural convection prevents the accumulation of dangerous concentra-tions of rhodium oxide vapour. I n the absence of oxygen, the deleterious e$ects of rhodium metal vapour migration upon the thermoelectric output of these devices can be reduced to negligible levels by suitably selecting the alloys from which the <b>thermocouple</b> and its <b>sheath</b> are constructed.

40|$|During {{irradiation}} {{tests at}} high temperature, failure of commercial Inconel 600 sheathed thermocouples is commonly encountered. To understand and remediate this problem, out-ofpile tests were performed with thermocouples in carburizing atmospheres {{which can be}} assumed {{to be at least}} locally representative for High Temperature Reactors. The objective was to screen those thermocouples which would consecutively be used under irradiation. Two such screening tests have been performed with a set of thermocouples embedded in graphite (mainly conventional Type N thermocouples and <b>thermocouples</b> with innovative <b>sheaths)</b> in a dedicated furnace with helium flushing. Performance indicators such as thermal drift, insulation and loop resistance were monitored and compared to those from conventional Type N thermocouples. Several parameters were investigated: niobium sleeves, bending, thickness, sheath composition, temperature as well as the chemical environment. After the tests, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) examinations were performed to analyze possible local damage in wires and in the sheath. The present paper describes the two experiments, summarizes results and outlines further work, in particular to further analyze the findings and to select suitable thermocouples for qualification under irradiation.

40|$|Abstract. The steam {{generators}} at Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) nuclear power {{stations in the}} UK are potentially life-limiting components. Enhancing the capability to monitor the {{steam generators}} {{has been identified as}} having the potential to provide key evidence in justifying the extension of the generating lifetime of the stations. It has been proposed to install new temperature measuring instrumentation to monitor reactor gas temperature and to provide additional data regarding steam generator operating conditions. The modification will be to introduce thermocouples to the bore of an intact steam generator tube to facilitate temperature measurement at or near to the locations of interest. The modified steam generator tube will be sealed at the feed header upstand. Between the upper surface of the superheater header tubeplate and the wall of the superheater header, the <b>thermocouple</b> bundle and <b>sheath</b> will be contained within a rigid stainless steel guide tube. The guide tube will be attached at both ends by welds, each forming a pressure boundary. At the tubeplate a weld will separate the bore of the sealed guide tube from the steam space within the superheater header; a weld between the guide tube and the superheater header will separate the steam space within the superheater header from atmosphere outside the header. In order to obtain a better design, three 3 -dimentional finite element models have been created using ABAQUS. A series of cyclic pressure, and start-up and shutdown thermal transient stress analyses have been carried out to provide stress values for structural integrity assessments to be conducted using ASME III, Subsection NH and R 5. 1...|$|R
40|$|During {{irradiation}} {{tests at}} high temperature failure of commercial Inconel 600 sheathed thermocouples is commonly encountered. As instrumentation, in particular thermocouples are considered safety-relevant both for irradiation tests and for commercial reactors, JRC and THERMOCOAX {{joined forces to}} solve this issue by performing out-of-pile tests with thermocouples mimicking the environment encountered by high temperature reactor (HTR) in-core instrumentation. The objective was to screen innovative sheathed thermocouples which would consecutively be tested under irradiation. Two such screening tests have been performed in high temperature environment (i. e. temperature in the range 1100 – 1150 ◦C) with purposely contaminated helium atmosphere (mainly CH 4, CO, CO 2, O 2 impurities) representative for high temperature reactor carburizing atmospheres. The first set of thermocouples embedded in graphite (mainly conventional N type thermocouples and <b>thermocouples</b> with innovative <b>sheaths)</b> was tested in a dedicated furnace at THERMOCOAX lab with helium flushing. The second out-of-pile test at JRC with a partly different set of thermocouples replicated the original test for comparison. Performance indicators such as thermal drift, insulation resistance and loop resistance were monitored. Through these long-term screening tests the effect of several parameters were investigated: niobium sleeves, bending, diameter, sheath composition as well as the chemical environment. SEM examinations were performed to analyze local damage (bending zone, sheath). The present paper describes the two tests, sums up data collected during these tests in terms of thermocouple behavior and describes further instrumentation testing work with fixed point mini cells for qualification under irradiation.

40|$|AbstractHot strip leaving from {{finishing}} roll is quenched {{from about}} 850 to 500 °Cby array of laminar jets on cooling table (Run-Out-Table). Cooling temperature {{control of the}} hot strip is important to obtain better mechanical strength and grain size. However, the cooling process includes unstable transition boiling region as well as moving boundary problem due to relative movement between the hot strip and the jets. To improve quality of hot strip deeper understanding about laminar jet quenching process on the moving hot surface should be elucidated. In this study, single laminar jet quenching tests on a rotating hollow hot cylinder mounted horizontally have been conducted to understand characteristics of transient heat transfer and wetting phenomena. The experiments were done for 18 - 8 stainless steel (SUS 304) hollow cylinder (O. D. 136 mm, I. D. 116 mm, W 150 mm) under rotational speed ranged from 15 to 60 rpm, cooling water temperature ranged from 10 to 60 °C (corresponding degree of subcooling 40 - 90 K) and flow rate ranged from 6 to 23 L/min. Surface temperature and surface heat flux on the rotating cylinder were estimated from two <b>sheath</b> <b>thermocouples</b> embedded at two depths from the outer surface with one dimensional inverse heat conduction analysis. Visual observations over the top surface were done with two normal speed video cameras which were synchronized with rotating cylinder temperature recording. The observation results showed that unstable wetted area was gradually growing from the stagnation area and finally the wetted area became continuous around the circumference of the cylinder. It {{was found that the}} growth and shape of the wetted area were strongly affected by the liquid temperature and the liquid flow rate. Wetted front which is the boundary between wetted and dry areas repeated advance and recession. Since the wetting area propagated faster in the rotational direction, the shape of the wetted area was asymmetry on the hot surface. The liquid film flow was completely splashed out due to violent nucleate boiling on the wetted front line. The characteristics of local transient heat transfer were evaluated with boiling curves taken around the stagnation point. The boiling curves indicated shift to much higher wall superheat as compared with a steady state pool boiling curve and those were categorized into three regions such as 1) single phase heat transfer, boiling heat transfer and 3) transition boiling by inspecting gradient of the boiling curves and the observation of the boiling situations. The transition boiling region disappeared and the single phase heat transfer became dominant for higher subcooling and higher flow rate conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were performed to investigate and compare the heat transfer characteristics of a catalyst bed both during the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reaction and with heating but without a reaction. Two reactors of different dimensions were used in this study. The first one was a laboratory scale reactor with a diameter of 23 mm and length of 300 mm, and the second was a bench scale reactor with a 50 mm diameter and 1 000 mm length. Three materials, namely SiO 2, TiO 2, and SiC were chosen as supports for the cobalt catalyst in the laboratory experiments. These supports were chosen because they have very different thermal conductivity characteristics, and hence could offer {{a wide range of}} heat transfer properties in the catalyst bed. In order to measure the experimental data accurately, the researcher designed and set up the reactor systems carefully. Three thin <b>thermocouples</b> with <b>sheaths</b> were placed at different radial positions in the bed. Each thermocouple could slide {{up and down in the}} sheath and in this way measure the temperature profile axially, at a fixed radius. Two stainless steel sieve plates were placed at either end of the catalyst bed to prevent any radial shifting of the thermocouples. The placement of three heating zones along the reactor ensured a flat axial temperature profile throughout the reactor under both non-reaction and non-heating conditions. This was especially important in the catalytic bed to ensure that any temperature gradient measured was the result of reaction or of heating, rather than unequal heat input along the reactor by the reactor wall heaters. Two sets of heat transfer experiments for each catalyst were carried out in the laboratory scale reactor, namely a set with FT reacting conditions and a set without. In the first set of experiments, the catalyst bed was run under typical low-temperature FTS conditions (P = 20 bar(g), reactor wall temperature Twall = 190 - 240 oC, space velocity SV = 0. 9 - 2. 25 NL/h/gcat) with syngas feed (H 2 /CO = 2); while in the second set an inert gas, N 2, was fed to the bed and a heater in the centre of the reactor was used to generate a controlled variable heat output across the catalyst bed. The radial temperature profiles at different radii in the bed were measured in both cases for varying flow rates and reactor wall temperatures. Simple radial heat transfer models were derived for these two sets of experiments, and the effective thermal conductivity coefficients of the catalyst bed were estimated. Comparisons of the results showed that there were considerable differences between both the values of the coefficients and the shape of the temperature profiles in the reaction and non-reaction cases. The effective thermal conductivity coefficient when FT reaction took place was up to three times higher than that obtained when a heater was used as the heat source. In order to test the hypothesis that liquid in the bed might change its heat transfer characteristics, the reactor operation was switched from reacting to non-reacting conditions, and the effective thermal conductivity post-reaction was measured over a period of up to two weeks. The measurements showed that the effective thermal conductivity gradually reduced from the value recorded under reaction conditions to that found in the reduced catalyst bed. These results suggest that the liquid formed by the FT reaction may play an important role in affecting the heat transfer characteristics of the catalyst bed. The effective thermal conductivity was further correlated with the chain growth probability,. In addition to the heat transfer experiments, the researcher also investigated and compared the performance of the three catalysts. It should be noted that the FT reaction was actually run under non-isothermal conditions when it was conducted in the large diameter (bench scale) reactor. The reaction rate and product selectivity as a function of operating conditions were recorded and discussed. In the heat transfer experiments carried out in the bench scale reactor, syngas produced from biomass was used as the feed, and the heat transfer experiments were performed with FT reaction only. The size of the catalyst used was 2 - 4 mm, instead of 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm (which was the case in the laboratory scale reactor). The temperature distribution and the effective thermal conductivity as well as the performance of the catalyst were discussed, and these results were also compared with those derived from the laboratory scale reactor...|$|R
