5|$|The age for officer {{candidates}} {{was between}} 20 and 50; {{they had to}} have a college degree, or <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> college and <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> professional or business experience. The enlisted age requirements were between 20 and 36; candidates had to have completed at least <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> high school. For the most part, SPARS were white, but five African-Americans did eventually serve. The agreement between the U.S. Navy and the USCG required that officer candidates receive their indoctrination training at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts. But in June 1943, the USCG withdrew from the agreement, and the indoctrination of SPAR officer candidates was transferred to the USCG Academy at New London, Connecticut. Most SPAR officers were general duty officers, but some officers received specialized training.|$|E

5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E
