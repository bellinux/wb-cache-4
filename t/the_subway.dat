5|$|During July 2017, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed who has {{control of}} <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system. Cuomo claimed that since <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system {{was owned by}} New York City and leased to the MTA, the city had {{to pay more for}} its capital needs. However, de Blasio argued that his large $2.5 billion {{contribution}} was enough.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Severnside Community Rail Partnership began a {{comprehensive}} scheme {{to improve the}} station. The work included removing foliage from the platforms, new lighting and artwork for <b>the</b> <b>subway,</b> community display panels and the installation of help points. <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> artwork came third in the arts category at the 2011 Community Rail Awards.|$|E

50|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Bach in <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> Day 2014, Henderson was contacted by amateur and professional musicians {{as well as}} musical organizations in Seattle, Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore, and cities in Germany, all interested in organizing Bach in <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> Day in their cities. In addition Henderson and organizers in Seattle began a global email outreach campaign to invite musicians across the world to join Bach in <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> Day 2015. On March 21, 2015, Johann Sebastian Bach’s 330th birthday, thousands of musicians in 130 cities in 40 countries participated in the fifth Bach in <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> Day.|$|R
5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop waits for <b>the</b> <b>subway,</b> alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train {{and the police}} officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|In Elmhurst, the {{destruction}} of {{almost all of the}} century-old buildings {{in the heart of the}} village were destroyed for the construction of <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b> Land was taken on the west side of the Broadway to avoid the demolition of the Saint James Episcopal Church and the Reformed Church. Many nineteenth century residences and the Wandowenock Fire Company buildings had to be torn down. To allow <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> line to curve into Queens Boulevard from Broadway, the northeast corner of the two streets was removed, in addition to some stores and an old Presbyterian chapel. New buildings were built behind a new curb line once <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> was completed, bringing a new face to Elmhurst. The introduction of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> stimulated local growth in Elmhurst. Commercial buildings and apartment houses replaced existing structures.|$|E
5|$|Located {{underneath}} <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> station terminal {{is a set}} of {{bus stops}} on Stillwell Avenue and Mermaid Avenue that make up a bus terminal for four New York City Bus lines. The bus terminal provides easier transfer to <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> and bus connections. One additional bus line is located near the station complex.|$|E
50|$|While {{beginning}} work on Bach in <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> Day 2014, Henderson {{was approached}} by Los Angeles-based classical music enthusiast and photographer Jeehyun Lee, who was interested in organizing Bach in <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> Day in Los Angeles. This {{was the first time}} an organizer other than Henderson worked on Bach in <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> Day, and marked the beginning of an inflection point in the growth of the movement. Bach in <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> Day 2014 was joined by 77 musicians in 12 cities in 4 countries, including 22 performers organized by Lee in Los Angeles, and a quartet of three cellos and a tuba on a moving subway train in Taipei. It was the first year a Bach in <b>the</b> <b>Subways</b> website offered Google map pins and listings for all the performances.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Subways</b> {{name comes}} from a time when Lunn, Morgan and Cooper used to hang around <b>the</b> local <b>subway</b> {{underpass}} which ran underneath a Welwyn Garden City roundabout.|$|R
5|$|Previously a {{grade-level}} intersection, the underpass {{was constructed}} simultaneously with <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> station costing $250,000. The {{construction of the}} underpass with a subway station underneath was a massive undertaking. Three levels were required {{in order for the}} underpass and <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> station to be built. The upper level that was built was Queens Boulevard, which carries traffic east and west. The second level is an underpass that carries four lanes of Union Turnpike (and now also the Jackie Robinson Parkway) under the Boulevard. The tunnel is in between the two mezzanines and it would rest atop the roof of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> station platform.|$|E
5|$|Riders pay {{a single}} fare to enter <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system and may {{transfer}} between trains {{at no extra cost}} until they exit via station turnstiles; the fare is a flat rate {{regardless of how}} far or how long the rider travels. Thus, riders must swipe their MetroCard upon entering <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system, but not a second time upon leaving.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{extensively}} reconstructed {{in the early}} 2000s, undergoing a $50 million overhaul to connect <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> station to the new AirTrain JFK. The project was designed by STV Group and financed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. During {{the reconstruction of the}} station, the original subway platforms were demolished and temporary platforms were erected in the center trackways while the new platforms and mezzanine were built. During off-peak hours, trains utilized a single track. The AirTrain structure around the station was completed in 2001, and the AirTrain station opened on December 17, 2003, at which time the shuttle bus was discontinued. The transfer was popular, with 4 million people transferring between <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> and the AirTrain from 2003 to 2007. The AirTrain was designed with the same track height and track gauge as those of <b>the</b> <b>subway,</b> to facilitate a future extension of <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> over the AirTrain system.|$|E

5|$|Access {{between the}} {{platforms}} is via a subway with ramps {{at the west}} end of the platforms, although the station is not considered completely accessible as the ramps are steeper than 1 in 12. <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> exits onto Fraser Street, which is the sole entrance to the station. <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> is decorated with murals painted by local schoolchildren, reflecting the history and culture of Bristol.|$|E

5|$|Many {{stations}} in <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system have mezzanines. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and {{proceed to the}} correct platform without having {{to cross the street}} before entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system. In many older stations, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E
