40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzes}} the potential impacts {{of changes in}} temperature due to climate change on the U. S. power sector, measuring the energy, environmental, and economic impacts of power system changes due to temperature changes under two emissions trajectories—with and without emissions mitigation. It estimates the impact of temperature change on heating and cooling degree days, electricity demand, and generating unit output and efficiency. These effects are then integrated into a dispatch and capacity planning model to estimate impacts on investment decisions, emissions, system costs, and power prices for 32 U. S. regions. Without mitigation actions, <b>total</b> annual <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> costs in 2050 are projected to increase 14 % ($ 51 billion) because of greater cooling demand as compared to a control scenario without future temperature changes. For a scenario with global emissions mitigation, including a reduction in U. S. power sector emissions of 36 % below 2005 levels in 2050, the increase in <b>total</b> annual <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> costs is approximately {{the same as the}} increase in system costs to satisfy the increased demand associated with unmitigated rising temperatures...|$|R

50|$|In 2008, {{the world}} <b>total</b> of <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> was 20,279 terawatt-hours (TWh) or 20.279 petawatt-hours (PWh).

The total energy needed to produce this power is roughly a factor 2 to 3 higher because a power plant's efficiency of generating electricity is roughly 30-50%.

40|$|We {{develop a}} stylized {{application}} of a new evolutionary model to study an energy transition in <b>electricity</b> <b>production.</b> The framework describes a population of boundedly rational electricity producers who decide each period on the allocation of profits among different energy technologies. They tend to invest in below-average cost energy technologies, while also devoting {{a small fraction of}} profits to alternative technological options and research on recombinant innovation. Energy technologies are characterized by costs falling with cumulative investments. Without the latter, new technologies have no chance to become cost competitive. We study the conditions under which a new energy technology emerges and technologies coexist. In addition, we determine which investment heuristics are optimal in the sense of minimizing the <b>total</b> cost of <b>electricity</b> <b>production.</b> This is motivated by the idea that, while diversity contributes to system adaptability (innovation) and resilience to unforeseen contingencies (keeping options open), a high cost will discourage investments in it. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
