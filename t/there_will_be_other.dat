5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E
25|$|The law {{provides}} that a by-election need only {{be called in}} a GRC if all the MPs in the constituency vacate their seats. It {{has been argued that}} the law should be amended, otherwise electors living in a GRC where a vacancy has arisen will lack parliamentary representation, and with a missing MP the remaining MPs may find it difficult to deal with constituency matters. Also, if the MP who vacates his or her seat is from a minority community and the seat is not filled, this would defeat the purpose of the GRC scheme which is to ensure a minimum level of minority representation in Parliament. In response, the Government has said that the other MPs of the GRC continue to represent the electors and should be able to handle constituency matters without any problems. Moreover, the loss of one minority MP in a GRC should not make much difference in practice as <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> minority MPs in Parliament.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} several vocal {{tracks for}} a possible new Simon & Garfunkel album, Simon decided to adopt it as his own solo album. Garfunkel refused to learn the songs {{in the studio and}} would not give up his longstanding cannabis and cigarette habits despite Simon's requests. An official spokesperson remarked, [...] "Paul simply felt the material he wrote is so close to his own life {{that it had to be}} his own record. Art was hoping to be on the album, but I'm sure <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> projects that they will work on together. They are still friends." [...] The material was later released on Simon's 1983 effort Hearts and Bones. Another rift opened between the duo when the lengthy recording of Simon's 1986 album Graceland prevented Garfunkel from working with Roy Halee on a Christmas album. In 1990, the duo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Garfunkel thanked his partner, calling him [...] "the person who most enriched my life by putting those songs through me," [...] to which Simon responded, [...] "Arthur and I agree about almost nothing. But it's true, I have enriched his life quite a bit." [...] After three songs, the duo left without speaking. In August 1991 Simon staged his own concert in Central Park, which was released a few months later. Art Garfunkel had offered to lend his friend a hand in creating another park reunion in which Simon declined, leading the concert as a solo act.|$|E

2500|$|Publicly, The Green Room was Truffaut's biggest {{financial}} failure {{but one of}} {{his most}} critically praised films. One major French film critic, François Chalais of Le Figaro, disliked the film, but Truffaut received high praise elsewhere. Pascal Bonitzer viewed the film as [...] "most profound, and without much exaggeration, {{one of the most beautiful}} French films of recent years," [...] and that [...] "it is not for nothing that Truffaut embodies his character, and that in the latter, Julien Davenne, the author and the actor are entwined in the tightest possible way...rarely does a filmmaker involve himself to that point - involving his body (and note all the ambiguity of the word in the context of this funeral film) and even his dead; mixing together Julien Davenne's dead with those of François Truffaut in the flaming chapel where the film comes to an end." [...] Joel Magny called Julien Davenne the ultimate [...] "truffaldian" [...] hero, [...] "unable to live the present moment in the fullness of his being, where he is...in a perpetual time-lag with reality." [...] The French magazine Télérama called Davenne [...] "l'homme qui aimait les flammes" [...] ("the man who loves the flames"). Jean-Louis Bory of Le Nouvel Observateur said that [...] "In its simple and pure line, it resembles a cinematic testament. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> Truffaut films, but none that will ever be more intimate, more personal, more wrenching than this Green Room, altar of the dead." ...|$|E
