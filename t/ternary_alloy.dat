Numerical {{simulations}} of phase separation in Fe-Cr-Mo and Fe-Cr-Ti <b>ternary</b> <b>alloys</b> and Fe-Cr-Mo-Ti quaternary alloys were performed {{with use of}} the Cahn-Hilliard equation for <b>ternary</b> <b>alloys</b> and quaternary alloys.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>ternary</b> <b>alloying</b> elements Cu, Mg and Fe on the Al-Si eutectic microstructure is investigated using a commercial purity Al- 10 wt%Si alloy in unmodified and Sr-modified conditions. A change in the Al-Si eutectic microstructure {{was associated with a}} change in the nucleation density of the eutectic grains caused by the addition of <b>ternary</b> <b>alloying</b> elements. When the <b>ternary</b> <b>alloying</b> element addition resulted in an increase in the eutectic nucleation frequency, a fibrous to flake-like transition was observed within the eutectic grain. When the <b>ternary</b> <b>alloying</b> element addition decreased the eutectic nucleation frequency significantly, a change in the eutectic morphology from flake-like to a mixture of flake-like and fibrous morphologies was observed. The mechanism of Al-Si eutectic modification is discussed. The growth velocity of the eutectic grain - liquid interface and the constitutional driving force available for growth are proposed as important parameters that influence the degree of eutectic modification in Al-Si alloys.

50|$|The term alloy {{is used to}} {{describe}} a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. The primary metal is called the base, the matrix, or the solvent. The secondary constituents are often called solutes. If there {{is a mixture of}} only two types of atoms (not counting impurities) such as a copper-nickel alloy, then it is called a binary alloy. If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a <b>ternary</b> <b>alloy.</b> An alloy with four constituents is a quaternary alloy, while a five-part alloy is termed a quinary alloy. Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a system. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a binary system, while all of the alloy combinations possible with a <b>ternary</b> <b>alloy,</b> such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ternary system.|$|E
