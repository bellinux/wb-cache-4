5|$|In 2003, Norwegian {{authorities}} {{decided to}} extend its operations in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station. By then, Norway was the only country with a territorial claim to Antarctica to not have an all-year research station on the continent. Construction was carried out from December 2004 through February 2005. To ease logistics, Norway took the initiative to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline <b>transport</b> <b>costs.</b> The permanent Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005.|$|E

40|$|A paradox in {{international}} trade is that multilateral trade liberalisation has resulted in increases in both the volume of world trade {{and the amount of}} foreign direct investment (FDI). This note presents a Cournot duopoly model with two regions, each consisting of two countries, and with an inter-regional <b>transport</b> <b>cost.</b> It is shown that multilateral trade liberalisation may lead firms to switch from exporting to undertaking export-platform FDI when the interregional <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> is high. Also, when the inter-regional <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> is high, the switch to FDI leads to an increase in the volume of world trade in this industry.

40|$|Location of {{upstream}} and {{downstream industries}} This paper studies the issue of agglomeration versus fragmentation of vertically related industries. While the downstream industry works under perfect competition, the upstream industry is a duopoly where each firm supplies a differentiated input to the competitive firms. These process the inputs under a quadratic production function entailing decreasing returns as in PENG, THISSE and WANG (2006). It is found that fragmentation occurs if the <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> of final goods is medium to high, while the <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> of inputs is low. Otherwise, agglomeration prevails. Multiple agglomerated equilibria are possible if the <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> of intermediate goods is either medium or high...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a simplified analytical procedure for determining the optimal timing for upgrading low-volume roads in developing countries. Most roadway upgradings from gravel to surface treated and to asphaltic concrete are carried out when total <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> on a road becomes high as a result of high traffic and the consequent rapid deterioration of the roadway. Adequate timing of upgrading strategies ensures effective use of resources and lower total <b>transport</b> <b>cost.</b> This study examined existing systems, models, and approaches for estimating total <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> components. An analytical procedure was then developed using a decision-tree concept to delineate all possible upgrading strategies within a plan period. The decision-tree concept depicts all the possible upgrading strategies within a plan period with decisions on roadway upgrading made at certain decision intervals. The total <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> of the upgrading strategies is evaluated to establish the optimal strategies and traffic warrants for improving a roadway surface. A computer program PVMNT was written to facilitate the computation of the total <b>transport</b> <b>cost.</b> A case study was presented to demonstrate the application of the analytical procedure. The case study revealed interesting results on the changes of optimal upgrading strategies with changes in base traffic volume and growth rate. However, general conclusions could not be drawn {{based on the results of}} the case study. These results, as well as the analytical procedure, should be of interest to engineers responsible for providing low-volume roads in developing countries...|$|R

25|$|The largest {{industry}} is tourism, but the island {{also has a}} strong agricultural heritage, including sheep and dairy farming and arable crops. Traditional agricultural commodities {{are more difficult to}} market off the island because of <b>transport</b> <b>costs,</b> but local farmers have managed successfully to exploit some specialist markets, with the higher price of such products being able to absorb the <b>transport</b> <b>costs.</b> One of the most successful agricultural sectors is now the growing of crops under cover, particularly salad crops including tomatoes and cucumbers. The island has a warmer climate and longer growing season than much of the United Kingdom. Garlic has been successfully grown in Newchurch for many years, and is even exported to France. This has led to the establishment of an annual Garlic Festival at Newchurch, {{which is one of the}} largest events of the local calendar. A favourable climate supports two vineyards, including one of the oldest in the British Isles at Adgestone. Lavender is grown for its oil. The largest agricultural sector has been dairying, but due to low milk prices and strict legislation for UK milk producers, the dairy industry has been in decline: there were nearly 150 producers in the mid-1980s, but now just 24.|$|E
