5|$|The {{rock that}} makes up Gareloi Island and its volcano is {{estimated}} to be of Pleistocene age. Several factors contribute to this inference, mainly the presence of glaciers and edifice failure (landslide) debris. The rock, which comprises dissected lava flows and pyroclastic masses, has been shaped by glacial retreat that began around 10,000 years past and fleshed out newly formed rocks. Other landslides have been generated on <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>east</b> flanks of the volcano.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is now seen as the primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>east</b> of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Amy neared {{hurricane}} intensity several times, {{beginning on}} June30 as maximum winds increased to 70mph (110km/h); however, {{the storm was}} unable to acquire enough tropical features, and remained predominately subtropical. Gale-force winds at this time extended roughly 125mi (210km) out from the center to <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>east.</b> Despite being subtropical at this point, the NHC decided against renaming it due to Amy's proximity to land. On July2, a barometric pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg) was recorded, the lowest in relation to Amy. The following day, another trough caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. On July4, Amy passed roughly 170mi (270km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland before becoming an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
