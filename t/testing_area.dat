25|$|Following the war the Fort de Liers {{was sold}} by the {{military}} to Fabrique Nationale (FN) for one franc in 1949, FN eventually becoming Techspace Aero.The fort {{is used as a}} <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> of aircraft engines by Techspace Aero, whose plant adjoins the fort, and is not accessible to the public. The fort's shape remains discernible, with sound control ducting closely adjoining the central massif of the fort.|$|E
25|$|The 01 was an {{experimental}} prototype built {{to explore and}} solve the problems stemming from prolonged supersonic flight. The sizable technological and operational uncertainties (no plane had yet been found able to cruise at over Mach 1.8 {{for long periods of}} time) were only one part of the problem. The weapon-related issues were the other. It took 18 months to build the 01 in Dassault's Saint-Cloud plant near Paris. In late 1958, the aircraft was transferred to the Melun-Villaroche flight <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> for finishing touches and ground tests. On 17 June 1959, French General Roland Glavany, on a five-year leave from the French Air Force since 1954, took the 01 into the air for its maiden flight.|$|E
50|$|The Rocket Establishment, {{as it was}} called, {{was divided}} into five areas: an {{administration}} and assembly block, a British Oxygen Company compound for on-site liquid oxygen fuel manufacture, a component <b>test</b> <b>area,</b> the engine <b>test</b> <b>area</b> and the static firing stands.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{the school}} {{exceeded}} {{the state average}} passing rate in all nine of the New York State Regents Examinations <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> and students took AP examinations in 16 <b>test</b> <b>areas.</b> The school's 14.9 student-teacher ratio exceeds the 12.8 state average.|$|R
50|$|Seidel {{saw that}} {{aircraft}} <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> were needed behind front lines, so that newly delivered aircraft could be assessed and given minor field modifications appropriate to their employment in battle. He established such <b>testing</b> <b>areas,</b> and also used them for final assembly of any light aircraft shipped by rail.|$|R
25|$|Austria-Hungary's {{occupation}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina came in 1878 {{as part of}} the Treaty of Berlin, and complete annexation followed in 1908, angering the Serbs. Sarajevo was industrialized by Austria-Hungary, who used the city as a <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> for new inventions such as tramways, which were established in 1885 before they were later installed in Vienna. Architects and engineers wanting to help rebuild Sarajevo as a modern European capital rushed to the city. A fire that burned down {{a large part of the}} central city area (čaršija) left more room for redevelopment. As a result, the city has a unique blend of the remaining Ottoman city market and contemporary western architecture. Sarajevo also has some examples of Secession- and Pseudo-Moorish styles that date from this period.|$|E
25|$|The {{main highway}} along the WashingtonIndian Head {{corridor}} before {{the construction of}} Indian Head Highway was Livingston Road, which follows much of {{the course of a}} road that has connected Charles County and the District of Columbia parallel to the eastern shore of the Potomac River through Prince George's County since the late 18th century. The road became more important as the highway connecting Washington with both Fort Washington and Fort Foote and later the Indian Head Naval Proving Ground, a gunpowder factory and <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> started by the U.S. Navy in the late 19th century. At its southern end at Mason Springs, Livingston Road was connected to Indian Head by the La PlataIndian Head road that later became MD 225. At the District of Columbia boundary in what is now Forest Heights, Livingston Road continued north to Atlantic Street, which connected with Nichols Avenue (now Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue), which headed north to a crossing of the Anacostia River {{at the site of the}} 11th Street Bridges.|$|E

30|$|The {{conception}} of a GMP monitoring program - selection of <b>test</b> <b>areas,</b> appropriate indicators, methods, farmers' clarification, etc. - should start far earlier than the GMP cropping. Importantly, the initial sampling design has to consider that farmers may deny work on their private properties. A total of 1, 360 involved farmers were informed about the project BINATS. Sixty-nine of these denied work on their fields. Twenty-seven of the 100 pre-selected <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> were affected by this prohibition. Twenty-one of these <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> could be retained by shifting survey circles appropriately [48]. Six <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> had to be shifted as a whole along the Austrian forest inventory raster. However, sizes of Austrian farms are small (average farm size, 18.9 ha) [59] as compared to other EU countries, and problems with denied access may be more serious with larger farm sizes.|$|R
40|$|Optimal scale {{selection}} {{is the key}} step of the slope segmentation. Taking three geomorphological units {{in different parts of}} the loess as <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> and 5 m-resolution DEMs as original test date, this paper employed the changed ROC-LV (Lucian, 2010) in judging the optimal scales in the slope segmentation process. The experiment results showed that this method is effective in determining the optimal scale in the slope segmentation. The results also showed that the slope segmentation of the different geomorphological units require different optimal scales because the landform complexity is varied. The three <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require the same scale which could distinguish the small gully because all the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> have many gullies of the same size, however, when come to distinguish the basins, since the complexity of the three areas is different, the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require different scales...|$|R
2500|$|In Portal, GLaDOS is Chell's only {{link with}} the {{situation}} she is placed in; at the game's start, she introduces Chell to the game's Enrichment Center and the physics of the portal gun. In later stages of the center, GLaDOS admits to having lied to Chell about her progress, {{as part of a}} supposed [...] "test protocol". GLaDOS slowly becomes more sinister, and Chell's trust in GLaDOS is tested when the AI directs Chell into a <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> populated with live-fire turrets, a course designed for military androids. The AI claims that the regular test chamber is unavailable due to [...] "mandatory scheduled maintenance". GLaDOS uses the lure of cake and grief counseling to encourage Chell to continue, but at the final <b>testing</b> <b>area,</b> as Chell prepares to receive the supposed cake, GLaDOS attempts to incinerate Chell in a fire pit. Once Chell escapes, GLaDOS attempts to reconcile with Chell, claiming the pit was a final test.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the launch}} of PublixDirect on September 24, 2001, Publix entered the online grocery business, in hopes of serving the Southeastern U.S. The slogan used was [...] "Online Shopping, Home Delivery." [...] This {{occurred}} during the dot-com crash, alongside competitor Webvan's well-publicized failure. Publix found that demand for online grocery shopping in the Miami <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> was not {{as great as the}} company expected, and shut down PublixDirect on August 23, 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Rapid demobilization {{followed}} {{the end of}} World War I, and despite the experience of that conflict, the Army's air arm remained quite small {{during most of the}} interwar period. [...] After the armistice, Carlstrom Field served as a <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> for various aircraft, dirigibles, and other aeronautical weapons. [...] In October 1919, final testing of an experimental unmanned aircraft called the [...] "Kettering Bug", one of the earliest examples of a cruise missile, was successfully tested & launched at Carlstrom Field.|$|E
40|$|Cisco was {{interested}} in how field failure categories relate to manufacturing test failures to better predict the tests that should be performed on a product after a return by a customer and what tests will be failed by a product before and after a return by a customer based on what type of failure occurred in the field. A study was conducted on one product type and 5 years of field data and the associated test data were captured. For each combination of field failure, shipping status, <b>test</b> <b>area</b> result, and <b>test</b> <b>area</b> a statistical model of the population proportion was created. The 95 % and 99 % confidence intervals were found. The critical <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> and a ranking of the criticality of the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> were arranged from the confidence intervals. These findings will reduce the time spent on unnecessary tests...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} {{digital elevation}} models (DEM) were derived during the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission from C- and X-band interferometric radar data. While these two DEMs share several of their properties, they were processed independently. Here, we investigate {{what can be}} gained by merging the two DEMs into a single composite DEM for four different <b>test</b> <b>areas.</b> Based on {{an analysis of the}} relative differences and the deviations from an absolute reference in one <b>test</b> <b>area</b> we propose an algorithm for combining the two DEMs optimally. We then compare the composite DEM with both individual DEMs and with a reference {{of a large number of}} precise GPS profiles in one <b>test</b> <b>area</b> in southern Germany. We find that in our <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> the area of missing values is reduced significantly in the composite DEM. Even compared with the more complete C-band DEM the number of void pixels can be reduced by 22...|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{occurrence}} and abundance of potential hybridisation partners in Austria [55, 56], a first ecological risk assessment of GM oilseed rape was performed. Feral populations or volunteers of oilseed rape {{were found in}} nearly three quarters (71 out of 100) of all BINATS <b>test</b> <b>areas.</b> On average, oilseed rape could be recorded within 2.41 circles per <b>test</b> <b>area.</b> In eight <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> (8 %), feral oilseed rape populations were observed along transport routes, which confirms earlier findings that spillage during transport {{plays an important role}} for the establishment of feral oilseed rape populations (see above).|$|R

2500|$|In his {{analysis}} of Portal, Daniel Johnson points out that [...] "the larger chunk of Portals narrative exists in GLaDOS' dialogue", which tells [...] "a metaphoric tale of a power struggle of identity roles within an institution". He discusses how the [...] "backstage" [...] of the institution is hinted at and gradually revealed through GLaDOS's slip-ups, from the momentary glitch during her initial instructions to the player ("the first flaw in the routine") to her ultimate abandonment of the formal language of the institution as she desperately pleads with the player {{to return to the}} <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> (the [...] "front stage", where the institution's inner workings are supposedly hidden from view). Microsoft Game Studios developer Tom Abernathy, in discussing the importance of compelling characters in video games, praises Portal for giving its audience [...] "room to do some imagination work" [...] by inviting them to read between the lines to understand GLaDOS's motivations. His own interpretation is that GLaDOS is conflicted between her wants and needs, a conflict which ultimately [...] "causes her to go crazy". Stephen Totilo notes the [...] "artful way" [...] in which GLaDOS's antagonistic character is slowly revealed and defined throughout Portal despite [...] "little interactivity in how the story is told". [...] Of his own reaction to that character development, he writes, [...] "I wanted to hunt GLaDOS down, confront her for her lies, and break free of her clutches. I wanted this boss battle. I don't know if I ever have wanted a boss battle before." [...] Newsweek editor N'Gai Croal describes her as a [...] "maternal, mischievous, malevolent and finally murderous unreliable narrator".|$|E
