She further added, [...] "Since love isn't always black and white, this song deals with the gray area". Entertainment Weekly Nick Catucci felt that the song [...] "treat relationships with the same raw instinct that suffuses her sex songs" [...] on the album. Caitlin White from the website The 405 felt that, [...] "In 'No Angel' her partner is 'no angel either,' the second thought in a comparison that begins with her own ability to transgress standards of purity or celestial perfection".

[...] "Make Her Say" [...] includes a sample of pop singers Lady Gaga's 2009 smash hit [...] "Poker Face" [...] and features verses from West and Common.

Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna complimented the radio friendly sound of the song, but felt that the lyrics [...] "had been used in countless songs", rendering them incoherent. Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times criticized the song's lyrics, saying: [...] "Despite having crafted some of the best singles of the '80s, and despite being a genuine wit, Madonna can tend toward terribly banal rhymes." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine dismissed the song as a [...] "slushy rewrite of that year's 'This Used to Be My Playground', itself a slushy rewrite of Like a Prayers 'Promise to Try'." ...|$|E

In The New York Times, Jon Pareles praised Scott's [...] "proudly and forthrightly feminine" [...] themes {{and said the}} songs are [...] "springy {{with a sense of}} improvisation, both in the rhythms and in their elaborate vocal overlays". The Washington Posts Bill Friskics-Warren noted its [...] "sumptuous orchestration, jazzy flourishes and neo-soul beats", and wrote, [...] "The full range of human emotion, from defiance to hurt and hope, is expressed {{over the course of the}} album." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek said that [...] "Scott sounds more in control than ever; her spoken and sung phrasing (now a trademark), songwriting, and production instincts are all solid". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot wrote, [...] "She's perfected a style that toggles between singing and conversing, and balances more conventional pop structure with spontaneity."

It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating and called it [...] "another great" [...] episode that chronicles the love between Homer and Marge, showing the [...] "ups and downs" [...] of their marriage. He said Lurleen's songs are [...] "filled with clever observations", but it is Homer's befuddlement <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "classic" [...] episode. Meyers added, however, that country music fans might [...] "take offense at Matt Groening's script, which hams up every stereotype imaginable". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that after the [...] "great" [...] previous episode [...] "Dog of Death", [...] "one might expect some drop-off with 'Colonel Homer', but virtually none occurs. It offers another classic episode that benefits from a memorable guest voice performance from D’Angelo. Homer’s moment in the sun creates a fun plot and the program nicely lampoons the country music business." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said the episode is a [...] "good example of The Simpsons fixing itself on a target (in this case, country and western music) and extracting every possible gag.

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles {{considered}} the album [...] "an unexpected magnum opus", and while Pareles felt that [...] "the rock CD overpowers the acoustic one", he considered that [...] "among the quieter songs, {{there are enough}} supple melodies and hypnotic guitar patterns to suggest fine prospects for a follow-through album". Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly described the discs of In Your Honor as [...] "the outdoors and indoors sides", with the rockers [...] "pack an intoxicating wallop: 90-proof rock for 90-degree weather, they'll sound terrific blasting from convertibles, open windows, boom boxes, and at barbecues and beach parties" [...] and the acoustic songs [...] "all very pretty — sometimes scarily so", ultimately concluding that [...] "you'll probably revisit the rockin' half more often". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered that the record [...] "showcases a reinvigorated band that is eager to stretch out and experiment", with the rock record having a [...] "fluid musicality and a [...] sense of drama that gives it a nearly cinematic sense of scope", and the acoustic album being [...] "quieter, {{but it also has}} a similar flow and easy grace <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> fitting complement to the harder first record." [...] Reviewer Joe Gross of Spin described the hard rock disc as [...] "the most consistent rockers of Grohl's career" [...] and considered that the album as a whole [...] "chronicle the physical and mental graffiti of figuring out how to emerge from some very large shadows, including his own, with nerve and power" [...] While Mike Schiller of PopMatters considered that [...] "In Your Honor has some great tunes, but {{it is by no means}} perfect", he praised the rock songs for [...] "indications of just how loud this band can get", and regarding the acoustic tracks, wrote that [...] "despite the down-tempo feel, the songs are infectious".|$|E

He went on to claim {{that it was the}} greatest TV anime series of the 21st century thus far. Scott Green of Ain't It Cool News commented that the series was [...] "hugely admirable" [...] and he would give it the highest possible recommendation to anyone even slightly interested in anime. He also praised the animation team's attention to detail, stating that the series [...] "would not work nearly as well if the characters in general and as magical girls specifically weren't presented so spectacularly winningly by the production." [...] T.H.E.M. Anime reviewer Tim Jones criticized what he regarded as weak character development but nevertheless remarked that the series was [...] "beautiful, well-written, and surprisingly dark" [...] and gave it four out of five stars. In the review, Jones also commended the unique animation and design of the backdrops shown during witch fights, which he described as surreal and [...] "trippy", but beautiful. In his review of the three BD volumes of the anime series, Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network characterized the story as very emotionally dark and [...] "one of the most ambitious and beautiful anime series in recent memory."
