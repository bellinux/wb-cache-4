This paper uses the Sea � le area {{as a case study}} of how crucial it is to understand inventory and supply chain practices as part of earthquake preparation. Geologists say a magnitude 6. 7 earthquake could strike along the Sea � le fault that runs through King County. The earthquake could kill or injure thousands of people and disrupt the economy of the region. It could badly damage homes, offi ce buildings, manufacturing plants, schools, port facilities, utilities, and transportation routes from the south end of downtown Sea � le east through Bellevue and throughout river valleys north and south of the cities. Other earthquake dangers are a magnitude 9. 0 Cascadia subduction zone quake, which could disrupt the economy of the entire Pacifi c Northwest, and deep earthquakes like the 2001 Nisqually quake. A rarely discussed problem that could stall the recovery of our area is the widespread practice of Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory. JIT can help local businesses compete in global markets when it saves warehousing costs. A � er a major earthquake, however, it could lead to shortages along supply chains for many industries and services. Many businesses in the Puget Sound area use warehousing or distribution facilities in the Kent or Duwamish Valleys. These areas have soils in that are prone to liquefying during ground shaking. When soil liquefi es, it loses cohesion and may be unable to Figure 1.

In addition, many warehouses are <b>tilt-ups,</b> which perform poorly in quakes. Making it worse, roadways and bridges disrupted by shaking or blocked by debris may stop or slow transit for days, weeks, or even months (see Figure 1).

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2011 Joplin tornado in which the walls of a Home Depot {{collapsed}} in Joplin after being hit by an EF5 tornado, The Kansas City Star, citing engineers, criticized Home Depot's practice of using <b>tilt-up</b> construction in hundreds of its big-box stores (other nearby big-box stores in Joplin, including a Walmart and Academy Sports, which had concrete block construction, lost their roofs but the walls remained intact). In <b>tilt-up</b> construction the concrete is poured onsite, lifted into place, and then attached to the roof. The engineers told the Star that the practice, while normally safe and efficient, is dangerous in major storms because once the roof is lifted (as happened in Joplin) the walls collapse in a domino effect. [...] Seven people were killed {{in the front of the}} store when the 100,000-pound walls collapsed on them, while 28 people in the back of the store survived when those walls collapsed outward. Only two of the slab walls in the Home Depot survived. In contrast, 3 people died in the Walmart but 200 survived. Engineers noted that when concrete block construction fails, structural elements break in pieces and usually not in huge slabs. [...] Home Depot said it fundamentally disagreed with the engineers quoted by the Star and said it would use <b>tilt-up</b> construction when it rebuilds the Joplin store.|$|E

[...] They said that once one wall falls, it creates a domino effect. [...] Twenty-eight people in an un-reinforced training room {{in the back of the}} building survived. [...] According to a study of the collapse, the tornado hit the south corner of the store and lifted the roof up causing the west walls to collapse into the store.

[...] Engineers said that stronger roof-to-wall connections might have tempered the collapse. [...] Two other big box stores at the corner that had concrete block construction (an Academy Sports and Walmart) lost their roofs but the walls remained intact.

50|$|<b>Tilt-up</b> {{construction}} requires significant {{organization and}} collaboration {{on the building}} site. The chronological steps {{that need to be}} taken for a <b>tilt-up</b> project are: site evaluation, engineering, footings and floor slabs, forming <b>tilt-up</b> panels, steel placement, embeds and inserts, concrete placement, panel erection and panel finishing. Once the pad (casting surface or floor slab) has cured, forms are built on top. Dimensional lumber, a high quality plywood or fiber board that has at least one smooth face is typically used, although aluminum or steel forms are also common. Carpenters work from engineered drawings designed for each panel or element to construct on site. They incorporate all door and window openings, as well as architectural features and other desired shapes that can be molded into the concrete. Studs, gussets and attachment plates are located within the form for embedding in the concrete. The forms are usually anchored to the casting surface with masonry nails or otherwise adhered to prevent damage to the floor slab.|$|E
