40|$|Deer-vehicle {{collision}} (DVC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious traffic issues in the Unite States. To reduce DVCs, this research developed a system using a contour-based histogram of oriented gradients algorithm (CNT-HOG) to identify deer through the processing of images taken by thermographic cameras. The system is capable of detecting deer in low visibility. Two motors are applied to enlarge the detection range and make the system capable of tracking deer by providing two degrees of freedom. The main assumption in the CNT-HOG algorithm is that the deer are brighter than their background in a <b>thermo</b> <b>image.</b> The brighter areas are defined as the regions of interest, or ROIs. ROIs were identified based on the contours of brighter areas. HOG features were then collected and certain detection frameworks were applied to the image portions in the ROIs instead of the whole image. In the detection framework, a Linear Support Vector Machine classifier was applied to achieve identification. The system has been tested in various scenarios, such as a zoo and roadways in different weather conditions. Th...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} about temperature determination for given dot {{of picture}} through image analysis. Heat transfer is {{the transition of}} thermal energy from a heated item to a cooler item. Main method of measurement of temperature in image is Pattern Matching, color scale detection and model detection. We can measure temperature dependency at time for selected point of <b>thermo</b> vision <b>images.</b> This measurement gives idea about the heat transfer at time dependences. ...|$|R
40|$|Spark plasma {{sintering}} (SPS) is {{a breakthrough}} process for powder consolidation assisted by pulsed cur-rent and uniaxial pressure. In order {{to model the}} temperature variations of the tools during a SPS cycle,the Graphite-Papyex-Graphite contact phenomena are studied experimentally and modeled by finite ele-ment calculations. Compared to conducting materials, the <b>thermo</b> graphic <b>image</b> of an insulating sample(alumina) shows strongly localized heating along the Papyex implying contact effects are predominant. The aim of this modeling study {{is to determine the}} main contact phenomena due to Papyex. It is basedon numerous experimental data and studies the case of alumina sintering. Finally the contact model isconfronted to experimental thermal images...|$|R
40|$|Neutral {{electrodes}} (grounding plates used in electrosurgical operations) {{were tested}} with thermo cameras in volunteer experiments. These experiments {{are difficult to}} perform and expensive. A new test device swaroTEST with a measuring board “electronic skin ” simulates the relevant electrical features of human skin to replace volunteer experiments. This device consists of a three dimensional resistor network representing the electric features of the skin and muscle tissue, and a temperature sensing array (one transistor for each cm) to measure the resultant temperature increase after a standardized current load (700 mA hf current during 60 s, proposed in the relevant AAMI HF- 18 standard). The comparison of test results with <b>thermo</b> camera <b>images</b> of volunteer experiments showed a sufficient coincidence, which proves the applicability of this test device to replace volunteer experiments...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to numerically and {{experimentally}} investigate the performance characteristics of skin condensers applied to a specific household refrigerator model. To this end a mathematical model which takes into account both the heat transfer to the ambient and to the refrigerated compartments was developed. The model predicts the condenser performance from {{the internal and external}} air temperatures, geometry, mass flow rate, pressure and temperature at the heat exchanger inlet. Steady-state energy consumption tests â€“ compressor running continuously with electric heaters being used to create artificial thermal load â€“ were carried out in different operating conditions with the product maintained within a climate-controlled chamber. Tests were carried out at 25 Â°C and 32 Â°C ambient temperatures, 5 Â°C to 10 Â°C fresh-food compartment temperatures, - 20 Â°C to - 15 Â°C freezer compartment temperatures and compressor speeds of 3000 rpm and 4500 rpm. <b>Thermo</b> graphic <b>images</b> of the outer steel shell temperature fields were also recorded during the experiments. The model predictions were compared with the experimental database with the deviations falling inside a Â± 5 % error band. It has been found that, independently of the operating conditions, 60 % of the condenser heat released rate is transferred to the ambient while the remaining 40 % is transferred to the refrigerated compartments. It has also been found that radiation plays an important role, being responsible by over 80 % of the heat rejected to the ambient...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this article}} is to present a new {{methodology}} for assessment of skin topology using a three-dimensional image (3 D). Methods: The measurement of the skin surface roughness is based on 3 D scanning of silicone replicas by chromatic aberration length technique in a contactless manner, i. e. by a polychromatic light beam. Analysis of the skin surface reprints was performed using Talymap, Gold version. Results were analysed by fractal geometry, which allows to evaluate changes of the skin surface before and after application of cosmetics and instrumental cosmetological techniques. The methodology was applied for objective assessment of the effects of diamond microdermabrasion on the skin surface roughness. Measurements were performed on 23 volunteers in the age group of 31 – 67 years. Results: Based on the results of skin surface scanning after the treatment with diamond microdermabrasion it may be concluded that inequalities of the skin surface are reduced immediately after exfoliation. However, this effect mostly diminishes within 14 days after treatment. The entire study ultimately suggests that the instrumental method used only leads to improvement of the skin surface immediately after its application. <b>Thermo</b> vision <b>images</b> of the skin surface temperature were obtained during the application of the abrasive method. The experimental results showed that the skin is rather cooled than heated by the treatment. Conclusion: This study is focused on the development of a methodology for objective measurement of changes in treated skin relief using 3 D scanning. The results are evaluated using fractal dimension. The output may also include also an enlarged model of the skin surface made by 3 D printer, which can serve for illustrative communication with the client. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
