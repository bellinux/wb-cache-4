5|$|The {{original}} plant uses Babcock & Wilcox Volund boilers {{to provide}} steam {{for a single}} Ansaldo <b>turbo</b> <b>generator</b> rated at 19.2MW. The third line uses a Von Roll Inova reciprocating grate to burn the waste, and generates electricity using a single Von Roll Inova three-pass steam generator, rated at 10MW.|$|E
5|$|Each boiler powered a <b>turbo</b> <b>generator,</b> made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity. The stations used {{them because of}} a Statutory Order of the Ministry of Supply in November 1947 that all turbo alternators made for the home market could only be of 60MW at advanced steam conditions. Stella South had a total generating capacity of 300MW and Stella North originally 240MW (later recorded as only 224MW). The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time. In 1967, one of the sets at Stella South became the world's first in commercial operation to use brushless excitation. The set was modified by Parsons to use A.C. exciters and silicon diode rectifiers. The stations' switchgear was manufactured by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E
25|$|Orizaba and {{her sisters}} had turbo-electric transmission. Each ship had two oil-fired high {{pressure}} boilers that fed a single AEG <b>turbo</b> <b>generator.</b> This produced current for an AEG electric propulsion motor that drove a single propeller shaft. This was a sophisticated propulsion system that required skilled operation. Both Antilla and Arauca suffered technical failures on their maiden voyages to the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|Each {{ship had}} turbo-electric transmission, {{with a pair}} of steam <b>turbo</b> <b>generators</b> {{generating}} current that powered propulsion motors on the twin propeller shafts. General Electric built the <b>turbo</b> <b>generators</b> and propulsion motors for President Coolidge but Westinghouse built the <b>turbo</b> <b>generators</b> and propulsion motors for President Hoover. 12 oil-fired Babcock & Wilcox high-pressure boilers supplied the steam for President Hoovers turbo-generators. The electric propulsion motors produced 26,500 shp at 133 RPM.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is description, {{analysis}} and proposal of <b>turbo</b> <b>generator’s</b> control and protection system. The power output of <b>turbo</b> <b>generators</b> is from 3 MVA up to 75 MVA for various industrial sectors.

50|$|Dollar Lines ordered both ships on 26 October 1929. The Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia {{built the}} two ships, {{completing}} President Hoover in 1930 and President Coolidge in 1931. They were the largest merchant ships {{built in the}} USA up to that time. Each ship had turbo-electric transmission, {{with a pair of}} steam <b>turbo</b> <b>generators</b> generating current that powered propulsion motors on the propeller shafts. General Electric built the <b>turbo</b> <b>generators</b> and propulsion motors for President Coolidge but Westinghouse built the <b>turbo</b> <b>generators</b> and propulsion motors for President Hoover.|$|R
25|$|On 30 October, the Egyptian Navy {{dispatched}} the Ibrahim el Awal, an ex-British Hunt class destroyer, to Haifa {{with the}} aim of shelling that city's coastal oil installations. On 31 October the Ibrahim el Awal reached Haifa and began bombarding the city with its four 102mm (4-inch) guns. The French destroyer Kersaint, which was guarding Haifa port as part of Operation Musketeer, returned fire but failed to score any hits. The Ibrahim el Awal disengaged and turned northwest. Israeli destroyers INS Eilat and INS Yaffo then gave chase and caught up with the Egyptian warship. The Israeli destroyers, together with two Israeli Air Force Dassault Ouragans, succeeded in damaging the destroyer's <b>turbo</b> <b>generator,</b> rudder and antiaircraft guns. Left without power and unable to steer, the Ibrahim el Awal surrendered to the Israeli destroyers. The Egyptian destroyer was subsequently incorporated into the Israeli Navy and renamed INS Haifa (K-38).|$|E
2500|$|It {{required}} {{removal of}} all the boiler rooms, the forward engine room, both <b>turbo</b> <b>generator</b> rooms, the ship stabilisers and the water softening plant. The ship's empty fuel tanks were filled with local mud to keep the ship's centre of gravity and draft at the correct levels, as these critical factors had {{been affected by the}} removal of the various components and structure. Only the aft engine room and [...] "shaft alley", at the stern of the ship, would be spared. Remaining space would be used for storage or office space.|$|E
