40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to investigate}} early childhood lead teachers' perspectives of <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> including their attitudes and beliefs, and the practice of <b>time</b> <b>out</b> in their classrooms. The study sought to detail the practice of <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> to investigate teachers' perceptions of <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> and to gain further understanding into teachers' choices regarding <b>time</b> <b>out</b> use. These objectives were achieved {{with the use of a}} comprehensive, written survey directed to 151 lead preschool teachers at 18 randomly selected preschool programs within Hamilton County, Ohio. Written discipline policies from 9 preschool programs included in the survey sample were also analyzed as they related to the use of <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> Fifty completed surveys were returned representing a well-balanced sample of lead teachers across multiple demographic variables. Results indicated that 66 % of teachers were using <b>time</b> <b>out</b> and there were not any distinguishable differences among the variables collected between those teachers who used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> and those who did not. Teachers' <b>time</b> <b>out</b> practices included verbal or visual warnings for children, discussion, and redirection. Teachers defined <b>time</b> <b>out</b> as an action, as a period of time, and as a place. 63 % of teachers did not perceive <b>time</b> <b>out</b> as punishment; nonetheless 55 % perceived that <b>time</b> <b>out</b> had the potential to be harmful to young children. The majority of teachers using <b>time</b> <b>out</b> did so because they perceived that the child learned through <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> but other teachers indicated that young children were not able to comprehend <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> Some teachers used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> due to the perceived social and emotional benefits for the child while other teachers perceived <b>time</b> <b>out</b> to be detrimental to children's social and emotional development. Teachers also indicated that they used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> to maintain control of children. Teachers who used <b>time</b> <b>out</b> were influenced by experience, education, program policies, and because <b>time</b> <b>out</b> is a form of discipline. Interestingly, these same factors influenced other teachers to not use <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> The majority of the teachers who chose not to use <b>time</b> <b>out</b> were influenced by other methods available for classroom or behavior management.

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>out</b> is a {{well-known}} discipline technique that has gained popularity among parents trying to manage and guide children’s behavior. When used appropriately, <b>time</b> <b>out</b> is an effective discipline tool; however, it is often overused in trying to handle too many situations of misbehavior. <b>Time</b> <b>out</b> is most effective when used {{for only a few}} specific situations. No one discipline technique works with every type of misbehavior. A parent needs to learn and be equipped with many discipline tools to guide their child’s behavior successfully. Here are several strategies that may be helpful. <b>Time</b> <b>Out</b> <b>Time</b> <b>out</b> is a technique used to interrupt an unacceptable behavior by removing the child from the situation where the misbehavior is occurring. Before using <b>time</b> <b>out</b> the child must understand the concepts of “waiting” and “quiet; ” this usually occurs by age three. The <b>time</b> <b>out</b> location selected should be a quiet, dull place devoid of activity. Preschool age children should be placed in an area where you can see them at all times. Children should be expected to stay in the <b>time</b> <b>out</b> for no more than one minute per year of age—for example, a four year old would be given four minutes. Explain the <b>time</b> <b>out</b> procedure ahead of time. Walk the younger child through the procedure until he or she understands. Time the quiet time only (not the time spent whining, yelling, or crying). When the time is up, explain to the child again what behavior is appropriate and allow him or her to return to the activity. Praise the child for using appropriate behavior. When <b>time</b> <b>out</b> doesn’t work: <b>Time</b> <b>out</b> won’t work if it is overused. If you use <b>time</b> <b>out</b> for every behavior problem, the effectiveness will lessen because it becomes an automatic response: “I yelled, now I’m in <b>time</b> <b>out,</b> and now I’m done. ” Also make sure to choose a toy-free place for the <b>time</b> <b>out.</b> Choosing a location where there are tons of toys and distractions, such as the child’s room, won’t allow the child to think about what they have done wrong (Famil...|$|R

5|$|Del Piero {{was a free}} {{kick and}} penalty kick (62 goals from {{penalties}}) specialist. He is the third highest scorer of penalties in Serie A history, scoring 50 <b>times</b> <b>out</b> of 61 attempts, behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio. Del Piero's unique free kick technique was usually characterised by a curling strike which rose high over the wall, and then suddenly dropped into the top corner of the goal; he attributes his ability on set pieces to the time spent studying Roberto Baggio in training during their time together at Juventus, and was also influenced by the free kick technique {{of one of his}} idols, Platini. Indeed, in his early years with the Turin club, Del Piero's free kick technique was compared to that of the Frenchman, as he preferred to strike the ball from a distance of around 20 metres from the goal, with a direct kick, rather than having it touched by a teammate first. Del Piero is currently the Italian all-time top scorer from free kicks in all competitions (52 goals: 46 goals at club level, 6 goals with the Italy national team). He is also the third all-time highest goalscorer of free kicks in Serie A, with 22 goals, behind only Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović. In addition to his talent and footballing abilities, Del Piero also drew praise throughout his career for his leadership with Juventus, and for his fair play and correct behaviour on the pitch.|$|E
