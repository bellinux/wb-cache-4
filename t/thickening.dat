5|$|In {{mainland}} Europe (particularly Spain and Italy), {{hot chocolate}} is sometimes served very thick {{due to the}} use of a <b>thickening</b> agent such as cornstarch. Among the multiple thick forms of hot chocolate served in Europe is the Italian cioccolata calda.|$|E
5000|$|When continents collide, the {{continental}} crust may <b>thicken</b> at their edges in the collision. If this happens, {{much of the}} <b>thickened</b> crust may move downwards rather than up as with the iceberg analogy. The idea of continental collisions building mountains [...] "up" [...] is therefore rather a simplification. Instead, the crust <b>thickens</b> and {{the upper part of}} the <b>thickened</b> crust may become a mountain range.|$|R

50|$|Pre-gelatinized starch {{is used to}} <b>thicken</b> instant desserts, {{allowing}} the food to <b>thicken</b> {{with the addition of}} cold water or milk. Similarly, cheese sauce granules (such as in Macaroni and Cheese or lasagna) or gravy granules may be <b>thickened</b> with boiling water without the product going lumpy. Commercial pizza toppings containing modified starch will <b>thicken</b> when heated in the oven, keeping them on top of the pizza, and then become runny when cooled.|$|R

5|$|Pelvic and vaginal {{ultrasounds}} {{are helpful}} {{in the diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound may appear normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial <b>thickening,</b> uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E
5|$|The caps {{form from}} the top of the short stipe by the growth and {{expansion}} of a blunt margin and later as a <b>thickening</b> of the upper surface. Spines start to form when the cap hangs over the stipe slightly. They are white in many species, but become brown in maturity as the brown-colored spores accumulate on the surface.|$|E
40|$|Does <b>thickened</b> formula help {{infants with}} {{persistent}} vomiting or other GERD symptoms? <b>Thickened</b> infant formulas marginally reduce the episodes of {{vomiting and regurgitation}} symptoms compared with nonthickened formula (SOR: A, consistent RCTs). A 2 - to 4 -week trial of a <b>thickened</b> formula or an extensively hydrolyzed protein formula (hypoallergenic formula) is a reasonable first step for such symptoms (SOR: B, evidence-based guideline) ...|$|R

50|$|Untreated starch {{requires}} heat to <b>thicken</b> or gelatinize. When a starch is pre-cooked, it {{can then}} be used to <b>thicken</b> instantly in cold water. This {{is referred to as}} a pregelatinized starch.|$|R
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive <b>thickening</b> of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
5|$|For {{the primary}} deposits, the source pegmatites, {{which are usually}} {{obtained}} by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride; then follow <b>thickening,</b> filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, {{with a series of}} magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, <b>thickening</b> of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
3000|$|Conventional {{ultrasonography}} {{in isolated}} tubal torsion might show the <b>thickened</b> {{walls of a}} distended fallopian tube with <b>thickened</b> fimbriae {{and the presence of}} internal debris within the tube, as in our case (Fig.  1)[10] [...].|$|R
50|$|Belonging to the Stenella genus, {{this species}} is a Cercospora-like fungus with a {{superficial}} secondary mycelium, solitary conidiophores, conidiogenous cells with <b>thickened</b> and darkened conidiogenous loci and catenate or single conidia with dark, slightly <b>thickened</b> hila.|$|R
25|$|Pachypodium {{trunks and}} {{branches}} are <b>thickened</b> with water-storing tissue. Plants {{must rely on}} the food and water stored in their <b>thickened</b> trunks during seasonal or intermittent drought when leaves have been shed and no water {{is available from the}} substrate. In addition to the lower surface-to-volume ratio which aides in water retention, the <b>thickened</b> trunks and branches can also possess photosynthetic surface tissue to allow nutrient synthesis even when leaves are not present.|$|R
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use <b>thickening</b> agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a millimeter in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis <b>thickening,</b> however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{growth is}} the {{elongation}} of the stems and roots. Secondary growth {{consists of a}} progressive <b>thickening</b> and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic. Eventually {{the growth of a}} tree slows down and stops and it gets no taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.|$|E

50|$|It is one {{complication}} of chronic {{rheumatic heart disease}}. Other complications of chronic rheumatic heart disease are valvular effect (stenosis, insufficiency or can be both), valvular leaflets become <b>thickened</b> by fibrosis, frequent valvular calcification, cordae tendinae become <b>thickened,</b> shortened and fused.|$|R
5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} the nails and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, <b>thickening</b> of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyl larvae {{are often}} {{distinguished}} by poorly developed bones {{and the presence}} of a hyobranchial apparatus, a series of bones that gills would attach to in life. However, some fully mature temnospondyls also possess hyobranchial bones but did not have external gills. A dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults. Major body changes occur in metamorphosis, including the reshaping and strengthening of skull bones, the <b>thickening</b> of postcranial bones, and an increase in body size.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree of}} {{ovulation}} suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives {{depends on the}} progestogen activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional progestogen only pills, subdermal implants Norplant and Jadelle, and intrauterine system Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as <b>thickening</b> of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness. Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant Nexplanon—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: <b>Thickened</b> liquids are {{frequently}} recommended {{for patients with}} dysphagia to minimize aspiration. When discussing the use of <b>thickened</b> liquids with graduate students in Communication Sciences 2 ̆ 6 Disorders (CSD), it is beneficial to discuss the potential effect(s) of this dietary recommendation. Graduate level preparation involving first-hand experience with <b>thickened</b> liquids may help future speech-language pathologists (SLPs) develop a more complete understanding {{of the effects of}} diet modification. The purpose of the current {{study was to examine the}} reactions of graduate students in CSD to a brief period of <b>thickened</b> liquid use as an experiential learning activity. Methods: Sixty-eight graduate students enrolled in an accredited CSD program completed the study. As part of a class assignment, students were instructed to consume only <b>thickened</b> liquids for 24 hours. No further restrictions on food intake were made. Each student wrote a brief summary detailing his/her experience at the conclusion of the <b>thickened</b> liquid intake session. The narratives were examined for key terms that seemed to define the participants’ experiences. Results: Experiential terms were divided into physical symptoms, emotional responses, and behavioral changes. Common symptoms included persistent thirst, dryness, fatigue, perception of the experience as being unpleasant, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Conclusion: Many of the symptoms were associated with dehydration secondary to reduced fluid intake, per the students’ reports. Specific symptoms included craving water, fatigue, and headache. All participants reported a greater understanding of <b>thickened</b> liquid use upon completion...|$|R
