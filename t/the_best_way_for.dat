5|$|During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) and {{especially}} of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned. Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barça became 'More than a club' (Més que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the Catalans {{to demonstrate their}} identity was by joining Barça. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence. During Franco's regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.|$|E
5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing it is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been {{left behind in the}} zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E

25|$|The Republicans {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> men to get political experience {{was to be}} able to vote and to participate in the political system. They passed laws allowing all male freedmen to vote. In 1867, black men voted for the first time. Over the course of Reconstruction, more than 1,500 African Americans held public office in the South; some of them were men who had escaped to the North and gained educations, and returned to the South. They did not hold office in numbers representative of their proportion in the population, but often elected whites to represent them. The question of women's suffrage was also debated but was rejected.|$|E
25|$|Reynaud, however, {{had always}} wanted the Finance ministry. He {{endorsed}} radically liberal economic policies in order to draw France's economy out of stagnation, centered on a massive program of deregulation, including {{the elimination of the}} forty-hour work week. The notion of deregulation was very popular among France's businessmen, and Reynaud believed that it was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> France to regain investors' confidence again and escape the stagnation its economy had fallen into. The collapse of Léon Blum's government in 1938 was a response to Blum's attempt to expand the regulatory powers of the French government; there was therefore considerable support in the French government for an alternative approach like Reynaud's.|$|E
25|$|An RSC is {{composed}} of the regional committee members (RCMs) of all the participating ASCs in a region. It is similar in organization to an ASC, but is further removed from the day-to-day activities of individual home groups.

In some cases, only the RCMs in a region will meet to vote on issues; in other situations, all GSRs in a region will be invited to attend an RSC meeting. The RSC elects a delegate to attend the World Service Conference.|$|E

25|$|Though {{companies}} were hired {{for work on}} the pilot episode—such as Entity FX for the visual effects—effects departments now work exclusively for the series. Ivan Hayden is the visual effects supervisor, and works with many levels of the production staff. During pre-production, Hayden must go through the scripts, looking for possible visual effects. He then has a concept meeting with the writers, and after settling on the effect designs to use, coordinates with the special effects and stunt departments. Hayden is also present during filming to help the director {{make sure that the}} scenes are being filmed in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the visual effects, such as by ensuring that the actors are looking at the correct location where an effect will later be added. Afterward, he then meets with the editors. Another aspect of the visual effects department is coming up with rules and physics for each supernatural creature, though the rules are often bent if it benefits the story. In 2012, it was announced that Hayden will be working at the new Vancouver location of Encore for its VFX division.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century Pan-Slavic {{language}} projects were mostly the domain of Slovenes and Croats. In this era of awakening national consciousness, the Russians were the only Slavs who had their own state; other Slavic peoples inhabited large, mostly non-Slavic states, and clear borders between the various nations were mostly lacking. Among the numerous efforts at creating written standards for the South Slavic languages there were also efforts at establishing a common South Slavic language, Illyrian, that might also serve as a literary language for all Slavs in the future. Of special importance is the work of Matija Majar (1809–1892), a Slovenian Austroslavist who later converted to Pan-Slavism. In 1865 he published Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski ("Mutual Slavic Orthography"). In this work, he postulated that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> Slavs to communicate with other Slavs was taking own language as a starting point and then modifying it in steps. First, he proposed changing the orthography of each individual language into a generic ("mutual") Pan-Slavic orthography, subsequently he described a grammar that was based on comparing the five major Slavic languages of his days: Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbian. Apart from a book about the language itself, Majar also used it for a biography of Cyril and Methodius and for a magazine he published in the years 1873–1875, Slavjan. A fragment in the language can still be seen on the altar of Majar's church in Görtschach. Other Pan-Slavic language projects were published in the same period by the Croatian Matija Ban, the Slovenes Radoslav Razlag and Božidar Raič, as well as the Bulgarian from Macedonia Grigor Parlichev – all based on the idea of combining Old Church Slavonic with elements from the modern South Slavic languages.|$|E

500|$|According to the Irenaean tradition, {{humans are}} not created perfectly, {{but in a}} state of imperfection. The theodicy teaches that {{creation}} has two stages: humans were first created in the image of God, and will then be created in the likeness of God. Humans are imperfect because the second stage is incomplete, entailing the potential, not yet actualised, for humans to reach perfection. To achieve this likeness of God, humans must be refined and developed. The theodicy proposes that evil and suffering exists in the world because this is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> humans to develop. As such, the Irenaean theodicy is sometimes referred to as the [...] "soul-making theodicy", a phrase taken from the poet John Keats.|$|E

Janie serves as Shelly's voice of reason, while Rita encourages her to be more impulsive with dating. They often disagree with one another on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> Shelly to approach her love life.

500|$|A core {{tenet of}} {{psychodrama}} is Moreno's theory of [...] "spontaneity-creativity".

By encouraging an individual to address a problem in a creative way, reacting spontaneously and based on impulse, they may begin to discover new solutions to problems {{in their lives and}} learn new roles they can inhabit within it. Moreno's focus on spontaneous action within the psychodrama was developed in his Theatre of Spontaneity, which he directed in Vienna in the early 1920s. [...] Disenchanted with the stagnancy he observed in conventional, scripted theatre, he found himself interested in the spontaneity required in improvisational work. He founded an improvisational troupe in the 1920s. [...] This work in the theatre impacted the development of his psychodramatic theory.|$|E
