500|$|Putnam {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference {{that he was trying to}} raise the funds to pay the team's debts. He reported that the team had taken in about $2.3 million in gate receipts to that point, which left him [...] "only $300,000 short of operating the club", but revealed that the team had also [...] "paid out over $1.2 million in bonuses to future players." [...] He asserted that the team would not be in such dire financial straits if that bonus money had not been paid. [...] Putnam said that he would need to raise $750,000 by November 28 so the team could pay back taxes due to the state, county, and city as well as the salaries of players who had not been paid in four weeks. He said [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>comes</b> from Birmingham, we'll stay here but if <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>comes</b> from people in Timbuktu who want the team in Timbuktu, them we'll move there." [...] Putnam said a group from New York was interested in purchasing the Americans. [...] Putnam speculated that one reason he had been unable to secure [...] "local money" [...] to invest in the franchise was that local interests were still hoping to bring an NFL franchise to the city.|$|E

2500|$|The series' {{stunt man}} and stunt {{arranger}} Ray Austin expressed {{the opinion that}} the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There The Avengers was given a late timeslot due to its violence. [...] "They did that with the first Avengers here , with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS , {{because it was too}} violent." [...] Austin goes on to explain that U.S. television follows a [...] "different code". Austin said that on The Avengers [...] "we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one was going to stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>comes</b> from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York—you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it." [...] In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC. The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC.|$|E

60|$|Almost all {{expenditure}} {{being carried}} on {{by means of}} money, <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>comes</b> to be looked upon as the main feature in the transaction; and since that does not perish, but only changes hands, people overlook the destruction which {{takes place in the}} case of unproductive expenditure. The money being merely transferred, they think the wealth also has only been handed over from the spendthrift to other people. But this is simply confounding money with wealth. The wealth which has been destroyed was not the money, but the wines, equipages, and furniture which the money purchased; and, these having been destroyed without return, society collectively is poorer by the amount. In proportion as any class is improvident or luxurious, the industry of the country takes the direction of producing luxuries for their use; while not only the employment for productive laborers is diminished, but the subsistence and instruments which are the means of such employment do actually exist in smaller quantity.|$|E
