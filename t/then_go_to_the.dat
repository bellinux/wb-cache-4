5|$|Many {{people start}} {{to show up at}} the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and her friends start to get annoyed. In order to get back at them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels {{self-conscious}} about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E
5|$|Moving on to 300 AF Cocoon, {{the pair}} find Snow {{fighting}} a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After resolving the paradox, which delays {{the fall of}} Cocoon until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as an anomaly from another time. The pair <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Academia on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover a paradox whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate Cocoon was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. Resolving the paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new Cocoon to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to disappear in the corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream-worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains {{that she is the}} seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's own heart.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Cleveland, Joe, and Quagmire are {{spending}} the evening at The Drunken Clam, when Peter is reminded {{to pick up}} Meg from the roller skating rink. They <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rink and continue to enjoy themselves, but forget to pick up Meg when they leave. After skating home in the rain, Meg asks the family for her own car. The next day, Peter takes his daughter to the local car showroom, where she shows an interest in a sedan. Distracted by a large tank at the dealership, however, Peter is tricked into buying it. At first, Peter uses the tank himself, despite it being intended for Meg, but then he teaches Meg to drive it. Later that day, however, the two accidentally run over Joe, and he impounds the tank. Frustrated, Meg decides to earn the money for her own car, {{and is able to}} get a job at the local Quahog mega store, Superstore USA, working under a man named Mr. Penisburg. The shops in Quahog soon become bankrupt because of the new superstore, and causes people to lose their jobs of Superstore USA's one job taking quahog, like cleveland and mort putting planks on the doors so they will become abandoned.|$|E

If the attacker tries to get his king to his sixth rank by moving his rook to that rank first to block the checks, the defender simply exchanges rooks and has a drawn king and pawn versus king endgame.|$|E

Upon waking, Ana is confronted by Police Sergeant Kenneth Hall, electronics salesman Michael, petty criminal Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda and joins them, after they prove she is still alive. They break into a nearby mall and are attacked by a zombified security guard, who scratches Luda. Kenneth is also badly injured while wrestling with the zombie, which Ana subdues with his shotgun.

25|$|As a teenager, he {{was greatly}} {{troubled by the}} Metaphysics of Aristotle, which he could not {{understand}} until he read al-Farabi's commentary on the work. For {{the next year and}} a half, he studied philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made {{with the help of a}} work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.|$|E
25|$|SSS {{can make}} {{changes to the}} Handbook {{as long as there}} is a {{proposal}} made and brought to Senate's attention. If the motion passes, it goes to the Principal.

Newfound SSS has changed some of the policies around school, including the usage of technology, as well as eating in the academic wings. If the motion fails, the proposal will go back to the appropriate committee in which they will make the necessary edits in order to improve the proposal. Most of the time the motion fails is because of the wording, or the proposal is not deemed necessary. In order for such proposal to pass, the motion must have the majority ruling in favor of the proposal.|$|E

[...] His plan was to cross two groups onto the island from points in Elizabethtown (present-day Elizabeth, New Jersey), capture prisoners from the isolated militia outposts, and destroy supplies.

500|$|The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering was {{published}} in 2000. Here, Finkelstein argues that Elie Wiesel and others exploit {{the memory of the}} Holocaust as an [...] "ideological weapon." [...] The purpose, writes Finkelstein, is to enable the State of Israel, [...] "one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, [...] cast itself as a victim state;" [...] that is, to provide Israel [...] "immunity to criticism." [...] He alleges what he calls a [...] "double shakedown" [...] by [...] "a repellent gang of plutocrats, hoodlums and hucksters" [...] seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from Germany and Switzerland, moneys which <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lawyers and institutional actors involved in procuring them, rather than actual Holocaust survivors.|$|E
500|$|In {{a series}} of flashbacks, Commander Archer meets with Commodore Forest, and is {{informed}} that although he excelled in simulations, his colleague Commander Robinson has been awarded the test ship, the NX Alpha. Disappointed, Archer goes to the 602 Club, a local bar, bumping into Robinson there. Later, Robinson takes the scheduled flight aboard the NX Alpha, breaking the warp 2.0 barrier. He refuses a command from Forest to stop and instead increases speed; the craft soon destabilizes and is destroyed as it approaches warp 2.2, but Robinson escapes. The Vulcans argue that the warp program should be postponed, but Archer wants the program, and his father's engine research, to continue. [...] Archer, and his new friend Lieutenant Tucker, <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 602 Club to discuss the problem.

500|$|On the way {{to their}} {{vacation}} spot, Lois falls asleep. Unfortunately, Peter doesn't {{pay attention to the}} road, deciding instead to read a comic book while driving, and crashes the car into a tree. They are forced to spend their entire honeymoon money on car repairs and are about to return home when Peter discovers that actor/director Mel Gibson has a private suite at a luxurious hotel nearby, [...] "which he barely uses". He and Lois <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel, where Peter poses as Gibson to gain access to his room. When Lois yells out Gibson's name during intercourse, Peter, again, decides to return home. As the two are about to leave, Peter accidentally stumbles upon Gibson's private screening room and discovers a sequel to The Passion of the Christ entitled The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This. To spare the world from [...] "...another two hours of Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo-jumbo," [...] Peter steals the film. However, when they leave the hotel, they are noticed by two priests, Gibson's associates, who were there to collect the film.|$|E
500|$|Ned reluctantly {{agrees with}} this and asks Homer to teach him the secret to his lust for life. This leads Homer to head towards Mr. Burns' Casino, but when Ned reminds Homer it is now defunct, Homer instead takes Ned on a {{gambling}} trip to Las Vegas. Homer is confident about going there, but Flanders is nervous. When they arrive, they see Captain Lance Murdock (from [...] "Bart the Daredevil") doing one of his stunts, and Homer chooses to volunteer, and survives (although Murdock is again badly injured). They wander into a casino called [...] "Nero's Palace" [...] and begin to play roulette. Ned protests against games of chance because of Deuteronomy 7, but Homer ignores him and takes the reference as a lucky number. They win, but immediately lose all they won. They <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> casino's bar, and Ned gives into temptation and gets drunk on wine spritzers. Homer and Ned wake {{up the next morning}} in their hotel room married to two cocktail waitresses: Homer's new wife is named Amber, and Ned's new wife is Ginger. Homer finally realizes he got in over his head. While Homer fantasizes about bigamy, Ned snaps Homer back to reality by saying they were drunk and thus not of sound judgement to have such quickie, plastic weddings; also they are already married.|$|E
500|$|In April2011, it was {{reported}} that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An EastEnders insider told the News of the World, [...] "Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [...] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab." [...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, and the way you do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E

500|$|In North America, the Series (particularly {{the first}} few games) exposed the need for better {{preparation}} and off-season training. Philadelphia Flyers coach Fred Shero became an avid student of the Soviet style {{and was one of}} the first to bring the Soviet training techniques to the NHL as the Flyers won two Stanley Cup championships in 1974 and 1975. Tom Mellor (who joined the small but rapidly growing group of American-born NHL players after the 1972 Olympics) lamented that the NHL training methods of the early 1970s were vastly inferior to those of the Soviets. [...] "When I went to play for Detroit after the Olympics, Alex Delvecchio was the coach.... When he would coach, we would do a couple of one-on-ones, two-on-twos, three-on-twos, we'd scrimmage, and he would scrimmage with us. At the end of the scrimmage, we'd do a couple of figure eights and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bar. That was the NHL and pro mentality." [...] Mark Howe commented that the Soviet national team must have trained six hours on the day of a game in the 1972 Winter Olympics. On the other hand, Swedish sports journalists were extremely impressed by the toughness and [...] "never say die" [...] fighting spirit of the Canadians, who lost only one game out of seven on European ice despite usually trailing in the third period. According to Soviet player Boris Mikhailov, who later became a coach, [...] "it was a meeting between two schools of hockey and we have since continued this great exchange and we have learned from each other, taking the best of both styles." ...|$|E
500|$|After this point, {{the story}} {{continues}} differently {{depending on the}} Hero's alignment. If it is [...] "law", the Law Hero gets killed in a battle with the Chaos Hero, while the Hero and the Heroine go to the basement. On their way they have to kill the Chaos Hero and fight Yuriko, who {{turns out to be}} the demon Lilith in disguise; she calls the Hero [...] "Adam", and says she wanted to create a new age and live with him forever, which is why she tried to execute the Heroine. After defeating her in battle, the Hero and the Heroine reach the basement and kill the demon Asura-ou; they <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cathedral's roof, where they are thanked by a messenger from God. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "chaos", he and the Heroine must go to the top floor and kill the archangel Michael, and on their way kill the Law Hero; the Chaos Hero dies, too, because of the magical ring he has been wearing. On the roof, they meet Lucifer, who says that a new era will begin, where both demons and humans are free; he also warns them that God still is alive. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "neutral", he and the Heroine must kill the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, Asura-ou, and Michael, and fight Yuriko. On the roof, they meet Taishang Laojun, who thanks them and says that balance is needed to achieve happiness; he asks the Hero and the Heroine to lead humanity to a future that doesn't rely on gods or demons. The game ends with the Heroine saying that those who have died will be reborn, and that it is time for creation and rebuilding.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Goodbye Stranger", Castiel {{has been}} {{completely}} brainwashed by Naomi and has killed thousands of copies of Dean ruthlessly. Castiel is sent to find the angel tablet and tortures and kills the demons also looking for it, drawing Sam and Dean's attention. Sam and Dean track down someone who knows the location of one of Lucifer's Crypts where the angel tablet is and in ensuing scuffle, Sam ends up in trouble. Castiel saves Sam and captures one of the demons, claiming under Naomi's orders that he is searching {{for the second half}} of the demon tablet and that the demons are searching for a parchment that will allow them to translate it without a Prophet. Castiel tortures the demon who tells them where to find Meg, but kills her before she can reveal the truth to Sam and Dean. Castiel heads off alone and rescues Meg who explains what the demons really want. While Naomi initially wants her killed to prevent that, Castiel is able to make a case to keep her alive. The group <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> warehouse where the crypt is and before heading inside with Dean, Castiel reveals that Sam is damaged by his trials on a level that even Castiel can't fix. Castiel and Dean locate the angel tablet and Castiel has to have Dean get it as it is warded against angels. However, Naomi orders Castiel to kill Dean and though he fights it, he has no control over his actions. As he is about to kill him, Dean manages to break through to Castiel's heart and he breaks free of Naomi's influence. He picks up the angel tablet which completely severs Naomi's connection to and control over him. Castiel heals Dean and explains what happened, but senses that he must now protect the tablet from everyone, even Dean. Castiel is later seen traveling on a bus to an unknown destination with the tablet. Despite losing the tablet, Naomi is somewhat satisfied as according to her, Castiel is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Naomi later comes to Dean. [...] In an attempt to gain his trust, presumably because she knows Castiel is one of his weak spots, she lies to Dean about Castiel and claims that he misinterpreted everything she has done and is still insane. Dean, of course, doesn't believe her. Despite this, Castiel is eventually captured by Naomi's forces, but the angel tablet is claimed by Crowley after one of Naomi's angels betrays their location, although this gives Castiel time to escape and reunite with the Winchesters after killing the angel guarding him.|$|E
