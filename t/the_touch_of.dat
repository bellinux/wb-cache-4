5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E
5|$|Miyuki is {{considered}} one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed the Yotsuba. Her specialty is freezing magic, and her unique magic allows her to freeze a person's consciousness. In addition, half of her magic casting abilities is used to seal Tatsuya's powers. Before the family vacation in Okinawa, Miyuki treated Tatsuya coldly akin to how the other Yotsuba clan members did. She begins to warm up to him and when Tatsuya saves her life, devotes her existence to him. It evolves to the point she disdains <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> other males and expresses jealousy towards females around Tatsuya. Genetically different from Tatsuya, despite being born from the same parents, Miyuki professes her love to him following their engagement under Maya's orders. She is voiced by Saori Hayami.|$|E
5|$|Though not aggressive, {{the common}} {{stingray}} can inflict an excruciating wound with its serrated, venomous tail spine. The ancient Greeks and Romans greatly feared its venom, with authors such as Aelian (175–235 AD) stating that stingray wounds were incurable. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), in his Natural History, asserted that its spine {{was capable of}} killing trees, piercing armor like an arrow, and corroding iron. Greek poet Oppian (172–210 AD) claimed that <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> stingray venom could even dissolve stone. In Greek mythology, Hercules {{was said to have}} lost a finger to the bite of a stingray, and Circe was said to have armed her son Telegonus with a spear tipped with a stingray spine, with which he accidentally slew his father Odysseus.|$|E

25|$|At {{least a few}} insects have nociceptors, {{cells that}} detect and {{transmit}} sensations of pain. This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a heated probe and an unheated one. The larvae reacted to <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> the heated probe with a stereotypical rolling behavior that was not exhibited when the larvae were touched by the unheated probe. Although nociception has been demonstrated in insects, {{there is not a}} consensus that insects feel pain consciously.|$|E

25|$|Ganga arrogantly fell on Shiva's head. But Shiva calmly trapped her in {{his hair}} and let her out in small streams. <b>The</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> Shiva further sanctified Ganga. As Ganga {{travelled}} to the nether-worlds, she created a different stream to remain on Earth to help purify unfortunate souls there. She is the only river to follow from all the three worlds – Swarga (heaven), Prithvi (Earth) and Patala (netherworld or hell). Thus is called Tripathagā(one who travels the three worlds) in Sanskrit language.|$|E
25|$|The domovoi {{is also an}} oracle, as his {{behavior}} foretells or forewarns about the future. If he laughs, sings, jokes, or dances good times can be expected, and if he strums a comb there is a wedding in the future, but if he wails at night, extinguishes a candle or makes himself visible it means a family member, usually {{the head of the}} household, will die. <b>The</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> the domovoi is also a harbinger. If his furry hand feels warm, good fortune is indicated; however, if his touch is icy cold, misfortune is coming.|$|E

40|$|A {{flat surface}} {{is more often}} judged to be convex after <b>the</b> <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> a concave surface than after <b>the</b> <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> a convex surface. This haptic {{after-effect}} increases with the time of contact with the curved surface till it saturates, and it decreases with the time-lapse between <b>the</b> <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first surface and the next one. In this paper, the haptic after-effect <b>of</b> two successively <b>touched</b> spherically curved surfaces is investigated. It is found that both surfaces contribute to the after-effect, but the after-effect is not additive. The time course of the after-effect of two successive surfaces can be described by a first-order integrator with a single time constant of about 7 s and an amplitude equal {{to the difference between}} the saturation levels of the after-effects of the two surfaces when measured in isolation. The new saturation level is therefore equal to that of the after-effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most recently <b>touched</b> surface...|$|R
25|$|With the V70 Bi-Fuel Volvo {{continued}} {{to offer a}} factory CNG powered car. A 95-litre tank installed in the trunk allowed for a claimed range of 250km running on CNG only. Due to the bulky tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button. On Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster {{was replaced by a}} level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E
25|$|After the {{screening}} room incident, Hughes {{moved into a}} bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides, his wife, and numerous girlfriends. He would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies. This may have been because Hughes found <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> clothing painful due to allodynia. He may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain, especially {{those who do not}} receive adequate treatment. In one year, Hughes spent an estimated $11million at the hotel.|$|E
25|$|Various {{means of}} {{keeping track of}} traffic on the Ho Chi Minh trail were tried by the teams. In early 1967, the CIA's Technical Services Division {{forwarded}} a magnetic traffic sensor {{to be placed on}} the trail; however, it failed to keep accurate count or quit entirely. Finally, the CIA altered a U.S. Air Force survival radio into the Hark-1 radio, which had pictures of enemy troops and trucks next to push buttons. A road watch agent who could neither read nor write clicked a button for every soldier or truck counted; the tallies could be then be radioed to a relay aircraft overhead by <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> another button.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Tyco Toys created {{a line of}} action figures called The Incredible Crash Dummies based on the {{characters}} from the NHTSA television advertisements. They were intended to fall apart at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button on their abdomens. Vehicles which could be crashed into walls and broken were also produced. Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy were produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{incandescent}} gas lighting in factories, homes {{and in the}} streets, replacing oil lamps and candles with steady clear light, almost matching daylight in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night shift work possible in industries where light was all important—in spinning, weaving and making up garments etc. The social significance of this change is difficult for generations brought up with lighting after dark available at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a switch to appreciate. Not only was industrial production accelerated, but streets were made safe, social intercourse facilitated and reading and writing made more widespread. Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets {{to the majority of}} urban households. The invention of the gas meter and the pre-payment meter in the late 1880s {{played an important role in}} selling town gas to domestic and commercial customers.|$|E
25|$|Gandhiji {{stayed in}} the Ashram {{and spoke to the}} volunteers. He tried to boost up their morale, by {{explaining}} to them the principle of Satyagraha and the role of scarifies and suffering in it, and the need for extreme patience. He tried to reach a compromise with the orthodoxy and for this; he had to meet the Savarna leaders. His secretary sent a note of invitation to the Savarna leader Idanthuruthil Devan Neelakandan Namboothiri to come over to the camp. The haughty Namboothiri not only refused to accept the invitation, but also said that those who wanted to see him must go over to his house. So it was that Gandhiji and his party reached the Indanthuruthil Mana (a Namboothiri household) on the next day noon. They were made to sit in the portico of the house, while the Namboothiri and his Savarna comrades occupied the inner room. The Namboothiri believed that Gandhi and his followers were polluted by <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> untouchables, and could not be admitted into the pure interior of an orthodox Mana.|$|E

500|$|The GTS has usually used a more {{powerful}} engine and robust drivetrain than other HSV models, however the E-Series 1 GTS shared the 6.0L LS2 V8 engine with 412bhp (307kW) of power and 405lb·ft (550 N·m) of torque, with the cheaper Clubsport and the luxury Senator. The major difference between the E-Series GTS and other HSV models in the range is the Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide"). MRC utilises magnetorheological dampers to improve the car's handling and dynamics. In the GTS, the MRC can be switched between Performance and Track response modes at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button. MRC is not available on the Clubsport; it is standard equipment of the Senator, but switches between [...] "Luxury" [...] and [...] "Performance", there is no [...] "Track" [...] mode like the GTS has.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} So Beautiful or So What touch on {{subjects}} such as love, mortality, and faith. In terms of songwriting, Simon did not approach each new song with a theme; instead, he let them evolve naturally from the first line he would compose. Simon {{had no plans to}} pursue religious writing, but it ended up particularly strong in the album’s lyrics. He noted that [...] "five of the first six" [...] songs he wrote touched on themes of God: [...] "I wondered whether there was a subconscious theme that I was tapping into. I have used Christian symbols and imagery before in songs. It’s very strongly evocative, so it may just be coincidence—but it may not be." [...] The A.V. Club suggested that the album's gospel influence inspired <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> humor when discussing dark {{subjects such as}} death.|$|E
