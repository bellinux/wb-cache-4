During our attempts to inhibit the nephrotoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics by polyanionic peptides, we discovered that poly-D-glutamic acid (molecular weight, 20 kd; 250 mg/kg/day subcutaneously for 1 to 4 days) produces an acute <b>thesaurismosis</b> in the proximal tubular cells associated with a marked proliferation of peritubular interstitial cells in rat kidney. Thesaurismotic bodies were easily visualized by light microscopy at the basal pole of proximal tubular cells with the cationic stain Giemsa. By electron microscopy, these bodies appeared membrane-limited, frequently distorted, filled with heterogeneous granular material, accessible to injected peroxidase (a tracer of the endocytic pathway), and generally stainable for the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase. Specimens obtained 3 hours after injection of poly-D-glutamic acid and horseradish peroxidase suggested an impairment of endosome and/or lysosome fission, but not fusion. By histoautoradiographic examination after 3 H-thymidine incorporation, global labeling indices of cortical cells were increased 11 - to 18 -fold in poly-D-glutamic acid-treated rats as compared with controls, with > 80 % of labeled cells localized in the interstitium. Distal tubular and glomerular cells also showed a moderate proliferation, but proximal tubular cells showed no significant necrosis or proliferation. Although tubular <b>thesaurismosis</b> persisted, interstitial cell proliferation resolved within 7 days after cessation of treatment. We suggest that poly-D-glutamic acid is a convenient tool to induce a rapid and sustained lysosomal storage disorder. It could also help clarify the relationship between insults to tubular cells and proliferation of peritubular cells, two features frequently associated in tubulointerstitial disorders. The mechanism of the <b>thesaurismosis</b> and of the interference with the dynamics of fusion-fission of the endocytic apparatus are addressed in the companion paper...|$|E
40|$|Considering its complex {{molecular}} pathophysiology, beta-thalassemia {{could be}} a good in vivo model to study some aspects related to erythrocyte functions with potential therapeutic implications not only within the frame of this particular hemoglobinopathy but also with respect to conditions in which the cellular milieu, altered by a deranged anion exchanger, could display a significant pathogenetic role (i. e., erythrocyte senescence, complications of red cell storage, renal tubular acidosis and some abnormal protein <b>thesaurismosis).</b> This work evaluates the anionic influx across band 3 protein in normal and beta-thalassemic red blood cells (RBCs) and ghosts. Since redox-mediated injury is an important pathway in the destruction of beta-thalassemic RBCs, we studied the anion transport and the activity of caspase 3 in the absence and presence of t-butylhydroperoxide in order to evaluate the effect of an increase of cellular oxidative stress. Interestingly, beta-thalassemic erythrocytes show a faster rate of anion exchange than normal RBCs and absence of any modulation mechanism of anion influx. These findings led us to formulate a hypothesis about the metabolic characteristics of beta-thalassemic erythrocytes, outlining that one of the main targets of caspase 3 in RBCs is the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 protei...|$|E
40|$|Coadministration of poly-L-aspartic acid (poly-L-Asp) protects rats {{against all}} {{measured}} signs of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. Based on in vitro and acute in vivo models, previously {{we hypothesized that}} poly-L-Asp protects by forming complexes with the drug in lysomes of proximal tubular cells. However, another closely related peptide, poly-L-glutamic acid (poly-L-Glu), could not protect against gentamicin-induced phospholipidosis and nephrotoxicity, presumably because it is susceptible to rapid hydrolysis in sysosomes in vivo. The present study expands the in vivo comparison between these two polyanions to a subacute model of rats and examines in detail the influence of these polymers on the qualitative and quantitative morphological alterations of lysosomes, phospholipiduria and proliferation of cortical cells induced by gentamicin. Our results not only demonstrated that despite a significantly higher drug cortical accumulation, the coadministration of poly-L-Asp almost completely protects against the development of all these early renal alteration but also pointed {{to the possibility of}} a mild, albeit apparently nonlethal, lysosomal <b>thesaurismosis</b> to develop under these conditions. In contrast, poly-L-Glu could not protect against these early renal alterations, though cortical drug accumulation was not significantly higher; however, it induced a conspicuous proliferation of peritubular interstitial cells. Therefore, the present work, taken together with the earlier results of ours {{as well as that of}} others, tends to strengthen the hypothesis that the site of action of poly-L-Asp must be in lysosomes, which are also the organelles that sequester and accumulate the drug...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{counterpart}} {{is given to}} the data of our investigation about the incidence of infantile amaurotic idiocy (Tay-Sachs) in Switzerland, published here in 1954. The term > is rather unclear and had to be critisised by Letterer. The diagnose of all lipidosis is more difficult than of any other genetic character, as neither a thorough clinical and histological examination nor the chemical analysis of the brain and the big abdominal organs (spleen, liver etc.) is sufficient; it ought always to be completed by the modern histochemical method at least if we want to separate the M. Niemann-Pick from the M. Tay-Sachs. The quarrel between the > and the > concerning the independence of these two phosphatid-lipidosis {{does not seem to be}} ended definitely by chemical analysis of the affected organs. Undoubtfully these two very similar diseases must have many common traits in their pathogenesis. This does not mean, however, that they do not depend on 2 different genes, may be working at the same pheno-genetical chain (Klenk), perhaps there is a pseudo-allely, which as a matter of fact can hardly ever become proved in men. This author showed that the M. Niemann-Pick is regularly characterised by a high percentage of sphingomyelin whilst in the M. Tay-Sachs the gangliosids prevail. But recently this difference is regarded to hold only quantitatively. Therefore we have to look for genetical proofs of the independence of these two lipidosis. An observation of van Bogaert in his famous pedigree of the family Mi. and another less convincing of Driessen show that among the children of the same parents cases of both these lipidosis can appear. Since both these families are of Russian respectively Polish-Jewish origin, coming from a not very big area in which these lipidosis were found relatively very often, these two instances also could be explained by mere coincidence. Our Swiss cases which all happened in families of non Jewish origin do not show sibs the one of whom had M. Tay-Sachs and the other M. Niemann-Pick, nor were combinations of both lipidosis observed. Unfortunately excepted one, namely that of Baumann, Scheidegger & Klenk, none of our cases has been examined with all the modern methods. These 3 specialists established the theory that we deal in the M. Niemann-Pick and M. Tay-Sachs with specific cellular dystrophies and not an overloading of the blood with certain lipids, as was supposed by Pick: For, all values of blood-chemistry, principally of the total amount of fatty acids as well as of cholesterol and of anorganical phospor used to be normal in the serum of those patients. The data published by U. Pfändler could become disguised as rare exceptions or consequences of alterations in a no more fresh serum. His conclusions with regard to the pathogenesis and the way of hereditary transmission cannot become adopted neither for the adult, nor for the infantile forms of Niemann-Pick. The facts found by us and others clearly speak in favour of a simple-recessive transmission, at least for the infantile forms of M. Niemann-Pick, the same has been proved by us for M. Tay-Sachs. Videbaeks pedigree with parents of the 2 children with M. Niemann-Pic being first cousins, is not to be interpreted otherwise. Of our Swiss families with M. Niemann-Pick 3 contain each 2 fraternal and 3 isolated cases; parental consanguinity was found 4 times but not very close though 5 of these families come from isolates. The gene concerned therefore cannot be too rare. Like the other authors we did not observe secondary cases in collateral lines. The oldest of our patients reached the age of 3 ½ years. There is no higher incidence of other hereditary diseases, especially with regard to metabolism, in our 6 Swiss families. From the clinical standpoint there is to mention that 4 of our 5 cases studied in detail showed the typical red spot in the region of the macula retinae; one case showed a complete atrophia nervi optici and another an atrophy of the temporal parts of the papilla nervi optici. In most cases a demencia or > was noted, a fact which suggests the participation of the brain in the processus of the specific <b>thesaurismosis.</b> Unfortunately, however, the brain has but once been examined with the modern histochemical method...|$|E
