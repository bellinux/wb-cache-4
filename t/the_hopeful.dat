The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is vastly improved and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E

500|$|Ten {{days later}} in <b>the</b> <b>Hopeful</b> Stakes, Secretariat made a [...] "dazzling" [...] move, passing eight horses within [...] mile {{to take the lead}} then drawing off to win by five lengths. His time of 1:16 for [...] furlongs was only [...] of a second off the track record. Returning to Belmont Park on September 16, he won the Belmont Futurity by a length and a half after {{starting}} his move on the turn. He then ran in the Champagne Stakes at Belmont on October 14 as the 7–10 favorite. As had become his custom, he started slowly and then made a big move around the turn, blowing past his rivals to win by two lengths. However, following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards, Secretariat was disqualified and placed second for bearing in and interfering with Stop the Music, who was declared the winner.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} seven episodes of the season, Maureen Ryan of Variety gave {{positive}} thoughts on Jessica Jones, stating, [...] "The show, which features an exceptional performance from Krysten Ritter and sure-handed guidance from executive producer Melissa Rosenberg, {{is not just a}} contender for the title Best Marvel-related TV property; in a supremely crowded TV scene, {{it is one of the}} year’s most distinctive new dramas." [...] Jack Shepard of The Independent, also on {{the first seven}} episodes, felt the season [...] "not only matches [...] but exceeds expectations." [...] Shepard gave exceptional praise to Tennant's Kilgrave, feeling he was one of the best villains produced by Marvel, and possibly [...] "the best on-screen comic book villain since Heath Ledger’s Joker." [...] Forbes Merrill Barr stated that after seeing the first seven episodes, [...] "the answer is a resounding yes" [...] if lightning could strike twice for Marvel Television, claiming, [...] "In no uncertain terms, Jessica Jones is the best thing Marvel Television has ever produced. It contains all <b>the</b> <b>hopeful</b> anticipation of [...] S.H.I.E.L.D., all the feminist-overtones of Agent Carter and all the grittiness of Daredevil." ...|$|E
500|$|The city's {{fall was}} not {{a result of the}} Ottoman {{artillery}} nor their naval supremacy (many Italian ships were able to aid and then escape the city). The Fall came about due to the combined weight of overwhelming odds stacked against the city — outnumbered by more than 10 to 1, the defenders were overcome by sheer attrition as well as the skill of the Ottoman Janissaries. As the Ottomans continued their seemingly unsuccessful and costly assaults, many in their camp began to doubt the success of the siege; history had shown the city to be invincible to Ottoman siege and the memories of Ankara and Varna, even if they had not altered the status quo for long, lingered in their minds and in the minds of <b>the</b> <b>hopeful</b> defenders. In an effort to raise morale, the Sultan then made a speech reminding his troops of the vast wealth and pillaging of the city to come. An all-out assault captured the city on May 29, 1453. As the Ottomans fanned out to sack the city, their naval discipline began to collapse and many Genoans and Venetians escaped in vessels from the city, including Niccolò Barbaro, a Venetian surgeon present at the siege who wrote: ...|$|E

2500|$|Since then {{vaccination}} {{campaigns have}} {{spread throughout the}} globe, sometimes prescribed by law or regulations (See Vaccination Acts).

[...] Louis Pasteur further developed the technique during the 19th century, extending its use to killed agents protecting against anthrax and rabies. [...] The method Pasteur used entailed treating the agents for those diseases so they lost the ability to infect, whereas inoculation was <b>the</b> <b>hopeful</b> selection of a less virulent form of the disease, and Jenner's vaccination entailed the substitution of a different and less dangerous disease. [...] Pasteur adopted the name vaccine as a generic term in honor of Jenner's discovery.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{break of}} two months, Grey Momus reappeared in <b>the</b> <b>Hopeful</b> Stakes at Newmarket on 3 October {{for which he}} started 4/7 {{favourite}} despite carrying top weight. He started badly and was left {{with a great deal}} of ground to make up before finishing strongly to take second place behind the 15/1 outsider Saintfoin. At the next Newmarket meeting two weeks later he finished unplaced behind Ion when favourite for the Clearwell Stakes. At the Newmarket Houghton meeting on 30 October, Grey Momus was pitted against Colonel Peel's four-year-old filly Vulture, over five furlongs in a match which was highly anticipated. The match, which attracted keen betting interest, was made for £1000 with Grey Momus receiving 38 pounds from his older rival. At half way, Grey Momus seemed to be struggling, and looked likely to be easily beaten, but he stayed on strongly and was only half a length behind at the finish. Two days later at the same meeting Grey Momus was moved up in distance for one mile sweepstakes in which he prevailed by a neck from Paganini after a [...] "desperate race".|$|E

2500|$|Like all of Vancouver, the West End was {{originally}} a forested wilderness. The area was purchased in 1862 by John Morton, Samuel Brighouse, and William Hailstone, three men {{known as the}} [...] "Three Greenhorn Englishmen," [...] or just the [...] "Three Greenhorns," [...] owing {{to the belief that}} the naive men paid too much for the remote land. The men had plans to establish a brickworks on the shore of Coal Harbour, and their land claim {{was originally}} staked with <b>the</b> <b>hopeful</b> intent of mining for porcelain clays, but the grade of clay was not fine enough for that use. When those plans failed (a lack of transportation being a key factor) they sold {{a good portion of the}} area, by then known as the Brickmaker's Claim, to Victoria investors who in turn tried to promote its development as New Liverpool. The only thing that happened with that scheme was a subdivision plan registered with the Land Titles office in New Westminster. Another name used for the property was the Brighouse Estate (Brighouse as a name came to refer to a particular part of Richmond, where [...] "Greenhorn" [...] J. Morton also owned property). One of the partners, observant that brick was a valuable building commodity despite the abundance of timber in the region, moved the brick-clay operations to Sumas Mountain, establishing the community of Clayburn, now a neighbourhood of Abbotsford.|$|E
2500|$|In fact, she had by now begun {{appearing}} in public almost exclusively as a male. [...] She began {{to refer to}} herself as Mr. Charles Brown and {{although there is no}} way of telling why she chose the name Brown, there is a possibility that it was chosen because of her elder sister, Catherine Brown. She boasted further that a young heiress fell in love with her, believing her to really be a man, and proposed marriage. [...] This resulted, not surprisingly, in disappointment for both Charke and <b>the</b> <b>hopeful</b> heiress. Although the identity of the young woman remains [...] "shadowy", many historians believe that she is indeed [...] "Mrs. Brown". [...] Unable to earn a living in the sanctioned theatres, Charlotte began to work any job she could to support herself and Catherine, but she was always attracted to jobs she could perform as a man. [...] Therefore, she was a valet to Richard Annesley, 6th Earl of Anglesey, and then even took up as a sausage maker. [...] Anglesey was famous as a bigamist and libertine, and lived with a paramour during Charlotte's employ. Charlotte claimed that when Anglesey was not entertaining guests, the trio would dine together as friendly equals. As a valet's service would indeed be personal, normally including dressing one's master for the day, the entire arrangement would have been quite unusual. [...] (Anglesey was soon a central party to an infamous scandal, being dispossessed of his lands—but allowed to continue using his title—after a court ruled that he had sold his young kinsman, James Annesley, who had a better claim to the inheritance, into slavery.) ...|$|E
