Obtained from them were horizontal and vertical components of surface velocities of the ice sheet at 141 stations and also principal strains, maximum shear strains, dilatations, and rotations of the surface ice in 140 triangles of the chain. Horizontal velocities of the ice sheet showed small values {{in the vicinity of}} the Yamato Mountains, and maximum values of more than 20 m/year in a region between 39 °E and 40 °E. Direction of the flow vector was approximately identical with that of the large-scale maximum slope of the ice surface, but the direction and magnitude of the principal strain showed influence by small-scale surface undulations. In general, the direction of the maximum extension of strain was rather close to that of the ice flow. Tensile strains were more common than compressive strains almost all over Mizuho Plateau. The vertical component of ice velocity was directed downward, which is characteristic of the submergence flow, in the region from 39 °E eastward. The amount of snow accumulation was not enough to compensate the deficit of ice mass caused by the submergence flow along the <b>triangulation</b> <b>chain.</b> The mass budget was negative in the zone of 2400 - 2600 m in elevation in the Shirase drainage...|$|E
5000|$|From its {{inception}} in 1600 {{to the beginning of}} the nineteenth century, the British East India Company gained more territory on the Indian subcontinent. With the acquisition of new territory, it employed several explorers and cartographers to provide maps and other information on its territories, most notably James Rennell, from 1767 in Bengal. As Rennell proceeded making maps, some serious flaws in them surfaced, based on a lack of precise measurements. In 1800, shortly after the English victory over Tipu Sultan, William Lambton, an infantry soldier with experience in surveying proposed to remedy precisely that, through a series of triangulations initially through the newly acquired territory of Mysore and eventually across the entire subcontinent.The Great Trigonometrical Survey of India started on 10 April 1802 with the measurement of a baseline near Madras. Major Lambton selected the flat plains with St. Thomas Mount at the north end and Perumbauk hill at the southern end. The baseline was 7.5 mi long. Lieutenant Kater was despatched to find high vantage points on the hills of the west so that the coastal points of Tellicherry and Cannanore could be connected. The high hills chosen were Mount Delly and Tadiandamol. The distance from coast to coast was 360 mi and this survey line was completed in 1806. The East India Company thought that this project would take about 5 years but eventually it took nearly 70 years well past the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the end of company rule in India. Because of the extent of the land to be surveyed, the surveyors did not triangulate the whole of India but instead created what they called a [...] "gridiron" [...] of <b>triangulation</b> <b>chains</b> running from North to South and East to West. At times the survey party numbered 700 people. The Trigonometrical Survey was conducted independent of other surveys, notably the topographical and revenue surveys. In 1875, the decision was taken that the Survey budget should be reduced from 240,000 to 200,000 pounds. This resulted in a reorganization under Surveyor-General Colonel J.T. Walker to amalgamate the Great Trigonometrical, Topographical and Revenue Surveys into the Survey of India.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} new {{results on}} the subject of polygonal structure reconfiguration. Specifically, the types of structures considered here are polygons, polygonal <b>chains,</b> <b>triangulations,</b> and polyhedral surfaces. A sequence of vertices (points), successively joined by straight edges, is a polygonal chain. If the sequence is cyclic, then the object is a polygon. A planar triangulation is a set of vertices with a maximal number of non-crossing straight edges joining them. A polyhedral surface is a three-dimensional structure consisting of flat polygonal faces that are joined by common edges. For each of these structures there exist several methods of reconfiguration. Any such method must provide a well-defined way of transforming one instance of a struc-ture to any other. Several types of reconfigurations are reviewed in the introduction, which is followed by new results. We begin with efficient algorithms for comparing monotone chains. Next, we prove that flat chains with unit-length edges and an-gles within a wide range always admit reconfigurations, under the dihedral model of motion. In this model, angles and edge lengths are preserved. For the universa...|$|R

This program included a glaciological study to elucidate the mechanism of accumulation {{of a large number}} of meteorites in the bare ice area. In December 1978,a <b>triangulation</b> <b>chain</b> with 20 stations, 15 km in length, was newly established in the Allan Hills bare ice field to investigate the ice flow. Values of elevation and coordinates (X, Y) of all stations are tabulated. The error in elevation of farthest station from the datum point is ± 7 cm, and errors in position of the same station are ± 0. 932 m in X coordinate and ± 1. 128 m in Y coordinate. The extensive bare ice area on the ice sheet surface in the vicinity of the Allan Hills is located upstream of the mountain range, and the bare ice fields inland west to the plateau of the East Antarctic ice sheet are located in the neighborhood of a sub-ice bedrock mountain. Therefore, the ice flow coming down towards the Allan Hills or into the Mawson Glacier should be forced to make an upward movement in the neighborhood of the mountains...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Dev. Studies) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. The study {{examines}} the woodcraft {{trade in the}} Hazyview area {{through the application of}} the value chain methodology as adapted from the works of writers such as Kaplinsky and Morris (2001), McCormick and Schmitz (2002) and Sturgeon (2001). Several methods of collecting data were employed (<b>triangulation)</b> : value <b>chain</b> analysis, interviews, observation and focus group discussions. The findings reveal that the woodcraft value chain comprises several actors: the informal craft workers, assistant craft workers, retailers and consumers of crafts, located at the various levels of the chain. The informal craft workers, who are the main focus of this study, are mostly involved in the production and selling level of the value chain, while the formal traders (e. g. craft retailers, wholesalers, curio shop owners) are involved in selling, marketing and branding of the crafts. Although craft workers also sell and 'market' their crafts by the roadside, the findings show that these activities do not yield substantial profit for them, as they lack the necessary rents to make a sustainable income out of crafts. The lack of innovation (introduction of new products), product diversification, access to new markets, and other factors that characterize the informal wood craft trade have implications in terms of competitiveness and the sustainability of the woodcraft trade as a source of income of the informal traders. The findings show that the challenges facing the informal woodcraft traders are also aggravated by high levels of competition that has emerged in recent years due to globalization and democratization, which have seen the opening of South African borders to craft workers {{from other parts of the}} world, especially Africa. Of importance though is the fact that the informal traders lack crucial rents that are essential for them to remain competitive. These rents include: resource, marketing, infrastructure, financial and policy rents. The findings show that, unless traders acquire these rents their trade remains uncompetitive and unsustainable. There are also economic and environmental implications emanating from the findings as the analysis shows that wood for carving is no longer a free natural resource as it used to be in the past years, but a scarce economic resource. The analysis further shows that the problems that traders experience are both endogenous and exogenous in nature. It is clear that traders need to deal with endogenous issues such as innovation, upgrading of the value chains, diversification and other internal issues and processes. With the necessary support, traders could deal with these problems. Policy would, however, need to address exogenous issues such as controlling the flooding of the SA craft market with cheap crafts, mostly from the neighbouring states and other countries in Africa (not excluding countries outside the continent of Africa). Creating an 'enabling environment' for the woodcraft trade is important e. g. Financial, logistic, capital and other support measures. Indeed, what has emerged in the analysis of this study is that people's livelihoods (under the current and prevailing conditions) are under threat. In the context of poverty and high unemployment levels, something would have to be done to deal with the crisis facing the informal traders. This study concludes by making the necessary recommendations on what could be done to redress the situation...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of accumulation {{of a large}} number of meteorites in the bare ice area near the Allan Hills in South Victoria Land has been investigated by surveying a <b>triangulation</b> <b>chain</b> of 20 stations, 15 km in total length, during the 1978 - 79 and 1979 - 80 field seasons. The horizontal and vertical components of surface velocities of the ice sheet in the bare ice area at 18 stations and the parameters of surface strains at 18 triangles of the chain were obtained. The horizontal velocity of the ice sheet at the station farthest from the datum point is 2. 51 m/year and the velocity vector principally points in a northeast direction which is perpendicular to the contour lines. The magnitude of horizontal velocities gradually decreases from a maximum at station 20 to nearly zero at the stations near the Allan Hills. The vertical movements of the bare ice are emergent at a rate of 4. 5 cm/year on the average in the region of high meteorite accumulation, while in the area of the further inland the vertical ice flow shows small submergence velocities. Ablation rates are ranging from 4. 2 to 7. 0 cm/year with an average of 5. 7 cm/year and are balanced on the average by the emergent velocity of the ice in the meteorite accumulation area. Compressive strains are predominant in most of the triangle areas and the horizontal dilatation of each triangle area is negative (horizontal convergence). These characters of ice flow are favorable for accumulation {{of a large number}} of meteorites on the bare ice surface in a small area, and also support a proposed hypothesis by NAGATA (1978) on the {{mechanism of}} concentration of Yamato meteorites within the Meteorite Ice Field near the Yamato Mountains in East Queen Maud Land, where the triangulation survey has also shown an upward flow of ice...|$|E
