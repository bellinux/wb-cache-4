40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to move beyond the market/non-market divide and to {{recognise}} the plurality of labour practices in societies by adopting a variant of what Glucksmann calls “a <b>total</b> <b>social</b> organisation of labour” approach. Design/methodology/approach – To transcend the conventional depiction of separate market and non-market spheres, this paper adopts a <b>total</b> <b>social</b> organisation of <b>labour</b> approach which recognises a multiplicity of labour practices existing on a spectrum from market to non-market practices crosscut by another spectrum from wholly monetised to wholly non-monetised practices. This conceptual lens is employed to analyse the results of 861 face-to-face interviews on the labour practices used in affluent and deprived urban and rural English localities. Findings – The outcome is to reveal the multifarious labour practices in these English localities along with how both work cultures and the nature of individual labour practices vary socio-spatially. While affluent and rural populations draw more on an array of market-oriented and monetised labour practices, deprived populations and urban localities are found to rely more on a range of non-market and non-monetised labour practices, and all labour practices are more likely to be conducted out of necessity in deprived and urban populations and out of choice in affluent and rural populations. Research limitations/implications – The paper only provides a snapshot survey. It does not show the changes taking place over time. Practical implications – It reveals how it is mistaken to privilege the development of labour practices in the formal market economy and displays the feasibility of, and possibilities for, alternative futures beyond market hegemony. Originality/value – The paper transcends the market/non-market dualism and proposes an alternative conceptual framework to capture the multifarious labour practices in societies.

40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this paper is}} recognition that the depiction of a formal/informal labour dualism, which views formal and informal labour as separate and hostile realms, is inappropriate for capturing the range of labour practices in societies. This is because labour practices cannot be neatly separated into discrete formal and informal realms, the differences within the formal and informal spheres are as great as {{the differences between the two}} realms, and formal and informal labour are not always embedded in different economic relations, values and motives. Here, an alternative more nuanced conceptual lens is proposed that resolves these problems and in so doing captures the multifarious labour practices in societies, namely the <b>total</b> <b>social</b> organization of <b>labour</b> (TSOL) perspective. This depicts labour practices as existing along a spectrum from more formal-oriented to more informal-oriented practices and cross-cuts this with a further spectrum from non-monetized, through in-kind and reciprocal labour, to monetized labour. Applying this conceptual lens, the results of a survey of the anatomy of labour practices in an affluent, mixed and deprived district of Moscow, comprising 313 face-to-face interviews, are then analysed. This reveals that socio-spatial variations in the organisation of labour are not solely about the degree of formalization of working life. Instead, this study unravels that populations range from relatively affluent ẃork busyṕopulations undertaking, and voluntarily selecting from, a multiplicity of labour practices, to relatively disadvantaged ẃork deprivedṕopulations engaged in a narrower range of practices and more commonly out of necessity and in the absence of alternatives. The outcome is call for both the wider application and refinement of this TSOL approach when mapping the <b>social</b> organisation of <b>labour</b> and evaluations of whether the findings from Moscow are more widely valid in other societal contexts.

40|$|Chile enjoys {{relative}} {{economic and}} political stability, but has enormous class, gender and labour market inequalities. Women’s employment participation is low – the lowest in Latin America. This research aims to explain this low female participation rate by looking at women’s experiences, the continuing barriers they face around paid employment, the tension between paid work and family life, and the factors {{that lead to the}} decisions they make. It examines normative gendered roles and gendered relations, highlighting diverse experiences between social groups. The study is qualitative, based on 60 semi-structured interviews with upper/middle- and working-class women in Santiago, Chile. The conceptual framework is based on the <b>Total</b> <b>Social</b> Organisation of <b>Labour</b> and is informed by the concepts of gender regime and gender order. I explore the way in which women conceptualise work and the implications of this for their self-esteem, the valuation of women’s work, and their place in society. The conceptualisation of work shapes (mis) recognition, (mis) representation and (mal) distribution of un/paid labour. I argue that structural and cultural factors put women off the labour market. The main obstacles women face when engaging with paid employment are structural (lack of childcare, education, transport time and costs, long working hours) and cultural (machismo, discrimination, traditional division of labour). Most women experience these barriers, which take different forms according to class. Women would like more support, a smaller gender pay gap, wider childcare provision and fewer working hours. The Chilean gender order is characterised by a ‘traditional’ gender division of labour in a ‘modern’ context. It displays a male-breadwinner/female-home-carer model with little State support, meaning women rely on individual (re) sources. The distribution of un/paid work is a private problem variously resolved by individual (gendered) strategies. This research contributes to knowledge by providing feminist analysis and understanding of the low female workforce participation rate...|$|R
