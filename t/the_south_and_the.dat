Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya neighborhood in <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> railway station.

5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Albanian {{independence}} movement gathered momentum. On 28 November 1912 in Vlorë, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence, and a provisional government was soon formed that exercised its authority {{only in the}} immediate area of Vlorë. Elsewhere, the Ottoman general Essad Pasha formed the Republic of Central Albania at Durrës, while conservative Albanian tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler. Most of the area that would form the Albanian state was occupied at this time, by the Greeks in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Serbs in the north.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 16th century, eastern Honduras {{was still}} beyond the {{frontier}} of conquest.

The territory was well populated by a diverse range of indigenous peoples, including Lencas, Nahuas and Misumalpas. The exact political composition of the territory was unknown to the Spanish, such that the Spanish Crown prohibited campaigns of conquest and reduction in Taguzgalpa owing to ignorance of its makeup.|$|E

By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, {{the difference being due}} to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.|$|E
