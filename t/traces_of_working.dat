50|$|In {{studying}} the wear on a lithics, different techniques are often used. A distinction is often made between use-wear and microwear analysis. Use-wear uses an approach of low magnification study while micro-wear employs high magnification; this raises contentions {{as to which}} approach is more useful. Therefore, use-wear studies regularly employ magnification up to 50x, while magnification beyond 50x is relegated to microwear analysis. In addition to {{the two groups of}} magnification in which researchers align themselves, a third group examines evidence of use by attempting to identify organic residues present on a lithic. The organic residues are analyzed {{in order to understand the}} activities the lithics were used for such as butchering, or other tasks which can leave behind <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> with wood, ceramics, or plant remains.|$|E

40|$|In 1994 and 1996, Peter Bellwood {{and colleagues}} {{excavated}} Golo Cave, an archaeological site on Gebe Island, eastern Indonesia. This excavation uncovered {{a number of}} artefacts, including examples of modified shells. Fragments of Nautilus pompilius were also uncovered, however, due to difficulty identifying <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> on the unique structure of Nautilus shell, it was uncertain if these fragments represented worked samples or not. This paper presents {{the findings of a}} number of experiments aimed at determining the origins of the Nautilus shell fragments recovered from Golo Cave. Firstly, whole shell specimens of Nautilus shell were fractured using an INSTRON machine to generate examples of an edge formed through natural compaction. Secondly, a number of materials were used to experimentally work modern samples of Nautilus belauensis, with particular attention paid to abrasion and score-snap experiments. The INSTRON and experimentally worked samples were then examined using both low-power and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to identify the traces of natural breakage and deliberate modification respectively. Once these traces had been established, the Nautilus samples from Golo Cave were also examined using low-power and high-power (SEM) microscopy to identify any similar patterns between the INSTRON fractured samples or the experimentally worked samples. It was found that some of the Golo Cave fragments had indeed been deliberately worked by humans, with positive identification of working traces found on some of the samples. Naturally fractured edges were also recognised on Golo Cave fragments when compared to the INSTRON fractured specimens. An ethnographic study within this project also examined the past and current use of Nautilus shell as a raw material in a Solomon Island context {{to gain a better understanding}} of the practical and cultural significance of its use in the present day and the past. This component was used to develop the methodology for this project, but also found that the general trend of Nautilus shell use has transitioned from having a strong cultural and spiritual importance to having a more economic importance in recent decades...|$|E

They found {{the remains of a}} settlement which was elliptical in shape and about 190 x 120 m in size. The remains of some of the buildings and bridges were discovered. Willow wickerwork, straw, grain and plants provide an insight into how they lived and what they ate. Today there are about 1,400 bronze artifacts from Mörigen in Swiss museums along with a number in foreign countries. Refining vessels along with sandstone and clay molds provide evidence of bronze refining at Mörigen.

50|$|On April 30, 1877, French poet, humorous {{writer and}} {{inventor}} Charles Cros submitted a sealed envelope containing {{a letter to}} the Academy of Sciences in Paris fully explaining his proposed method, called the paleophone. Though no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> a <b>working</b> paleophone was ever found, Cros is remembered as the earliest inventor of a sound recording and reproduction machine. The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical phonograph cylinder, invented by Thomas Edison in 1877 and patented in 1878. The invention soon spread across the globe and {{over the next two decades}} the commercial recording, distribution, and sale of sound recordings became a growing new international industry, with the most popular titles selling millions of units by the early 1900s. The development of mass-production techniques enabled cylinder recordings to become a major new consumer item in industrial countries and the cylinder was the main consumer format from the late 1880s until around 1910.|$|R
50|$|Once metals are cleaned, metallurgists use microscopes {{to examine}} minute {{details of the}} metals in order to reveal {{information}} regarding composition and manufacturing techniques. For example, the artifact shape, cracks, and places where pieces of metal were joined together can be identified. Additionally, one garner information pretianing to casting errors, mould seams and decorative work. Metallography exams {{the size and shape}} of the grains of minerals in the materials for <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> heating, <b>working</b> and alloying. Scanning electron microscopes are also utilized to explore manufacturing techniques used for jewellery and weapons making. This is because they enable fine detail to be identified, such as when they examine the hammering of folded layers of metal to create a sword. Additionally the identification of the marks of the tools that were used to make the artifact can inform studies of manufacturing techniques. Also, other techniques are used to identify types of metals. For example, Atomic absorption spectroscopy is used to identify alloys of gold, bronze and copper. However, this is not as effective if an artifact contains multiple types of metals.|$|R

[...] (died in the year ... Lord ...). This slab has experienced four other overhauls before it ceased to be used because burials in the churches were abandoned for reasons of hygiene in the mid-19th century.Now it will be tried to preserve the plate and the few recognizable elements to it.It would first have to be erected to prevent the collection of rainwater.

40|$|Research {{on working}} memory has {{revealed}} a developmental trend in memory performance, but a controversy exists {{as to whether}} the improved performance is due to a developmental increase in working memory total processing space (M-space), is the result of more efficient processing and storage of material, or is due to the use of "chunking " or other mnemonic strategies by older children. A study <b>traced</b> the development <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory span and examined the relationship between metacognitive knowledge about reading and memory, M-space, and working memory performance in skilled and less-skilled readers. Subjects, 32 second, fourth, and sixth grade children, completed a series of memory and metacognition measures and M-space tasks. Results substantiated a developmental increase in working memory span performance. The pattern of grade and reader effects found for the span tasks suggests that the trend in working memory performance resulted from an increase in the processing efficiency of mental operations, rather than from an increase in the total processing space. Metacognitive ability was marginally related to working memory performance.

40|$|Introduction: This study {{compared}} 5 auditory, event-related potential (ERP) components (from P 1 to P 3, 50 to 500 ms post stimulus) after 3 tones differing {{in pitch}} and in rarity presented to {{three groups of}} children. The mismatch negativity (MMN), the ERP <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> auditory <b>working</b> memory for deviant stimuli was also studied. Methods: Topographic recordings were derived from 19 electrodes over the scalp of 12 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) : mean 10. 2 years-of age), 12 healthy controls matched for age, and 10 with chronic complex Tic- or Tourette syndrome (TS), who also showed symptoms of attention-deficit. Results: Four major effects are reported: a) Shorter ERP latencies were evident in ADHD children as early as 100 ms after the stimulus; b) Both ADHD and TS children showed larger P 2 component amplitudes than the controls with their maxima shifted more anteriorly; c) Frontal MMN was not significantly different between ADHD and healthy controls, but the normalised data showed a left-sided distribution in the ADHD group and a right-sided distribution in the normal children. Maxima for TS children was unusually more posterior. (In adults the distribution is normally frontal and bilateral.) d) ADHD patients did not show the usual right-biased P 3 asymmetric distribution (nor a frontal vs. parietal latency difference). Conclusions: These results suggest that ADHD children process information faster from the early N 1 (c. 100 ms) stage. Both groups of children with attention-deficit symptoms showed a marked enhancement of the inhibitory phase of processing in the auditory cortex marked by P 2. That this is shown even after a standard stimulus indicates an increased likelihood of unimportant stimuli being further processed and coming to control behaviour, while stimuli competing for attention are suppressed. Later indices of processing (N 2 -P 3) showed a frontal impairment (TS), especially in the right hemisphere (ADHD) that are suggested to be indicative of anomalous timing {{in the development of}} frontal function...|$|R
