5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> worked with Team Bondi management, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> {{came to understand that}} this was a terrible idea.|$|E

5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} {{passed to the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) when it was {{established}} in 1997 to review alleged miscarriages of justice. The CCRC referred {{the case to the}} Court of Appeal in March 2001 on the grounds that new DNA testing on the silencer constituted fresh evidence. The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002 at the Royal Courts of Justice by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002. The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Bamber by Michael Turner QC. In a 522-point judgment, the judges said that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> examined the case, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> thought the jury had been right.|$|E

5|$|During combat, Aya gains {{experience}} {{points and}} gains experience levels when a certain quantity is achieved. Gaining a level both restores her health and raises her maximum health and energy levels. Weapons also gain levels <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> are used. In addition to leveling up, Aya's stats can be customized using Over Energy (OE) clips found during missions or acquired during Overdive attacks.

5|$|Theoretically, {{all life}} forms {{are said to}} deserve full {{protection}} {{from all kinds of}} injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life.

5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

5000|$|In the AAP's opinion, such {{punishment}}s, {{as well as}} [...] "physical punishment {{delivered in}} anger with intent to cause pain", are [...] "unacceptable and may be dangerous {{to the health and}} well-being of the child."

25|$|The {{liquidation}} of debt {{could not}} keep up with the fall of prices which it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> owed. This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.|$|E

25|$|While most medical {{transcription}} agencies prefer {{candidates with}} a minimum of one year experience, formal instruction is not a requirement, and there is no mandatory test. Some hospitals require nothing more than a diploma for employment as a medical transcriptionist. The average pay range for an in-house MT in a hospital setting is $8/hr. However, MT/HDS can expect to receive anywhere from $12-$19 an hour, depending if they are working in a union or non-union environment. This large gap is because the job is based on production, so the more an MT can produce, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> can make.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the reasons}} for this {{production}} gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to <b>the</b> Internet. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster <b>the</b> connection, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> opportunities <b>they</b> have to gain the technology skills and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> time <b>they</b> have to be creative.|$|R

25|$|Sweating {{dissipated}} heat through evaporation. Early humans, like chimpanzees now, had few sweat glands, {{and most of}} them were located in the palms of the hand and the soles of feet. At times, individuals with more sweat glands were born. These humans could search for food and hunt for longer periods before being forced back to the shades. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> could forage, more and healthier offspring they could produce, and higher the chance they had to pass on their genes for abundant sweat glands. With less hair, sweat could evaporate more easily and cool the body of humans faster. A few million years of evolution later, early humans had sparse body hair and more than 2 million sweat glands in their body.|$|E
25|$|Seniors’ {{subjective}} health remains {{relatively stable}} while objective health worsens with age. Furthermore, {{it seems that}} the perceived health improves with age when objective health is controlled in the equation. This phenomenon is known as the paradox of ageing. People's expectations concerning health co-evolve with the health norms surrounding one's age. Elderly people often associate their functional and physical decline with the normal ageing process. The elderly may actually enhance their perception of their own health through social comparison; for instance, the older people get, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> may consider themselves in better health than their same-aged peers. Hence, the older a person becomes and the more their actual health declines, the greater the potential role is for social comparison processes to create a gap between a person's objective and subjective health.|$|E
25|$|The {{more time}} {{participants}} {{are allowed to}} make some judgment about a person, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> will weigh information beyond physical appearance. Specific manipulations include identifying men as gay versus straight and people as trustworthy or not. In {{a study of the}} interaction between ratings of people in speed dating and the form of media used to present them, impression accuracy in a speed dating task was not significantly different when a potential date was presented in person versus in a video. However, impressions of dates made via video were to be much more negative than those made in person. An additional study that looked at characterization of a romantic partner suggested that {{people are more likely to}} rely on “gut reactions” when meeting in person, but there isn't sufficient information for this kind of evaluation when viewing someone online.|$|E

25|$|Krill {{typically}} {{follow a}} diurnal vertical migration. It has been assumed that they {{spend the day}} at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. The deeper they go, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Swimming activity in krill varies with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefore sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce feces which implies {{a role in the}} Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. Vertical migration may be a 2–3 times daily occurrence. Some species (e.g., Euphausia superba, E. pacifica, E. hanseni, Pseudeuphausia latifrons, and Thysanoessa spinifera) form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of their {{apparent}} success, the members of TLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 3, 1995. TLC declared debts totaling $3.5 million, some of it due to Lopes' insurance payments arising from the arson incident and Watkins' medical bills, but the primary reason being that the group received {{what they called a}} less than favorable deal from Pebbitone. After Arista Records, LaFace, and Pebbitone recouped their investment for recording costs and manufacturing and distribution (common recoupable charges in most record contracts), both Pebbitone and LaFace Records went on to charge for expenses such as airline travel, hotels, promotion, music videos, food, clothing, and other expenses. According to the members of TLC, ironically, the more successful the album became, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> were in debt. In addition to this, managers, lawyers, producers, and taxes had to be paid, leaving each member of the group with less than $50,000 a year after having sold millions upon millions of albums.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{assumptions}} underlie their game theoretic model, {{and allow for}} the authors' simplified model of society. First, Acemoglu and Robinson assume that society is simply divided between a small rich class and a large poor class. Second, they assume that regimes must be either democratic or nondemocratic; {{there is nothing in}} between. Third, people's preferences in society are defined only by monetary redistribution from the rich ruling class. The more monetary benefits they get, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> prefer the ruling class. Fourth, people care not only about redistribution today but also redistribution in the future. Therefore, people would not only want more redistribution today but also they want to see a guarantee for more or stable redistribution in the future. Fifth, the economic output of a country fluctuates year by year, which means revolution is less costly for the ruling class during economic downturn. Finally and most importantly, each individual in the society tries to maximize their own utility.|$|E

50|$|Wishpool {{marked a}} {{different}} creative approach for Brother Cane; rather than writing {{about a dozen}} songs before entering the studio, the band took {{an extended period of}} time to write almost 40 songs, with the idea that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> songs <b>they</b> wrote, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> strong ones <b>they</b> would have to choose from.|$|R

25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for the {{following}} reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>they</b> like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds {{he has a new}} baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.|$|E
500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets".

[...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E
