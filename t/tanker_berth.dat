50|$|The <b>Tanker</b> <b>Berth</b> was {{completed}} in 1980 and {{is dedicated to the}} transfer of dangerous goods in bulk. Activities include the discharging and/or loading of tankers carrying bulk fluids such as hydrocarbon oil products, chemicals and edible oils. A conveyor system is also used for loading wood-chips. The facility consists of a free standing wharf of 80 metres in length with dolphins at each end allowing for ships of up to 250 metres LOA to berth and pump ashore.|$|E
50|$|An onshore {{pipeline}} system {{had been established}} during the war that fed petroleum from <b>tankers</b> <b>berthed</b> at London, Bristol and Merseyside to airfields in Southern England. PLUTO was fed via a spur established to Lepe, a hamlet {{on the shore of}} The Solent. From there, a length of HAMEL pipe took fuel under the Solent to a bay near Cowes on the Isle of Wight, through an overland pipe across the island to Shanklin.|$|R
5|$|In Valdez, where Fluor had supervision, {{the work}} also was divided among several contractors. Site {{preparation}} {{work was done}} by Morrison-Knudsen. Chicago Bridge & Iron Company built the tank farms, the <b>tanker</b> <b>berths</b> were built by Kiewest (a venture of Peter Kiewit Sons and Willamette-Western Corporation), and General Electric insulated the pipes. Fluor also had supervision {{of the construction of}} the pumping stations, which were generally built by the contractors working on a specific section of the pipeline.|$|R
500|$|At {{the end of}} the {{pipeline}} is the Valdez Marine Terminal, which can store [...] of oil. Eighteen storage tanks provide this capacity. They are [...] tall and [...] in diameter. They average 85% full at any given time—. Three power plants at the terminal generate 12.5 megawatts each. Four <b>tanker</b> <b>berths</b> are available for mooring ships in addition to two loading berths, where oil pumping takes place. More than 19,000 tankers have been filled by the marine terminal since 1977.|$|R
50|$|The Paulsboro Refinery is a 950 acre {{facility}} abutting Paulsboro {{in adjacent}} Gibbstown (Greenwich Township) and processes medium-to-heavy sour crude oils to produce unbranded gasoline, heating oil, and jet fuel. It {{is one of}} only two facilities on the East Coast able to process petroleum coke. It became a Special Purpose Subzone 142A of Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) No. 142 in 1995. In 1998, Valero Energy Corporation purchased the facility from Mobil and in 2010 sold it to PBF with backing from Blackstone Group and First Reserve Corporation.

50|$|Such {{specialist}} {{work was}} part of a pattern that quickly developed in the company's operations during that period, namely the undertaking of innovative, state-of-the-art civil engineering techniques at the forefront of modern technology. Other elements within this pattern were hyperbolic natural draft cooling towers (mostly around 300 ft high), monolithic concrete chimneys (sometimes over 400 ft high), complete power station structures, and coastal works such as <b>tanker</b> <b>berths,</b> docks and harbours.In the same period, only this time in the building sector, Kier were in the vanguard of new reinforced concrete systems for use as framework for tall buildings. Their most famous contribution in this field was an eight-storey avant-garde development of apartment blocks named Highpoint, located in Highgate Village, north London. They were responsible for the reinforced concrete and general building.|$|R
500|$|The Valdez Marine Terminal, the {{southern}} end of the pipeline, was planned for a site across the Port Valdez fjord from Valdez proper. Initial studies predicted bedrock would be six feet below the surface of the ground, but when excavation began, it was discovered that bedrock actually was sixty feet down, requiring the removal of [...] of overburden. The terminal itself was designed to be built with four <b>tanker</b> <b>berths</b> and space for a fifth, should it become necessary. Holding tanks were planned that had a capacity equal to that of the pipeline, allowing the whole pipeline to be emptied if required. As required by the Pipeline Authorization Act, a ballast-water filtration system had to be designed as well. This system removes oil from tankers' ballast water so it is not released into Prince William Sound—something fishermen feared when the pipeline was proposed.|$|R

5000|$|The planned project {{consists}} of two parallel pipelines between an inland terminal at Bruderheim, Alberta, and a marine terminal in Kitimat, British Columbia, each with a length of 1177 km. Crude oil produced from oil sands would be transported from Bruderheim to Kitimat, while natural gas condensate would move in the opposite direction. Condensate would {{be used as a}} diluent in oil refining to decrease the viscosity of heavy crude oil from oil sands, and {{to make it easier to}} transport by pipelines. About 520 km of pipeline would run in Alberta and 657 km in British Columbia. [...] The crude oil pipeline would have a diameter of 36 in and a capacity of [...] The condensate pipeline would have a diameter of 20 in with a capacity of [...] Enbridge expects these pipelines to be completed by 2015.

50|$|The vessel, {{under the}} flag of Equatorial Guinea and with an Indian crew, was under way to Alang, India, to be scrapped, when it {{suffered}} engine failure and almost drifted ashore near the Eastern Cape town of Hamburg. The salvage tug Smit Amandla had been despatched to tow it to Durban. The South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) contacted the owners who initially undertook to charter a tug to replace the Smit Amandla and complete the voyage to India. When communications broke down, SAMSA applied for a court order for the detention, seizure and sale of the uninsured vessel. The court order was granted on 22 July, but its complete execution was delayed by further red tape when South Africa's chief harbour master, Rufus Lekala, refused to allow the <b>tanker</b> to <b>berth</b> in Durban. During this delay the weather deteriorated considerably {{in the area where}} the Phoenix lay at anchor, in compliance with the order.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the moment}} oil was {{discovered}} in Persia (now Iran) in May 1908, the issue arose of how best to ship it back to Britain. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) initially employed independent contractors; principally the Asiatic Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, to carry the oil by sea. In 1912 the company acquired its first ocean going ship, the SS Ferrara, a conventional freighter that carried oil products in metal cases. [...] <b>Tankers</b> couldn't <b>berth</b> in Abadan owing to a natural sand bar off the coast known as the Shatt-al-Arab Bar, and often had to anchor up to 40 miles from the port. This meant oil had to be lightered out to the ships. Accordingly, APOC made two further shipping purchases, a barge Friesland and a tug Sirdar-i-Naphte. This situation remained until the mid 1920s when the bar was eventually dredged to allow ships {{direct access to the}} port.|$|R

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the feasibility of}} a special floating pier {{at the port of}} Caripito. This port, located along the Rio San Juan, is the port of embarkment for many oil fields in north-east Venezuela. A few years ago some dolphins at the port collapsed. These problems are mainly caused by river bank slidings. As a result one pier has not been used since. In this situation a floating pier might offer some interesting advantages: - the pier itself it not affected by river bank slidings; - meander processes can change the course of a river. If the pier can not be used at it's original place anymore, it can be moved to another; - the pier and the tanker follow the tide together. Loading operations are influenced less; - the pier can be build off site, at a place where work conditions are optimized. It is finally floated and transported to the right location. Until today floating piers have served at many cargo ports. Generally these cargo piers are very large. On the other hand conventional oil piers always have a small loading platform. It is mainly used to support the oil pipes which lead to the tanker. A floating oil pier can only be economically competitive if it is small too. A small floating platform can be displaced easily. This study will evaluate a new type of floating pier, which utilizes this ability: When the tanker has arrived, then it's head and stern mooring lines are fastened to buoys. Next the spring lines are fastened to the small floating platform. The tanker's winches pull the platform to it's hull. Now the oil loading process can be executed. Finally the platform is withdrawn towards the river bank and the tanker leaves the pier. Different aspects of the platform are investigated. The construction itself, it's stability, the wind and current forces on the tanker and on the platform, the resulting displacements of the tanker and the magnitude of the breasting energy. Unfortunately it must be concluded that the piers at the port of Caripito do not provide enough space. Nevertheless the movable platform will offer an interesting alternative when it is used in an area which provides more space than the Rib San Juan. It's main advantages are: - the <b>tanker</b> <b>berths</b> at some distance of the platform. This can be done in relatively bad weather conditions (e. g. with hardly any sight, strong winds). Tugs can be needed less or not at all; - tankers of any size can be served. The dimensions of the platform construct i on are not related {{to the size of the}} tanker nor to any forces on it. The platform can be used at a port where the size of the tankers might increase in the future; - the platform can be installed quickly (this might also be interesting for military operations).
