The aim of the article is to assess the role of infrastructure potential of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> in ensuring its flexibility and security. Threats to <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> security are systematized by sources of formation, scale, duration and nature of influence. The essence of security and flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> is defined. There systematized indicators of security and flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> in interrelation with the components of infrastructure potential of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> <b>The</b> methodology for determining the level of economic safety and flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> is substantiated, <b>the</b> corresponding calculations are made. Also the methodology for calculating the normalized index of the infrastructure potential of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> is developed. <b>The</b> correlation-regression analysis {{of the connection between}} development of the infrastructure potential of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market,</b> its security and flexibility is carried out. The results of the calculations showed that the degree of implementation of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> infrastructure potential at the current stage of development of the Ukrainian economy is insufficient. It does not contribute to achieving the necessary level of flexibility and security of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> Each of <b>the</b> components of infrastructure potential requires changing approaches to regulation aimed at ensuring the systematic development of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> Most of <b>the</b> identified problems are mainly related to dysfunctionality of the technological and information components of the infrastructural potential of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> This is manifested in the low level of confidence in it from the part of the household sector {{as well as in the}} poor efficiency of regulation of certain segments of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> That is why the prospects for further research are to identify areas for increasing the role of technological and information components of the infrastructure potential of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R

5|$|The bank bailouts and the {{economic}} downturn increased the country's deficit and debt levels {{and led to a}} substantial downgrading of its credit rating. To build up trust in <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets,</b> the government began to introduce austerity measures and in 2011 it passed a law in congress to approve an amendment to the Spanish Constitution to require a balanced budget at both the national and regional level by 2020. The amendment states that public debt can not exceed 60% of GDP, though exceptions would be made in case of a natural catastrophe, economic recession or other emergencies. As one of the largest eurozone economies (larger than Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined) the condition of Spain's economy is of particular concern to international observers. Under pressure from the United States, the IMF, other European countries and the European Commission the Spanish governments eventually succeeded in trimming the deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to an 7.1% in 2013.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence {{in the very near future}} helped to calm the markets).|$|E

40|$|Finance {{does not}} matter in perfect and {{efficient}} markets. Based on neoclassical economics, financial capital is always perfectly priced, and all investments are completely valued in frictionless markets. In the real world, however, finance does matter, especially {{in the real estate}} market, which is relatively imperfect and inefficient. There are several phases through which funds flow into real estate. Among others, the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> and real estate investors is crucial. <b>The</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> provides funds to investors. An efficient <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> will value real estate investments perfectly, but an inefficient <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> will not.
