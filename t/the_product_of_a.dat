Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric rift valley which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

Yorktown was authorized in the 1886 fiscal year, and the contract for her construction was awarded to the William Cramp and Sons shipyard of Philadelphia. The hull for Yorktown was designed by the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair while the mechanical design was left to the Cramp yard. Yorktowns keel was laid on 14 May 1887.|$|E

Trinidad continued the fight and pursued the challenger, who displayed a quick pace throughout the fight. In the fourth round Trinidad connected a solid punch that injured Carr, and in the eighth he scored three consecutive knockdowns before the referee stopped the fight by technical knockout.|$|E
5|$|Following Thompson's attack {{upon the}} {{veracity}} of the codex, a number of scholars published their opinions that the document is genuine {{over the course of}} the 1980s and early 1990s, including John B. Carlson, Yuri Knorozov, Thomas A. Lee, Jr., Jesús Ignacio Mora Echeverría, George E. Stuart, and Karl Taube. In 2000, German epigrapher Nikolai Grube expressed his belief that the document is genuine, based upon the precision of the Venus almanac. However, in a later publication from 2012, he clearly calls the codex a forgery. In 2002, French archaeologist Claude-François Baudez commented – like Thompson before – that the codex serves no divinatory purpose and was useless as an aid to a Maya priest; he believes that the document is <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forger using pre-Columbian materials but relatively ignorant of his subject. The codex is notable in its use of prominent illustrations of uniform size and the almost complete absence of hieroglyphic text; the deities lack names and the cardinal directions are unmarked. In a paper published in 2003, the authors (including Mayanist Stephen D. Houston) argue that the iconography and lack of hieroglyphic text are the result of a strong central Mexican stylistic influence.|$|E

Working with Death by Stereo's Paul Miner, the quartet {{recorded}} 12 tracks, and by April 2000, the group had released Identity Crisis on Greenflag Records. A portion of the album's proceeds were donated to a local charity called Crittenton Services for Children and Families. More support gigs and local buzz followed, and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City's Louis Posen. In 2001, Posen signed with the band, reissued Identity Crisis, and sent the group out on tour with Samiam. Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town Football Club is an English {{football}} club based in Luton, Bedfordshire, which competes in League Two, the fourth tier of English football, for the 2017–18 season. Formed in 1885 as <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> merger, Luton Town {{became the first}} professional team {{in the south of}} England six years later and joined the Football League in 1897. After leaving the League in 1900 because of financial difficulties, Luton Town settled at their Kenilworth Road ground in 1905 and competed in the Southern League until 1920, when the club rejoined the Football League. The team was relegated to the Football Conference in 2009, after 89 consecutive years of League membership, following a 30-point deduction imposed by the football authorities. Five seasons later, the club won promotion back to the Football League.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town Football Club {{was formed}} on 11 April 1885, <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> merger {{of the two}} leading local teams, Luton Town Wanderers and Excelsior. Initially based at Excelsior's Dallow Lane ground, the club began making {{payments}} to certain individual players in 1890. The following year, Luton became the first club in southern England to be fully professional. The club was a founder member of the Southern Football League in the 1894–95 season and finished as runners-up in its first two seasons. It then left to help form the United League and came second in that league's inaugural season before joining the Football League (then based mostly in northern and central England) for 1897–98, concurrently moving to a new ground at Dunstable Road. The club continued to enter a team to the United League for two more seasons, and won the title in 1897–98. Poor attendance, high wages and the high travel and accommodation costs that resulted from Luton's distance from the northern heartlands of the Football League crippled the club financially, and made it too expensive to compete in that league. A return to the Southern League was therefore arranged for the 1900–01 season.|$|E
