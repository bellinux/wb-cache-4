5|$|Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an {{effective}} method <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and expensive {{for the protection of}} civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may also be used for high-altitude parachute jumps.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the sea, Jaywick had never been a practical place for farming due to the risk from floods; and the land remained unused. A sea wall was built in 1880 <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> flooding. Ordnance Survey mapping around 1897 shows Jaywick as a few farmhouses near what is now Crossways on the Tudor estate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} stages, {{electrolyte}} levels are often abnormal and require correction. High potassium levels can be life-threatening, {{and respond to}} increased urine production and renal replacement therapy (see below). Temporary measures include the administration of calcium <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> cardiac complications, insulin or salbutamol to redistribute potassium into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.|$|E
5|$|Much of the system's core, {{including}} the LWKT subsystem, the IPI messaging subsystem {{and the new}} kernel memory allocator, are lockless, meaning that they work without using mutexes, with each process operating on a single CPU.

5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler ordered the {{construction}} of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but due to shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, most of the strongpoints were never built. As the expected site of an Allied invasion, Pas de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> the disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications {{that the use of}} anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on pilings <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> storm surges.|$|E
5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>against</b> dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease {{the incidence of}} dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
