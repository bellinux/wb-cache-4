25|$|Further to the east, {{the canyon}} system runs into Coprates Chasma, {{which is very}} similar to Ius and Tithonium chasmata. Coprates differs from Ius in the eastern end which {{contains}} alluvial deposits and eolian material and like Ius, has layered deposits, although the deposits in the Coprates Chasma are much more well defined. These deposits pre-date the Valles Marineris system, suggesting erosion and sedimentary processes later cut by the Valles Marineris system. Newer data from Mars Global Surveyor suggest that the origin of this layering is either just a succession of landslides, one over another, volcanic in origin, or it may be the bottom of a basin of either liquid or solid water ice suggesting that the peripheral canyons of the Valles Marineris system could have been at one time isolated lakes formed from erosional collapse. Another possible source of the layered deposits could be wind-blown, but the diversity of the layers suggests that this material is not dominant. Note that only the upper layers are thin, while the bottom layers are very big, suggesting that the lower layers were composed of mass wasted rock and the upper layers come from another source. Some of this layering may have been transferred to the floor by landslides in which the layers are kept semi-intact, yet the layered section looks highly deformed with thickening and thinning beds that have multitudes of folds in them as seen in MOC image #8405. This complex terrain could also be just eroded sediment from an ancient Martian lake-bed and appear complex because all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> an aerial view like a geologic map and not enough elevation data to see if the beds are horizontal.|$|E

6000|$|ROMANCE, n. Fiction that owes no {{allegiance}} to the God of Things as They Are. In the novel the writer's thought is tethered to probability, as a domestic horse to the hitching-post, but in romance it ranges at will over the entire region of the imagination--free, lawless, immune to bit and rein. Your novelist is a poor creature, as Carlyle might say--a mere reporter. He may invent his characters and plot, but he must not imagine anything taking place that might not occur, albeit his entire narrative is candidly a lie. Why he imposes this hard condition on himself, and [...] "drags at each remove a lengthening chain" [...] of his own forging he can explain in ten thick volumes without illuminating by {{so much as a}} candle's ray the black profound of his own ignorance of the matter. There are great novels, for great writers have [...] "laid waste their powers" [...] to write them, but it remains true that far and away the most fascinating fiction <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> [...] "The Thousand and One Nights." ...|$|E
