5|$|The {{education}} system features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by {{six years of}} compulsory primary education, and five years of optional secondary education. Schools in the primary {{education system}} are divided into two categories: national primary schools, which <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> Malay, and vernacular schools, which <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> Chinese or Tamil. Secondary education is conducted for five years. In {{the final year of}} secondary education, students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination. Since the introduction of the matriculation programme in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges can enroll in local universities. However, in the matriculation system, only 10 per cent of places are open to non-bumiputera students.|$|E

5|$|Oswald died on 29 February 992 {{in the act}} of {{washing the}} feet of the poor at Worcester, as was his daily custom during Lent, and was buried in the Church of Saint Mary at Worcester.

5|$|The Empire of Japan endeavored, through {{education}} initiatives and specific {{financial support for}} new shrines, to frame Shinto practice as a patriotic moral tradition. From the early Meiji era, the divine origin of the Emperor was the official position of the state, and taught in classrooms not as myth, but as historical fact. Shinto priests were hired to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> public schools, and cultivated this teaching, alongside reverence for the Emperor and compulsory class trips to shrines. State Shinto practitioners also emphasized the ritual aspect as a traditional civic practice that did not explicitly call on faith to participate.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} the result of a {{reflection}} on my experience as a teacher in higher education, and on the specific characteristics of that teaching.

It also reflects on the teaching skills for <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> higher education, the corrosive effects of the educational bureaucracy, and the de-profissionalization of teachers. Finally, it presents the contemporary challenges to <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> higher education 1. Education as a commodity, 2. The information society; and 3. The trivialization of <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> higher education. The challenges of <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> higher education often cause stress, and a sense of loss and failure.

5|$|Holst's {{works were}} played {{frequently}} {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and <b>teach.</b> <b>In</b> his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.|$|E
5|$|Hoosiers {{were divided}} about {{entering}} World War I. Before Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare {{and tried to}} enlist Mexico as a military ally in 1917, most Hoosiers wanted the U.S. to be neutral in the war. Support for Britain came from professions and businessmen. Opposition came from churchmen, women, farmers and Irish Catholics and German-American elements. They called for neutrality and strongly opposed going to war to rescue the British Empire. Influential Hoosiers who opposed involvement in the war included Democratic Senator John W. Kern, and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall. Supporters of military preparedness included James Whitcomb Riley and George Ade. Most of the opposition dissipated when the United States officially declared war against Germany in April 1917, but some teachers lost their jobs on suspicion of disloyalty, and public schools could no longer <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> German. Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, from Terre Haute, went to federal prison for encouraging young men to evade the draft.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, when Macdonald was 15, {{the family}} moved to the town of Port Hood, Cape Breton. Macdonald {{attended}} the Port Hood Academy. He hoped to enroll next in the Bachelor of Arts program at St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, but his family couldn't afford to pay for a university education so Macdonald obtained a teaching licence and taught for two years to finance his education. Midway through his university studies, he took another year off to earn money teaching. He completed his final term on credit and was required to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> the university's high school during 1914–15 to pay off his debt. Macdonald did well at St. FX. He played rugby, joined the debating team, edited the student newspaper and, in his graduating year, won the gold medal in seven of his eight courses. He was also class valedictorian.|$|E

5|$|Lithuania {{had been}} part of the Russian Empire since the {{partitions}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. After the unsuccessful uprising of 1863, Lithuania was subjected to Russification policies: the Lithuanian press ban was initiated, schools were required to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> the Russian language, Roman Catholics could not hold positions in government institutions and could own only limited amounts of land, and political rights were restricted. However, these measures had limited effects on the Lithuanian National Revival, and a sense of the Lithuanian national identity continued to grow. The first Lithuanian political parties, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and Lithuanian Democratic Party, included goals of political autonomy for Lithuania within the Russian Empire in their basic program.|$|E
5|$|McMaster has {{received}} accolades for its research strengths, {{particularly in the}} field of health sciences. For five years in a row, McMaster has ranked second in for biomedical and health care research revenues by the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. The Faculty of Health Science oversees $130 million a year in research, much of that research conducted by scientists and physicians who <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> the medical school. The Faculty of Health Sciences operates several research institutes, including the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, and the Population Health Research Institute. A McMaster research group led by David Sackett and later Gordon Guyatt had been credited for establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. In November 2010, researchers at the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute turned clumps of human skin into blood cells, which may help alleviate the shortage of blood donors. A portion of Albert Einstein's brain is preserved and held for medical research at the McMaster brain bank. Researchers there have identified differences in his brain that may relate to his genius for spatial and mathematical thinking.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{universality}} of <b>teaching</b> and training <b>in</b> the area of science of indoor air quality and the practice of indoor air quality management. The key questions, which the paper addresses, are: (i) how universal are approaches to <b>teaching</b> and training <b>in</b> the area of science and practice of indoor air quality, and (ii) is it possible, practical or desirable to transfer training or university degree programs from one geographical, cultural or economical reality to another? The paper is an attempt to answer the two questions from the broad perspective of linking parallels between <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> indoor air sciences and <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> an interdisciplinary area in general, and also from the perspective of personal experience from university and training course <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> various places in the world. The conclusion drawn is that transfer of knowledge and technology <b>in</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> the area of indoor air sciences is possible and desirable. The success of program transfer depends on the understanding of the philosophy of <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> this area as well as on understanding local needs requirements and limitations...|$|R
5|$|The Great Depression {{and lack}} of {{outreach}} to Wisconsinites and UW faculty led to the college's slow decline. Enrollment decreased every year since the program began, which its statewide reputation exacerbated. After his son was expelled in 1931 by dean and Experimental College critic George Sellery, Meiklejohn recommended the college's dissolution. Public criticism of the college included student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. Meiklejohn wrote a retrospective of the college, which philosopher John Dewey reviewed favorably and noted for its contribution to educational philosophy. University of Wisconsin faculty and regents voted to dissolve the college in May 1932. Some advisers stayed to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> the university, and Meiklejohn remained briefly before moving to Berkeley. The Experimental College influenced programs internal to the university, and was the precursor to its Integrated Liberal Studies undergraduate program.|$|E
5|$|The life of {{the college}} was {{disrupted}} by the English Civil War. Leoline Jenkins, who became principal after the war in 1661, put the college on a more stable financial footing. Little happened at the college during the 18th century, and the 19th century saw a decline in numbers and academic standards. Reforms of Oxford University after two Royal Commissions {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century led to removal of many of the restrictions placed on the college's fellowships and scholarships, such that the college ceased to be predominantly full of Welsh students and academics. Students' academic achievements rose in the early 20th century as fellows were appointed to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> new subjects. Women were first admitted in 1974 and now form a large part of the undergraduate population.|$|E
5|$|After {{repairs to}} the college were {{completed}} in mid-1656, the first admissions were made. The first headmaster, Richard Dutton, was appointed in 1655, and in 1665 the institution became an incorporated charity. The number of pupils grew, with admissions rising to 100 by the 1870s. Boys were admitted based on the parish they lived in, and on need, health and background of the family. Illegitimate boys were not admitted, and all boys {{had to be able}} to read to a certain standard that meant they were not hard to <b>teach.</b> <b>In</b> 1878, a new schoolroom designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse (who designed Manchester Town Hall) was built in a Tudor style. The number of boys admitted was reduced to 75 in 1908 to save money, though three years later admissions increased again to 99. In 1916, no boys were admitted due to lack of funding caused by World War I, and in 1918 the number was limited to 70. Successful public appeals resulted in the numbers rising to 97 in 1929. In 1926 a scheme was set up which allowed boys to apply for scholarships to join a grammar school, which meant that while they lived at Chetham's, they were educated elsewhere during the day. Further, they would stay at grammar school until at least the age of 16 and sometimes 18.|$|E
