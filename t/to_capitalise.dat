5|$|A {{grandson}} of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, Felix Mendelssohn {{was born into}} a prominent Jewish family. He was brought up without religion until the age of seven, when he was baptised as a Reformed Christian. Mendelssohn was recognised early as a musical prodigy, but his parents were cautious and did not seek <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on his talent.|$|E
5|$|A pilot episode for a Battletoads TV {{series was}} also {{produced}} by Canadian DIC Entertainment, {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on {{the popularity of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The pilot originally aired in syndication in the United States on the weekend of Thanksgiving 1992, but it was never picked up as a full series.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} bizarre {{software}} products for the ZX81 came about {{as a result of}} music companies attempting <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on the popularity of Sinclair's computers. In 1983, EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX81 program recorded on the B-side. Island Records responded with XL1 by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley, packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Non-stenographic systems often {{supplement}} alphabetic characters {{by using}} punctuation marks as additional characters, giving special significance <b>to</b> <b>capitalised</b> letters, and sometimes using additional non-alphabetic symbols. Examples of such systems include Stenoscript, Speedwriting and Forkner shorthand. However, {{there are some}} pure alphabetic systems, including Personal Shorthand, SuperWrite, Easy Script Speed Writing and Keyscript Shorthand which limit their symbols to a priori alphabetic characters. These have the added advantage that {{they can also be}} typed—for instance, onto a computer, PDA, or cellphone. Early editions of Speedwriting were also adapted so that they could be written on a typewriter, and therefore would possess the same advantage.|$|R

Through providing improved website performance and uptime and providing more sophisticated performance metrics, the new hosting system should support more online orders, which the Eagle Boys IT chief says are worth 1.5 times the orders which are made in-store or by telephone.|$|E
5|$|Going into {{production}} in summer 1984 – with studio recordings in September and October – the first series of As Seen On TV {{was intended for}} broadcast late that year. As a theatre tie-in, Wood arranged a short stand-up tour with the same name as the show, <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on her television appearances around the same time. This backfired when the BBC put back the opening broadcast to early the following year.|$|E
5|$|Merritt {{brought the}} score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game {{drew to a}} close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on the opportunities, {{continuing}} to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.|$|E
40|$|Hot springs {{have long}} been {{acknowledged}} as a special and significant natural resource. The practice of drinking water which emanates from hot springs and using it for bathing has occurred throughout history. Being endowed with natural hot springs all over the island, Taiwan possesses a comparative advantage in terms of availability of this resource along with its considerable tourism potential. With a view <b>to</b> <b>capitalising</b> on the abundance of natural springs and positioning Taiwan as a hot springs tourism destination, a number of government and industry-led initiatives have been undertaken and others are in the planning stages. In this context the present study provides a detailed framework and management guidelines for the hot springs tourism sector...|$|R

5000|$|... "Neanderthal Man" [...] was {{the only}} hit by Hotlegs. An album, Thinks: School Stinks and a {{follow-up}} single, [...] "Lady Sadie", differed markedly {{from the sound of}} [...] "Neanderthal Man" [...] and drummer Kevin Godley later admitted the band failed <b>to</b> properly <b>capitalise</b> on their hit with interviews or other promotional work.|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. It was assumed that the existing freehold arrangements would remain, and that those whose land was not required for the city itself would be in a position <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on the new circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Ingres sought <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> {{on the success}} of his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise. Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.|$|E
5|$|The former RAAF Fairbairn, {{adjacent}} to the Canberra Airport was sold to the operators of the airport, but the base continues {{to be used for}} RAAF VIP flights. A growing number of software vendors have based themselves in Canberra, <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on the concentration of government customers; these include Tower Software and RuleBurst. A consortium of private and government investors is currently making plans for a billion-dollar data hub, with the aim of making Canberra a leading centre of such activity in the Asia-Pacific region.|$|E

50|$|After {{the arrival}} of Victory at Portsmouth, large numbers of artists arrived to prepare {{sketches}} for their interpretations of the battle, and Nelson's death. Arthur William Devis and Benjamin West competed to create the grandest scene of the death, with West also painting his Apotheosis of Nelson. J. M. W. Turner also visited the Victory to gather material for his paintings of the battle. The caricaturist James Gilray produced {{some of the earliest}} works {{in the aftermath of the}} battle, but his works were considerably more respectful than many of his satirical attacks on public figures. A large number of prints were also quickly produced <b>to</b> <b>capitalised</b> on public interest. In the 1840s Prince Albert became interested in naval history, and commissioned several works, including ones depicting Nelson's victories, for the Royal palaces. Daniel Maclise duly designed and painted an enormous fresco for the Royal Gallery at Westminster.|$|R
5|$|A tag team {{match for}} the Unified Tag Team Championship followed, between the champions The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith), who were {{accompanied}} by their manager Natalya, and the team of Chris Jericho and The Miz. The Hart Dynasty took the early advantage, but Jericho and The Miz were able to isolate both Smith and Kidd in the ring {{at different points in}} the match, wearing them down. Natalya interfered by tripping up Jericho while The Miz had the referee distracted. The Hart Dynasty were able <b>to</b> <b>capitalise,</b> and performed the Hart Attack on The Miz for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{continued}} his good form {{at the start}} of the 195455 season, scoring 90 and 9 in the opening match against New South Wales. He then made 49 and 9 against the touring England cricket team of Len Hutton. In the Christmas match against South Australia, Harvey failed <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on his starts, making 31 and 35 as Queensland won by 34 runs. The following week, he made only 0 and 3 not out in the New Year’s match against New South Wales. He finished the truncated season with only 16 in the following match against Victoria, ending the summer with 242 runs at 30.25.|$|E
5|$|In {{the return}} match against Queensland, Harvey made 17 as Victoria took a convincing innings win. In the next match against New South Wales, Harvey played with Neil {{for the first}} time at {{first-class}} level, and pair played together for their state’s two remaining matches of the season, although they never batted together as Merv was always out before Neil came in, usually at No. 6. Merv made 30 and 44, failing <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on his starts to make a big score with a Test vacancy beckoning; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test.|$|E
50|$|The 19th century {{brought about}} a large {{increase}} in population as Wales, {{like the rest of}} the UK, largely attributable to high birth rates and the demographic transition. In 1801 just over 587,000 people lived in Wales; by 1901, this had increased to over 2,012,000. The growth rate in the first half of the 19th century was almost 15 per cent per decade, falling to 12.5 per cent per decade for the rest of the century. However, these changes were uneven. The most significant rises in population occurred in industrial counties - Denbighshire, Flintshire, although by far the largest part of the increase was in Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire. From 1851, the population of rural counties such as Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire began to decline. The causes were complex, but included the transition from subsistence <b>to</b> <b>capitalised</b> farming, and the lure of new employment opportunities in industrial districts.|$|R

5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific {{name of a}} plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, the division's {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Minqar Qaim were encircled by the 21st Panzer Division.

In the course of this movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E
5|$|Skipsea Castle was a Norman motte and bailey castle {{near the}} village of Skipsea, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Built around 1086 by Drogo de la Beuvrière, {{apparently}} on the remains of an Iron Age mound, it was designed to secure the newly conquered region, defend against any potential Danish invasion and control the trade route across the region leading to the North Sea. The motte and the bailey were separated by Skipsea Mere, an artificial lake that was linked to the sea during the medieval period via a navigable channel. The village of Skipsea grew up beside the castle church, and the fortified town of Skipsea Brough was built alongside the castle around 1160 <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on the potential trade.|$|E

5000|$|This feature {{provides}} an interesting quirk {{which has become}} something of a fad among his readership even in mainland Italy. The TV adaptation of Montalbano's adventures, starring Luca Zingaretti, further increased Camilleri's popularity to such a point that in 2003 Camilleri's home town, Porto Empedocle - on which Vigàta is modelled - took the extraordinary step of changing its official name to that of Porto Empedocle Vigàta, no doubt with an eye <b>to</b> <b>capitalising</b> on the tourism possibilities thrown up by the author's work. On his website, Camilleri refers to the engaging and multi-faceted character of Montalbano as a [...] "serial killer of characters," [...] meaning that he has developed a life of his own and demands great attention from his author, to the demise of other potential books and different personages. Camilleri added that he writes a Montalbano novel every so often just so that the character will be appeased and allow him to work on other stories.|$|R
5|$|The Nazi Propaganda Ministry {{was quick}} <b>to</b> <b>capitalise</b> on the {{successful}} raid, and radio broadcasts by the popular journalist Hans Fritzsche displayed the triumph felt throughout Germany. Prien {{and his crew}} reached Wilhelmshaven at 11:44 on 17 October and were immediately greeted as heroes, learning that Prien had been awarded the Iron Cross First Class, and each man of the crew the Iron Cross Second Class. Hitler sent his personal plane to bring the crew to Berlin, where he further invested Prien with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. This decoration, made {{for the first time}} to a German submarine officer, later became the customary decoration for successful U-Boat commanders. Dönitz was rewarded by promotion from Commodore to Rear-Admiral and was made Flag Officer of U-Boats.|$|E
5|$|Venables brought Gary Lineker {{back from}} Barcelona, and Stewart was {{selected}} to be Lineker's striker partner for the 1989–90 season, leaving Walsh on the bench.

40|$|Abstract: There is {{benefit to}} a {{researcher}} if technical research can {{be associated with}} a user who is prepared to pay for it – the commercial aspects of the research.

The Concept A Doctorate course implies pioneering work, novelty and maybe patents. Standards suggest that something is well established, so there is not an obvious link between them, in fact they would appear to be diametrically opposite. However, a further look at standards may reveal closer ties than may be immediately apparent, it may well cost less than a patent and be eminently suitable for a student to introduce as a useful commercial artefact.
