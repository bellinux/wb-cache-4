5000|$|AdK is a monomeric protein (~ 38-40 kDa), {{which works}} via an ordered Bi-Bi {{reaction}} mechanism. [...] It {{belongs to the}} phosphofructokinase B (PfkB) family of sugar kinases. Other members of this family (also known as the RK family) include ribokinase (RK), inosine-guanosine kinase, fructokinase, and 1-phosphofructokinase. The members of the PfkB/RK family are identified {{by the presence of}} three conserved sequence motifs. The structures of AdK and several other PfK family of proteins have been determined from a number of organisms (see section below) as well as that for RK protein from E. coli. Despite low sequence similarity between AdK and other PfkB family of proteins, these proteins are quite similar at structural levels. Compounds that are substrates for AdK include the N-nucleosides <b>toyocamycin,</b> tubercidin and 6-methylmecaptopurine riboside; the C-nucleosides formycin A, 9-azadenosine, and a large number of other C- and N-nucleoside analogs. The AdK from mammalian sources, in addition to carrying out ATP-dependent phosphorylation of Ado, also catalyzes an Ado-AMP exchange reaction requiring ADP. This activity {{is an integral part of}} AdK and it presumably allows a rapid and precise control of Ado concentration in cells. The enzymatic activity of AdK from different sources show a marked dependence on phosphate (Pi) and/or pentavalent ions and it is a conserved property of the PfkB family of proteins. The conserved NXXE motif, which is a distinctive property of the PfkB family of proteins, is involved in Pi (PVI) dependency.|$|E

Although its structure is known, several questions regarding its functional remain to be addressed. We report that both Archaeoglobus fulgidus and human Rio 1 bind more tightly to an adenosine analog, <b>toyocamycin,</b> than to ATP. <b>Toyocamycin</b> has antibiotic, antiviral and cytotoxic properties, and is known to inhibit ribosome biogenesis, specifically the maturation of 40 S. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of <b>toyocamycin</b> bound to Rio 1 at 2. 0 A ̊ and demonstrated that <b>toyocamycin</b> binds in the ATP binding pocket of the protein. Despite this, measured steady state kinetics were inconsistent with strict competitive inhibition by <b>toyocamycin.</b> In analyzing this interaction, we discovered that Rio 1 is capable of accessing multiple distinct oligomeric states and that <b>toyocamycin</b> may inhibit Rio 1 by stabilizing a less catalytically active oligomer. We also present evidence of substrate inhibition by high concentrations of ATP for both archaeal and human Rio 1.

Methods Cell viability assay, western blot, cell-cycle arrest, annexin V/propidium iodide assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular Ca 2 + flux were assayed. Results We investigated the apoptotic effect of <b>Toyocamycin</b> and the underlying molecular mechanism in prostate cancer PC- 3 cells. <b>Toyocamycin</b> treatment resulted in reduced cell viability of PC- 3 cells, but not of non-malignant RWPE- 1 cells. <b>Toyocamycin</b> enhanced apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ROS production in PC- 3 cells. In addition, MAPK proteins were activated upon <b>Toyocamycin</b> treatment. The p 38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activities were regulated by ROS-mediated signaling pathway underlying the Toyocamycin-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) recovered the Toyocamycin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS, and apoptosis. Additionally, p 38 stimulated ROS production and inhibitory effects on ERK activation, while ERK inhibited the ROS production and had no effect on p 38 activation.

Exposure for 24 hr to <b>toyocamycin</b> caused an exponential type of cell lethality resulting in a 4 -log reduction of cell viability, while sangivamycin produced a gradual and self-limiting type of cell lethality resulting in a 1 -log reduction of cell viability. <b>Toyocamycin,</b> at a concentration of 1 M produced total cessation of precursor rRNA processing, while 10 M sangivamycin produced little or no effect on processing. On the contrary, sangivamycin caused {{a significant decrease in}} protein synthesis after 6 hr, while <b>toyocamycin</b> had less effect. The inhibition of protein synthesis by sangivamycin results from an inhibition of the formation of complexes essential to the initiation of protein synthesis. The results suggest that the mechanisms of action of these closely related agents are quite distinct. The marked loss of cell viability caused by <b>toyocamycin</b> correlates with its effect on rRNA processing, while the slow inhibition of protein synthesis appears to be secondary to the loss of ribosome synthesis. On the other hand, the lesser cytotoxicity produced by sangivamycin results from a more direct effect on protein synthesis.

40|$|Plants exhibit multitudes {{of defense}} {{mechanisms}} against diﬀerent kinds of stress. Jasmonic acid (JA) {{is one of}} the identiﬁed signaling compounds mediating plant’s response to wounding, attack by herbivores or necrotrophic pathogens. Central parts of the JA signaling pathway have recently been unraveled by demonstrating that (+) - 7 -iso-JA-L-Ile is the most bioactive form of JA and that the SCF(COI 1) -complex functions as its receptor. However, many other components of the JA signaling pathway remain unknown. This includes how and where protein kinases may be involved in JA signaling. Likewise, the mechanistic details of cross-talk between diﬀerent hormone signaling pathways are unknown. Using a chemical biology approach, screening for selective compounds that can be used as tools in applications complementing genetic approaches, I aimed at identifying some of these unknown components. The advantage of this method is that {{it has the potential to}} circumvent redundancy of gene function, lethality of mutants and pleiotropic eﬀects, problems generally encountered in genetic approaches. I developed a screening procedure for bioactive compounds that uses a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana line, harboring the JA-responsive reporter gene LOX 2 p::LUC. This procedure allowed bidirectional screening for activators or inhibitors of reporter expression. Sifting through approx. 1, 700 natural compounds, I identiﬁed one activator of reporter gene expression and 16 inhibitors of methyl jasmonate induced reporter expression. Critical validation of these primary hits revealed that the putative activator in fact interfered with the activity of the luciferase reporter. It presumably binds and stabilizes luciferase, thereby enhancing its apparent activity, whereas reporter gene expression was not aﬀected. After validation and characterization of the inhibitors, one compound (12) was identiﬁed as selective inhibitor of JA signaling. Structure-activity relationship studies, using derivatives of the compound, deﬁned parts of the molecule that where indispensable for its bioactivity. Based on this analysis, a derivatized probe was designed that harbors a ‘photoreactive’ benzophenone for establishing covalent binding and an alkyne residue to attach a detectable ﬂuorophore using ‘click chemistry’. Importantly, this probe retained activity and was used in ﬁrst aﬃnity-based target identiﬁcation experiments. In a second screen using a small, targeted library of 84 known protein kinase inhibitors, I identiﬁed three compounds that impaired JA signaling. This ﬁnding suggests the involvement of protein kinases in the JA signaling pathway that has been previously reported. Among the identiﬁed inhibitors was 5 -iodotubercidin, a nucleoside antibiotic. A derivative of this compound, <b>toyocamycin,</b> was previously described to selectively impair auxin signaling, which is mechanistically related to JA signaling. Several structural analogs were investigated with respect to their eﬀect on JA-dependent reporter expression or JA-independent readouts. <b>Toyocamycin</b> was considered to be the most speciﬁc derivative. To elucidate the role of <b>toyocamycin</b> in the Arabidopsis hormonal signaling network, I performed a microarray analysis after treatment with <b>toyocamycin.</b> The expression data showed that this compound modulates expression of JAZ genes, which are repressors of JA induced gene expression. <b>Toyocamycin</b> also modulated genes, which may be involved in hormonal crosstalk between e. g. auxin or salicylic acid signaling. The fact that <b>toyocamycin</b> caused a root growth phenotype, which is dependent on allene oxide synthase (AOS) and jasmonoyl-isoleucine synthetase (JAR 1), indicated that multiple targets may exist, because inhibition of the LOX 2 marker was independent of JAR 1. Identiﬁcation of the protein targets of <b>toyocamycin</b> and compound 12 may eventually lead to identiﬁcation of yet unknown components in JA signaling or hormonal crosstalk...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Toyocamycin</b> nitrile hydratase (TNH) is {{a protein}} hexamer that catalyzes the {{hydration}} of <b>toyocamycin</b> to produce sangivamycin. The structure of hexameric TNH and {{the arrangement of}} subunits within the complex, however, have not been solved by NMR or X-ray crystallography. Native mass spectrometry (MS) clearly shows that TNH is composed of two copies each of the α, β, and γ subunits. Previous surface induced dissociation (SID) tandem mass spectrometry on a quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) platform suggests that the TNH hexamer is a dimer composed of two αβγ trimers; furthermore, {{the results suggest that}} α−β interact most strongly (Blackwell et al.

These data are consistent with the following interpretations: complete nuclear processing of viral RNA is necessary for polyribosome association, and precursor viral message(s) contain sequences that are lost normally during post-transcriptional processing...|$|E
40|$|Three {{thousand}} microbial strains {{collected from}} different sources were screened for herbicidal activity. A strain of ME- 9189 showed herbicidal activity against Digitaria sanguinalis and Portulaca oleracea was isolated from a mountainy soil. Based on taxonomic studies, the strain {{was identified as}} Streptomyces tubercidicus. The active compound of ME- 9189 was purified from the culture broth by charcoal, silica gel, sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography and crystalization, consecutively. The ME- 9189 compound was identified as tubercidin by spectroscopic methods of UV, 1 H and 13 C-NMR, and EIMS. In the bioassay, growth of radish shoot and root was inhibited by 50 % with tubercidin treatment of 10 ppm, showing 2 times higher activity than that of herbicidin A and {{similar to that of}} <b>toyocamycin.</b> ope...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Accumulating {{evidence}} supports {{the concept that}} melanoma is highly heterogeneous and sustained by a small subpopulation of melanoma stem-like cells. Those cells are considered as responsible for tumor resistance to therapies. Moreover, melanoma cells are characterized by their high phenotypic plasticity. Consequently, both melanoma stem-like cells and their more differentiated progeny must be eradicated to achieve durable cure. By reevaluating compounds in heterogeneous melanoma populations, {{it might be possible}} to select compounds with activity not only against fast-cycling cells but also against cancer stem-like cells. Natural compounds were the focus of the present study. METHODS: We analyzed 120 compounds from The Natural Products Set II to identify compounds active against melanoma populations grown in an anchorage-independent manner and enriched with cells exerting self-renewing capacity. Cell viability, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, gene expression, clonogenic survival and label-retention were analyzed. FINDINGS: Several compounds efficiently eradicated cells with clonogenic capacity and nanaomycin A, streptonigrin and <b>toyocamycin</b> were effective at 0. 1 µM. Other anti-clonogenic but not highly cytotoxic compounds such as bryostatin 1, siomycin A, illudin M, michellamine B and pentoxifylline markedly reduced the frequency of ABCB 5 (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B, member 5) -positive cells. On the contrary, treatment with maytansine and colchicine selected for cells expressing this transporter. Maytansine, streptonigrin, <b>toyocamycin</b> and colchicine, even if highly cytotoxic, left a small subpopulation of slow-dividing cells unaffected. Compounds selected in the present study differentially altered the expression of melanocyte/melanoma specific microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and proto-oncogene c-MYC. CONCLUSION: Selected anti-clonogenic compounds might be further investigated as potential adjuvants targeting melanoma stem-like cells in the combined anti-melanoma therapy, whereas selected cytotoxic but not anti-clonogenic compounds, which increased the frequency of ABCB 5 -positive cells and remained slow-cycling cells unaffected, might be considered as a tool to enrich cultures with cells exhibiting melanoma stem cell characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Heterocyclic {{compounds}} play {{an important}} role in many biological processes due to their versatility. Amongst these, indole alkaloids and purines represent two major classes of biologically active heterocyclic compounds, which are discussed further. First, the total synthesis of the marine triazolopyrimidine essramycin is presented. The synthesis proceeded in two steps and confirmed the structure initially proposed when the metabolite was isolated from the Mediterranean Sea. The family of dilemmaones, isolated from the South African coast of Cape Town, shows high similarity with previously isolated marine indole alkaloids, such as trikentrins and herbindoles. Their structure was elucidated only through spectroscopic studies. Here we present the first total synthesis of dilemmaone B and confirmation of its proposed structure. The last part of this work concerns 7 -deazapurines. These compounds, although well known in transfer RNA and in several nucleoside antibiotics isolated from Streptomyces sp., have been shown to be involved in many important biological processes. A fundamental point in their biosynthesis has not been completely elucidated yet, i. e. the loss or rearrangement ofN- 7 in the purine precursor. Having prepared a novel doubly labelled purine, [2 _ 13 C, 7 - 15 N]-adenine, we used it as a biosynthetic precursor to <b>toyocamycin.</b> NMR and mass spectrometry showed incorporation of 13 C but loss of 15 N in the <b>toyocamycin</b> derived from our fermentation. These findings, in combination with recent results obtained by McCarty et al., allow a chemical mechanism for the loss of N - 7 in 7 -deazapurine biosynthesis to be formulated for the first time. Finally, synthesis of the biosynthetic precursor, 6 -carboxy- 5, 6, 7, 8 - tetrahydropterin, and construction of a model system for a mechanistic study are presented herein.

40|$|Nitrile-containing natural {{products}} are rare in Nature, {{and there have}} been very few studies on the mechanisms by which they are synthesized and utilized. The biosynthesis of 7 -deazapurine containing {{natural products}} is a unique case whereby both formation of a nitrile and its conversion to an amide are documented. The overall theme of this work is to interrogate the biosynthesis of the nitrile intermediate in the pathway and its subsequent hydration to an amide. The biosynthesis 7 -cyano- 7 -deazaguanine (preQ₀), the key intermediate in the biosynthesis of the hypermodified base queuosine and the <b>toyocamycin</b> natural product, is accomplished by preQ₀ synthetase through a series of unprecedented reactions whereby the carboxylate moiety of the substrate, 7 -carboxy- 7 -deazaguanine (CDG), is successively activated by adenylation, reacted with ammonia, and dehydrated to produce the nitrile. This one-enzyme synthesis of a nitrile is unique as the only other known route to nitriles proceeds through at least two enzymes. Nitrile hydratases are metalloenzymes that selectively hydrate nitriles to the amide and are used industrially to produce acrylamide and nicotinamide. These enzymes use a trivalent iron or cobalt complex comprised of two backbone amidate ligands and three cysteine thiolate ligands of which two are modified to the sulfenato and sulfinato form. This work describes aspects of a particular nitrile hydratase, <b>toyocamycin</b> nitrile hydratase (TNH). Whereas most nitrile hydratases are heterodimeric, TNH is heterotrimeric, and yet what was discovered is that only the subunit containing the active site metal complex is required for activity. This single subunit analog of the protein was used for single turnover assays in ¹⁸O-labeled water to show with high resolution mass spectrometry that the source of the product amide oxygen is actually the enzyme itself and likely the sulfenato ligand oxygen acting as a nucleophile. The mechanism of the active site complex synthesis is described showing that this is self-catalytic in the presence of cobalt(II) and molecular oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Stable mutants {{which are}} {{approximately}} three- and eightfold {{resistant to the}} pyrazolopyrimidine nucleosides formycin A and formycin B (FomR) have been selected in a single step from mutagenized Chinese hamster ovary cells. In cell extracts, the two FomR mutants which were examined were both found to contain no measurable activity of the enzyme adenosine kinase (AK). However, cross-resistance studies with other adenosine analogs such as <b>toyocamycin</b> and tubercidin show that these mutants are distinct from <b>toyocamycin</b> or tubercidin resistant (Toyr) mutants which also contain no measurable AK activity in cell extracts. Studies on the uptake and incorporation of [3 H]adenosine and [3 H]tubercidin by various mutants and parental cell lines show that unlike the Toyr mutants, which are severely deficient in the phosphorylation of these compounds, the FomR mutants possess nearly normal capacity to phosphorylate these compounds and incorporate them into cellular macromolecules. These {{results suggest that the}} FomR mutants contain normal levels of AK activity in vivo. In cell hybrids formed between FomR X FomS cells and FomR X Toyr cells, the formycin-resistant phenotype of both of the FomR mutants behaved codominantly. However, the extracts from these hybrid cells contained either congruent to 50 % (FomR X FomS) or no measurable (FomR X Toyr) AK activity, indicating that the lesion in these mutants neither suppresses the wild-type AK activity nor complements the AK deficiency of the Toyr mutants. The presence of AK activity in the FomR mutants in vivo, but not in their cell extracts, along with the codominant behavior of the mutants in hybrids, indicates that the lesions in the FomR mutant are of a novel nature. It is suggested that the genetic lesion in these mutants affects AK activity indirectly and that it may involve an essential cellular function which exists in a complex form with AK. Some implications of these results regarding the mechanism of action of formycin B are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{wide variety}} of purine {{nucleoside}} (mainly tubercidin and adenosine) analogs, which had previously been shown to inhibit the replication of {{a broad spectrum of}} RNA viruses, were evaluated for their antirhinovirus activity in human diploid (WI- 38) fibroblasts. Tubercidin, 5 -(1 -hydroxyethyl) tubercidin, 5 -(2 -buten- 1 -yl) tubercidin, <b>toyocamycin,</b> and sangivamycin emerged as the most potent inhibitors. These compounds inhibited the replication of rhinovirus types 1 A, 1 B, and 9 at an MIC well below 1 microgram/ml. However, these compounds proved cytotoxic for the uninfected host cells at concentrations which were only slightly higher (3 - to 10 -fold, on the average) than those required for inhibition of rhinovirus replication. The most selective inhibitor of rhinovirus replication was 3 -deazaguanine, with a selectivity index of 50. None of the carbocyclic and acyclic analogs of adenosine tested exhibited a potent or selective antirhinovirus activity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Non-nucleoside analogs of the pyrrolopyrimidine nucleosides <b>toyocamycin,</b> sangivamycin and thiosangivamycin {{have been}} {{synthesized}} and their cytotoxicity in mammalian cells determined. While studying {{the effects of}} 5 -thioamide-substituted analogs on cell growth, we observed an interesting phenomenon in which cells recovered spontaneously from growth inhibition during extended incubations. HPLC studies demonstrated that the 5 -thioamide moiety of several structurally dissimilar 7 -substituted 4 -aminopyrrolo[2, 3 -d]pyrimidines, including thiosangivamycin, is unstable in cell culture medium and is converted to the corresponding 5 -nitrile with a half-life of approximately 48 hr. In contrast, different substituents at the 4 -position of the heterocycle significantly affected {{the stability of the}} 5 -thioamide moiety. Conversion of the thioamide to the nitrile was caused by components in the cell culture medium, not components of serum. The above observations demonstrate that caution should be exercised in interpreting biological data obtained in vitro for 5 -thioamide pyrrolo(2, 3 -d]pyrimidines...|$|E
40|$|Nucleoli of {{cultured cells}} of the {{established}} lines KB and L were found to possess a distinctive fine structural organization. The major portion of the nucleolar volume was composed of compact, particulate material. Spheroidal fibrillar zones about 0. 4 / 2 in diameter occurred within the particulate mass. These fibrillar zones had a central light area and a denser rim. <b>Toyocamycin</b> treatment, which sharply inhibited the appearance of newly synthesized RNA in the cytoplasm, caused the gradual disappearance of the fibrillar material from nucleoli. Actinomycin D treatment, which inhibited virtually all RNA synthesis, caused varying types of segregation of nucleolar components. The morphology of nucleoli of KB and L cells and the reorganization of these nucleoli in response to drugs appear {{to be different from}} those of nucleoli of freshly initiated Chinese hamster and mouse cell lines.

40|$|Trichomonas vaginalis is {{the most}} common sexually {{transmitted}} protozoan in the world and its resistance to metronidazole is increasing. The {{purpose of this study was}} to demonstrate that clinical metronidazole resistance in T. vaginalis does not occur via the same mechanism as laboratory-induced metronidazole resistance-that is, via hydrogenosome down sizing. Ultrathin sections of this parasite were examined using transmission electron microscopy and the size and area of the cell and hydrogenosomes were compared between drug-resistant laboratory lines and clinically resistant isolates. Clinical metronidazole-resistant T. vaginalis had similar-sized hydrogenosomes as a metronidazole-sensitive isolate. Inducing metronidazole resistance in both of these isolates caused down sizing of hydrogenosomes. Inducing <b>toyocamycin</b> resistance did not cause any ultrastructural changes to the cell or to the hydrogenosome. No correlation between hydrogenosome number and the drug-resistant status of T. vaginalis isolates and lines was observed. This report demonstrates that clinical metronidazole resistance is not associated with down-sized hydrogenosomes, thus indicating that an alternative resistance mechanism is used by T. vaginalis...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleoside}} analogues fluorouridine and fluorodeoxyuridine (both at 100 muM) and 8 -azaguanine (at 500 muM) inhibit both rRNA transcription {{and processing}} in Ehrlich ascites cells. In BHK 21 cells fluorodeoxyuridine {{has no effect}} on either rRNA maturation or transcription, whereas <b>toyocamycin</b> (at 2 microM) inhibits both processes in BHK 21 cells and Ehrlich ascites cells. The drugs inhibit transcription in cells incubated in the complete medium, but have no effect on the decreased transcription in cells incubated in a medium without amino acids. This lack of effect cannot be explained by an altered uptake of the drugs in the amino acid-starved cells, since maturation of the rRNA precursor is affected in cells incubated in media with or without amino acids. The effect of the drugs on rRNA transcription is not the consequence of the inhibition of protein synthesis. The results lend support to the proposal that rRNA processing and transcription are co-ordinately controlled in cells with a high rate of rRNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Of {{a series}} of newly {{synthesized}} derivatives of the pyrrolo[2, 3 -d]pyrimidine nucleosides tubercidin, <b>toyocamycin,</b> and sangivamycin, the xylosyl analog of tubercidin, xylotubercidin, exhibited the greatest potency and selectivity against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) in vitro. At dosage regimens that were not toxic for the host, xylotubercidin proved efficacious in various HSV- 2 animal model infections. When applied topically at 0. 25, 0. 5, or 1 % in dimethyl sulfoxide or when administered systemically (intraperitoneally) at 12. 5 or 25 mg/kg per day, xylotubercidin suppressed the development of herpetic skin lesions and the paralysis and mortality associated therewith in hairless mice inoculated intracutaneously with HSV- 2. In this model, acyclovir was effective only if administered topically at 5 or 10 % in dimethyl sulfoxide. When administered intraperitoneally over a dosage range of 10 to 50 mg/kg per day, xylotubercidin achieved {{a significant reduction in}} the mortality rate of mice infected intraperitoneally with HSV- 2.

40|$|Small {{molecules}} containing a 7 -deazapurine moiety are ubiquitous in nature. They comprise {{a broad range}} of structurally diverse antibiotics produced by terrestrial and marine microorganisms that possess demonstrated antibiotic and antineoplastic activity. In addition, queuosine, a hypermodified nucleoside located in the wobble position of select tRNAs that is almost universally conserved throughout biology, contains a 7 -deazapurine functional group. The since their initial identification over 50 years ago, the chemical transformations underlying the biosynthesis of 7 -deazapurines have remained elusive. This work describes the identification of a cluster of co-localized genes in the Streptomyces rimosus chromosome that are responsible for the biosynthesis of the 7 -deazapurine containing antibiotics <b>toyocamycin</b> and sangivamycin. Further, the in vitro conversion of GTP to the previously identified queuosine biosynthetic intermediate 7 -cyano- 7 -deazaguanine (preQ₀) is demonstrated using purified, recombinant enzymes. Also included herein is a kinetic, spectroscopic, and mechanistic characterization of QueE, an enzyme that catalyzes the third step in the biosynthesis of 7 -deazapurines using a radical-mediated rearrangement. A possible mechanism for the reaction catalyzed by QueD, the second step in the deazapurine biosynthetic pathway, is explored based on X-ray crystallographic data of site directed QueD mutants containing bound substrate. Finally, hitherto unrecognized gene clusters that are likely devoted to the biosynthesis of 7 -deazapurines other than queuosine are described...|$|E
