5|$|Although the Ministry of Education {{reported}} that eleven schools had sustained a combined total of $300,000 of damage, the Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities {{reported that}} most of the country's other major infrastructure remained functional. They estimated that the cost to clean up all of the roads and drains was $900,000 and the cost to repair <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> and communications damage was another $505,000. Saint Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority reported another $922,000 of damage, but none of these sectors experienced prolonged disruptions to their functionality.|$|E
5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E

30|$|In this approach, the planner uses {{internally}} {{a utility}} calculator component for estimating <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> {{of a specific}} job configuration. <b>The</b> <b>utility</b> calculator calculates <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> for a specific job configuration {{on the basis of}} <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> function. <b>The</b> <b>utility</b> function takes into account a set of parameters included in the job description and the runtime of the job. Thus, an application-specific performance model is needed to estimate <b>the</b> <b>utility.</b> Additionally, <b>the</b> parameter set changes due to different types of involved resources, execution environments, or applications. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> function has to be adapted according to the specific application scenario.|$|R
