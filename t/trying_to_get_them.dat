25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Bucharest, Moscovici {{reported}} to his party about the matter, and organized a public protest against Conservative Party rule. Joining him in this effort were other veterans of the Bulgarian campaign, including his lifelong friends Constantin Titel Petrescu and Toma Dragu, alongside the socialist physician Ecaterina Arbore. The authorities moved to organize a court-martial, but withdrew the request when faced with public outcry. In August 1913, Moscovici was in Dobreni commune, Neamț County, addressing the local peasants and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> interested in the PSDR agenda.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} week of the 2008 Tour de France, the stages were mostly flat. As {{traditionally}} in the Tour de France, this resulted in small breakaways of cyclists, and the sprinters' teams <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> back. In the first stage, the sprinters won, with Thor Hushovd winning the stage, but in the second stage, four cyclists managed to stay away. The fourth stage was a time trial, won by Stefan Schumacher, who took over the lead. In the fifth stage, the sprinters won the battle and Mark Cavendish won the stage.|$|E
25|$|The first {{track was}} {{completed}} in 1835, and freight service began immediately. The solid granite roadbed proved to be much too rigid, jolting the engine and cars nearly to pieces. Repairs on the locomotives (there were two at the time) would sometimes take most of the night, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> {{ready for the next}} day's service. The much poorer Boston and Worcester Railroad could not afford a granite bed and so was built with modern wooden ties. This turned out to be far superior, so the owners of the Boston and Lowell decided they would upgrade their entire roadbed to wood when they added a second track.|$|E

This angered Chaghatai, and Genghis headed off this sibling fight by appointing Ögedei the commander of the besieging forces as Urgench fell. But the removal of Jochi from command, and the sack of a city he considered promised to him, enraged him and estranged him from his father and brothers, and is credited with being a decisive impetus for the later actions of a man who saw his younger brothers promoted over him, despite his own considerable military skills.|$|E
25|$|Fulci and his {{collaborator}} Danielle Stroppa wrote a plot synopsis and {{a screenplay}} for Argento, and Argento kept <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> {{to increase the}} violence and gore quotient, against Fulci's wishes strangely. (Stroppa had co-written two of Fulci's earlier films, The House of Clocks and Voices from Beyond). Fulci assumed that he was slated to also direct the film, but sadly he died before filming could begin, due {{to a series of}} delays caused by Argento's involvement with his own project, The Stendhal Syndrome, at the time. Wax Mask was eventually directed by former special effects artist Sergio Stivaletti. The screenplay was entirely reworked by Stivaletti after Fulci's death, so the finished film contains significant changes to Fulci's original screenplay. Argento also hired Fulci's daughter Antonella to serve as an assistant art director on the film.|$|E

After a sharp action fought between the afternoon of 9June and the morning of 10June, the two ships sank or drove ashore all of the ships {{with the exception of}} three brigs, which they captured. Three weeks later he was cruising off Alicante when he encountered several merchant vessels, which ran ashore.

500|$|At the Supreme Court, justices meet {{after the}} case is briefed and argued, and they vote on the result. The task of writing the opinion is {{assigned}} by the Chief Justice or, if the Chief Justice is in the minority or not participating, by the senior justice in the majority. After the assignment, the justices generally communicate about a case by sending notes and draft opinions to one other's chambers. In the give-and-take of opinion writing, Scalia did not compromise his views {{in order to attract}} five votes for a majority (unlike the late Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., who would accept fewer than he wanted in order to gain a partial victory). Scalia, known to his friends and colleagues as [...] "Nino", attempted to influence his colleagues by sending them [...] "Ninograms"—short memorandums aimed at <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to include his views in their opinions.|$|E

Nowell was described as a [...] "gifted kid with many friends". At first, Wilson did not share Nowell's interest in reggae music. Nowell recalled the experience: [...] "I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to do (UB40's version of) 'Cherry Oh Baby', and it didn't work. They tried, but it just sounded like such garbage. We were horrible". Nowell attended the University of California, Santa Cruz before transferring to California State University, Long Beach to study finance. While at Cal State Long Beach, Nowell received good grades, appearing on the Dean's List in 1990. However, he dropped out one semester shy of earning a degree, stating in 1995 [...] "I have all the hard classes left...I doubt I'll ever go back".|$|E

2500|$|After {{remaining}} {{in possession of}} Recife {{for more than twenty}} days Lancaster knew {{that he would have to}} leave soon and prepared to sail. The Portuguese however were observed constructing a battery to command the entrance of the harbor, and Lancaster, sent a strong party of 275 men to destroy their work. Attacking at night the English surprised the Portuguese [...] who fled and the destruction was achieved, but some order was lost as fifty of the English ran forward, beyond the cover of the ships' broadsides, were met by a large body of Portuguese and their Indian allies and were ambushed. Almost all the officers of the party including Venner (who was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> back), and others to the number of thirty-five were killed before the rest found the safety of the English lines. Buoyed by this success the Portuguese with their Indian allies then launched another attack on the isthmus, only to be repelled again this time with the help of the ships guns. After this close call Lancaster decided that the occupation had reached its end and decided to take advantage of leaving unmolested with the destruction of the battery.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson and {{his crew}} {{witnessed}} an unarmed woman being kicked and shot at point-blank range by Captain Medina, who later claimed that he thought she had a hand grenade. Thompson then saw a group of civilians (again consisting of children, women, and old men) at a bunker being approached by ground personnel. Thompson landed and told his crew that if the soldiers shot at the Vietnamese while he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> out of the bunker {{that they were to}} open fire on these soldiers. Thompson later testified that he spoke with a lieutenant (identified as Stephen Brooks of 2nd Platoon) and told him there were women and children in the bunker, and asked if the lieutenant would help get them out. According to Thompson, [...] "he [...] said {{the only way to get}} them out was with a hand grenade". Thompson testified that he then told Brooks to [...] "just hold your men right where they are, and I'll get the kids out". He found 12–16people in the bunker, coaxed them out and led them to the helicopter, standing with them while they were flown out in two groups.|$|E
2500|$|In 752, when {{associates}} of Wang Hong's brother Wang Han (王銲) plotted treason and rose in rebellion inside Chang'an, the troops commanded by Yang Guozhong (Consort Yang's cousin) and Wang Hong were initially unable to crush Wang Han's associates, but Gao then arrived with reinforcements and crushed the rebellion decisively. [...] In the aftermaths, when Wang Hong hesitated at asking for punishment for his brother, Yang Guozhong accused Wang Hong of being complicit, and both Wang Hong and Wang Han were executed. [...] Later that year, when Emperor Xuanzong, seeing that Geshu Han, {{the commander of}} Longyou Circuit (隴右, headquartered in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai), had poor relations with An Lushan, then the commander of Fanyang Circuit (范陽, headquartered in modern Beijing) and An Sishun (whose uncle was An Lushan's stepfather), then the commander of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), and wanted to improve relations between these three key border troop commanders, he summoned all three to the capital and had Gao host a feast for the three of them, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to resolve their unpleasantries.

2500|$|In 1990, DeVille made Victory Mixture, {{a tribute}} album of classic New Orleans soul and R which he {{recorded}} {{with some of}} the songs' original composers. The album was recorded without the use of overdubbing or sound editing with the goal of capturing the spirit of the original recordings.I got all the original guys to come back in, like Earl King, Dr. John and Eddie Bo. Allen Toussaint played side piano. I brought in the rhythm section of The Meters on a couple of cuts. We call it the [...] "little" [...] record. It's funny, because I was just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> money, the writers of the songs, 'cause they all got ripped off in the 1950s and 1960s. They were all fascinated, and Dr. John (who had played on DeVille's 1978 album Return to Magenta and who DeVille knew from his association with Doc Pomus) convinced them that they wouldn't get ripped off by this northern white boy. That's when I crossed over to being a local here in New Orleans. We were all pleased with it. It's recorded the way it was originally done back then. It's live with no overdubs anywhere, no digital, no editing. We played the song several times and just picked the best take, the one that was the most natural. It's on Fnac/Orleans Records. I'm really proud of that one. Victory Mixture was recorded for a small independent label, Orleans Records, which licensed it to Sky Ranch (Fnac Music) in France. [...] "It sold over 100,000 units in Europe very quicklyour first gold disc," [...] said Carlo Ditta, founder of Orleans Records and the producer of Victory Mixture.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins in}} a futuristic {{cafeteria}} with kids, dubbed the [...] "Warriorettes", {{sitting down at}} tables wearing all white while the tables and walls are gray. Smith then enters the room in colorful attire, including a blue vest, orange pants and a belt with her name on it, while donning rhinestones on her lips and extravagant nail tips. With her braids shaped to form a heart, she carries a boombox filled with paint and plays it while undoing her braids and dipping them into paint inside the stereo, using her hair as a paintbrush and enlivening the atmosphere with colors. Smith then performs dance moves and gets the classroom involved, which is intercut with the singer now donning a colorful mohawk, performing choreography with dancers with blue shirts {{in front of a}} light blue backdrop. She alternates different hairstyles, and then walks down a hallway with her backup dancers, donning a cotton candy-esque hairstyle. She further whips her hair to give color to the lockers and students' attire, before performing extensive choreography with the hallway students. Midway, Smith and her dancers perform a dance routine with music not in the original song. The last scenes involves Smith with puff braids and in a yellow jumpsuit with her backup dancers in a different classroom <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to dance, which is intercut with previous paint-splashing scenes, as the students, including her brother Jaden, teachers, janitor, elderly lady, and toddler dance.

She is initially cool towards Don Draper, who bristles at her assertive, independent image, but they warm to each other and eventually begin an affair. In the course of their affair, Don tells her things he has not shared with Midge Daniels (his previous mistress) or his wife. When Don is blackmailed by Pete Campbell, he comes to Rachel with the suggestion that they run away together to Los Angeles. She reminds him of his duty to his children and questions whether he would want to abandon his children after having grown up without a father. When Don persists, Rachel comes to the realization that he didn't want to run away with her, he simply wanted to run away. Ironically, her calling him a coward and urging him to think more clearly inspires him to persuade Pete to stand down. The relationship seems to collapse from that point on, and Cooper complains to Don about how upset he has made her. Don and Rachel end the affair at some point {{between the first and second}} seasons. He encounters her again in Season 2 while out to eat with Bobbie Barrett, finding out that Rachel has moved on and married a man named Tilden Katz. Though it appears that Don is only momentarily shaken by the news of her marriage, several episodes later, after drinking heavily with Roger and Freddie Rumsen, he gives his name as [...] "Tilden Katz" [...] to the bouncer of an underground club Roger is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> into.
