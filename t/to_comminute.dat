This seemingly inconsequential plastic and elastic deformation in the 3.5 -mm plate may allow some compression across the large, non-comminuted fracture fragments, thus providing secondary stability which the more rigid 4.5 -mm counterpart lacks.

The process described is a [...] "double burning" [...] process in which the limestone is burned on its own first, then slaked, mixed with clay, and burned again. This was a common practice for manufacturers of both Artificial and Portland cements when only hard limestones were available. The grinding technology of the time consisted only of flat millstones, and it was more economic <b>to</b> <b>comminute</b> the limestone by burning and slaking than by grinding.|$|E
50|$|Alluvial gold {{deposits}} {{could be}} worked {{and the gold}} extracted without needing to crush the ore. Washing tables were fitted below the tanks to collect the gold-dust and any nuggets present. Vein gold needed crushing, and they probably used crushing or stamp mills worked by water-wheels <b>to</b> <b>comminute</b> the hard ore before washing. Large quantities of water were also needed in deep mining to remove waste debris and power primitive machines, {{as well as for}} washing the crushed ore. Pliny the Elder provides a detailed description of gold mining in book xxxiii of his Naturalis Historia, most of which has been confirmed by archaeology. That they used water mills on a large scale elsewhere is attested by the flour mills at Barbegal in southern France, and on the Janiculum in Rome.|$|E

40|$|New Zealand forest {{operations}} are primarily based on large scale pine plantation clear-cuts. Previous {{studies have shown}} that relatively large volumes of woody biomass residues accumulate at the landings. This includes not only the branches and tops, but a very aggressive value recovery program focusing on quality results in a large volume of relatively short large diameter off-cuts. Through a program supported by the NZ Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA), four field studies were carried out to assess productivity characteristics and logistical options to optimise the recovery of landing biomass. The first field trial looked at using a tub grinder <b>to</b> <b>comminute</b> very large, but contaminated volumes of biomass from a superskid, whereby a comparison was made between fresh and old residues. The second looked at recovering short logs from the biomass piles and loaded directly by excavator into a bin truck, or stacked for a self-loading truck. The third focussed on longer logs trucked to a centralised landing area: the resulting stack covered for drying and subsequently chipped. For the latter study, an additional trial was set up to assess moisture content change over time of timber stacked, with treatments of covered and larger logs split. At time of writing the fourth trial had yet to commence. The results to date indicate that the difficulty of recovering the biomass from the landings significantly impact the ability <b>to</b> <b>comminute</b> cost-effectively. Sieving tests of the comminuted biomass indicated high levels of contamination, with large percentages of fines. While system costs were comparably moderate, production levels were low given the size and potential of the equipment used...|$|E

40|$|Colloid {{mills and}} {{extruders}} {{are widely used}} for disintegrating wet fibrous biomass. However, their main disadvantages are a high energy requirement {{in the range of}} hundreds or thousands of kWh per ton of material, {{and the fact that they}} grind in process cycles.

40|$|AbstractElectrostatic {{sub-micron}} complexes of {{a protein}} (sodium caseinate (NaCAS) or bovine serum albumin (BSA)) and a polysaccharide (chitosan) were fabricated by associative phase separation and investigated {{for use in}} encapsulation and pH-triggered delivery applications.

The effect of applying ultrasound has been considered with a view <b>to</b> <b>comminuting</b> precipitates produced under low shear to the colloidal scale to form coacervates. A simple model is suggested to explain how the biopolymer mixing ratio influences the ability for application of ultrasound to convert macroscopically phase-separated complex precipitates into coacervates. Different factors, both from a formulation and processing viewpoint, were studied with respect to encapsulation efficiency (EE) of model hydrophilic actives: fluorescein, rhodamine B, and riboflavin. Release of fluorescein and rhodamine B was measured as function of pH in order to investigate the pH-responsive molecular release capability of the fabricated structures.

30|$|The {{results of}} this study showed that the EMG {{activity}} of the masseter muscles during clenching on a preformed silicon index was significantly higher than during chewing peanut and chewing cake. This finding is in line with Miralles et al., [37] who pointed out that the increased EMG activity may be due to increased vertical dimension leading to increased muscle activity during maximum voluntary clenching. This finding is also in line with Darwish et al., [38]. The results also show higher mean EMG activity when chewing peanut than when chewing cake in this study. This coincides with van der Bilt et al., [39] who stated that harder food consistency required higher muscle activity levels due to higher muscle force needed <b>to</b> <b>comminute</b> hard food. The results are also in agreement with Karkazis [40] who found that harder foods required higher chewing rates, higher electrical activity of the masseter muscle, and higher relative contraction periods, accompanied by shorter cycle durations.|$|E
40|$|Fragmentation of {{particulate}} solids is {{an important}} process in many industrial activities, particularly in the mineral, cement and glass industries <b>to</b> <b>comminute</b> the raw materials to a required size. Understanding of processes and mechanisms responsible for fragmentation of particulate solids is a hard task. This may bring great precision for designing and controlling the comminution process. This work aims to contribute to understanding fragmentation of cement clinker particles under impact loading. For this purpose, six narrow-size classes of Portland clinker were fragmented with varying specific impact energy levels in a drop weight test apparatus. Then, breakage probabilities and functions of these size classes were determined from the product size distributions. The calculated breakage functions show evidences for the modes of breakage (meridian cracks to oblique cracks and shattering) given in the literature.

40|$|The {{effect of}} particle-bed {{breakage}} mechanisms on the liberation properties of ores remains unclear. Surprisingly {{few studies have}} been published in this area and limitations in liberation measurement techniques previously used have prevented definitive conclusions from being reached regarding whether particle-bed breakage enhances the liberation properties of mineral ores relative to conventional grinding mechanisms. In this study, two sulphide ores of differing textures were comminuted to various size distributions using impact and particle-bed breakage mechanisms in a hammer mill and a piston-die compression unit respectively. The liberation properties of the various discharge samples were then characterised using a mineral liberation analyser - a mineralogical characterisation system based on automated scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the size-by-size liberation properties of both valuable and gangue mineral phases were independent of both the method used <b>to</b> <b>comminute</b> the samples, as well as the particle size distribution of the final products.

40|$|Simulation {{modelling}} {{was used}} to investigate interactions between forage degradation characteristics, rumen processes and body weight, and to predict the voluntary food intake and digestion {{of a range of}} forages. Predicted voluntary intake and digestion agreed well with empirical data, explaining 61 and 70 %, respectively, of variance in observed values. Since the data covered a wide range of animal weights and forage qualities, these results suggest that the model is a useful means of integrating the effects of animal and forage variables.
