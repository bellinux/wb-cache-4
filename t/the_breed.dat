5|$|As of November 2011, the Kennel Club has not {{highlighted}} {{any specific}} concerns regarding the breed's health to conformation show judges. Due {{to the low}} numbers of <b>the</b> <b>breed,</b> {{two of the most}} prevalent problems facing <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> today is the popular sire effect and the general problem of genetic diversity within <b>the</b> <b>breed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasts {{worked to}} reorient <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> towards driving and {{recreation}} pursuits, and since 1982 have again reorganized <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> association. In 1992, a new studbook {{was created for}} <b>the</b> <b>breed,</b> with new selection criteria designed to preserve the quality of <b>the</b> <b>breed,</b> particularly its gaits. The latest editions of <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> registry and studbook are controlled by the Syndicat national des éleveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob normand (SNEUCCN, National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy Cob Horses), based in Tessy-sur-Vire. The association works to preserve and promote <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, Vendee and Anjou. In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman Cob horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds. This included {{approximately half of the}} Norman Cobs bred in France.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{breeding}} {{programs in}} the early 20th century succeeded in re-establishing <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> to some extent, but mechanization, combined with two world wars, again resulted in <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> almost becoming extinct. In the 1980s, concerned with the declining population numbers, interested breeders undertook a promotional program, which resulted in renewed interest in <b>the</b> <b>breed.</b> By the 1990s, population numbers were higher, and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed. However, livestock conservation organizations still consider <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> to be at risk, due to low population numbers.|$|E
50|$|Channel Island cattle is a {{collective}} name for <b>the</b> <b>breeds</b> of cattle {{developed in the}} Channel Islands located between England and France. <b>The</b> <b>breeds</b> which can be so described are the Jersey, the Guernsey and the Alderney.|$|R
50|$|Cor de la Bryere {{has had an}} {{incredible}} impact on <b>the</b> Holsteiner <b>breed,</b> occurring in more than 70% of Holsteiner pedigrees, and is credited for improving <b>the</b> <b>breed's</b> jumping technique. He also had {{a huge impact on}} <b>the</b> Oldenburg <b>breed.</b>|$|R
60|$|From these several facts, more {{especially}} from the drakes of all <b>the</b> <b>breeds</b> having curled tail-feathers, and from certain sub-varieties in each breed occasionally resembling in general plumage the wild duck, we may conclude with confidence that all <b>the</b> <b>breeds</b> are descended from A. boschas.|$|R
5|$|Following work by <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> {{clubs to}} ensure that any reoccurring health {{problems}} are dealt with, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in <b>the</b> <b>breed,</b> <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E
5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought. The first is traditional breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a light draft horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of <b>the</b> <b>breed.</b> This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of <b>the</b> <b>breed.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{now found}} {{in many parts of}} the world, being {{exported}} to Canada in 1853, the US in 1882 and Australia in 1951. <b>The</b> <b>breed</b> enjoyed success during the 1950s but this subsided during the foot and mouth crisis. Today, <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> is enjoying a revival, due to the demands of the beef market. <b>The</b> <b>breed</b> is considered average size and they have a thick coat, due to the climate of their native Scotland.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>breed's</b> {{numbers were}} never large, and so few {{examples}} existed after World War II that in 1949 the President of <b>the</b> Pont-Audemer <b>breed</b> club in France allowed for other <b>breeds,</b> including <b>the</b> Irish Water Spaniel, to cross-breed {{with the existing}} population in order to alleviate the risk of inbreeding what few Pont-Audemer Spaniels remained. However <b>the</b> <b>breed's</b> population remained low, and in 1980 at {{the recommendation of the}} Société Centrale Canine, <b>the</b> Pont-Audemer <b>breed</b> club was merged with that of the Picardy Spaniel.|$|R

50|$|The Seskar Seal Dog (Seiskarinhyljekoira) is an extinct {{dog breed}} from Finland that was {{recently}} recreated. The modern dogs are not direct descendants of <b>the</b> original <b>breed.</b> Moreover, {{they are not}} used for the same purpose as <b>the</b> original <b>breed.</b> <b>The</b> original <b>breed</b> is typically called Seskar Seal Dog and the modern version Seskar (or Seiskari) Dog. Some 200 individuals in Finland represent <b>the</b> modern <b>breed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Members of <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> {{are shown}} {{annually}} at the Paris International Agricultural Show. There are fairs held for <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> at Lessay and Gavray, in Manche. The National Stud at Saint-Lo remains {{involved in the}} maintenance and development of <b>the</b> <b>breed,</b> and organizes the annual national competition for <b>the</b> <b>breed.</b> The stud also organizes events at which to present <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> to the public, including the Normandy Horse Show. The Norman Cob is beginning to be exported to other countries, especially Belgium. In that country, some are bred pure, while others are crossed on the Ardennes to improve the latter's gaits. Approximately 15 horses are exported annually, traveling to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy for leisure, logging and agricultural uses.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>breed</b> {{was made}} the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985. The American Water Spaniel remains a rare breed. During 1998 only 233 puppies were {{registered}} with the AKC, with an estimated 3,000 dogs in existence mostly around the Midwestern United States, in particular in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. In 2010, <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> was ranked 143rd most popular breed in the United States, out of 167 breeds. This is a decrease since 2000, when <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> was ranked 125th. The dogs are not classified specifically as either retrievers or as spaniels and so may not compete in AKC field trials, but may compete in AKC hunt tests (spaniel and retriever tests) and retriever hunting tests sponsored by the AWSC, <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> club in the United States. The American Water Spaniel Field Association {{was set up in}} 1993 by breed enthusiasts supporting AKC Spaniel classification and looking to provide field training opportunities to owners of <b>the</b> <b>breed.</b> In a vote held of members of the AWSC in 1999, they chose to keep <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> unclassified.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>breed</b> was {{originally}} a multipurpose horse, used for agriculture, cavalry and pulling diligences (a type of carriage). Because {{of a lack}} of support from a breeding syndicate, such as the one in existence for the Mérens horse, once the need for a multipurpose breed declined, the population of the Castillonnais dwindled. Many horses were crossbred with draft horses, and <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> almost became extinct. The intervention of a group of supporters in 1980 saved <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> from extinction, and in 1992 L'Association Pyrénéenne Ariégeoise du Cheval Castillonnais (the Ariege Pyrenees Association of Castillonnais Horses) was formed, with support from several French government agencies and stud farms. Annually, in August, the association holds a small competition and sale for <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> in Castillon-en-Couserans, which also includes inspections to register horses for <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> studbook.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the Koolie Club of Australia {{was formed}} to preserve, protect and {{ethically}} promote <b>the</b> Koolie <b>breed.</b> <b>The</b> Koolie Club does not actively work towards bench standard recognition, feeling this would only be detrimental to <b>the</b> <b>breeds</b> working future. As of (2013), no bench standard exists.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of season and breed on thermoregulation, blood constituents, blood metabolites, blood minerals, blood enzymes, egg production performance and egg quality in local and exotic breed (White Hisex) laying hens. The rectal temperature (Tr) was significantly higher during the summer than the winter in both birds. <b>The</b> exotic <b>breed</b> showed significantly higher Tr than <b>the</b> local <b>breed</b> during summer and winter. The packed cell volume (PCV) was significantly lower during summer compared with winter in both breeds, and it was significantly higher in exotic breed than in local <b>breed</b> during summer. <b>The</b> haemoglobin concentration (Hb) was significantly higher in <b>the</b> exotic <b>breed</b> than <b>the</b> local <b>breed</b> in both seasons. The heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (H/L) was significantly higher during summer than the winter in both <b>breeds.</b> <b>The</b> plasma glucose level decreasedsignificantly during summer compared to winter in both <b>breeds.</b> <b>The</b> concentration of serum cholesterol was significantly higher during summer compared to winter in both breeds and it was significantly lowerin <b>the</b> local <b>breed</b> compared to <b>the</b> exotic <b>breed</b> during summer. Serum total protein concentration was significantly higher in exotic <b>breed</b> compared to <b>the</b> local <b>breed</b> only during summer. The serum Ca level decreased significantly during summer than the winter in both breeds and it was significantly lower in <b>the</b> local <b>breed</b> compared to <b>the</b> exotic <b>breed</b> in both seasons.

5|$|The {{physical}} characteristics seen in <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> {{are currently in}} flux, so {{there is not a}} single breed phenotype, though many members of <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> closely resemble the Mérens. Enthusiasts are breeding for a rustic mountain horse, of medium size, with good gaits and good temperament. Some members of <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> closely resemble Iberian horses such as the Andalusian horse. The official breed standard calls for a moderately long neck and long, sloped shoulder, broad back, rounded croup and muscular legs. Some members of <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> are branded on the left hindquarter. Because of its relative rarity and physical similarities, the Castillonnais is commonly confused with the Mérens.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> in Russia increased after the early 1990s, with Moscow dog shows {{since that time}} annually including between 120 and 131 Russian Spaniels, which qualifies <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> {{as one of the}} most popular, along with the Irish Setter. In 2002, the Russian Spaniel Club was set up in the United States to increase the knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> outside Russia and to enable owners to register their dogs.|$|E
5|$|World War I caused {{problems}} for <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> in the United Kingdom, {{and when the}} war was over there were no dogs whose parents had registered pedigrees. <b>The</b> <b>breed</b> restarted with the remaining unregistered dogs, and it is these dogs that formed the modern day breed. The breeders in the 1920s and 1930s developed these dogs into the type of Welsh Springer Spaniel which remains today. The Welsh Springer Spaniel Club (UK) was formed in 1923, registrations slowly increased between the wars but all records held by <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> club were destroyed in an air raid during World War II. Following the two World Wars, it was thought that no Welsh Springers remained in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>breed</b> was reintroduced, and the descendants of those dogs make up <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> today in the United States and Canada. <b>The</b> <b>breed</b> was officially imported into Australia in 1973.|$|E
50|$|The Pekingese's {{flat face}} and large eyes {{are some of}} <b>the</b> <b>breeds</b> most obvious characteristics. The body is compact and low to the ground.

25|$|In 2011, a {{study found}} that herding dogs were more trainable than hounds, working dogs, toy dogs and non-{{sporting}} dogs. The sporting dogs were more trainable than non-sporting dogs. Terriers were bolder than hounds and herding dogs. Breeds with ancient Asian or African origin were less trainable than <b>breeds</b> in <b>the</b> herding/sighthound cluster and <b>the</b> Hunting <b>breeds.</b> <b>Breeds</b> in <b>the</b> mastiff/terrier cluster were bolder than <b>the</b> ancient <b>breeds,</b> <b>the</b> <b>breeds</b> in <b>the</b> herding/sighthound cluster, and <b>the</b> hunting <b>breeds.</b>|$|R

5|$|A natural bobtail can {{be found}} in some members of <b>the</b> <b>breed,</b> which is not a {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of <b>the</b> <b>breed,</b> according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. <b>The</b> <b>breed</b> has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|Although breed {{associations}} and the French National Stud are making {{efforts to protect}} <b>the</b> <b>breed,</b> very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> very close to extinction. It {{is one of the}} most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in breed numbers is proof that <b>the</b> <b>breed</b> is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020.|$|E
