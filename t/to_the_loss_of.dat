5|$|With {{the decline}} of the whaling {{industry}} and the California Gold Rush, in the late 1840s, Hawaii's population dropped, and infectious disease epidemics contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> local populations.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline may be due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E

5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 8 April, the Yugoslav Supreme Headquarters was under the mistaken {{impression}} that {{the situation in the}} 4th Army's area of operation was relatively good, believing the penetration of German troops had been temporarily halted. However, the effect of the rebellions and desertions within the 4th Army was significant within the flanking 2nd and 7th Armies, and contributed to further withdrawals. This was particularly marked {{in the area of the}} 7th Army, which was forced to withdraw from the Drava on the night of 8/9 April due to the situation in the 4th Army on its right flank, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Maribor.|$|E
5|$|Combining the {{strengths}} of the both companies was not successful in bus chassis production because of strategic mistakes by SAT. The Vanaja LK-series with a large, centrally mounted engine was discontinued, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the main customer, Väinö Paunu Oy. SAT offered Sisu chassis to replace the Vanaja models, but a number of bus operators, including TKL, rejected them.|$|E
50|$|In 1945, US Steel was Chicago's {{largest single}} employer, with 18,000 {{workers at the}} company's South Works. Within a few decades, massive {{restructuring}} in <b>the</b> industry led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> thousands of jobs among the working class.|$|R

5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} multi-track tape, {{there had never}} been an official true stereo release of the final track until the 2012 remastered version of Smiley Smile. The stereo mix was made possible through the invention of new digital technology by Derry Fitzgerald, and received the blessing of Brian Wilson and Mark Linett. Fitzgerald's software extracted individual instrumental and vocal stems from {{the original}} mono master—as the multi-track vocals remained missing—to construct the stereo version that appears on the 2012 reissue of Smiley Smile.|$|E
5|$|Early in July, Gilmore {{was rushed}} to the {{emergency}} room after suffering from vision problems. He was immediately hospitalized and compelled to undergo surgery after he was diagnosed with a detached retina. Gilmore's campaign was stalled as the candidate was ordered by doctors to restrict travel for an indefinite period. The doctors revealed that Gilmore's vision problems could have deteriorated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> eyesight.|$|E
5|$|Following negotiations, the JNA {{evacuated}} its Jastrebarsko barracks on 13 November. The garrison left, under ECMM escort, to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

5|$|Fox {{suffered}} an outage during their broadcast of Game 1, {{resulting in a}} loss of coverage for 15 minutes, followed by a 5-minute delay in-game while officials addressed the availability of video review due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Fox's feed; the teams agreed to allow the use of footage from the world feed of the game for video review. Fox temporarily switched to the MLB International feed of the game with Vasgersian and Smoltz to restore coverage. The video from the feed was then accompanied by Fox's commentators before the full Fox production was restored.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> life by uniformed soldiers, millions {{died in the}} superpowers' proxy wars {{around the}} globe, most notably in Southeast Asia. Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post-Cold War years. Left over from the Cold War are numbers stations, which are shortwave radio stations thought {{to be used to}} broadcast covert messages, some of which can still be heard today.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{structural}} material was long ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney.

5|$|Oil {{production}} was slowed {{as a result}} of Humberto, as at least four refineries—the Valero, ExxonMobil, Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC plants in Port Arthur—were halted due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> power. Oil prices rose above $80 a barrel in intraday trading on September 12 as a result, ending the next day at a record high of $80.09 a barrel.

5|$|On {{arriving}} in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, Nimrods progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point {{was blocked by}} frozen sea. Shackleton decided {{to wait a few}} days {{in the hope that the}} ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, {{as well as}} the national housing crisis that began in 2008. While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown. Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.|$|E

5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> flying ability {{and the loss of}} water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and blood vessels, {{in the same}} fascial compartment—leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb.

5|$|TBI {{is present}} in 85% of traumatically injured children, either alone or with other injuries. The {{greatest}} number of TBIs occur in people aged 15–24. Because TBI {{is more common in}} young people, its costs to society are high due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> productive years to death and disability. The age groups most at risk for TBI are children ages five to nine and adults over age 80, and the highest rates of death and hospitalization due to TBI are in people over age 65. The incidence of fall-related TBI in First-World countries is increasing as the population ages; thus the median age of people with head injuries has increased.|$|E
