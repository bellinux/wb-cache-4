5|$|On Halloween day, {{she goes}} to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> she sees on display as not good enough for scaring anyone. But she sneaks into a back room and discovers a row of hideously {{deformed}} masks. She is startled to find that <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she chokes Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she doesn't know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.|$|E

5000|$|Government Guy - The tyrannical {{ruler of}} Edge City in the future. He wore <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> of <b>the</b> 23rd century, while a time-traveling Stanley wore <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> he {{brought with him}} from the 20th century, thus {{allowing}} two people to wear <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> at <b>the</b> same time without <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> being split in two. He is a parody of Ross Perot. Government Guy wore <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> in Future Mask, which was also his only appearance (note <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> in <b>the</b> future is green due to mold, previously thought to be radiation exposure). Despite wearing <b>the</b> <b>Mask,</b> he is defeated quite easily by <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> due to his lack of understanding of the powers it grants.|$|R
25|$|When {{entering}} the water while wearing <b>the</b> <b>mask,</b> <b>the</b> diver {{may need to}} manually prevent water impact from dislodging or knocking off <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b> Alternatively, a diver can enter the water with <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> off {{and then put it}} on or use an entry method which does not result in fast water flow over <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b> Wearing <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> pushed up onto the forehead while out of the water or on the surface increases the risk of <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> falling or being knocked off.|$|R

5|$|Andrade {{made his}} {{professional}} wrestling debut {{a month before}} his 14th birthday and worked initially as Brillante Jr. In 2007 he began working for CMLL as La Sombra and was met with in ring success as he won the 2007 Torneo Gran Alternativa tournament, the 2011 Universal Championship {{and at one point}} he was a triple champion; holding the Mexican National Trios Championship, NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship and CMLL World Tag Team Championship at the same time. He also made appearances for New Japan Pro Wrestling, where he is a former IWGP Intercontinental Champion. While working as La Sombra, Andrade was one of the founding members of the Los Ingobernables ("The Ungovernables") wrestling group, and won <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> of El Felino, Olímpico and Volador Jr. by defeating them in Lucha de Apuestas matches before losing his own mask to Atlantis.|$|E
5|$|At the meeting, Dean O’Dell’s wife {{asks the}} ex-husband {{to give their}} son a bone marrow transplant. Meanwhile, Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) arrests Weevil for the robbery. Veronica visits Weevil in prison before she decides to look into a pizza {{delivered}} to Weevil’s house. Sheriff Lamb tells Keith that the ex-husband has disappeared before accusing Keith in the ex-husband’s disappearance. Keith thinks that Dean O’Dell {{was involved in the}} disappearance, but when he visits Dean, it turns out that Dean's wife and stepson have disappeared to a hospital in Mexico, presumably taking the ex-husband with them. Wallace visits a “tutor”, who gives him a mysterious “study guide” before going back to for the “answers.” Veronica notices <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> being used in a short film, but they were stolen.

5000|$|Government Guy (voiced by Frank Welker {{in normal}} form, Kevin Michael Richardson in <b>Mask</b> form) - <b>The</b> tyrannical ruler of Edge City in the future. At some point after a {{thermonuclear}} crisis, he found <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> {{and used it}} to power everything in Edge City. However, he made laws that banned anything related to fun. He wore <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> of <b>the</b> 23rd century, while a time-traveling Stanley wore <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> he brought with him from the 20th century, thus allowing two people to wear <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> at <b>the</b> same time without <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> being split in two.

5|$|Jarrell's career {{took him}} to Africa in 1977, where he found {{inspiration}} in the Senufo people of Ivory Coast, Mali and Burkina Faso. Upon return to the United States he moved to Georgia and taught at the University of Georgia. In Georgia, he began to use a bricklayer's trowel on his canvases, creating a textured appearance within his already visually active paintings. The figures often seen in his paintings are abstract and inspired by <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> and sculptures of Nigeria. These Nigerian arts have also inspired Jarrell's totem sculptures. Living and working in Cleveland, Jarrell continues to explore the contemporary African American experience through his paintings, sculptures, and prints. His work {{is found in the}} collections of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, High Museum of Art, The Studio Museum in Harlem and the University of Delaware.|$|E
5|$|The House of <b>the</b> <b>Masks</b> {{is named}} after the mosaic motif of theatre masks decorating ivy scrolls {{arranged}} in strips around a central surface area decorated in a cubic pattern. The more intricately decorated mosaics are found in four different rooms branching off from the peristyle courtyard paved with marble chips, with corridor mosaics utilizing amphora fragments. In the center of one mosaic is the figure of Dionysos riding a leopard against a similar black background to the mosaic in the House of Dionysos. Another central mosaic features a flute player and a dancing figure, the latter perhaps representing Silenus. Only the Dionysos figure employs the vermiculatum method. The other mosaics of the house fail to achieve the naturalism of finer figure scenes and motifs, but they nevertheless demonstrate an attempt at mimicking their illusionist qualities with the tesselated technique.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Quarter of Delos {{contains}} the Jewelry Quarter, where older {{structures such as}} workshops and other archaeological remains dating to the 3rd century BC and early 2nd century BC have been discovered. By {{the second half of}} the 2nd century BC these were replaced by private homes built in the most characteristic fashion for Delos: a narrow, rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard, a vestibule service room in the front, and a larger, main room in the rear. The quarter of the House of <b>the</b> <b>Masks</b> is the only area of Delos without this archetypal house plan. Some houses of the Northern Quarter feature mosaic decorations with mythological scenes, including Lycurgus of Thrace and Ambrosia in an upper-story mosaic, as well as Athena and Hermes together with a seated woman in a main-room mosaic.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{indicate}} the use of <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> by Eugene O'Neill.

5000|$|Dr. Neuman - Stanley's cynical {{psychiatrist}} and a recurring character. Stanley typically goes {{to see him}} to talk about his problems and <b>The</b> <b>Mask.</b> Dr. Neumann doesn't believe in <b>The</b> <b>Mask,</b> which he thinks is Stanley's [...] "imaginary friend". This is a running gag of the show. However, he later gains <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> from Stanley, who {{wanted to get rid of}} it. Neumann tries <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> on and with it on, becomes crazy and psychotic. He also wears a yellow coat and blue pants with sneakers as well as a huge bow tie with the same color scheme as <b>the</b> <b>Mask's</b> tie. While wearing <b>The</b> <b>Mask,</b> Neumann puts Stanley and other people in straitjackets (using their underwear), believing they suffer from an illness called Ipkissia maskosis. He also teams with Pretorius, but is ultimately defeated and separated from <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> after trying to kill Stanley. Even after this, and the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> has appeared in the news and even on television, Neumann is still not convinced. Neumann wore <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> in Shrink Rap.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> PMK gas <b>mask</b> {{contains}} a drinking tube, allowing soldiers wearing <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> to rehydrate without removing <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> itself. <b>The</b> system {{consists of a}} special canteen cap, which will only allow water to flow through when connected to the tube leading to <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b>|$|R
5|$|The smaller {{time frame}} of {{development}} for Left Behind gave the team {{an opportunity to}} trial mechanics and ideas that {{they were unable to}} test on the main game. With the game's combat, an added feature was to allow players to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, allowing an easier escape. The gameplay was also more focused on the characters, as opposed to the combat, to allow players to relate to them more. The gameplay sequences were designed to contrast with other moments of Ellie's life; for example, the water gun fight with Riley is contrasted to the gunfights with enemies. The team found that creating some gameplay mechanics was a challenge, with even fewer combat scenarios in Left Behind than in The Last of Us. The animation of <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> also presented a challenge, due to the number of joints; it took various iterations before the final design was implemented.|$|E
5|$|These early stelae {{depicted}} rulers as warriors or wearing <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> and headdresses of Maya deities, {{accompanied by}} texts that recorded dates and achievements during their reigns, {{as well as}} recording their relationships with their ancestors. Stelae came to be displayed in large ceremonial plazas designed to display these monuments to maximum effect. The raising of stelae spread from the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands throughout the Maya area. The development of Maya stelae coincides {{with the development of}} divine kingship among the Classic Maya. In the southern Maya area, the Late Preclassic stelae impressed upon the viewer the achievements of the king and his right to rule, thus reinforcing both his political and religious power.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>masks</b> used {{by these}} dancers vary, with deep lines present in masks from Tabasco and Michoacán. In Guerrero, Puebla and Veracruz, where the {{depiction}} is more comical, <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> {{tend to have}} glossier skin tones.|$|E
50|$|Kay {{eventually}} {{finds out}} <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> person is actually Rosemarie, who was lonely and used <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> to disguise herself while she explored the village.

Nan throws <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> into <b>the</b> air where The Wind Boy destroys it. She then visits Rosemarie {{in the middle of the}} night and persuades the girl to confess to her grandfather about wearing <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b> Rosemarie does so and her grandfather decides to send her to the village school so that she will have friends.|$|R

25|$|In October 2005, Burger King {{began to}} sell Halloween masks {{resembling}} The King and Burger King's viral marketing character The Subservient Chicken.

Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> quickly sold out, and some masks were also sold on eBay for hundreds of dollars.

5000|$|Stanley Ipkiss/The Mask (voiced by Rob Paulsen) - The primary {{protagonist of}} the series. Instead {{of getting rid}} of <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> as in <b>the</b> movie, he kept it, and {{whenever}} he tries getting rid of [...] "The Mask", he gets into trouble and is often forced to use <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> to overcome these problems, eventually coming to actively rely on <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> to fight supernatural enemies (even facing Satan at one point). Stanley Ipkiss is portrayed as a push over good guy, once described as [...] "repressed, with an overactive superego", but inside of him he has a [...] "wild man under the surface, just waiting to get out". Meanwhile, <b>The</b> <b>Mask,</b> unlike his violent comic book counterpart, is more of a mischievous superhero, who, as Stanley had put it, [...] "Would rather go to water polo night at the Coco Bongo than fight crime". <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> is also apparently even aware of the surroundings when he isn't being worn as during one episode Stanley attempts to control <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> with <b>the</b> Sister <b>Mask</b> which seems to work at first only for <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> to go back to normal and state <b>the</b> sister <b>mask</b> doesn't work at all (though this may actually be due to <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> and Stanley sharing knowledge). <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> also works when broken (when <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> was split in two each half still works but only does half the transformation, finally allowing Stanley and <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> to converse). To date the only thing that truly affects <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> is <b>the</b> Common Cold which throws his powers out of whack and will result in the death of both <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> and <b>the</b> wearer. Also, <b>The</b> <b>Mask's</b> powers are quite dependent on the restraint of its wearer's personality; in one episode, Stanley tries to act like <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> would in order to improve his life at Dr. Neuman's counseling; while Stanley becomes more assertive and confident, <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> stops functioning properly, due to it bringing out the repressed sides of his personality. Due to the different personalities <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> and Stanley have, they often refer to each other as separate people (such as <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> remarking [...] "Oh Stanley is going to hate me in the morning"). In [...] "Split Personalities", it is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> always wanted to give Stanley a wedgie (he even manages to give him a [...] "half-wedgie"). In the same episodes (as pointed out by Stanley), possibly the only thing <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> and Stanley have in common is their lack of success with women (though Mask has more luck and self-confidence in this area, failing only due to the interference of other characters). <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> is shown to be very impulsive, fun-loving and cynical and several times has been shown to have a humongous appetite, once eating twenty pizzas in one bite, loves dancing and impressing ladies at the Coco Bongo, his favorite nightspot, and giving atomic wedgies to his enemies and people who annoy him or Stanley. The one redeeming feature of <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> is his desire not to hurt anyone as shown in [...] "Sister Mask" [...] where he was most displease that his array of gag guns were now firing real bullets as oppose to [...] "Bang flags". <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> does have a big-heart and cares for others and comes to rescues them when in need, especially his friends like Milo and Peggy.|$|R

25|$|Masks {{may also}} {{indicate}} a culture's ideal of feminine beauty. <b>The</b> <b>masks</b> of Punu of Gabon have highly arched eyebrows, almost almond-shaped {{eyes and a}} narrow chin.

The whiteness of the face represent the whiteness and beauty of the spirit world. Only men wear <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> and perform the dances with high stilts despite <b>the</b> <b>masks</b> representing women. One of the most beautiful representations of female beauty is the Idia's Mask of Benin in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.|$|E
