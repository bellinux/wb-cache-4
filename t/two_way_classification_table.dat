40|$|Many agent-oriented {{patterns}} {{have been}} written to capture agent oriented software engineering experiences {{over the past ten}} years. However, there is no unified organization of these patterns and their reuse is almost non existent. In this paper, we present a process for analyzing agent-oriented patterns leading towards the creation of a unified view of these patterns. The process is based on the <b>Two</b> <b>Way</b> <b>classification</b> scheme, a classification scheme designed to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing, classifying and describing agent-oriented patterns. We have investigated almost 100 patterns and classified 28 of them. This paper demonstrates the use of the process to analyze and classify 4 agent-oriented patterns.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The objective {{of this study was to}} attempt to determine if the symptom of fatigue represents a metabolically induced or a perceived component in depressed individuals. Dietary intake patterns were analyzed for 20 depressed individuals to identify nutritional adequacy and the relationship which exists between diet and fatigue. A double blind sugar challenge was conducted to assess the mood altering effect of sugar. After baseline data were gathered, the subject was randomly assigned to consume either a sugar or acesulfame-K sweetened drink. The subject was asked to complete a series of mood scales and blood glucose was monitored every 30 minutes for 2 hours to assess the biological and psychological effects of the sugar. Results of the diet analysis revealed that the depressed male and female subjects had nutritional deficiencies when compared to the Recommended Daily Allowances and the Food Guide Pyramid. These nutritional deficiencies were in calcium, selenium, molybdenum, biotin, vitamin D, iodine, vitamin K, fluoride, and the milk, vegetable, and fruit food groups. Analysis of the blood glucose values following sugar ingestion, using <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant effects of condition, time, and interaction of time and condition on blood glucose. Also blood glucose values indicated impaired glucose tolerance. Each of the POMS, PANAS, and EAS mood scales, analyzed by a <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> repeated measures analysis of variance, revealed a nonsignificant difference for the main effect of condition and condition by time interaction but a significant time effect. The time main effect revealed that subjects' mood improved across time. The interaction effect for the POMS fatigue and anger scale scores approached significance and revealed a rapid decline in the scale scores following sugar consumption. These results indicate nutritional deficiencies in depressed subjects and impaired glucose tolerance which suggests that the fatigue in depressed individuals may be metabolically induced...|$|R
40|$|To {{facilitate}} uniform {{reporting of}} injuries by their nature and body region, a matrix classification of ICD- 9 N-codes is proposed. The proposed grouping of ICD codes {{according to the}} two axes of the matrix (Axis A: Body Region and Axis B: Nature of Injury) is attached. These groupings were defined to be compatible with the ICD- 10. Also, the groupings were defined assuming that only four digit ICD codes were available as many databases (e. g., emergency department and ambulatory care data, vital statistics and some hospital discharge data) do not use a fifth digit. A modified classification is also presented when injuries are classified using only the three digits of the ICD. More refined classifications are possible when more information (i. e., a fifth digit) is available. The proposed classification encompasses all ICD codes 800 - 999. For several categories (e. g., poisonings, late effects etc.), however, the <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> is not applied or irrelevant. Axis A: Body Region: Region Classification.

40|$|Concession {{is one of}} the trickiest {{semantic}} discourse relations {{appearing in}} natural language. Many have tried to sub-categorize Concession and to define formal criteria to both distinguish its subtypes as well as for distinguishing Concession from the (similar) semantic relation of Contrast. But there is still a lack of consensus among the different proposals. In this paper, we focus on those approaches, e. g. Lagerwerf (1998), Winter and Rimon (1994), and Korbayova and Webber (2007), assuming that Concession features two primary interpretations, “direct ” and “indirect”. We argue that this <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> falls short of accounting for the full range of variants identified in naturally occurring data. Our investigation of one thousand Concession tokens in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) reveals that the interpretation of concessive relations varies according to the source of expectation. Four sources of expectation are identified. Each is characterized by a different relation holding between the eventuality that raises the expectation and the eventuality describing the expectation. We report a) a reliable inter-annotator agreement on the four types of sources identified in the PDTB data, b) a significant improvement on the annotation of previous disagreements on Concession-Contrast in the PDTB and c) a novel logical account of Concession using basic constructs from Hobbs (1998) ’s logic. Our proposal offers a uniform framework for the interpretation of Concession while accounting for the different sources of expectation by modifying a single predicate in the proposed formulae...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{problem of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether graduate students in education (the experimentals) participating in a counseling practicum would demonstrate a change in self-actualization which would be significantly different when compared with other graduate students in education (the comparisons) who were not participating in the above program. The investigation was designed to test the following null hypotheses: 1. There will be no significant differences in mean post-test scores between the experimental group and the comparison group as measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory. 2. There will be no significant differences in mean growth toward self-actualization between the experimental group and the comparison group as measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory. 3. There will be no significant differences in mean growth toward self-actualization in the experimental group as measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory. 4. There will be no significant differences in mean growth toward self-actualization in the comparison group as measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory. The sample consisted of 44 graduate education candidates enrolled in graduate education courses at Oregon State University, during the fall term of the 1972 school year. The experimental group (Group I) was comprised of 21 graduate students enrolled in the counseling practicum. The course provided supervised experience which included the following: working with a variety of counselees; weekly critique sessions for the purpose of evaluating video tapes of the counseling sessions; participation in weekly interpersonal-relations groups and weekly counseling by a doctoral candidate. The comparison group (Group II) was comprised of graduate students who had not taken the practicum and were in Research Procedures, a required course for all graduate students in education. The Personal Orientation Inventory was the instrument utilized for the measurement of growth toward self-actualization. The instrument was administered, under pre and post-test conditions, to both groups during the fall quarter. The I (Inner-directed) scale of the Personal Orientation Inventory was utilized as the measure of self-actualization for the testing of the statistical hypotheses. Hypothesis I was tested by an analysis of covariance in a one <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> design with pre-test mean scores, age, sex and, sex and age serving as covariates. Hypothesis II was also tested by an analysis of covariance in a one <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> design on pre-test and post-test mean scores with sample, age, sex, and sex and age serving as covariates. An analysis of variance in a <b>two</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> design was used in analyzing hypotheses III and IV. The. 05 level of significance was selected as the acceptable level of statistical significance. The results of analysis did yield a significant difference at the. 05 level for hypotheses I and II in favor of the experimental group (Group I), those participating in the counselor practicum. In other words, the experimental group was shown to be significantly more selfactualized on the pre-test and post-test mean scores and also showed a more significant mean growth toward self-actualization than the comparison group (Group II). The results of analysis did not yield a significant difference at the. 05 level for hypotheses II/and IV. This is to say that there was no significant difference in mean growth toward selfactualization between pre-test and post-test mean scores of the sample and the comparison group (Group II). The comparison group showed nonsignificant negative mean growth toward self-actualization. In essence, the results of this investigation support the discriminatory power of the Personal Orientation Inventory and the position that a counseling practicum does have a significant impact on the personal development of participants...|$|R
