5|$|As a captain, Gilligan was well-liked by {{players and}} commentators, {{although}} many {{did not believe}} he was an effective tactician. Nevertheless, under his leadership, Sussex became an attractive, competitive team. He encouraged the search for young talent, and the players consequently discovered became {{the backbone of the}} club into the 1930s. As a fielder, he inspired his teams to become good fielding sides. In addition, as MCC captain of a team which toured India in 1926–27, he encouraged Indians <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own cricket board instead of allowing white Englishmen to run Indian cricket, and lobbied the MCC to bestow Test match status on the Indian team. As MCC president, he played a part in the D'Oliveira affair in 1968. He died in 1976, aged 81.|$|E
5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> lives.|$|E

2500|$|Buddhist {{scholars}} look to this sonnet {{to illustrate}} {{that the nature}} of love lies in the awareness of life's impermanence; a lesson often learned too late. Ultimately, the one who must be loved is ourselves as we march past all the warning signs, into the black night. The curious line 'death's second self' strikes at the duality between the objective perception of death in others and the ego's interpretation of that event. In a sense, this sonnet also reaches back into pagan images of pyres and sacrifice, as well as reaching into a future that, instead of exaltations of heaven's glory, urges the reader <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own relationship with reality. - Austin Sirch ...|$|E
2500|$|Solo diving, once {{considered}} technical diving and discouraged by most recreational diver certification agencies as {{more dangerous than}} buddy diving, is now considered by many experienced divers and some certification agencies to be an acceptable practice for suitably trained, equipped, and competent recreational divers, and by some other agencies to be occasionally inevitable. Rather than relying on the traditional buddy diving safety system, solo divers are self-sufficient and willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own safety while diving. The first training agency to offer a Solo Diving certification was Scuba Diving International (SDI) in 1999. In 2011, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) started offering a solo specialty called [...] "Self-Reliant Diver", which in many respects (entry requirements, for example) {{is very similar to}} the course offered by SDI.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard's {{pamphlets}} and polemical books, including The Moment, criticized {{several aspects}} of church formalities and politics. According to Kierkegaard, the idea of congregations keeps individuals as children since Christians are disinclined from taking the initiative <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own relation to God. He stressed that [...] "Christianity is the individual, here, the single individual". Furthermore, since the Church was controlled by the State, Kierkegaard believed the State's bureaucratic mission was to increase membership and oversee the welfare of its members. More members would mean more power for the clergymen: a corrupt ideal. This mission would seem at odds with Christianity's true doctrine, which, to Kierkegaard, is to {{stress the importance of}} the individual, not the whole. Thus, the state-church political structure is offensive and detrimental to individuals, since anyone can become [...] "Christian" [...] without knowing {{what it means to be}} Christian. It is also detrimental to the religion itself since it reduces Christianity to a mere fashionable tradition adhered to by unbelieving [...] "believers", a [...] "herd mentality" [...] of the population, so to speak. Kierkegaard always stressed the importance of the conscience and the use of it.|$|E
