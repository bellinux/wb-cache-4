40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of a {{prolonged}} acid and thermal attack, on the surface of PTFE by Fourier Transform Infrared Micro-Spectroscopy (FT-IR). The materials are commercialized by two alternative producers in form of <b>Teflon</b> <b>tapes.</b> These tapes are installed in process plants where tires moulds are cleaned inside a multistage ultrasonic process. In these cases, <b>Teflon</b> <b>tapes,</b> having a role of gaskets, show inexplicably phenomena of degradation in relatively short operation periods. Even considering that these gaskets are exposed to the combined effect of ultrasonic waves, temperature, humidity and acid attack, the PTFE properties of resistance nominally exclude the possibility of these severe erosion phenomena. An interesting explanation can be related to the potential presence in the cleaning solution, mainly based on sulfamic acid, of highly reactive chemical compounds, as chlorides and fluorides, originated by the disaggregation of elements from the tire composition and/or additives used as processing aids and/or by catalytic effect generated by fluorine produced by PTFE degradation. In general, up to 300 different chemical elements, both organic and inorganic, natural and synthetic, are merged in a tire. Since this composition is practically unknown, especially regarding additives and “unusual elements”, representing a secrecy of each tire manufactures, it is really complex to define the chemical composition of the cleaning solution with an appropriate precision. As a consequence, the gaskets have been treated with different mixtures of acids in the way to combine a larger range of possibilities. Thus, the FT-IR experimental characterization of PTFE surface properties followed an appropriate accelerated aging, aiming at actuating the specific mechanics of wearing as in industrial use. The different acid treatments adopted for accelerating the aging of gaskets have highlighted the different behaviour of the PTFE matrix, but also differences between manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of a {{prolonged}} acid attack on the surface of PTFE by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). PTFE is very non-reactive, partly because of the strength of carbon–fluorine bonds and for its high crystallinity, and, as a consequence, it is often used in containers and pipework with reactive and corrosive chemicals. The PTFE under analysis is commercialized by two alternative producers in form of <b>Teflon</b> <b>tapes.</b> These tapes are adopted, as gaskets, in process plants where tires moulds are cleaned by acid solutions inside a multistage ultrasonic process. In this case, PTFE shows, in a relatively short operation time, inexplicably phenomena of surface degradation, which could be related, in general terms, to an acid attack. But, even considering the combined effect of ultrasonic waves, temperature, humidity and acid attack, the PTFE properties of resistance nominally exclude the risk of the extreme erosion phenomena as observed. The present experimental research aim at investigating this contradiction. A possible explanation could be related to the presence in the cleaning solution of unexpected fluorides, able to produce fluorinating agents and, thus, degrade carbon-fluorine bonds. Considering more the 300 chemical elements a tire compound consists in, it is really complex to preserve the original chemical composition of the cleaning solution. In this research PTFE samples have been treated with different mixtures of acids with the aim at investigating the different aging effects. The thermal analysis has permitted the experimental characterization of PTFE surface properties after acid attack, providing evidence of the degradation phenomena. In particular, the different acid treatments adopted for accelerating the aging of gaskets have highlighted the different behaviour of the PTFE matrix, but also differences between manufacturers...|$|R

Recently, it has been proposed that birds are able to modify plumage UV reflectance by the application of uropygial gland secretion. Based on a survey of the optical properties of this secretion from 51 species belonging to 12 avian orders, we show that two main types of uropygial secretions exist, one predominantly found in passerines and one in non-passerines, both reducing relative UV reflectance of a white background (<b>Teflon</b> (TM) <b>tape).</b> We quantified how each type of secretion (exemplified by blue tit and mallard) affected feather UV reflectance. Both secretions reduced overall brightness and relative UV reflectance of white mallard feathers but hardly affected the reflectance of UV/blue blue tit crown feathers. According to models of avian colour vision, changes in reflectance due to application of the secretion were at or below the discrimination threshold of most birds. We conclude that the uropygial secretion is unlikely to play a major role in modifying plumage UV reflectance. However, the optical properties of the uropygial secretion may have been selected to interfere as little as possible with visual signaling through plumage reflectance...|$|R

40|$|On {{the early}} morning of September 15 th, 2016, {{on the first floor}} of Building 31 at NASA-Johnson Space Center, the hose from a water chiller {{ruptured}} and began spraying water onto the floor. The water had been circulating though old metal pipes, and the leaked water contained rust-colored particulates. The water flooded much of the western wing of the building's ground floor before the leak was stopped, and it left behind a residue of rust across the floor, most notably in the Apollo and Meteorite Thin Section Labs and Sample Preparation Lab. No samples were damaged in the event, and the affected facilities are in the process of remediation.

In that lab, a water leak occurred at the bottom of the sink used to clean the lab's tools and containers with ultra-pure water.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The {{thermal contact}} {{conductance}} (TCC) between two machined pieces {{of stainless steel}} was studied. A guarded hot plate thermal conductivity test fixture was designed and built for the experiment. Factors investigated included the contact pressure, surface roughness, interface material and average test temperature. The contact pressure at the interface ranged from 80 to 800 psi. The mean surface roughness of the opposing surfaces was 2. 8 μin (. 0708 μm) parallel to the sanding direction and 1. 9 μin (. 0482 μm) perpendicular to the sanding direction. Interface materials included air, indium foil, copper foil, <b>Teflon</b> <b>tape,</b> silver filled paint and thermal grease. Average test temperatures ranged from 0 °C to 100 °C, in 20 °C increments. With air alone in the interface gap the TCC was nearly insensitive to contact pressure. The thermal grease and silver filled paint most increased the TCC over air alone while being nearly insensitive to pressure. With indium foil the TCC was similar to air, but improved somewhat with increasing pressure. With copper foil the TCC was lower than air alone, but increased with increasing pressure. The <b>Teflon</b> <b>tape</b> had a lower TCC than air at low contact pressure, but a higher TCC than air at higher pressures. In general the TCC improved somewhat at higher temperatures. The ability of an interface material to improve the TCC is more a function of its flow stress and wetting ability than its thermal conductivity.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Fine {{particle}} processing {{has long}} been a challenge in the minerals processing industry. Ores often have to be ground to less than 100 μm in size in order to liberate the valuable components. Even in the coal industry, where there is minimal comminution, a considerable fraction of the run-of-mine coal is less than 100 μm in size. Hence, {{it can be difficult to}} efficiently recover these fine particles using existing beneficiation methods, such as flotation. In the past few decades, there has been on-going effort focussed on developing methods to separate finer particles in an efficient way, with an increasing interest in approaches that involve dry particles. This Thesis is concerned with the potential for achieving selective separations through contacting particles with water drops. More specifically, the objective was to achieve selective capture of the hydrophilic particles via the water phase, leaving the hydrophobic particles in a dry state. Two different approaches were investigated through the establishment of novel experimental systems. The first approach involved a system consisting of falling water drops passing through a gas-suspension of particles. Conceptually, this approach is the opposite of conventional flotation. A gaseous dispersion of particles was used instead of a water based dispersion of particles, and a system of falling water drops was used instead of a system of rising air bubbles. Thus the particles travelled horizontally with the airflow, colliding with drops via the gas side of the gas-liquid interface of the falling drops. The hydrophobic particles either adhered at the surface or were deflected, while the hydrophilic particles were engulfed completely, settling through to the base of the drop. Ideally the hydrophobic particles passed through the collection zone, reporting in a dry form. Thus, in the context of the coal industry, a high calorific dry product should be generated. Due to the low viscosity of air compared to water, the collision efficiency of the particles with the water drops should increase significantly compared to conventional flotation. Thus viscous forces become far less significant, allowing the inertial forces to dominate, even for ultrafine particles. Energy consumption should then be much lower. A new laboratory-scale experimental system was then designed and set up to further investigate this approach. The development of this facility represented a major outcome of the study, the goal being to control the steady flow of the particles and the drops to achieve reproducible and meaningful data sets. A number of design modifications were needed to achieve these requirements. The experimental system consisted of a feed column, water distribution chamber mounted over a collision chamber, underflow collection system, and dry particle cyclone stage. The airflow was driven by an air suction pump. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles covering a broad size range (8 - 116 μm) and spherical and irregular shapes were used in the experimental program to investigate the selective collection efficiency of this system. Results, expressed in terms of the recovery to underflow, were found to be highly reproducible, to within 3 %. A simple mathematical model was also developed to describe the interception of the particles with the water drops. Particles were assumed to be collected if there was any overlap in the trajectories of the particles and the drops. In one version, the particle velocity was assumed to be much higher than the falling speed of the drops, while in a second version the particle velocity was assumed to be much smaller than the drop speed. These models were then validated using the Discrete Element Method, demonstrating the accuracy of the model in these two extremes. Moreover, the DEM approach allowed intermediate, less extreme, conditions to be examined. Thus the modelling approach provided an appreciation of the principle parameters governing the interception, most notably the water flux, droplet diameter, and active length of the collection zone. Clearly, the model did not consider the subtle effects associated with the particle-drop adhesion, dynamic wetting, disengagement from the fluid streamlines, and particle shape effects. These more subtle effects were manifested through the experimental work. The recovery of the particles in the underflow was calculated relative to the total feed that passed through the experimental system. There was a linear dependence between the particle recovery in the underflow and the water flux, with a slope dependent on the relative selectivity between the different particle species. The analysis was examined using a water flux of up to 0. 0167 m 3 /(m 2 s). The results agreed well with the analytical and DEM models within the aforementioned water flux range. With the second approach, electrostatic formation of liquid marbles was investigated as an alternative mechanism for collecting hydrophilic glass ballotini particles into a water drop. In these experiments curious electrostatic phenomena were observed, resulting in the formation of particle agglomerates. Fine hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles on a charged substrate were seen to intermittently jump across a gap of several millimetres to penetrate the surface of a hanging water drop. The substrate was wrapped in <b>Teflon</b> (PTFE) <b>tape,</b> which provided an ideal substrate for frictional charging. Within around 300 milliseconds, the drop filled up like a 'sack of marbles'. Charge and volume data analysis of these experiments revealed that there is a tendency of the particles to jump to the drop intermittently in sudden 'cascades' or 'avalanches', rather than through gradual and incremental transfer as the substrate was moved toward the hanging drop. Although the distance between the substrate and the drop was important in affecting particle lift, the substrate speed had relatively little effect on the onset of the particle ‘avalanche’. This interesting phenomenon was also observed using different organic liquids such as glycerine and hexane. Overall, it was apparent that a limited selectivity between hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles can be achieved through direct interaction between a gaseous dispersion of the particles and a system of water drops. However, the level of selectivity was deemed to be insufficient for justifying the development of a successful industrial separation. The data sets generated from this work can be useful in any follow-up work in improving our understanding of the precise particle-drop interception, and final interaction. Electrostatic forces were clearly powerful across significant distances, and offered the potential for developing innovative methods for processing fine, dry particles. This approach may also prove useful in the formation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic liquid marbles...|$|R

For each of the hermetic containers, polyethene rubbers were placed on them after which they were securely sealed with <b>Teflon</b> <b>tape</b> (also known as plumbing tape) prior to placing their lids to ensure airtight conditions as performed by [9]. The non-hermetic containers were also filled with 500  g of grains after which six weevils were manually counted and placed into each. Muslin cloth was placed on each of the non-hermetic containers to prevent the entry of other insects and also help air to circulate around the grains [12].|$|E
40|$|Implanted {{satellite}} transmitters {{are used}} in seaducks to track migration routes, breeding, and wintering grounds. However, high mortality rates, handling stress, and inadequate small-scale location data necessitates the use of external transmitters. Three external transmitter attachment techniques were tested, including a <b>Teflon</b> <b>tape</b> harness, sutures to anchor the transmitter through the dorsal vertebral processes, or a 3 D individually customized silicon harness on 12 surf scoters (Melanitta perspicillata). Body weight, serum and hematology chemistry, behavioral time budgets, and dive performance were used as measures of impact for each transmitter. Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) transmitter performance was evaluated for accuracy, precision, and battery performance for use in seabirds. All methods had transient effects on weight, serum chemistry, immune response (sutured transmitters), and increased bottom and total dive times. Teflon harnesses impacted behavior. Silicon harnesses had the least deleterious effects compared to other treatments. Accordingly, we recommend silicon harnesses for deploying external transmitters in wild seaducks...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft visual {{inspection}} is often augmented by non-destructive evaluation methods and tools. This research explores one such tool, the eddyscope, {{which is used}} to identify structural defects, corrosion, cracks in bolt holes, and sub-surface cracks. Current training on this piece of equipment involves shadowing an expert during the inspection process; however, this on-the-job training is expensive, time-consuming, and dependent on the expertise and performance of the inspector. A computer-aided eddyscope training and simulation tool is proposed as a solution. To investigate this possibility, the study reported here used a hierarchical task analysis of an eddy current inspection using interviews with technicians, shadowing of Level III technicians, video and audio recordings, and a documentation review; in addition, the think-aloud protocol was used during the inspection of an aircraft for surface flaws. The results identified 11 best practices, focusing on how to calibrate, position, hold, and scan with the eddyscope as well as physical and environmental considerations such as temperature, the use of <b>Teflon</b> <b>tape</b> to minimize wear and reduce probe noise, and the use of nonmetallic guides and templates to reduce the edge effect. These results will serve as a base line for developing a virtual eddyscope training tool...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBonding of {{composite}} structures is regularly used in aerospace industry to restore structural integrity in repair or assemble sub-structures. This structural feature {{is prone to}} degradation with improper installation or disbond when submitted to fatigue or extreme strains. Therefore, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) should be considered to inspect adhesive bonded joints. In comparision with traditional NDE, a built-in structural health monitoring (SHM) would be more desirable to save the inspection cost as well as improve safety. The objective {{of this research is}} to evaluate integrity of composite bonded joints using guided wave propagation technique. Two carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) are bonded together using adhesive film and artificial disbond is introduced by a circular <b>Teflon</b> <b>tape.</b> A rectangular piezoceramic is used to generate plane guided waves and non-contact measurement is performed using 3 -D Laser Doppler Vibrometer to extract the required information for evaluation of quality of bond line. Results have shown that the joint can be charactized using guided wave behavior, and reflection and transmision coefficients for incident A 0 and S 0 modes are extracted in order to design the final SHM system...|$|E
40|$|The protein {{crystal growth}} (PCG) {{experiments}} run on 51 -F were analyzed. It was found that: (1) sample stability is increased over that observed during the experiments on flight 51 -D; (2) the dialysis experiments produced lysozyme crystals that were significantly {{larger than those}} obtained in our identical ground-based studies; (3) temperature fluctuations apparently caused problems during the crystallization experiments on 51 -F; (4) it is indicated that <b>teflon</b> <b>tape</b> stabilizes droplets on the syringe tips; (5) samples survived during the reentry and landing in glass tips that were not stoppered with plungers; (6) from the ground-based studies, {{it was expected that}} equilibration should be complete within 2 to 4 days for all of these vapor-diffusion experiments, thus it appears that the vapor diffusion rates are somewhat slower under microgravity conditions; (7) drop tethering was highly successful, all four of the tethered drops were stable, even though they contained MPD solutions; (8) the PCG experiments on 51 -F were done to assess the hardware and experimental procedures that are developed for future flights, when temperature control will be available. Lysozyme crystals obtained by microdialysis are considerably larger than those obtained on the ground, using the identical apparatus and procedures...|$|E
