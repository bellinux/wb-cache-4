40|$|The {{implementation}} of dense, one-selector one-resistor (1 S 1 R), resistive switching memory arrays, {{can be achieved}} with an appropriate selector for correct information storage and retrieval. Ovonic threshold switches (OTS) based on chalcogenide materials are a strong candidate, but their low thermal stability {{is one of the}} key factors that prevents rapid adoption by emerging resistive switching memory technologies. A previously developed map for phase change materials is expanded and improved for OTS materials. Selected materials from different areas of the map, belonging to binary Ge-Te and Si-Te systems, are explored. Several routes, including Si doping and reduction of Te amount, are used to increase the crystallization <b>temperature.</b> <b>Selector</b> devices, with areas as small as 55 x 55 nm(2), were electrically assessed. Sub-threshold conduction models, based on Poole-Frenkel conduction mechanism, are applied to fresh samples in order to extract as-processed material parameters, such as trap height and density of defects, tailoring of which could be an important element for designing a suitable OTS material. Finally, a glass transition temperature estimation model is applied to Te-based materials in order to predict materials that might have the required thermal stability. A lower average number of p-electrons is correlated with a good thermal stability...|$|E
40|$|The enantiomeric {{resolution}} of certain 2 -arylpropionic acids was achieved on thin silica gel plates impregnated with optically pure l-(−) -serine as chiral selector. The mobile phase enabling successful {{resolution of}} (±) -ibuproxam and (±) -ketoprofen was acetonitrile–methanol–water (16 : 4 : 0. 5, v/v/v) and (16 : 3 : 0. 5, v/v/v) for (±) -tiaprofenic acid. The spots were detected with iodine vapors and the detection limits {{were found to}} be different for each of the 2 -arylpropionic acid, ranging between 0. 25 and 0. 50 μg/ml. The effect of concentration of the impregnating chiral <b>selector,</b> <b>temperature</b> and pH on resolution has been studied. The procedure was applied successfully to resolve commercial ampoules of ketoprofen dosage formulation...|$|R
40|$|Geometrical {{design of}} the spiral crystal {{selector}} can affect crystal orientation in the final single crystal structure. To achieve {{a better understanding of}} conditions associated with the onset of crystal orientation in a spiral crystal <b>selector,</b> <b>temperature</b> field was investigated using three-dimensional finite element method during the process. Different geometries of spiral crystal selector were used to produce Al- 3 wt. % Cu alloy single crystal using a Bridgman type furnace. The Crystal orientation of the samples was determined using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and optical microscopy. Analysing the temperature field in the crystal selector revealed that, the orientation of growing dendrites against liquidus isotherm in the spiral selector was the reason for crystal misorientation which differs in various selector geometries. Increasing the take-off angle from 35 ° up to 45 ° increases the misorientation with respect to direction. Further increase of take-off angle greater than 45 ° will decrease the crystal misorientation again and the efficiency of the selector to produce a single grain is decreased...|$|R
40|$|Enantioselective {{separation}} of the sunscreen agent 3 -(4 -methylbenzylidene) -camphor by electrokinetic chromatography: Quantitative analysis in cosmetic formulations 3 -(4 -Methylbenzylidene) -camphor (MBC) is a chiral sunscreen agent used in cosmetic products. In this work, the enantio{{separation of}} MBC has been performed by EKC and applied {{to the analysis of}} the MBC enantiomers in cosmetic creams. Different experi-mental conditions (type and concentration of the chiral <b>selector,</b> <b>temperature,</b> and sample solvent) have been optimized. Due to the neutral nature of this compound, anionic CD derivatives were investigated as chiral selectors. Carboxymethylated-b-CD (CM-b-CD) showed the highest chiral separation power, observing that a 15 mM con-centration of this CD at a working temperature of 157 C enabled to obtain the highest enantioresolution. However, under these conditions, tailing of peaks obtained for the enantiomers was observed. The addition of increasing concentrations of the neutral a-CD to CM-b-CD at a 15 mM concentration in a 100 mM borate buffer at pH 9. 0 improved the enantiomeric separation and decreased peak tailing. The use of DMF for the total dissolution of the cosmetic creams, and methanol:water (1 : 1 v/v) for appro-priate dilution enabled to observe good shape and size for the peaks of the MBC enantiomers. After optimizing a method for the preconditioning of the capillary, the analytical characteristics of the chiral separation method for the analysis of MBC were investigated. Linearity, LODs and LOQs, precision (instrumental repeatability, method repeatability, intermediate precision), accuracy, and selectivity were evaluated. The method was applied to analyze MBC enantiomers contained in two commercial cos-metic creams containing racemic MBC and to study the skin absorption of this com-pound with time...|$|R
