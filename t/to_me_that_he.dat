He boasted {{so much of}} the {{assistance}} he had rendered authors, that at last he believed he had written their works. Had he been connected with Fielding, he would no doubt have asserted that he wrote a great portion of Tom Jones. Moreover, he was excessively troublesome and obtrusive in his suggestions.

500|$|Extant {{biographies of}} Epaminondas universally {{describe}} {{him as one of}} the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: [...] "Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone." [...] Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record: [...] "For it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, [...] Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior".|$|E
500|$|The dress rehearsal, with Debussy, Ravel, {{other musicians}} and critics among those present, passed without incident. However, the {{following}} evening the premiere provoked something approaching a riot, with loud verbal {{abuse of the}} work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out. Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him. Stravinsky wrote [...] "The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than {{the picture of the}} stage. He stood there apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile. It is still incredible <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually brought the orchestra through to the end." [...] The extensive press coverage of the incident made Monteux [...] "at age thirty-eight, truly a famous conductor". The company presented the Rite during its London season a few weeks later. The Times reported that although there was [...] "something like a hostile reception" [...] at the first London performance, the final performance in the season [...] "was received with scarcely a sign of opposition". Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to The Rite of Spring.|$|E
500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... it never occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, I was sure that I was in love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible for me not to be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E

500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from post-polio syndrome, and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> woke up one morning and didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had just gone out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in longhand, leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E

2500|$|René Pommier {{has pointed}} {{out a number of}} {{problems}} with the Girardian claim that all desire is mimetic. [...] First, {{it is very hard to}} explain the existence of taboo desires, such as homosexuality in repressive societies, on that basis.. On Girard's defence on the other hand, Jean-Michel Oughourlian exemplifies the situation by noting that [...] "one homosexual admitted <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> just wanted to be somebody else".|$|E

Both tariff reform and Ulster dominated his political work, with Austen Chamberlain saying that Law [...] "once said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> cared intensely for only two things: Tariff Reform and Ulster; all the rest was only part of the game".|$|E
2500|$|By mid-December, it {{was obvious}} that Buford was sick, {{possibly}} from contracting typhoid, and he took respite at the Washington home of his good friend, General George Stoneman. On December 16, Stoneman initiated the proposal that Buford be promoted to major general, and President Abraham Lincoln assented, writing as follows: [...] "I am informed that General Buford will not survive the day. It suggests itself <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will be made Major General for distinguished and meritorious service at the Battle of Gettysburg." [...] Informed of the promotion, Buford inquired doubtfully, [...] "Does he mean it?"

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this policy, in the same Washington Post article, Dr. Myers stated that: [...] "I was {{recently}} informed by the director of data research at U.S. News, the person at the magazine who has {{a lot to say about}} how the rankings are computed, that absent students' SAT scores, the magazine will calculate the college's ranking by assuming an arbitrary average SAT score of one standard deviation (roughly 200 points) below the average score of our peer group. In other words, in the absence of real data, they will make up a number. He made clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believes that schools that do not use SAT scores in their admission process are admitting less capable students and therefore should lose points on their selectivity index." ...|$|E

In particular, they have not explained how giving federal authorities more time to build a case for Yucca Mountain or appointing a Yucca advocate to the nuclear projects board could possibly be interpreted as being {{in line with the}} state’s opposition to the plan." [...] Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) said [...] "this amounts to surrendering in Nevada's decades-long fight against the project". Rep.

2500|$|In 1976, Powell {{left the}} University of Texas {{to take a}} {{position}} as a curator at the National Gallery of Art (NGA). The NGA's director at the time, J.

2500|$|On {{the centennial}} of Escrivá's birthday, Cardinal Ratzinger (who became Pope Benedict XVI) commented: [...] "I have always been {{impressed}} by Josemaría Escrivá's explanation of the name 'Opus Dei': an explanation ... gives {{us an idea of}} the founder's spiritual profile. Escrivá knew he had to found something, but he was also conscious that what he was founding was not his own work, that he himself did not invent anything and that the Lord was merely making use of him. So it was not his work, but Opus Dei (God's Work). [...] gives us to understand that he was in a permanent dialogue, a real contact with the One who created us and works for us and with us... If therefore St Josemaría speaks of the common vocation to holiness, it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is basically drawing on his own personal experience, not of having done incredible things himself, but of having let God work. Therefore a renewal, a force for good was born in the world even if human weaknesses will always remain." ...|$|E

[...] David Treviño added that his father [...] "made hard decisions and embodied the true spirit of leadership. His style pushed everyone to do more, to excel, and to do it better." [...] He went on to add that [...] "when someone had something unkind or false to say about Dad, I argued with him that he needed to respond because in the absence of truth, people might believe the lies that were being said about him. [...] But he chose to keep quiet and explained <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had lived his life in such a manner so that anyone who really knew him would not believe it."
