5|$|The {{original}} idea, {{known as}} The Un-Natural World was {{of an urban}} fox living in Brixton called Nelson, who was so used to {{living in the city}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> any sense of being an animal. It also featured a cat, Marion, who was trying to encourage Nelson to be more animal-like.|$|E
5|$|During {{subsequent}} {{discussions with}} a US consular official, Terrazas gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} or not he had truly intended to abandon his rights as a US citizen when he applied for his certificate of Mexican nationality. The State Department eventually concluded <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> his US citizenship, a decision which Terrazas appealed, first before the State Department's board of appellate review, and subsequently to the courts.|$|E

5|$|The {{light and}} {{grenadier}} companies {{were involved in}} the capture, shortly afterwards, of St Lucia and the recapture of Guadeloupe. A short period as garrison duty followed and then the regiment returned to England, severely weakened by both losses in battle and sickness, mostly yellow fever. Sir Charles Grey, commander of the British forces in the West Indies, estimated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> 5,000 out of 7,000 troops in less than six months.|$|E

Within a month of his escape, he turned up in Mexico as John Martin. He reported to the British Embassy there <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> his passport, and {{managed to get a}} replacement.

5|$|In 1877 Beato sold most of {{his stock}} to the firm Stillfried & Andersen, who then moved into his studio. In turn, Stillfried & Andersen sold the stock to Adolfo Farsari in 1885. Following the sale to Stillfried & Andersen, Beato {{apparently}} retired for some years from photography, concentrating on his parallel career as a financial speculator and trader. On 29 November 1884 he left Japan, ultimately landing in Port Said, Egypt.

5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 season, {{although}} great by most players' standards, was a lean {{year for}} Federer. He {{was defeated in}} straight sets in the semifinals of the 2011 Australian Open by eventual champion Novak Djokovic, marking {{the first time since}} July 2003 that he did not hold any of the four major titles. In the French Open semifinals, Federer ended Djokovic's undefeated streak of 43 consecutive wins with a four-set victory. However, Federer then lost in the final to Rafael Nadal. At Wimbledon, Federer advanced to his 29th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, but lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. It marked {{the first time in his}} career <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> a Grand Slam tournament match after winning the first two sets.|$|E
5|$|At a VCA {{meeting in}} April 1981, Loxton {{announced}} that he was severing all connections with organised cricket. He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons, as he would be moving to the Gold Coast in Queensland with his wife. However, he proceeded to give a blunt 15-minute speech, claiming <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> the art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating to the Gold Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers.|$|E

5|$|Realizing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> the initiative, was low on {{ammunition}} and food, {{and had more}} than 10,000 of his men killed, wounded, or missing, Beauregard could go no further. He withdrew beyond Shiloh Church, leaving 5,000 men under Breckinridge as a covering force, and massed Confederate batteries at the church and on the ridge south of Shiloh Branch. Confederate forces kept the Union men in position on the Corinth Road until 5 p.m., then began an orderly withdrawal southwest to Corinth. The exhausted Union soldiers did not pursue much farther than the original Sherman and Prentiss encampments. Lew Wallace's division crossed Shiloh Branch and advanced nearly , but received no support from other units and was recalled. They returned to Sherman's camps at dark. The battle was over.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and Chandler now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E
5|$|During the journey, Pattle {{developed}} a fever and high temperature. Nevertheless, on 19 April {{he took to}} the skies in several missions. By this date, Pattle's fever had metamorphosed into influenza and his condition had worsened. He did not want his squadron {{to know he was}} unwell. Pattle feared the effect it would have on morale and vowed to continue flying. The officer commanding No. 80 Squadron, Tap Jones, visited Pattle the day before and noticed he was very gaunt, drawn and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> weight. Jones helped the weakened Pattle change into his flying gear. Jones was acting wing commander, but did not ban Pattle from operations. Pattle claimed six victories this day — three Ju 88s and three Bf 109s — plus one Henschel Hs 126 shared and two probables (a Ju 88 and a Bf 109). The battle with the Bf 109s took place over Eleusis and Tanagra airfields. He engaged III./Jagdgeschwader 77 (Fighter Wing 77 or JG 77) in a head-on position and executed an Immelmann turn which took him behind and above the Messerschmitts and allowed him to claim three of them shot down. No. 33 Squadron claimed four Bf 109s (three were lost). Among the victims was the German ace, Kurt Ubben. Ubben landed in Allied territory and was picked up by a Fieseler Fi 156, escaping to his own lines.|$|E

5|$|For {{three days}} Peard sailed north and east, on several {{occasions}} believing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> the French only for Ganteaume's ships to reappear over the horizon once more as light winds hampered his escape. At dawn on 13 February, Peard realised that he would eventually be caught and defeated, and swung Success back towards the west, hoping that by doing so he would lead the French straight into any British forces that might now be searching for Ganteaume. The plan failed when the wind disappeared completely at noon, and by 15:00 two French ships of the line had approached within gunshot. Hopelessly outnumbered, the frigate surrendered without further resistance and {{was attached to the}} French squadron as Succès, the crew provided by detachments from other vessels. Peard and his men joined the prisoners taken from Incendiary and Sprightly on Ganteaume's flagship Indivisible and were closely questioned as to British movements in the Mediterranean. When interrogated, Peard informed Ganteaume that the invasion of Egypt was already underway, that the Eastern Mediterranean was controlled by a powerful fleet under Lord Keith and that a squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren was actively hunting the French and could appear at any moment.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. first fired unitary (C-model) Tomahawks at the Khost camps, {{aiming to}} attract militants into the open, then {{launched}} {{a barrage of}} D-model missiles equipped with submunitions to maximize casualties. Sources differ on the precise number of casualties inflicted by the missile strikes. Bin Laden bodyguard Abu Jandal and militant trainee Abdul Rahman Khadr later estimated that only six men {{had been killed in}} the strikes. The Taliban claimed 22 Afghans killed and over 50 seriously injured, while Berger put al-Qaeda casualties at between 20 and 30 men. Bin Laden jokingly told militants that only a few camels and chickens had died, although his spokesman cited losses of six Arabs killed and five wounded, seven Pakistanis killed and over 15 wounded, and 15 Afghans killed. A declassified September 9, 1998, State Department cable stated that around 20 Pakistanis and 15 Arabs died, {{out of a total of}} over 50 killed in the attack. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen's leader, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, initially claimed a death toll of over 50 militants, but later said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> fewer than ten fighters.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Domnall's {{rule in the}} kingdom is unknown, and it is {{questionable}} whether he had any real authority in the northern Hebrides, furthest from Mann. In about 1097, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) sent a delegate named Ingimundr into the Isles to take possession of the kingdom. After installing himself on Lewis, Ingimundr was overthrown and killed whilst attempting to usurp the kingship. Ingimundr's rationale for seating himself upon an island {{on the edge of}} the kingdom may have been due to the fact that he was unable to gain any authority on Mann itself. In fact, the chronicle reveals that civil war erupted there the following year, and the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (died c. 1142) indicates that Mann was devastated to point of being a virtual desert by the time Magnús appeared on the scene. The warring itself may have been related to the aforesaid factional struggles between Gofraid's sons. Although it is possible that it was Magnús who actually forced Domnall from the Isles, the fact the chronicle makes no mention of Domnall during the recorded conflict on Mann may be evidence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> control of the island by then.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} {{deterioration in}} Rhodes's bowling {{continued into the}} 1906 season when Wisden commented <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> his sharp spin and was not dangerous on a hard wicket. Rhodes scored 1,721 runs, now regularly opening the batting, and completed another double with 128 wickets, but the Wisden correspondent did not believe this compensated for his lost bowling. In 1907, Rhodes scored fewer runs and increased his bowling aggregate, securing 173 wickets in a wet season. Wisden believed his greater bowling success was due to a reduced batting contribution, but he still completed the double by scoring 1,045 runs. During that season, Rhodes was again asked to open the batting for Yorkshire and he {{was chosen as the}} permanent replacement for John Tunnicliffe as Yorkshire's opening batsman. Several batsmen had been tried in the position, but Rhodes's superior defensive technique with the bat secured him the role. Despite the increase in wickets, Rhodes was not picked for any of the Tests that year against South Africa, Colin Blythe being preferred.|$|E

In about 1097, Magnús sent a delegate named Ingimundr into the Isles to take possession of the kingdom. After installing himself in Lewis, Ingimundr was overthrown and killed whilst attempting to usurp the kingship. Ingimundr's rationale for seating himself upon an island (Lewis and Harris) {{on the edge of}} the kingdom may have been due to the fact that he was unable to gain any authority on Mann itself. In fact, the chronicle reveals that civil war erupted there the following year, and the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (died c. 1142) indicates that Mann was devastated to point of being a virtual desert by the time Magnús appeared on the scene. The warring itself may have been related to the aforesaid factional struggles between Guðrøðr's sons. Although it is possible that it was Magnús who actually forced Domnall from the Isles, the fact the chronicle makes no mention of Domnall during the recorded conflict on Mann may be evidence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> control of the island by then. Within the year, the same source records the arrival of Magnús himself, which could suggest that it was Ingimundr's slaying, at the hands of the Islesmen, that had incited Magnús to take matters into his own hands.|$|E
