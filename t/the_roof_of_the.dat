5|$|The skull {{has a long}} rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (between the eyes), and low braincase. It {{differs from}} that of T.bolivaris in various proportions, which are more {{apparent}} in adults than in juveniles. The skull of H.megacephalus is distinctly larger. The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward. The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins; T.bolivaris is similar, but has stronger beading and H.megacephalus entirely lacks the beading. The parietal bone is usually limited to <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most T.bolivaris. The interparietal bone, part of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> braincase, is large.|$|E
