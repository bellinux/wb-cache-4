40|$|This is a {{story of}} two spatial designers: The Mathematician and <b>the</b> <b>Architect.</b> In <b>the</b> four {{dimensional}} space of a Mathematician, most physical realities must be ignored in order for the space to remain pure. The visual, {{one of the most powerful}} tools of <b>the</b> <b>Architect,</b> can coexist within the Mathematician's four dimensional world without affecting its purity. However, <b>the</b> <b>Architect</b> must ignore his/her physical realities, such as gravity, mass, and human scale. The Mathematician establishes the rules within which <b>the</b> <b>Architect</b> must operate. <b>The</b> <b>Architect</b> manipulates form through a structure that is defined by <b>the</b> Mathematician. <b>The</b> <b>Architect</b> explores spatial qualities through the tools that the Mathematician gives him/her. <b>The</b> <b>Architect</b> tries to understand the meaning of the form that both of them have created. He/she pushes the form in order for it to achieve spatial qualities. Together, the Mathematician and <b>the</b> <b>Architect</b> try to understand the meaning of such spatial qualifiers as: big/small, wide/narrow, inside/outside, and light/dark. <b>The</b> <b>Architect</b> starts to understand why spaces achieve these qualities in his/her physical world...|$|R
