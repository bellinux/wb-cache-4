5000|$|On Sunday 5 May, Reagan and Kohl {{appeared}} at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The U.S. President's speech there, according to Time, was a [...] "skillful exercise in both the art of eulogy and political damage control." [...] Reagan said:"All these children of God, under bleak and lifeless mounds, the plainness of which does not even hint at the unspeakable acts that created them. Here they lie, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> hope, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> pray, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> live, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> heal, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> laugh, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> cry.... And then, rising above all this cruelty, out of this tragic and nightmarish time, beyond the anguish, the pain and suffering, and for all time, we can and must pledge: never again."Reagan spent only eight minutes at the Kolmeshöhe Cemetery. Along with Kohl, 90-year-old General Matthew Ridgway, who had commanded the 82nd Airborne in World War II, and Luftwaffe ace and former head of NATO, General Johannes Steinhoff, Reagan placed a wreath at a wall of remembrance. After placing the wreath, and standing at attention in honour while a short trumpet salute sounded Steinhoff, in an unscripted act, turned and shook hands with Ridgway. Reagan smiled, and firmly shook General Steinhoff's hand. Kohl later thanked Steinhoff for his actions.|$|R

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of white {{settlers}} to the baytown of Hynesville in the 19th century, the Karankawa began to commit offenses against the settlers, including the unsanctioned slaughter of their livestock. As a result, the settlers engaged the Indians at the 1852 Battle of Hynes Bay, near the San Antonio Bay extension of Hynes Bay. The Karankawa were swiftly defeated, and the survivors agreed <b>to</b> <b>never</b> return; finding refuge across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas. A few years later, the Hynes extension began to fill with mud, leaving it shallow and hard to navigate. Reports from Hynesville suggest that alligators infested the bay, killing a few residents.|$|E

He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared <b>to</b> <b>never</b> leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1926–27 season, the {{departure}} of club captain Jimmy Blair saw Keenor appointed the new captain of the Bluebirds and he led the team to a second FA Cup final in 1927. However Keenor came close <b>to</b> <b>never</b> playing in the match as, having been struggling to hold down a first team place due to injury, he handed in a transfer request in January 1927 but a proposed move to Severnside rivals Bristol Rovers later collapsed. Instead, he returned to the starting eleven that beat Arsenal 1–0 with a goal from Hughie Ferguson, being praised for his leadership of the team's defence during the match and earning plaudits from opposing captain Charlie Buchan. By winning the trophy, Cardiff had become the first team outside England to win the FA Cup and Keenor, as captain, was handed the trophy by King George V.|$|E

The case is considered closed, but Mulder notes that Davey disappeared after the incidents. The episode ends as X enters a research facility where experiments are being performed on a despairing Banton.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 Casino Royale {{was adapted}} into a parody Bond film {{starring}} David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's {{preference for the}} role of Bond. The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of Thunderball titled Never Say Never Again in 1983. The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, {{was not part of the}} Eon series of Bond films. In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal, which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights <b>to</b> <b>Never</b> Say Never Again from Taliafilm.
