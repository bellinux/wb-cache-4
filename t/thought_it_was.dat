Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> over to me.|$|E
5|$|The track {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Although many <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> catchy, {{it was thought}} to be generic when compared to other songs played on the radio, and is noted for being a departure from Cheryl's previous works.|$|E
5|$|According to Skene in Collectanea de Rebus Albanicis, the Donald first {{mentioned}} {{may be the}} Donald MacDuffie who {{is recorded}} as witnessing a charter by John, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles in 1463.

5|$|At {{the base}} of the mountain, Holley and others in the {{afternoon}} saw E Company men come down from the top and, later, men from the engineer company. Each group <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the last of the survivors and told confused, conflicting stories. When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled, Holley found that the company had suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action.|$|E
5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative Republicans who <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|In his 1935 book, The Three Americas, Widney {{said that}} Atlantis {{was in the}} area where the Bahamas are located.

He also believed that there was a submerged lost continent in the South Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the alien nest were shot at the {{decommissioned}} Acton Lane Power Station in Acton, London. The crew <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a perfect place to film because of its grilled walkways and numerous corridors, but had to spend money to remove asbestos from the station. The Atmosphere Processor set was not dismantled after filming, and was reused in 1989 as the Axis Chemicals set for Batman (1989).|$|E
5|$|The Go-Getter debuted on January 22, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and {{was given}} a limited {{theatrical}} release on June 6, 2008 by Peace Arch Entertainment. Its run lasted just three days, and it grossed only US$11,931. Critics were divided {{in reaction to the}} film; some praised the performances, the dialogue and the cinematography, while others <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unoriginal, forgettable, and poorly acted.|$|E

To get the fisherman's Chinese correct, Cohen called his friend. When the Chinese actors came, the actors felt Cantonese would be more appropriate for the fisherman than Mandarin, so it was changed. Moe was picked to rescue the children, because the writers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> funny.|$|E
5|$|Though wounded, Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury kept shooting. One of them, perhaps Billy, shot Morgan Earp {{across the}} back in a wound that struck both {{shoulder}} blades and a vertebra. Morgan went down for a minute before picking himself up. Either Frank or Billy shot Virgil Earp in the calf (Virgil <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Billy). Virgil, though hit, fired his next shot at Billy Clanton.|$|E
5|$|Acacia pycnantha {{was first}} {{formally}} described by botanist George Bentham in the London Journal of Botany in 1842. The type specimen was {{collected by the}} explorer Thomas Mitchell in present-day northern Victoria between Pyramid Hill and the Loddon River. Bentham <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> related to A. leiophylla, which he described in the same paper. The specific epithet pycnantha {{is derived from the}} Greek words pyknos (dense) and anthos (flowers), a reference to the dense cluster of flowers that make up the globular inflorescences. Queensland botanist Les Pedley reclassified the species as Racosperma pycnanthum in 2003, when he proposed placing almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus Racosperma. However, this name is treated as a synonym of its original name.|$|E

5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel. He <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the most exciting story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, {{he wanted to show}} the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E
5|$|Both Wilson {{and critics}} responded {{positively}} to the film, with Wilson saying she <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the best film adaptation {{of any of}} her works. It was released on DVD on 12 January 2009. Dustbin Baby was awarded the International Emmy in the Children and Young People category at the 2009 ceremony. Helen Blakeman won a Children's BAFTA for the screenplay, while the film itself was shortlisted for a Children's BAFTA in the Drama category and shortlisted for the Kids' Vote award. The film was also awarded the 2010 KidScreen Award for Best One-off, Special, or TV movie aimed at a Family Audience and the KidScreen Award for Best Acting.|$|E
5|$|Bulls and Bears, a farce {{performed}} at Drury Lane on 2 December 1715, {{was attributed to}} Cibber but was never published. The Dramatic Works of Colley Cibber, Esq.

By Mr. Doggett was attributed to Cibber by William Chetwood in his General History of the Stage (1749), but John Genest in Some Account of the English Stage (1832) <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> by Thomas Doggett. Other plays attributed to Cibber but probably not by him include Cinna's Conspiracy, {{performed at}} Drury Lane on 19 February 1713, and The Temple of Dullness of 1745.|$|E

5|$|Deathrow {{received}} largely favorable reviews. Reviewers {{praised the}} game's fast-paced action, and surround sound, but complained {{of its high}} difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, and lack of online multiplayer. Some critics felt the game's use of profanity was excessive, while others <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a highlight. Reviewers considered the game's concept and mechanics similar to other series, specifically Speedball. IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won the TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue. Southend dissolved in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{shortly after}} the release of Christmas Nights in November 1996. Producer Yuji Naka wanted to create a game which {{involved}} saving people rather than killing them. Sonic Team chose to connect the game with firefighting as they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an effective way of having players identify with heroism. Burning Rangers received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the graphics was mixed, with some critics asserting that it had the best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor collision detection and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn titles released in America.|$|E

Nearing Waegwan at dawn, the battalion column was taken under North Korean mortar and T-34 tank fire after daybreak and sustained 18 casualties.|$|E
