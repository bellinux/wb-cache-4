5|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> {{of humans}} on this species is indirect, through {{woodland}} clearance which affects the habitat, predation by cats, and collisions with windows, buildings and cars. Only {{the first of}} these has the potential to seriously affect populations, but given the huge geographical spread of P. c. abietinus and P. c. tristis, and woodland conservation policies in the range of P. c. collybita, the chiffchaff's future seems assured.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade in Southern China by itself was probably not great. The Canton trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of Canton, and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to Canton, and even there was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of the Old China Trade was an increased import of opium and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist world system after 1830. However, the maritime fur trade played a minor role in this process.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of the {{aid package}} was to fuel a rapid {{expansion}} in the urban middle and upper class, while life remained mostly unchanged for South Vietnam's rural majority. This served to increase anti-government resentment among peasants, while solidifying urban support for the Saigon government. US officials {{were aware of the}} failure of the program to propel economic development, but did not try and divert the spending to investment as they regarded the solidification of urban support for the government to be very important. They also used the dependence of the urban class on the CIP to achieve political changes in South Vietnam. In 1963, when the US sought to pressure the government of Ngo Dinh Diem after the alliance began to falter, they cut off funding as a gesture to the urban civil servant and military officer class that they disapproved of Diem. Following the South Vietnamese leader's overthrow and assassination in a US-backed coup, the CIP resumed.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of {{suspension}} bondage is {{to create}} a heightened sense of vulnerability and inescapability, as the subject is made to feel that by attempting to free themselves they may fall and hurt themselves, thus also creating a form of mental bondage in addition to the physical one that holds them. Being suspended, especially in a large open space, also creates a sense of objectification, submissiveness and erotic helplessness for the subject, which can be erotically stimulating for them and for those observing them. Rope suspension is sometimes done as performance art at BDSM conventions and fetish-themed nightclubs.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of {{the battle}} was unforeseen: the large loss of German {{transport}} aircraft. According to military historian Lt. Col. E.H. Brongers (ret.), {{the loss of the}} transport aircraft had a direct effect on the planning for the proposed German cross channel invasion of Britain. Also, Brongers mentions the impact of the loss of transport aircraft during the invasion of Crete. Since the Germans did not have sufficient aircraft to land troops in force, they had to drop them instead in groups, which resulted in heavy casualties. Brongers' conclusions are supported by military historian Col. Adriaan Hakkert (ret.).|$|E

It is worth reiterating, however, that small designs that estimate <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> typically do so by deliberately confounding higher order interactions with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects.</b> This means that unless those interactions are zero in practice, the analyst will obtain biased estimates of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects.</b> Furthermore (s)he has (1) no way of testing this, and (2) no way of correcting it in analysis. This emphasises the crucial role of design in DCEs.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the first}} two years of Timesitheus's {{prefecture}} seems to have been spent producing a stable environment in which government of any sort could be carried on. His main weapon to this end seems to have been to strengthen the authority of the Praetorian Prefecture, his own office, and to move equestrians with a fiscal background - such as himself - into positions of power. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of his manoeuvring seems to have been to ensure that the kind of men who had carried on the government under Alexander Severus were restored to effective office.|$|E
25|$|James Ferguson {{has argued}} that <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of many {{development}} projects {{carried out by the}} World Bank and similar organizations is not the alleviation of poverty. Instead the projects often serve to expand the exercise of bureaucratic state power. Through his case-studies of development projects in Thaba-Tseka he shows that the World Bank's characterization of the economic conditions in Lesotho was flawed, and the Bank ignored the political and cultural character of the state in crafting their projects. As a result, the projects failed to help the poor, but succeeded in expanding the government bureaucracy.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} day 190,000 {{vehicles}} moved into or within the zone during charging hours, a decrease of around 25% on normal traffic levels, partly due to it also being the half-term school holiday. A report from the Bow Group stated that historically, London congestion is at its worst during the morning rush hour, and that {{the early days of}} congestion charging had little impact on that critical time, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> occurring after 11am. Just over 100,000 motorists paid the charge personally, 15–20,000 were fleet vehicles paying under fleet arrangements, and it was believed around 10,000 liable motorists did not pay the due charge.|$|E

25|$|In 1750 he {{abandoned}} Mingotti's group for another company established {{by a former}} member of the Mingotti troupe, Giovanni Battista Locatelli. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of this was that Gluck returned to Prague on a more consistent basis. For the Prague Carnival of 1750 Gluck composed a new opera, Ezio (again set to one of Metastasio's works, with the manuscript located at the Lobkowicz Palace). His Ipermestra was also performed in the same year. The other major event of Gluck's stay in Prague was, on 15 September 1750, his marriage to Maria Anna Bergin, aged 18 years old, the daughter of a rich but long-dead Viennese merchant. Gluck seems to have spent most of 1751 commuting between Prague and Vienna.|$|E
25|$|The Longquan celadons {{were among}} the finest {{of a range of}} celadon wares {{produced}} in China, and led stylistic and technical developments. The celadons were produced in a range of shades of colour, centred on olive-green, but extending to greenish blues (regarded as desirable, but less common) and browns. All these colours come from the glaze; the body beneath is sometimes left partly unglazed as part of the decoration, when it fires to a terracotta brown. The wares are hardly ever painted; decoration comes from the vessel shape and carved or incised designs in the body. Shapes were originally mostly simple, allowing the glaze colour to create <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of a piece, but in later periods raised decoration was common.|$|E

The spill threatened industrial facilities in 'Al Jubayl because of the seawater cooling system for primary industries and threatened the supply of potable water produced by seawater-fed desalination plants. The 'Al Jubayl community harbor and Abu Ali Island, which juts into the gulf immediately north of 'Al Jubayl, experienced the greatest pollution, with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of the spill concentrated in mangrove areas and shrimp grounds. Large numbers of marine birds, such as cormorants, grebes, and auks, were killed when their plumage was coated with oil. In addition, beaches along the entire 'Al Jubayl coastline were covered with oil and tar balls.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of hantavirus infections {{is unclear}} {{as there is}} a lack of animal models to describe it (rats and mice do not seem to acquire severe disease). While the primary site of viral replication in the body is not known, in HFRS <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> is in the blood vessels while in HPS most symptoms are associated with the lungs. In HFRS, there are increased vascular permeability and decreased blood pressure due to endothelial dysfunction and the most dramatic damage is seen in the kidneys, whereas in HPS, the lungs, spleen, and gall bladder are most affected. Early symptoms of HPS tend to present similarly to the flu (muscle aches, fever and fatigue) and usually show up around 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. Later stages of the disease (about 4 to 10 days after symptoms start) include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and coughing.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{the orbital}} {{eccentricity}} of Earth occur on {{a cycle of}} about 100,000 years. The inclination, or tilt, of Earth's axis varies periodically between 22° and 24.5°. (The tilt of Earth's axis {{is responsible for the}} seasons; the greater the tilt, the greater the contrast between summer and winter temperatures.) Changes in the tilt occur in a cycle 41,000 years long. Precession of the equinoxes, or wobbles on Earth's spin axis, complete every 26,000 years. According to the Milankovitch theory, these factors cause a periodic cooling of Earth, with the coldest part in the cycle occurring about every 40,000 years. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of the Milankovitch cycles is to change the contrast between the seasons, not the amount of solar heat Earth receives. These cycles within cycles predict that during maximum glacial advances, winter and summer temperatures are lower. The result is less ice melting than accumulating, and glaciers build up.|$|E

25|$|TfL's {{report in}} June 2007 {{found that the}} number of {{chargeable}} vehicles entering the zone had reduced by 30% (primarily cars and minicabs, although vans and lorries had decreased by 13%), while there were overall increases in the numbers of taxis, buses, and especially bicycles. The daily profile of traffic flows had changed, with less traffic after 9:30am and a peak immediately before and {{after the end of the}} charging period. The level of traffic entering the zone during the morning peak had not reduced as much as at other times. The overall level of traffic of all vehicle types entering the central Congestion Charge Zone was consistently 16% lower in 2006 than the pre-charge levels in 2002. Year on year, counts of inbound traffic approaching the zone had also seen a distinct and significant 5–7% decline in the number of chargeable vehicles, which was unexplained. They had noted a small but pervasive long term trend of less traffic entering the zone, expected to be a result of people changing their location and lifestyle, perhaps influenced by the charge. The conservative Bow Group noted that <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> occurred after 11am.|$|E
25|$|The final {{reaction}} of the Dutch economic elite (which doubled as the political elite in this oligarchical Republic) to these economic challenges lay in the political sphere. After {{the end of the}} Franco-Dutch War (which, like the previous wars was mostly financed by floating bonds, instead of higher taxation) the public debt had risen to an alarming size. The Regents at first tried to retire a significant part of this debt, and were successful in the years leading up to the Dutch invasion of England, known as the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Though this episode is usually described as narrowly English, or at most Anglo-Dutch of significance, it was actually part of a strategic defense of the Dutch Republic against the aggressive encroachments of king Louis XIV of France. The ensuing Nine Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession had for the Dutch also an economic aspect, as they were trying to revert French protectionist measures, which threatened to close the French and Spanish metropolitan and colonial markets to them (both the Treaty of Ryswick and the Treaty of Utrecht contained provisions abrogating the draconian French tariff list of 1667). <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of these wars, however, was that the Dutch public debt increased with 200 million guilders between 1688 and 1713. In view of the meagre results of the 1713 peace treaty (most advantages of the war that the Republic had helped to win went to Great Britain, thanks to the separate peace that country had concluded previously with France) the gamble had not paid off.|$|E
