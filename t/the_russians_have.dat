5|$|In 2008, the Polish Foreign Ministry {{asked the}} {{government}} of Russia about alleged footage of the massacre filmed by the NKVD during the killings, something <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>have</b> denied exists. Polish officials believe that this footage, as well as further documents showing cooperation of Soviets with the Gestapo during the operations, are the reason for Russia's decision to classify most of the documents about the massacre.|$|E
25|$|John Pike, {{an analyst}} at the think tank GlobalSecurity, says he {{believes}} the weapon is roughly as powerful as the Russians claim. What he does not necessarily believe is that the weapon is new. He says <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>have</b> possessed a range of thermobaric weapons for at least four decades.|$|E
25|$|Russia {{does have}} 50 years of {{experience}} operating a fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers that are also used for scientific and Arctic tourism expeditions. <b>The</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>have</b> commented that a nuclear reactor that sinks, such as the similar reactor involved in the Kursk explosion, can be raised and probably put back into operation.|$|E

25|$|Russians are {{the second}} largest ethnic {{minority}} in Azerbaijan and is also the largest Russian community in the South Caucasus {{and one of the}} largest outside of Russia.

25|$|Fisheries have {{traditionally}} been the most important way of living along the coast, {{where the majority of}} the Norwegian population live. The red king crab, originally from the northern Pacific ocean but brought to the Barents sea by <b>the</b> <b>Russians,</b> <b>have</b> invaded from the east and are now being exploited commercially (especially in the Varangerfjord). To prevent the crab from spreading too far south, crab fishing west of Nordkapp is totally unregulated.|$|E
25|$|The real {{involvement}} of the Varangians came after they were asked by the Slavic tribes of the region to come and establish order, as those tribes were in constant warfare among each other ("Our country is rich and immense, but it is rent by disorder. Come and govern us and reign over us."). The tribes were united and ruled {{under the leadership of}} Rurik, a leader of a group of Varangians. Rurik had successfully been able to establish a set of trading towns and posts along the Volga and Dnieper Rivers, which were perfect for trade with the Byzantine Empire. Rurik's successors were able to conquer and unite the towns {{along the banks of the}} Volga and Dnieper Rivers, and establish the Rus' Khaganate. Despite the distinction of the Varangians from the local Slavic tribes at the beginning, by the 10th century, the Varangians began to integrate with the local community, and by the end of 12th century, a new people— <b>the</b> <b>Russians,</b> <b>have</b> emerged.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Hewson, {{an editor}} for Jane's Information Group, told the BBC {{it was likely}} that FOAB indeed {{represented}} the world's biggest non-nuclear bomb. [...] "You can argue about the numbers and how you scale this but <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>have</b> a long and proven history of developing weapons in the thermobaric class", he says. UPI claimed the device [...] "would enormously boost Russia's conventional military capabilities".|$|E

60|$|There was a Swedish ship in {{the offing}} {{at the time when}} Peter visited the island, and this ship drew near to the island and began to fire upon it as soon as those on board saw that <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> {{soldiers}} <b>had</b> landed there. This cannonading drove <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> back from <b>the</b> shores, but instead of retiring from the island they went and concealed themselves behind some rocks. The Swedes supposed that <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>had</b> gone around {{to the other side of}} the island, and that they had there taken to their boats again and returned to the main land; so they determined to go to the island themselves, and examine it, in order to find out what <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>had</b> been doing there.|$|R
2500|$|British Prime Minister Asquith {{wrote to}} Stanley: [...] "The European {{situation}} {{is at least}} one degree worse than it was yesterday, and has not been improved by a rather shameless attempt on the part of Germany to buy our neutrality during the war by promises that she will not annex French territory (except colonies) or Holland or Belgium. There is something very crude & childlike about German diplomacy. Meanwhile the French are beginning to press in the opposite sense, as <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>have</b> been doing for some time. The City, wh. is in a terrible state of depression and paralysis, is the time being all against English intervention." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{largest group}} by far that <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>have</b> called [...] "Tatars" [...] are the Volga Tatars, {{native to the}} Volga region (Tatarstan and Bashkortostan), who for this reason are often also simply known as [...] "Tatars", with their {{language}} known as the Tatar language. [...] they had an estimated population close to 6 million. There is a common belief that Russians and Tatars are closely intermingled, illustrated by the famous saying [...] "scratch any Russian just a little and you will discover a Tatar underneath" [...] {{and the fact that}} a number of noble families in pre-Petrine Russia had Tatar origins; however, genetics show that Russians form a cluster with Northern and Eastern Europeans (especially Belarusians and Ukrainians), and are very far from Tatar peoples.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July, Nicholas sent {{a message}} to Wilhelm informing him that he had ordered partial {{mobilization}} against Austria, and asking him to do his utmost for a peaceful solution. Upon hearing of Russia's partial mobilization, Wilhelm wrote: [...] "Then I must mobilize too." [...] The German Ambassador in St. Petersburg informed Nicholas that Germany would mobilize if Russia did not cease all military preparations at once, including those it had previously assured Russia it did not see as a threat against Germany or cause for German mobilization. The German military attaché in Russia reported that: [...] "I have the impression that they <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>have</b> mobilized here from a dread of coming events without aggressive intentions and are now frightened at what they have brought about." [...] At the same time, Nicholas’ order for a partial mobilization met with protests from both Sazonov and the Russian War Minister General Vladimir Sukhomlinov, who insisted partial mobilization was not technically possible, and that, given Germany's attitude, a general mobilization was required. Nicholas at first ordered a general mobilization, and then after receiving an appeal for peace from Wilhelm cancelled it as a sign of his good faith. The cancellation of general mobilization led to furious protests from Sukhomlinov, Sazonov, and Russia's top generals, all urging Nicholas to reinstate it. Under strong pressure, Nicholas gave in and ordered a general mobilization on 30 July.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>had</b> pushed <b>the</b> front 160 {{kilometers}} (100 miles) {{into the}} Carpathian Mountains, completely surrounded the Austrian fortress of Przemyśl {{and started a}} Siege of Przemyśl which lasted for over a hundred days. The battle severely damaged the Austro-Hungarian Army, destroyed {{a large portion of}} its trained officers, and crippled Austria. Though <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>had</b> been utterly crushed at the Battle of Tannenberg, their victory at Lemberg prevented that defeat from fully taking its toll on Russian public opinion.|$|R

5000|$|Near {{the close}} {{and after the}} end of World War II in Europe, <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> and <b>the</b> Western powers had {{programs}} to foster technology transfer and exploit German technical specialists. For example, the U.S. had Operation Paperclip [...] and <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>had</b> trophy brigades advancing with their military forces. In the area of atomic technology, the U.S. had Operation Alsos and <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> <b>had</b> their version. While operational aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> operation were modelled after the trophy brigades, a more refined approach was warranted for the exploitation of German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, and scientific personnel. This was rectified with a decree in late 1944 and the formation of specialised exploitation teams in early 1945 under <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Alsos, which <b>had</b> broader objectives, including wholesale relocation of scientific facilities to the Soviet Union.|$|R
