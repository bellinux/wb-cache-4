40|$|The Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation as a digital multi-carrier technique possesses many unique advantages over single-carrier approaches {{and is being}} adopted by emerging broadband transmission standards as physical layer. The Joint <b>Terminal</b> <b>Engineering</b> Office (JTEO) has conducted system analysis to determine optimal air-interface schemes that could operate in the WGS system. Presented in this paper are three OFDM-based techniques to illustrate the unique potentials of the OFDM techniques for supporting current and future MILSATCOM requirements. Explored in the recent JTEO research efforts, these OFDM-based techniques are intended for, (1) Supporting broadband (High Data Rate) HDR transmission through multi-channel clustering; (2) Extending TDM/TDMA-based IP transmissions; (3) Spread spectrum for anti-jamming.

The current seismic evaluation procedure of the piles in marine oil terminals includes monitoring material strains specified in the Marine Oil <b>Terminal</b> <b>Engineering</b> and Maintenance Standard (MOTEMS) during the nonlinear static pushover analysis to estimate the displacement capacity of piles. This investigation developed closed-form formulas for estimating the displacement capacity of piles by using a simple pile-deck connection system. The displacement capacity estimated from these formulas ensures that the material stain limits specified in the MOTEMS is not exceeded. These formulas are demonstrated to be 2 ̆ 2 accurate 2 ̆ 2 by comparing results from these formulas against those from the nonlinear finite-element analysis. The formulas developed in this investigation utilize the curvature ductility capacity of the pile section and rotation ductility capacity of the connection at the selected seismic design level, along with the parameter β which depends on the relative stiffness of the pile and the connection and the parameter η which depends on the relative strength of the connection and the pile...|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} {{maintenance}} of Marine Oil and LNG Terminals is governed by the Marine Oil <b>Terminal</b> <b>Engineering</b> and Maintenance Standards (MOTEMS) {{which is part of}} the 2010 Title 24 California Code of Regulations, Part 2, California Building Code, Chapter 31 F: Marine Oil Terminals. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the current recommendations for the in-ground plastic hinge length and depth for piles in section 7 of MOTEMS for all typical soil properties and pile dimensions found in Marine Oil and LNG Terminals. The pile types considered in this analysis are 24 -inch octagonal prestressed concrete piles and 24 -, 36 -, and 48 -inch steel pipe piles in varying soil conditions. Existing recommendations for plastic hinges are incomplete and inadequate. MOTEMS does not have any recommendations for plastic hinge depth, only length, nor does it have any recommendations for in-ground plastic hinge for steel piles. Recommendations for steel piles are however found in the Port of Long Beach Wharf Design Criteria (POLB), but the recommendations in both MOTEMS and POLB have shown to be inadequate for both steel and prestressed concrete piles. MOTEMS also proves to be adequate for Level 2 earthquakes but not for Level 1. The plastic hinge length for Level 1 is much longer than that for Level 2. So the MOTEMS recommendations for Level 1 lead to conservatively small displacement capacity. POLB recommendations are also adequate for Level 2 but not Level 1 for concrete and are overly conservative for steal and therefore, not adequate for either level except in dense and medium sands during a Level 1 earthquake. POLB does not take into account different soil characteristics and has one value for all soils, which is inadequate for most cases...|$|E
40|$|Romanian higher {{education}} began {{a long time}} ago, having its own national specificity but being also influenced by the education from other developed countries. Between 1813 [...] 1840 Gh. Asachi created the School of <b>Terminal</b> <b>Engineering,</b> establi-shing {{the foundations of the}} Technical Engineering University. In Moldavia, {{higher education}} in engineering, in the field of roads and bridges, coincides with the official opening of the Faculty of Construction of Jassy, in 1941, as part of the Polytechnic Institute, today the „Gheorghe Asachi” Technical University. Over the years, this type of education has evolved and developed, under the influence of schools of engineering such as The School of Bridges and Roads in France. The French School of Bridges and Roads was created by a decree of the king, on the 14 th of February 1747. In two and a half centuries, it has trained about 15, 000 engineers, who accomplished great works both in their native country and abroad. The reputation of this school is based especially on the discoveries, the accomplishments and the activity of these engineers, who have a great impact on the development of this institution. Most of these engineers did not go down in history (we seldom know the name of the person who built a bridge or a road). We remember some of them by a formula, a machine, a plate on a road, without actually knowing who is the person behind the name. Shaping their portraits, we could bring them back to the memory of the public, emphasizing the common aspects of their professional training at the School of Bridges and Roads. A free professional background, of a high scientific level, comprising a lot of practical issues, based on public transport in the beginning, where reflection and action play an important part. Except a lot of great scientists (among them, a Nobel prize laureate), inventors, entrepreneurs, engineers with prestigious accomplishments, there are also politicians (even a president), writers, a navigator. The selection of these personalities was difficult and can be contested. It was not intented to establish a hierarchy, but only to create a gallery of portraits, the only criterion taken into account being the exclusion of those engineers who are still alive. Unfortunately, there is no woman among these portraits, because their access was only permitted in 1959 for civil engineers and in 1975 for the others. We hope that this anomaly will be redressed in the paper celebrating 300 years of existence of this school. After a quarter of a millennium, in the 21 st century, the oldest civil school of engineers in the world, created during the reign of Louis XV, remains what it has always been: a way of modern training in the benefit of the nation and of society, having the ambition to instruct a quality personnel, able to adapt to the problems and needs of its epoch. With a prestigious heritage, the School of Bridges and Roads has evolved and transformed during its 250 years of existence, always remaining proud of its past {{and at the same time}} open towards the future. Many authors have already mentioned the history, rich in events, of this institution. We shall try to describe it concisely in the present paper. We shall present some portaits of well-known engineers: great constructors, inventors, scientists, making themselves known in other areas than their initial training, they illustrate a less known aspect of the life of the roads and bridges engineer, a rich, intense, varied life and activity.

The precursors of carotenoid biosynthesis, isopenthenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), are synthesized in this organism via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) or non-mevalonate pathway. <b>Terminal</b> pathway <b>engineering</b> in recombinant C. glutamicum permitted the production of various nonnative C 50 and C 40 carotenoids. Here, the role of engineering isoprenoid precursor supply for lycopene production by C. glutamicum was characterized. Overexpression of dxs encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of the MEP-pathway by chromosomal promoter exchange in a prophage-cured, genome-reduced C. glutamicum strain improved lycopene formation. Similarly, an increased IPP supply was achieved by chromosomal integration of two artificial operons comprising MEP pathway genes {{under the control of}} a constitutive promoter. Combined overexpression of dxs and the other six MEP pathways genes in C. glutamicum strain LYC 3 -MEP was not synergistic with respect to improving lycopene accumulation. Based on C. glutamicum strain LYC 3 -MEP astaxanthin could be produced in the mg per g cell dry weight range when the endogenous genes crtE, crtB and crtI for conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to lycopene were coexpressed with the genes for lycopene cyclase and β-carotene hydroxylase from Pantoea ananatis and carotene C(4) oxygenase from Brevundimonas aurantiaca...|$|R
40|$|Recently, two e-voting {{technologies}} {{have been introduced}} and used extensively in election procedures: direct recording electronic (DRE) systems and optical scanners.

40|$|Containers {{have become}} the {{standard}} for unitised cargo transport. In the past two decades, {{the emergence of the}} global economy has caused a boom in the volume of containers transported by sea. Maritime container transport can be divided into a global network of major shipping routes and numerous regional, short-sea services. In ports, container terminals link the different shipping lines and provide the intermodal connection between the maritime and continental transportation networks. On the major shipping routes, very large container ships operate the intercontinental services. Container terminals in gateway and hub ports, along these routes, annually handle throughputs of over 500, 000 TEU. The majority of these terminals is owned and operated by so called global terminal operators (GTO) that own and operate many terminals worldwide. Regional and short-sea services between regional and minor ports in the periphery of the network are operated by smaller vessels. For the majority of terminals in these ports, annual throughput is much less. Local, single terminal operators (STO) generally operate these container terminals. Public sector involvement is often large. Shipping lines are pressuring both larger and smaller terminals, to increase the level of services offered and, at the same time, reduce handling costs. Labour expenses take up a large part of those handling costs. For large terminals automated container handling has proven itself as a reliable and effective way to reduce operational costs. Especially in Europe, small and medium sized terminals face heavy competition. The number of ports that compete for the same hinterland is increasing. To stay ahead of the competition, terminals are forced to offer a very high level of services. Meanwhile, flexible routes of regional services makes business development forecasts uncertain. Investment risks are therefore high in this capital intensive industry. As a result conservativeness is considered a virtue among small and medium sized terminal operators, and scepticism towards innovative technology is widespread. The goal {{of this study is to}} inventory "off-the-shelf" automated container handling equipment and study the feasibility of automated container handling in small and medium sized <b>terminals.</b> Civil <b>Engineering</b> and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{attention}} on social, civil, and environmental problems has caused policy-makers and advisors {{to advocate for}} more integrated science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instruction. Although integrated STEM education promises to prepare U. S. students to tackle the crises of our times and the future (Lander & Gates, 2010), the integration of engineering design into high-school physics may prove difficult for teachers whether or not they’ve been previously trained in engineering design. This dissertation addresses a gap in classroom observation-based research on engineering integration in physics (Dare, Ellis, & Roehrig, 2014) by drawing on rich, qualitative, participant-observation data to investigate engineering-design instruction in high-school physics. The first study explores tensions that three high-school physics teachers encountered as they planned and executed a <b>terminal</b> velocity <b>engineering</b> design challenge. Separating out physics content came into tension with truly integrated engineering-design instruction as envisioned in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013 d), time and technical constraints came into tension with adequate data collection for making design decisions, and teachers’ supportive classroom routines came into tension with students’ divergent design thinking and agency. The first study concludes that even highly motivated and supported teachers may experience tensions between their regularly productive instructional practices and engineering design that could threaten {{the authenticity of the}} engineering design in which students engage. The second study identifies some of teacher “Leslie’s” productive resources (locally coherent patterns of thoughts and actions) activated as she implemented her first engineering design challenge in physics. Leslie called up some of the same resources when she taught engineering design as when she facilitated open, guided, and structured-inquiry investigations. This study suggests that finding and calling upon resources that are assistive in other instruction, such as inquiry instruction, might be useful for science teachers attempting engineering-design integration. Science education reform implementation researchers, teacher educators, and professional development providers need to acknowledge tensions that teachers may face with engineering-design integration, and the role that teachers’ existing resources can play in supporting reform adoption. Finally, this study agrees with other work (Katehi, Perason, Feder, & Committee on K- 12 Engineering Education, 2009) emphasizing the need for more research on engineering-design integration in high-school physics...|$|R
40|$|New {{container}} ports {{are mostly}} constructed on low lying coastal areas or in shallow coastal waters. The quay wall and terminal yard are then raised {{to a level}} well {{above mean sea level}} to insure safety against inundation. The resulting ‘conventional terminal’ requires large volumes of good quality fill material often dredged from the sea which is costly. Royal HaskoningDHV developed the concept of a container terminal with a “polder yard”. The yard would lie below the outside water level and be surrounded by a combined quay wall flood defense structure. A water drainage system is required to drain excess water from the polder. This master thesis investigates the technical and economic feasibility. Important conditions for the feasibility of a polder terminal are low conductive (impermeable) subsoil, which limit the amount of seepage water entering the polder, and high reclamation cost. The polder terminal is technically feasible; a conceptual design is made for a case study in Tuas, Singapore. The ‘polder terminal’ could save 10 to 25 % of the total cost (investment and risk) due to the lower reclamation cost. The exact saving depends on the polder depth which is bounded by uplifting failure of the polder yard. The increase in cost due to the risk of inundation and water drainage system is insufficient to counteract the large savings possible. The investments, risk and total cost of both the conventional and polder terminal are shown in the graph, where the minimum total cost of the polder terminal are lower than those of the conventional <b>terminal.</b> Hydraulic EngineeringCivil <b>Engineering</b> and Geoscience...|$|R

The quay wall and terminal yard are raised {{to a level}} well {{above mean sea level}} to assure flood safety. The resulting ‘conventional terminal’ requires large volumes of good quality fill material often dredged from the sea, which is costly. The alternative concept of a ‘polder terminal’ has a terminal yard which lies below the outside water level and is surrounded by a quay wall flood defence structure. This saves large amounts of reclamation investment but introduces a higher damage potential in case of flooding and corresponding flood risk. Important conditions for the feasibility of a polder terminal are low pervious subsoil and high reclamation cost. Further, a polder terminal requires a water storage and drainage system, against additional cost. A risk-based analysis of the optimal quay wall height and polder level is performed, which is an optimization (cost benefit analysis) under two variables. The overtopping failure mechanism proves to be the dominant failure mechanism for flooding. During overtopping the water depth in the polder terminal is larger than on the conventional terminal, resulting in higher damage potential and corresponding flood risk for the polder terminal. However, the reclamation savings prove to be larger than the increased flood risk: the ‘polder terminal’ could save 10 to 30 % of the total cost (investment and risk) demonstrating that it to be an economically attractive alternative to a conventional <b>terminal.</b> Hydraulic EngineeringCivil <b>Engineering</b> and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|In {{electrical}} <b>engineering</b> <b>terminal</b> connectors {{are commonly}} used for connecting and releasing electrical conductors. They are sophisticated mass products sufficient for high- and low power transmission or transmitting information. There are various applications for wiring in cars, control- or house installations and electrical power supply systems. Depending on the electrical current to be transmitted and consequently the wire diameter there are several approaches to realize a durable and safe mechanical connection between the conductors. The electrical contact resistance of such systems {{is defined by the}} constriction- and the film resistance. The constriction resistance heavily depends on the contact or load force. If the connection becomes loose, this force decreases or even disappears, which results in an extensive raise of the temperature in the contact area. The current density is locally increasing on certain connection points. The raised temperature may lead to unwanted operational states or even fire. There are a few mechanical solutions to realize a constant or re-adjusting contact force. However, these approaches are mechanically complex and hence cost intensive. In this paper we present the development and experimental investigation of a self-adjusting terminal connector based on shape-memory alloys (SMA) which is far less complex than currently known mechanical solutions. The compensation of the decreasing contact force is realized by a precompressed SMA cylinder, which is located in a drill hole {{at the bottom of the}} terminal connector’s screw. Under normal conditions the terminal works similar to a conventional screw connector. In case of decreasing contact forces, the increasing contact resistance results in a rising temperature. As soon as the austenite start temperature is reached the SMA cylinder starts to expand and resets the contact force. As a result the system cools down and the SMA cylinder keeps a desired contact force. In this paper we present the general design of such a system and ist limitations. Measurement data of the SMA cylinder and the active terminal connector will further show the proof of the concept...|$|R
40|$|As the {{worldwide}} gas market {{continues to grow}} and environmental concerns with respect to in-port unloading of gas have increased, {{there has been a}} boom of interest in new liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals in the past five years. For these terminals, which are more and more located in areas with hostile sea conditions, dedicated provisions are required to create sufficient shelter for the carriers. Proposals have been made to construct a marginal low crested breakwater parallel to the coast protecting a ship moored at a jetty close to the shore. For an optimal economic design of such an LNG marine terminal, the dimensions and orientation of the detached breakwater have to be optimized {{as a function of the}} weather related downtime of the moored LNG carrier. Doing so requires adequate simulation tools. However, for the combination of wave and ship motion, a link between an efficient wave simulation tool and a program for ship response calculations is not available at present. The research on ship behaviour has resulted in the development of various so-called six degrees of freedom (SDF) computer programs. These programs solve the equations of motion of a moored vessel for all six degrees of freedom. As a consequence of the non-linear characteristics of the mooring system the equation of motion is solved in the time domain. The wave force time series are calculated from a homogeneous wave field of irregular, long-crested waves. In case of an open jetty configuration these assumptions are valid. However, considering a carrier behind a detached breakwater, the wave field is not homogeneous, but the wave height varies over the ship length. Consequently the influence of the detached breakwater on the ship motions must be considered. In addition, the reflection of the waves at the coast also has to be taken into account. This thesis deals with a methodology to predict the hydrodynamics of a moored LNG carrier behind a detached breakwater. A rapid assessment tool has been developed in order to assess the optimum breakwater dimensions in the preliminary design stage of an LNG marine terminal. In particular the effects of the breakwater dimensions on the hydrodynamic behaviour of the moored LNG carrier are considered. The computational approach for the calculation of ship motions from a given offshore wave field is described. In addition results are presented for different <b>terminal</b> layouts.

40|$|Compared to land, {{rail and}} air, sea {{transport}} {{has proven to}} have the largest contribution to the transport of goods and is witnessing a continuous growth over the years. The existing ports are dealing with an increasing flow of goods and the transporting vessels, resulting in capacity problems. New innovations and technology are needed to encounter these problems and in a sustainable way. One of the solutions proposed is to expand towards the sea. A floating port at a certain distance from land could reduce the pressure on these ports. The objective of the thesis is to examine feasibility of an offshore floating terminal for container transshipment with an annual throughput of 1 million TEU. Different locations {{around the world with}} high potential for the container transshipment have been proposed as possible locations for the floating terminal. The first step was to design the terminal according to certain requirements. Except for accommodating a number of activities, the terminal has also the function of creating protected waters for the vessels calling on it. Different floating concepts were examined for their eligibility and finally a pontoon-shaped structure was chosen for the form of the hull of the terminal. The terminal has a rectangular- shaped layout with a length dimension of 1190 m and a width of 240 m. Berthing facilities and 11 quay cranes are provided at the lee side of the terminal for the loading and unloading operations of the containers. The heart {{of the study was to}} draw conclusions about the operability of the designed system based on the results of a hydrodynamic research. Computer models such as DELFRAC and SEAWAY were used to calculate the responses of both the terminal and vessel, in different sea conditions. According to the criteria for container vessel motions during lifting operations and the response calculations, it was concluded that the (un) loading operations of the containers could proceed safely up to sea conditions with a significant wave height of 3 m. This state represents the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) for the designed system and is of importance for determining the downtime of the terminal as result of the wind waves generated motions. Station keeping of the terminal is necessary to prevent the terminal from being drifted away by sea loads. After considering a number of alternatives to achieve this function, it is finally chosen for a combined DP thrusters- turret mooring system. The system will make it possible for the terminal to maintain a beam-on position to waves during operating conditions. This is to fulfil the function as a breakwater. During high seas, the terminal rotates till a bow-on position (heading) to waves. The last characteristic of the system will result in reduction of the sea loads on the terminal and thus also the mooring loads during aggressive sea conditions. The total construction cost of the terminal, including the necessary equipment is estimated for 448 million Euros. The terminal revenues are represented in the transshipment fee that the shipping liners must pay when using the terminal. According to the results of the financial analyses, a minimum fee of 125 Euro per TEU must be charged in order to make the <b>terminal</b> cost-effective.
