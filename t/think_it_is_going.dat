500|$|The {{idea behind}} Mad Dogs {{came from the}} {{friendship}} between the four main actors, who wanted to work together for a television project, as well as Cris Cole and executive producer Suzanne Mackie. The four initially {{wanted to make a}} story about a rock band, but decided that making programmes about bands have been [...] "done to death". To write the series, Cole was influenced by the works of David Lynch and the Coen brothers as inspiration to the kind of storytelling that is [...] "never quite what you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be".|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{started their}} defence {{of the league}} {{championship}} at home to Queens Park Rangers on 17 August 1991. It was the visitors who had led the match right from the 15th minute, but for Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson to earn his side a point after equalising well into stoppage time. The draw according to The Independent showcased the need for reinforcements: [...] "...not just to improve the squad, but also to cause a buzz in the dressing room". Arsenal were beaten 3–1 by Everton at Goodison Park three days after and lost to Aston Villa by the same scoreline. Graham dismissed any talk of crisis, saying [...] "I have been in football too long to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be nice and comfortable every season" [...] and felt the performance at Villa showed signs of improvement compared to the earlier league fixtures. A 2–0 win at home to Luton Town was followed by victory against Manchester City, where Alan Smith and Limpar scored a goal apiece.|$|E

2500|$|At the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, Powell {{revealed}} that he had spent {{two and a half}} hours explaining to President Bush [...] "the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers." [...] During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S. appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: [...] "I also had to say to him that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Yes, I did <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> great, all {{the work}} was so good, every actor was inspired, and Altman's team was {{intensely}} competent, and he was that rare kind of genius who knows {{what works and what}} doesn't at the moment <b>it</b> <b>is</b> happening.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Archibald {{looked at}} her steadfastly. [...] "Such ingenuousness," [...] he said, presently, [...] "is overpowering. Mr. Clyde, how do you do? Do you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a fine day?" ...|$|E

60|$|Rollo {{came down}} to breakfast, and he {{went out into the}} yard every two or three minutes, to look at the sky.

60|$|Rollo's {{father and}} mother and his uncle looked at the clouds all around.
