5|$|Arran has a {{particular}} concentration of early Neolithic Clyde Cairns, a form of Gallery grave. The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or trapezoidal stone and earth mound that encloses a chamber lined with larger stone slabs. Pottery and bone fragments found inside the chambers suggest they were used for interment and some have forecourts, {{which may have been}} an area for public display or ritual. There are <b>two</b> <b>good</b> examples in Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: Am Machaire).|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one, but between <b>two</b> <b>good</b> men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
5|$|After {{a fairly}} cagey first 21 minutes, {{the first major}} {{incident}} of the game occurred when Paul Scholes and Claude Makélélé clashed in mid-air, resulting in both players being booked and Scholes having to leave the field for treatment to a bloody nose. The first goal of the game came five minutes later, when an interchange of passes between Scholes and Wes Brown after a throw-in on the right flank gave Brown time to pick out a cross for Cristiano Ronaldo, who directed his header past Petr Čech. Chelsea almost equalised in the 33rd minute when Frank Lampard's cross was headed back into the goal area by Didier Drogba. United's Rio Ferdinand, under pressure from Michael Ballack, was forced to head the ball towards his own goal and Edwin van der Sar pulled off a one-handed save to deny Chelsea a goal. United {{spent the rest of}} the first half pressing for a second goal, and had <b>two</b> <b>good</b> opportunities to extend their lead, but were denied by a double-save from Čech. Wayne Rooney delivered a long ball into the path of Ronaldo and the United goalscorer placed his cross on the head of the diving Carlos Tevez, only for Čech to deny him. Chelsea's failure to clear the loose ball gave Michael Carrick the chance to extend his side's lead, but Čech was again equal to the task with another save.|$|E

5|$|In March 1991, in {{his fourth}} top {{division}} tournament, Takahanada was runner-up with twelve wins, and became the youngest ever sanshō or special prize winner, receiving awards for Fighting Spirit and Technique. In the following tournament in May 1991 he defeated veteran yokozuna Chiyonofuji in a match watched by 44 percent of the Japanese population on TV, and became the youngest ever to defeat a yokozuna. Chiyonofuji retired two days afterwards. In January 1992, he became the youngest ever top division tournament champion (19years 5months). He {{was too young to}} drink the celebratory sake at the after tournament party, and had to make do with oolong tea instead. After his second championship in September 1992, followed by <b>two</b> <b>good</b> scores of 10–5 and 11–4 in the next two tournaments, he was promoted to ōzeki in January 1993, the same tournament in which Akebono was elevated to yokozuna.|$|E

Karl Sheppard had <b>two</b> <b>good</b> opportunities to score, one of which was cleared off the line by Sligo defender Alan Keane after Sheppard had beaten the goalkeeper. Eoin Doyle scored Sligo's goal shortly afterwards. This was the only goal of the game, although Sligo's Richie Ryan hit the woodwork with a free-kick and both teams had penalty claims turned down.|$|E
25|$|The donor is {{expected}} to take a good breath and pass his/her demand valve (or mouthpiece {{in the case of a}} twin-hose regulator) to the recipient, who {{is expected}} to take <b>two</b> <b>good</b> breaths and pass it back. In reality the recipient will often take more than two breaths, and the donor should expect this and relax to minimize metabolic rate. The donor should retain a good grip on the demand valve throughout the buddy breathing process, as a panicked recipient may fail to give it back. A reasonably reliable way of keeping control of the demand valve is to grasp the hose firmly in the fist where it connects to the demand valve. This provides good control but allows the recipient to use the purge button if needed.|$|E

25|$|Several factors came {{together}} for Frazier in this fight. He was 27 {{years old and}} at his boxing peak physically and mentally, Ali, 29, was coming back from a three-year absence but had kept active. He had had <b>two</b> <b>good</b> wins, including a bruising battle with Oscar Bonavena, whom Ali had defeated by a TKO in 15 rounds. Frazier worked on strategy with coach Eddie Futch. They noted Ali's tendency to throw a right-hand uppercut from a straight standing position after dropping the hand in preparation to throw it with force. Futch instructed Frazier to watch Ali's right hand and, at the moment Ali dropped it, to throw a left hook {{at the spot where}} they knew Ali's face would be a second later. Frazier staggered Ali in the 11th round and knocked down Ali in the 15th in this way.|$|E
25|$|Parma's next {{engagement}} {{was set to}} be the hosting of Juventus at the Tardini on 31 January, but it {{was called}} off after heavy snowfall. The match was re-scheduled for 15 February. It {{was the first time}} a game at the Tardini had been called off in exactly two years, when Internazionale visited. The mid-week postponement gave Parma extra rest before their third consecutive away match on a Sunday against Chievo, who had played on Thursday night. Both sides had <b>two</b> <b>good</b> chances in the first half, but it was Parma who took the lead, shortly after the break when the returning and freshly signed McDonald Mariga's chipped ball was expertly controlled by Giovinco, who proceeded to finish emphatically. However, the lead was short-lived: Modesto's poor defending allowed Cyril Théréau to finish easily from six yards. Parma had the better of the game after Chievo's equaliser and saw a couple of efforts saved, before a wide Giovinco free-kick was inadvertently sliced home by Chievo's Luciano to give Parma the victory.|$|E
25|$|By 1796 Hoche had a {{free hand}} because, unlike earlier governments, the French Directory {{did not need to}} approve every operation. With unity of command and near-dictatorial powers, his expeditions {{continuously}} pressed the insurgents. An earlier truce worked in his favor by allowing the rebels to briefly enjoy peace; afterward they were less inclined to fight. Elsewhere, French victories over the First Coalition armies made Royalist prospects look dim. At length, rebel leaders Jean-Nicolas Stofflet and François de Charette were captured and executed. By March 1796 the south bank of the Loire River was pacified and Hoche deployed 15,000 infantry and two cavalry regiments against the Chouans on the north bank. By May the Chouannerie was quelled after most of the leaders were captured or gave up. In return for peace, Hoche promised that the priests had religious freedom while the young men would not be conscripted into the army. About 2,000 Republican deserters fighting for the rebels surrendered and their only punishment was to return to the Republican army. The hard-liners were not pleased with Hoche's lenient terms and wished that Willot had been in charge. However, the Directory was so thankful for Hoche's efforts that it publicly proclaimed him Pacificateur and bought him a pair of pistols, <b>two</b> <b>good</b> horses and riding tack.|$|E

25|$|The relegation {{battle in}} the National League {{tightened}} further, as the match at Trent Bridge became a low-scoring thriller, where Gloucestershire Gladiators failed to put away <b>two</b> <b>good</b> positions - first they collapsed from 75 for 2 to make 116, then they allowed Nottinghamshire to hit 19 for the last wicket. They were put in to bat by Nottinghamshire Outlaws and after losing Kadeer Ali and Ramnaresh Sarwan for ducks, Steve Adshead and Craig Spearman rebuilt with a 60-run third-wicket stand. Mark Ealham and Gareth Clough shared the last seven wickets, however, after Ryan Sidebottom had bowled Spearman for 18, and Gloucestershire were all out for 116. James Averis then took four wickets for the Gladiators, as Nottinghamshire lost their first five wickets for 32 runs, but Anurag Singh and Mark Ealham put them back on track by adding 30 for the sixth wicket. Jon Lewis broke through their defences, however, shattering Ealham's stumps as he was bowled, and when Anurag Singh departed for 41, Nottinghamshire's task looked steep. They needed 19 for the last wicket with Ryan Sidebottom and Greg Smith batting - but Smith hit two fours as he ended with 16 not out to take Nottinghamshire to the victory.|$|E
25|$|Following {{this poor}} showing, many critics and fans {{believed}} that, at 38 years old, Aerts {{was too old}} and past his prime. Nonetheless, {{he was determined to}} return to form and began training under Thom Harinck again in early 2009. With Harinck back in his corner, Aerts faced Errol Zimmerman in a superfight at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2009 in Yokohama. Although the fight went to an extra round decision which Aerts won unanimously (10-9, 10-9, 10-9), he looked like a much improved fighter. Following this, he knocked out former world cruiserweight boxing champion Yosuke Nishijima with a low kick in round three at a K-1 World Grand Prix 2009 in Tokyo Final 16 Qualifying GP superfight. With <b>two</b> <b>good</b> showings under his belt that year, Aerts then went up against Alistair Overeem at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2009 in Seoul Final 16 on September 26, 2009. Despite Overeem's youth, size and strength advantage, Aerts was still the favourite going into the fight as Overeem had primarily spent his career as an MMA fighter and not a kickboxer. Although there were no knockdowns in the match, Overeem dominated over three rounds and took the unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27).|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{opened their}} next road trip with a 5–4 defeat to the Milwaukee Brewers that snapped the six game win streak. The Brewers won on a walk-off double by George Kottaras off of Javy Guerra {{in the bottom}} of the ninth. The Dodgers {{suffered}} their second straight defeat in walk-off fashion the next night when Nyjer Morgan scored on a sacrifice fly by Ryan Braun {{in the bottom of}} the 10th inning. Matt Kemp hit his seventh home run of the season in the series finale to help the Dodgers avoid the sweep. <b>Two</b> <b>good</b> defensive plays at third base by Jerry Hairston, Jr. helped the Dodgers hold on to a 4-3 victory. The Dodgers next traveled to Houston for a matchup with the Astros. In the opener, the one-two punch of Kemp & Ethier again accounted for all the Dodgers runs in a 3–1 victory. Clayton Kershaw picked up his first win of the season in the next game as he struck out nine and only allowed three hits in seven scoreless innings. Kemp hit his ninth home run of the season and James Loney his first in the Dodgers 5-1 win over the Astros. The Dodgers road trip ended on a sour note as they got pounded by the Astros 12–0. Billingsley allowed nine runs in only 3 innings, including a grand slam home run by Jordan Schafer.|$|E
