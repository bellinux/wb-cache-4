40|$|Conference Name: 3 rd International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing (WiCOM 2007). Conference Address: Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:SEP 21 - 25, 2007. <b>Time-slot</b> <b>synchronization</b> is very {{important}} for a TDMA-based Ad Hoc Network. In this paper, we propose a decentralized algorithm to synchronize the local time slot reference. The differences between the time slots of neighboring nodes with consideration of signal propagation delay are used to compute the slot adjustment. The methods on how to choose parameters are also discussed. Simulation experiments have been carried out for different scenarios, and the results show that this algorithm has fast convergence rate and modest computation burden, hence is suitable to run on terminals of Ad Hoc networks...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} written {{as a tool for}} developing optical pulse-position- modulation (PPM) receivers in which photodetector outputs are fed to analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and all subsequent signal processing is performed digitally. The program can be used, for example, to simulate an all-digital version of the PPM receiver described in Parallel Processing of Broad-Band PPM Signals (NPO- 40711), which appears elsewhere in this issue of NASA Tech Briefs. The program can also be translated into a design for digital PPM receiver hardware. The most notable innovation embodied in the software and the underlying PPM-reception concept is a digital processing subsystem that performs synchronization of PPM time slots, even though the digital processing is, itself, asynchronous in the sense that no attempt is made to synchronize it with the incoming optical signal a priori and there is no feedback to analog signal processing subsystems or ADCs. Functions performed by the software receiver include <b>time-slot</b> <b>synchronization,</b> symbol synchronization, coding preprocessing, and diagnostic functions. The program is written in the MATLAB and Simulink software system. The software receiver is highly parameterized and, hence, programmable: for example, slot- and symbol-synchronization filters have programmable bandwidths...|$|E
40|$|A parallel-processing {{algorithm}} and {{a hardware}} architecture {{to implement the}} algorithm have been devised for timeslot synchronization in the reception of pulse-position-modulated (PPM) optical or radio signals. As {{in the cases of}} some prior algorithms and architectures for parallel, discrete-time, digital processing of signals other than PPM, an incoming broadband signal is divided into multiple parallel narrower-band signals by means of sub-sampling and filtering. The number of parallel streams is chosen so that the frequency content of the narrower-band signals is low enough to enable processing by relatively-low speed complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronic circuitry. The algorithm and architecture are intended to satisfy requirements for time-varying <b>time-slot</b> <b>synchronization</b> and post-detection filtering, with correction of timing errors independent of estimation of timing errors. They are also intended to afford flexibility for dynamic reconfiguration and upgrading. The architecture is implemented in a reconfigurable CMOS processor {{in the form of a}} field-programmable gate array. The algorithm and its hardware implementation incorporate three separate time-varying filter banks for three distinct functions: correction of sub-sample timing errors, post-detection filtering, and post-detection estimation of timing errors. The design of the filter bank for correction of timing errors, the method of estimating timing errors, and the design of a feedback-loop filter are governed by a host of parameters, the most critical one, with regard to processing very broadband signals with CMOS hardware, being the number of parallel streams (equivalently, the rate-reduction parameter) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} synchronizing the carriers of two sources in a wireless communication system with one destination. Carrier synchronization has been considered recently in cooperative communication systems where the sources wish to pool their antenna resources and transmit as a “distributed beamformer”. Based {{on the concept of}} round-trip carrier synchronization first described in [1], we propose a new <b>time-slotted</b> round-trip carrier <b>synchronization</b> system and describe its implementation in systems with single-path or multi-path channels. The performance of the <b>time-slotted</b> round-trip carrier <b>synchronization</b> system is investigated in terms of the phase offset at the destination and the expected beamforming time before resynchronization is required. Our results suggest that the synchronization overhead can be small with respect to the potential beamforming gains. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an acoustic distributed beamforming system and presents experimental re-sults for two-source and three-source acoustic distributed beam-forming using the <b>time-slotted</b> round-trip carrier <b>synchronization</b> protocol. Each source node in the system was built using commercial off-the-shelf parts including a Texas Instruments floating-point digital signal processor, microphone, speaker, audio amplifier, and battery. The source node functionality, including phase locked loops and the logic associated with the <b>time-slotted</b> round-trip carrier <b>synchronization</b> protocol, was realized through real-time software independently running on each source node’s C 6713 digital signal processor. Experimental results for two-source and three-source realizations of the acoustic distributed beamforming system in a room with multipath channels are presented. The two-source and three-source experimental results show mean power gains of approximately 97. 7 % and 90. 7 %, respectively, of an ideal beamformer. I...|$|R
40|$|Physical-layer network coding (PNC) brings {{throughput}} improvement for wireless networks. However, its synchronization {{requirement is}} {{widely recognized as}} an obstacle to its implementation. In this paper, we focus on phase-level synchronization and propose a <b>time-slotted</b> carrier <b>synchronization</b> scheme for PNC. We then analyze the phase error tolerance of PNC under different bit error rate (BER) requirements, and the synchronization overhead for obtaining synchronous signals below the phase error margin. We also consider the impact of different hardware (in particular, the phase-locked loop) parameters on the overhead in our analysis. Afterwards, we evaluate the performance of the proposed synchronization scheme with simulations. The results show that the proposed scheme is feasible with some typical hardware parameters. The throughput gain of PNC when using the proposed scheme is only slightly lower than the theoretical gain. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
