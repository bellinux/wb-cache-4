5000|$|According to Cassini data, {{scientists}} {{announced on}} February 13, 2008, that Titan hosts within its polar lakes [...] "hundreds of times more {{natural gas and}} other liquid hydrocarbons than all the known {{oil and natural gas}} reserves on Earth." [...] The desert sand dunes along the equator, while devoid of open liquid, nonetheless hold more organics than all of Earths coal reserves. It has been estimated that the visible lakes and seas of Titan contain about 300 times the volume of Earths proven oil reserves. In June 2008, Cassinis Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer confirmed the presence of liquid ethane beyond doubt in a lake in Titans southern hemisphere. The exact blend of hydrocarbons in the lakes is unknown. According to a computer model, three-quarters of an average polar lake is ethane, with 10 per cent methane, 7 per cent propane and smaller amounts of hydrogen cyanide, butane, nitrogen and argon. Benzene is expected to fall like snow and quickly dissolve into the lakes, although the lakes may become saturated just as the Dead Sea on Earth is packed with salt. The excess benzene would then build up in a mud-like sludge on the shores and on the lake floors before eventually being eroded by ethane rain, forming a complex cave-riddled landscape. However, the chemical composition and physical properties of the lakes probably varies from one lake to another (Cassini observations in 2013 indicate Ligeia Mare is filled with a <b>ternary</b> <b>mixture</b> of methane, ethane, and nitrogen and consequently the probes radar signals were able to detect the sea floor 170 m below the liquid surface).|$|E

Du Pont De Nemours and Company, Inc., (CRADA No. 92 - 0161) for testing the use of heat exchangers as the evaporator and condenser in an air-conditioning rig. Heat exchangers at typical realistic operating conditions were tested with R- 22 and with its potential replacement, a <b>ternary</b> <b>mixture</b> of R- 32 (30 %) /R- 125 (10 %) /R- 134 a(60 %). A test rig was built that provided for operation of the low-temperature exchanger (evaporator) with flooded coils. The test results indicated that the performance of the evaporator heat exchanger using <b>ternary</b> <b>mixture,</b> in terms of cooling capacity, would be around 7. 4 % less than the performance using R- 22. The cooling capacity for both refrigerants improved with flooded evaporator operation by 8. 6 % for R- 22 and by 15 % for <b>ternary</b> <b>mixture.</b> Compared with R- 22 operation, operation with <b>ternary</b> <b>mixture</b> results in slightly higher compressor discharge pressure, lower compressor discharge temperature, slightly lower compressor power consumption, and a higher compressor high-low pressure ratio. Temperature glide for <b>ternary</b> <b>mixture,</b> for both evaporator and condenser, was clearly evident, but not as pronounced as expected because of the pressure drop (and thus the temperature drop) along the coils. Further improvement of the performance of <b>ternary</b> <b>mixture</b> is possible if the evaporator is arranged in a counter-cross-flow configuration to take advantage of the temperature glide.
