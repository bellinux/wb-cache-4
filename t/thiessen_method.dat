The main aim is to find methods which enable transfer of spot measurements of precipitation to spatially distributed estimation and consequently comparison of results of these methods and evaluation of their differences and accuracy. For better understanding of this problematic, precipitation and its characteristics, origin and types are described. Factors which precipitation influence are also listed further in the text.

The first two methods use only rainfall information, while cokriging and kriging with an external drift use both precipitation data and orographic information (easily accessible from topographic maps). In the case study presented, kriging with an external drift seems to give the most coherent results in accordance with cross-validation statistics. If there is a correlation between climatological rainfall mean and altitude, it seems logical that the inclusion of topographic information should improve the estimates.

The rainfall values used were for five (5) days in the same month where rainfall data for at least six (6) of the nine (9) gauging points were recorded, since rain did not fall on the whole the catchment on the same day.

Fourteen pluviometers were set up in order to conduct a representative analysis of the rainfall in the basin. Residents of the area voluntarily participated in collection of the rainfall data in the years 2007 and 2008; the residents were trained to collect the data before the pluviometers were installed. ArcGis 9. 2 software was used to outline and calculate the area of the Thiessen polygons, and both arithmetic and Thiessen precipitation means were calculated using Excel software.

In this paper, {{precipitation}} and runoff trends {{over the}} past 40 years are inferred for two sub-basins of the Maipti River: El Colorado (1 710 km(2)) and the Alto del Maipo (3521. 52 km(2)). The two sub-basins {{are located in the}} metropolitan region of Chile and have markedly snowy regimes. Five rain gauge stations with monthly and annual records (mm) were analyzed for the period 1963 - 2006. After completing the missing information for each station, mean areal precipitation was calculated using the <b>Thiessen</b> Polygons <b>Method.</b> Monthly and annual mean flow data were extracted from two flow gauging stations. The analysis of temporal behavior for rainfall and runoff variables was performed by adjusting the Type- 1 Gumbel distribution function and calculating moving averages and the rainfall/runoff coefficient (existing ratio of rainfall to surface runoff; PP/E, abbreviation in Spanish). Thus, it was possible to determine that, over the last 40 years, the Maipo River basin showed increased winter rainfall, decreased summer and autumn rainfall and increased runoff during summer periods. Therefore, it can be inferred that the increase in this runoff is influenced by glacier melting...|$|R

Few studies have investigated {{the significance of the}} social context of animal personalities, and such research has largely focused on the social organization of nonterritorial populations. Here we address the question of whether exploratory behaviour, a well-studied personality trait, is related to the social structure of a wild great tit, Parus major, population during the breeding season. We assayed the exploration behaviour of wild-caught great tits and then established the phenotypic spatial structure of the population over six consecutive breeding seasons. Network analyses of breeding proximity revealed that males, but not females, show positive assortment by behavioural phenotype, with males breeding closer to those of similar personalities. This assortment was detected when we used networks based on nearest neighbours, but not when we used the <b>Thiessen</b> polygon <b>method</b> where neighbours were defined from inferred territory boundaries. Further analysis found no relationship between personality assortment and local environmental conditions, suggesting that social processes may be more important than environmental variation in influencing male territory choice. This social organization during the breeding season has implications for the strength and direction of both natural and sexual selection on personality in wild animal populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} elaborates on the {{estimation}} of actual evapotranspiration at watershed scale using mathematical models and remote sensing techniques. A water balance model was updated and used to simulate runoff from a watershed, based on input data of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. The water balance simulation considers the loss and routing functions to estimate actual evapotranspiration. Two methods were used to estimate the areal precipitation, the precipitation gradient <b>method</b> and the <b>Thiessen</b> polygons <b>method</b> adjusted for the mean elevation of the watershed. Areal potential evapotranspiration was calculated using three empirical and semi-empirical methods based on temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. The potential evapotranspiration methods used were the Thornthwaite, Blaney-Criddle, and the modified Penman-Monteith. The water balance model was calibrated with the observed monthly runoff. The actual basin-wide evapotranspiration was estimated using the water balance model. Monthly composites of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) /Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data were correlated and linear relationships were developed with the water balance computed monthly actual evapotranspiration rates for four watersheds of Central Thessaly, Greece. The performance of the developed Actual evapotranspiration-NDVI relationships was examined using various statistical tests. The NDVI-derived actual evapotranspiration agrees well, in general, with the actual evapotranspiration calculated from the water balance method for both wet and water-limiting conditions.

The global ECHAM 4. 5 climate model was used to feed the RAMS regional climate model for the Alto Jaguaribe hydrographic basin. Resulting precipitation values were calibrated by the probability density function (PDF) correction of simulated data compared with average daily precipitation data using the <b>Thiessen</b> <b>method</b> for the period 1979 - 2009. The Heidke Skill Score (HSS) {{was used to evaluate}} model performance in the Maximum Predictable Time Interval (ITEMP) of the atmospheric model. These PDF-corrected precipitation data, both observed and RAMS-simulated, were inserted in the hydrologic Soil Moisture Account (SMA) model from the Hydrologic Engineering Center â Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) to determine modeled flows. These flows were then compared with median observed flows. To calibrate and validate the SMA, an iterative method was used to minimize percentage error of volume. The data returned by this cascade model was applied to assisting policy-makers determine water releases from the OrÃs reservoir. Three different scenarios were compared, the first based on observed flows, the second flows simulated by SMA with observed precipitation, and the third by flows simulated by SMA driven by the RAMS-PDF precipitation data. The RAMS model showed optimal efficiency in precipitation prediction on a 30 to 45 day interval, with HSS values of 0. 56. The SMA model showed satisfactory performance with Nash-Sutcliffe values of 0. 89 in the calibration phase and 0. 67 in the validation phase, demonstrating its capacity to assist hydrological modeling in the semi-arid. This cascade model showed potential in accurately representing median inflows for the reservoir and as such {{can be used as a}} hydrologic tool, assisting reservoir operation decisions to meet the regionâs demand.

40|$|Introduction: The {{hydrological}} {{models are}} very important tools for planning and management of water resources. These models {{can be used for}} identifying basin and nature problems and choosing various managements. Precipitation is based on these models. Calculations of rainfall would be affected by displacement and region factor such as topography, etc. Estimating areal rainfall is one of the basic needs in meteorological, water resources and others studies. There are various methods for the estimation of rainfall, which can be evaluated by using statistical data and mathematical terms. In hydrological analysis, areal rainfall is so important because of displacement of precipitation. Estimating areal rainfall is divided to three methods: 1 - graphical. 2 -topographical. 3 -numerical. This paper represented calculating mean precipitation (daily, monthly and annual) using Galerkin’s method (numerical method) and it was compared with other methods such as kriging, IDW, Thiessen and arithmetic mean. In this study, there were 42 actual gauges and thirteen dummies in Mashhad plain basin which is calculated by Galerkin’s method. The method included the use of interpolation functions, allowing an accurate representation of shape and relief of catchment with numerical integration performed by Gaussian quadrature and represented the allocation of weights to stations. Materials and Methods:The estimation of areal rainfall (daily, monthly,…) is the basic need for meteorological project. In this field,there are various methods that one of them is finite element method. Present study aimed to estimate areal rainfall with a 16 -year period (1997 - 2012) by using Galerkin method (finite element) in Mashhad plain basin for 42 station. Therefore, it was compared with other usual methods such as arithmetic mean, Thiessen, Kriging and IDW. The analysis of Thiessen, Kriging and IDW were in ArcGIS 10. 0 software environment and finite element analysis did by using of Matlab 7. 08 software environment. The finite element method is a numerical procedure for obtaining solutions to many of the problems encountered in engineering analysis. First, it utilizes discrete elements to obtain the joint displacements and member forces of a structural framework and estimate areal precipitation. Second, it uses the continuum elements to obtain approximate solutions to heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and solid mechanics problems. Galerkin’s method is used to develop the finite element equations for the field problems. It uses the same functions for Ni(x) that was used in the approximating equations. This approach is the basis of finite element method for problems involving first-derivative terms. This method yields the same result as the variational method when applied to differential equations that are self-adjoints. Galerkin’s method is almost simple and eliminates bias by representing the relief by suitable mathematical model and incorporating this into the integration. In this paper, two powerful techniques were introduced which was applied in Galerkin’s method: 	The use of interpolation functions to transform the shape of the element to a perfect square. The use of Gaussian quadrature to calculate rainfall depth numerically. In this study, Mashhad plain is divided to 40 elements which are quadrilateral. In each element, the rain gauge was situated on the node of the stations. The coordinates are given according to UTM, where x and y are the horizontal and z, the vertical (altitude) coordinate. It was necessary at the outset to number the corner nodes in a set manner and {{for the purpose of this}} paper, an anticlockwise convention was adopted. Results and Discussion: This paper represented the estimation of mean precipitation (daily, monthly and annual) in Mashhad plain by Galerkin’s method which was compared with arithmetic mean, Thiessen, kriging and IDW. The values of Galerkin’s method by Matlab 7. 08 software and Thiessen, kriging and IDW by ArcGIS 10. 0 were calculated. The base of the comparison was isohyetal method, because it showed the relief and took into account the effect of rain gauges, therefore it could represent rainfall data and region condition completely. The most accurate method was isohyetal method in estimating mean precipitation. Cross-validation was usually used to compare the accuracy of interpolation method. In this study, root mean square error (RMSE) was used as validation criteria. Meanwhile, in the present study, the effects of altitude were neglected for two reasons. First, partial correlation coefficient of rainfall/altitude gradients was weak and second, the storms data were not accessible. Conclusions: In this study, the estimation of areal rainfall by Galerkin’s method was an innovative step. The case study was Mashhad basin (9909 km 2) which included 42 rain gauges. Comparing other methods indicated that: 	Galerkin’s method was more efficient in comparison with arithmetic mean and it had more accurate results. 	Result of Galerkin’s method was similar to Kriging, IDW and <b>Thiessen</b> <b>method.</b> 	Unlike other methods, mesh of finite element could be used for calculating runoff, sediment and temperature and it did not need station weights. Even within one network the number of interpolation points can be varied, so that in a rugged region the number can be increased with little increase in effort, while in a more uniform region fewer are necessary...|$|E

This paper investigates a case study and presents a new method of representing the mobility of people within a city from check-in data. By dividing the data in a temporal sequence, this study examines the overall mobility in the case study city through the gradient/difference of population density with a series of time after computing the population density from the check-in data using an incorporated <b>Thiessen</b> polygon <b>method.</b> By classifying check-in data with their geo-tags into several groups according to travel purposes, and partitioning the data according to administrative district boundaries, various moving patterns for those travel purposes in those administrative districts are identified by scrutinizing a series of spatial geometries of a weighted standard deviational ellipse (WSDE). Through deep analyses of those data by the adopted approaches, the general pattern of mobility in the case city, such as people moving to the central urban area from the suburb from 4 am to 8 am, is ascertained, and different characteristics of movement in those districts are also depicted. Furthermore, it can tell that in which district less movement is likely for a certain purpose (e. g., for dinner or entertainment). This study has demonstrated the availability of the proposed methodology and check-in data for investigating intra-urban human mobility...|$|R

Both methods {{are used to}} evaluate probabilities for copper and cobalt deficiencies in the Borders Region of Scotland. Results are compared with maps obtained by the polygonal <b>method</b> (<b>Thiessen</b> polygons) and an indicator kriging algorithm that does not use soil map information. Accounting for soil map information is shown to improve delineation of the deficient areas, especially where the sampling is sparse. Test locations are classified as deficient or not so as to minimize an expected cost of misclassification that is derived from focal probability distributions of copper or cobalt and functions measuring the cost of overestimating or underestimating metal concentrations. The comparison of classification results with actual copper and cobalt concentrations at test locations shows that the two proposed algorithms can decrease substantially the economic loss attached to misclassification...|$|R

Average climatic conditions in the Yangtze River ecological region were calculated based on the data from 118 weather stations via the <b>Thiessen</b> polygon <b>method.</b> The survey results found that the aflatoxin contamination of peanuts was significantly high in 2013. The determination coefficient (R 2) of multiple regression reflected by the aflatoxin B 1 content with average precipitation and mean temperature in different periods showed that climatic conditions one month before harvest had the strongest impact on aflatoxin B 1 contamination, and that Hunan and Jiangxi provinces were greatly influenced. The simulated mean aflatoxin B 1 intake from peanuts at the mean peanut consumption level was 0. 777 – 0. 790 and 0. 343 – 0. 349 ng/(kg·d) for children aged 2 – 6 and standard adults respectively. Moreover, the evaluated cancer risks were 0. 024 and 0. 011 /(100, 000 persons·year) respectively, generally less than China’s current liver cancer incidence of 24. 6 cases/(100, 000 persons·year). In general, the dietary risk caused by peanut production and harvest was low.

40|$|As {{hydrological}} computer modeling software {{continues to}} increase in complexity, {{the need for further}} understanding of the value of different model input datasets becomes apparent. Frequently used precipitation model input include rain gauge data and next-generation radar–based (NEXRAD) rainfall data. Rain gauge data are usually interpolated across a model domain using various <b>methods</b> including the <b>Thiessen</b> Polygon methodology, which may be data-sparse in some areas and overly data-dense in others. However, rain gauge data are generally very easy to use in hydrologic model development, often requiring little to no data processing. NEXRAD data have the potential to improve hydrologic runoff estimates due to the increased spatial resolution of the data: but has its own issues regarding accuracy, false precipitation indications, and difficulties due to data processing. Previous studies have investigated the value of NEXRAD input versus traditional rain gauge data inputs for hydrologic studies; however, results are inconclusive as to which precipitation source provides more accurate results. Limited work has been done to compare the value of these datasets at multiple spatial scales, especially in Florida, a study area dominated by low topographic drive and sub-tropical weather. In addition, little to no research has been done regarding the value of NEXRAD versus rain gauge data inputs at different rainfall return frequencies. The proposed research will utilize a hydrological rain-runoff model (HEC-HMS) of the Upper St. Johns River Basin, Florida to compare the performance of the two precipitation data input types at various watershed spatial scales and rainfall return frequencies. Statistical analysis of the hydrological model “goodness-of-fit” results will be utilized to assess the watershed scaling and rainfall frequency requirements to xii which NEXRAD data provide little to no advantage over standard rain gauges using the <b>Thiessen</b> Polygon <b>method</b> for estimating rainfall totals across a model domain...|$|R
