5|$|Five KPA {{divisions}} amassed {{to oppose}} the UN at Taegu. From south to north, the 10th, 3rd, 15th, 13th, and 1st Divisions occupied a wide line encircling Taegu from Tuksong-dong and around Waegwan to Kunwi. The KPA planned to use the natural corridor of the Naktong valley from Sangju to Taegu as its main axis of attack for the next push south, so the divisions all eventually moved through <b>this</b> <b>valley,</b> crossing the Naktong at different areas along the low ground. Elements of the DPRK 105th Armored Division also supported the attack.|$|E

5|$|Stretching {{between the}} Pfullendorf heights {{and the village}} lies a flat, wide plain, marshy in places, ringed with low-lying hills, and creased with a small {{tributary}} stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at {{the northern end of}} this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians arrived a day or so later. Over the following week, additional forces for both sides arrived, and the two armies faced each other across <b>this</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Mérens is closely linked to its {{homeland}} in the Pyrenees, {{as evidenced by the}} many myths and legends in which it plays a role. The origins of the Mérens are very old, and are commonly said to be lost in the mists of time. It is native to the upper valley of Ariege, near Andorra. The direct ancestor of the Mérens was probably in <b>this</b> <b>valley</b> during the Quaternary Period, approximately 15,000 years ago. These wild horses probably moved to the mountains to escape global warming that accompanied {{the end of the last}} glacial period.|$|E
5|$|The tombs were {{constructed}} and decorated by the {{workers of the}} village of Deir el-Medina, located in a small wadi between <b>this</b> <b>valley</b> and the Valley of the Queens, facing Thebes. The workers journeyed to the tombs through various routes over the Theban hills. The daily lives of these workers are quite well known and are recorded in tombs and official documents. Amongst the events documented is perhaps the first recorded worker's strike, detailed in the Turin strike papyrus.|$|E

5|$|Mahanoy Creek enters Northumberland County in East Cameron Township. It flows westward for {{a number}} of miles through a valley with Line Mountain to the south and Mahanoy Mountain to the north. The creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 125 in <b>this</b> <b>valley.</b> The creek passes into West Cameron Township, flowing west and goes through the {{township}} for several miles. It then flows into Little Mahanoy Township. After a short distance, it leaves behind the Line Mountain/Mahanoy Mountain valley and picks up Zerbe Run. Mahanoy Creek then turns southwest and passes by Dornsife before cutting through a gap between Little Mountain and Line Mountain and exiting Little Mahanoy Township. At this point, the creek enters Jackson Township and picks up Schwaben Creek, its last tributary, after some distance. Mahanoy Creek then meanders west to its mouth on the Susquehanna River north of Herndon and ten miles south of Sunbury.|$|E
5|$|At Gunnison, US-89 turns east before curving {{northeast}} {{into the}} Sanpete Valley, {{formed by the}} San Pitch River, {{a tributary of the}} Sevier River. Along US-89 in <b>this</b> <b>valley</b> are several small cities: Manti, Ephraim, Mount Pleasant, and Fairview. Between Ephraim and Mount Pleasant, US-89 meets the south end of SR-132 at Pigeon Hollow Junction. SR-132 was formerly US-189, connecting US-89 with US-91 in Nephi. Beyond Fairview, where the scenic SR-31 turns east, US-89 climbs out of the valley, reaching a summit at Hill Top (elevation 6400 feet/2000 m). Thistle Creek parallels the next leg of the highway, descending through a canyon to the junction with US-6 near the ghost town of Thistle, flooded by a landslide in 1983. Thistle Creek and Soldier Creek, paralleled by US-89 and US-6, merge near this junction to form Spanish Fork, which the overlapped routes follow northwest through Spanish Fork Canyon into the Utah Valley at Moark Junction. US-89 splits to the north from US-6 there, skirts the west edge of Mapleton, and merges with SR-51 - the old Arrowhead Trail (US-91) - south of downtown Springville.|$|E
5|$|The four lower cheekteeth—the fourth lower premolar (p4) {{and first}} through third lower molars (m1–m3)—are high-crowned teeth. Like the upper teeth, they bear four cusps (metaconid, protoconid, entoconid, and hypoconid), four lophs (metalophid, mesolophid, hypolophid, and posterolophid) and three valleys. Each {{of the lower}} cheekteeth lacks an {{additional}} loph, the ectolophid, which is present in Arikareeomys. The p4 is larger {{than any of the}} molars and longer than it is wide. Among the molars, m1 and m2 do not differ appreciably from each other and are a little wider than they are long, while m3 is a little smaller and its back side is more rounded and narrower. Syncline IV, which is located {{at the back of the}} tooth, between the hypolophid and posterolophid, is closed at the margins; <b>this</b> <b>valley</b> is open in Megapeomys bobwilsoni. Syncline IV also opens into the centrally located syncline III; this opening is absent in Arikareeomys. There are two roots under p4 and three under each of the molars, fewer than in Megapeomys bobwilsoni, which shows three under p4 and four under the molars.|$|E

25|$|The {{city was}} founded in 1531 within the Valley of Cuetlaxcoapan as a Spanish city, not on the {{foundation}} of an existing indigenous city-state. Official date of foundation is 16 April 1531, however, this first attempt at settlement failed due to constant flooding of the site {{right next to the}} river. Several rivers flow through the Valley of Puebla, the San Francisco, Atoyac and the Alseseca. <b>This</b> <b>valley</b> was bordered by the indigenous city-states turned colonial towns of Cholula, Tlaxcala, Huejotzingo and Tepeaca, all of which had large indigenous populations.
