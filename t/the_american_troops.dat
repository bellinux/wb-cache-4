5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted to placate the Hessian commander, Captain von Malmburg, {{who was in}} charge of the surrender. They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, cake, with compliments. As they left the fort, the Hessians stripped <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further injuries or deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Around 01:00 on August 27, the British {{approached}} {{the vicinity of}} the Red Lion with 200–300 troops. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> fired upon the British; after approximately two fusillades, they fled up the Gowanus Road toward the Vechte-Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd had been in command, but he was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates. This first engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38th and 39th streets between 2nd and 3rd avenues near a swamp located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.|$|E

5|$|British General Sir Henry Clinton {{moved up}} from New York City and {{attempted}} to divert American attention by capturing two forts in the Hudson River highlands on October 6, but his efforts were too late to help Burgoyne. Burgoyne attacked Bemis Heights again on October 7 after {{it became apparent that}} he would not receive relieving aid in time. This battle culminated in heavy fighting marked by Arnold's spirited rallying of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops.</b> Burgoyne's forces were thrown back to the positions that they held before the September 19 battle and the Americans captured a portion of the entrenched British defenses.|$|E
5|$|From August 1942 to February 1943, Berg was on {{assignment}} in the Caribbean and South America. His {{job was to}} monitor the health and physical fitness of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States, {{and they wanted to}} be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Howe landed {{his army}} in an amphibious {{operation}} at Kip's Bay, {{on the eastern}} shore of Manhattan, along the East River. After a bombardment of the American positions on the shore, 4,000 British and Hessian troops landed, and they fought the Battle of Kip's Bay. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> began to flee {{at the sight of the}} enemy, and even after Washington arrived on the scene and took immediate command, demanding that his soldiers fight, they refused to obey orders and continued to flee.|$|E
5000|$|The rest of both armies soon {{joined the}} {{fighting}} which expanded {{to cover the}} stretch from the beach to beyond the bridge.

500|$|In late October, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troop</b> {{strength}} surged {{again with the}} arrival of 500 men from New York and Connecticut, including Brigadier General David Wooster.

5|$|That morning, September 5, after a 10-minute {{artillery}} preparation, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> {{moved out}} in their third day of counterattack. It was a day of rain. As the attack progressed, the marines approached Obong-ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the month before. There, at midmorning, on the high ground ahead, they could see North Korean troops digging in. The marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions {{in front of the}} North Korean-held high ground.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Infantry Division was {{selected}} to undertake the task of recapturing Attu Island. The division arrived at Cold Bay on April 30, 1943, and, despite the cold weather prevailing in the region, many of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> were wearing only regular field clothing as the division had previously been stationed in California. Due to poor weather, the Americans' assault on Attu was delayed twice – first to May 4 and then to May 11. When the operation commenced on May 11, heavy fog shrouded the recapturing force from the Japanese, which hampered the latter's attempts at defending the island.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> {{were also}} {{supported}} by air and naval units. At {{the time of}} the counterattack, the US Navy force assigned to the island comprised the six destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 22, a squadron of PT boats, a small number of Landing Craft Infantry fitted as gunboats and several armed landing craft. The air units on Bougainville (designated AirSols) had 64 SBD Dauntless dive bombers and 32 TBF Avenger torpedo bombers available for ground support tasks.|$|E

German radio is heard broadcasting the song to <b>the</b> entrenched <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> to demoralize them.

5|$|The {{crossing}} of the Saint Lawrence by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> was observed by Quebec militia, who alerted British troops at Trois-Rivières. A local farmer led the Americans into a swamp, enabling the British to land additional forces in the village, and to establish positions behind the American army. After a brief exchange between an established British line and American troops emerging from the swamp, the Americans broke into a somewhat disorganized retreat. As some avenues of retreat were cut off, the British took a sizable number of prisoners, including General Thompson and much of his staff.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> were {{attempting}} to destroy Shōji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march overland from Aola Bay toward Koli Point to cut off any of Shōji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast. A patrol with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's patrol base.|$|E
5|$|Captain San Pedro {{detected}} {{the movements of}} <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> from his positions on a nearby hill and ordered his men to open fire. Garretson then ordered a direct attack on the Spanish and Puerto Rican forces in the hacienda. At day break, the 6th Massachusetts overran the Spanish forces and suffered four casualties. Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating {{the right wing of}} the Spanish force, which was not overrun, initiated a flanking attack against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength of the Spanish force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to momentarily panic, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off. Puig and his forces suffered two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead.|$|E

5|$|During the night, the American artillery, {{under the}} command of Henry Knox, {{occasionally}} fired shells into Trenton to keep the British on edge. As Cornwallis had, Washington also called for a council of war. Using the road leading to Princeton, and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there. By 2am on January 3, the army {{was on its way to}} Princeton. Washington left behind 500 men and two cannons to keep the fires burning and to make noise with picks and shovels to make the British think they were digging in. By morning, these men too had evacuated, and when the British came to attack, all of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> were gone.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{participated in}} the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777. After an initial setback, Washington rallied <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> and led them in a {{successful}} charge against the British forces. After making a brief stand, the British fell back, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them fire upon the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, and broke it down. The British subsequently put a white flag outside one of the windows. 194 British soldiers {{walked out of the}} building and laid down their arms, thus ending the battle in an American victory.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> {{who were}} not killed or {{captured}} escaped behind the fortified American positions centered on Brooklyn Heights. Howe then ordered all of his troops to halt the attack, in a move considered controversial to this day, despite the protests of many officers in his command who believed that they should push on to Brooklyn Heights. Howe had decided against a direct frontal assault against the entrenched American positions, choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around the American positions. He believed the Americans to be essentially trapped, with his troops blocking escape by land and the Royal Navy {{in control of the}} East River, which they would have to cross to reach Manhattan Island.|$|E

5|$|The Luna Defense Line {{was planned}} {{to create a}} series of delaying battles from Caloocan to Angeles, Pampanga, as the Republic was {{constructing}} a guerrilla base in the Mountain Province. The base was planned {{to be the last}} stand headquarters of the Republic in the case the Americans broke through the Defense Line. American military observers were astonished by the Defense Line, which they described as consisting of numerous bamboo trenches stretching from town to town. The series of trenches allowed the Filipinos to withdraw gradually, firing from cover at the advancing Americans. As <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> occupied each new position, they were subjected to a series of traps that had been set in the trenches, which included bamboo spikes and poisonous reptiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{flanking}} party {{consisted of}} Knowlton's Rangers, {{which had been}} reinforced by three companies of riflemen, in total about 200 men. As they approached, an officer accidentally misdirected the men, and the firing broke out on the British flank, not their rear. The British troops, realizing that they had almost been surrounded, retreated to a field, {{where there was a}} fence. The Americans soon pursued and, during the attack, Knowlton was killed. Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> pushed on; driving the British troops beyond the fence {{to the top of a}} hill.
