A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the <b>taxable</b> <b>base</b> amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|E
2500|$|Laffer {{explains}} {{the model in}} terms of two interacting effects of taxation: an [...] "arithmetic effect" [...] and an [...] "economic effect". The [...] "arithmetic effect" [...] assumes that tax revenue raised is the tax rate multiplied by the revenue available for taxation (or tax base). Thus revenue R is equal to t×B where t is the tax rate and B is the <b>taxable</b> <b>base</b> (R=t×B). At a 0% tax rate, the model assumes that no tax revenue is raised. The [...] "economic effect" [...] assumes that the tax rate will affect the tax base itself. At the extreme of a 100% tax rate, the government theoretically collects zero revenue because taxpayers change their behavior {{in response to the}} tax rate: either they lose their incentive to work, or they find a way to avoid paying taxes. Thus, the [...] "economic effect" [...] of a 100% tax rate is to decrease the tax base to zero. If this is the case, then somewhere between 0% and 100% lies a tax rate that will maximize revenue.|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{unemployment}} insurance financing, indexing is the automatic adjustment of <b>taxable</b> wage <b>bases</b> in conjunction with growth in wages. While every state has a mix of financing features in its unemployment insurance (UI) program, if asked to name a single step that will improve state UI trust fund solvency, knowledgeable experts would say indexing of <b>taxable</b> wage <b>bases.</b> • In 2003, states had UI <b>taxable</b> wage <b>bases</b> ranging from $ 7000 to $ 30, 200. Having higher wage bases is closely associated with having an indexed <b>taxable</b> wage <b>base</b> (TWB). All fifteen states that had UI wage bases of $ 15, 000 or more in 2003 were states with indexed TWBs. • Higher <b>taxable</b> wage <b>bases</b> put UI financing on a broader basis and increase the responsiveness of UI taxes when recovering from higher UI benefit payments during a recession. In general, states with higher <b>taxable</b> wage <b>bases</b> can recover from or avoid insolvency better than states with lower <b>taxable</b> wage <b>bases.</b> • UI programs insure workers against the loss of wages. Indexing permits the financing of UI programs {{to keep pace with}} the insured risk, that is, lost wages.

50|$|Some {{believed}} that the HST would generate significantly more revenue according to the following reasoning: While the PST revenue was estimated at $5.083 billion for 2009/2010, several sources concur to estimate the 5% GST revenue for British Columbia of about $5 billion (or a tax base at about $100 billion after the current GST exemption concerning the public sector). This reasoning argued that, since most sales subject to GST would be HST taxable (at 7% for the BC HST revenue), this revenue could be multiplied by 7%/5% to estimate the gross BC HST revenue. If the <b>taxable</b> <b>base</b> were roughly the same, this would result in approximately $7 billion in BC HST revenue.|$|E

They determine that because the effective corporate income tax rate has fallen by one-third in two decades, the effective tax rate decline is the result of a tax base that is eroding in relation to a corporation’s income and profits.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Arthur Laffer {{developed}} the Laffer curve, which demonstrates {{that there are}} two effects of changing tax rates: an arithmetic effect—if tax rates are lowered, revenue will be decrease by the same amount—and an economic effect—which provides incentives for individuals to increase their work output through low tax rates. The higher the taxes placed on income are, the more people lose their incentives to earn more taxable income, which causes the <b>taxable</b> <b>base</b> to shrink. This in turn leads reduced revenue at a certain point because although taxes are higher, there are fewer people paying those taxes. Laffer constructed a graph to illustrate when this point occurs, though it does not actually determine whether a particular tax cut will raise or lower revenues. Laffer’s curve is widely used because it can be applied to all taxes, not just income taxes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{income tax}} is {{calculated}} {{by the administration}} based on the amounts reported by taxpayers who are required to declare their whole income earned during the previous year. But the calculation of income tax {{takes into account the}} personal situation of the taxpayer, in particular through the [...] "family quotient" [...] (or units in the household) {{on the one hand and}} in the allocation of reductions or tax credits to taxpayers, on the other hand. The family quotient can take into account family responsibilities and, according to them, eases the effects of progressive taxation since the progressive rate is applied to a partial income (the taxable income). This process consists of dividing the taxable income of the household tax into a number of units (or parts) equal to the number of individuals. The progressive scale of tax is then applied to taxable income per share. Finally, this partial tax is multiplied by the number of units to determine the <b>taxable</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the {{self-assessment}} taxation approach, taxpayers calculate their taxable income, file {{tax returns}} and {{pay their taxes}} due.

The [...] "economic effect" [...] assumes that the tax rate will affect the tax base itself.

5000|$|Mancur Olson {{suggests}} that the emergence of dictatorships {{can be linked to}} the concept of [...] "roving bandits", individuals in an atomic system who move from place to place extracting wealth from individuals. These bandits provide a disincentive for investment and production. Olson states that a community of individuals would be better served if that bandit were to establish himself as a stationary bandit in order to monopolize theft in the form of taxes. Also, Except from the community, the bandits themselves will be better served, according to Olson, by transforming themselves into [...] "stationary bandits". By settling down and making themselves the rulers of a territory, {{they will be able to}} make more profits through taxes than they used to obtain through plunder. By maintaining order and providing protection to the community, the bandits will create a peaceful environment in which their people can maximize their surplus which means a greater <b>taxable</b> <b>base.</b> Thus, a potential dictator will have a greater incentive to provide security to a given community from which he is extracting taxes and conversely, the people from whom he extracts the taxes are more likely to produce because they will be unconcerned with potential theft by other bandits.
