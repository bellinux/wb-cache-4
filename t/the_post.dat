Another prospector named Alonzo Maxey, and a friend, built Bradley's Roadhouse to compete with McCarty's and by 1907, McCarty's had been transferred to Maxey.|$|E

5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they rushed the trench, throwing hand grenades. <b>The</b> <b>post</b> was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied that part of <b>the</b> <b>post</b> the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were {{now in a position}} to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of <b>the</b> <b>post</b> Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out of <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

5|$|Following Joseph Stalin's {{consolidation}} {{of power in}} the 1920s <b>the</b> <b>post</b> of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party became synonymous with 'Leader of the Soviet Union' because <b>the</b> <b>post</b> controlled both the CPSU and the Soviet Government. <b>The</b> <b>post</b> of the General Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary; in 1966 Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the communist party, the office of the General Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990. <b>The</b> <b>post</b> of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader, the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo, the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The President of the Soviet Union, an office created in March 1990, replaced the General Secretary as the highest Soviet political office.|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} in {{installing}} a picket fence is to insert <b>the</b> <b>posts</b> into <b>the</b> ground. Traditionally this is done by digging deep holes (usually 36in x 12in) either manually or with a power auger. <b>The</b> <b>posts</b> are then placed upright {{into the ground and}} concrete is poured to cement them into place. Once they are set, the horizontal rails are affixed to <b>the</b> <b>posts</b> using fasteners, and finally the pickets can be attached to the horizontal rails. By far the most time consuming part of installing a picket fence is setting <b>the</b> <b>posts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Captain G. H. Halliday's D Company moved southwards against Post 19. He {{drew the}} defenders' {{attention}} with a demonstration by one platoon {{in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>post</b> {{while the rest of}} the company moved around <b>the</b> <b>post</b> and attacked silently from the rear. This maneuver took the defenders by surprise and D Company captured the post—and 73 prisoners—at 0230. Halliday repeated this tactic against Post 14, which was taken at 0400 with 64 prisoners. Capturing the two posts cost one Australian killed and seven wounded. A third attempt against Post 17 failed: the previous attacks had alerted <b>the</b> <b>post</b> and D Company came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire. A furious battle raged until <b>the</b> <b>post</b> fell shortly before dawn. Another 103 Italians were captured at a cost of two Australians killed and nine wounded. Between casualties and men detached as prisoner escorts, D Company strength fell to 46 men, and Halliday elected to halt for the night.|$|E

This reasoning can proceed through all the disks, each of which must first be on <b>the</b> S <b>post</b> before passing to <b>the</b> I <b>post,</b> thus showing that the solution must pass through an intermediate state where all n &minus; 1 disk are on <b>the</b> S <b>post.</b>|$|R

5|$|With {{the guerrillas}} {{requiring}} supplies, Koos de la Rey lead {{a force of}} 3,000 Boers against Brakfontein, on the Elands River in Western Transvaal. <b>The</b> <b>post</b> held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 Rhodesians. The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties. During the night the defenders dug in, enduring shelling and rifle fire. A relief force was stopped by the Boers, while a second column turned back believing that <b>the</b> <b>post</b> had already been relieved. The siege lasted 11 days, during which more than 1,800 shells were fired into <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a frontal attack, the Boers eventually retired. The Siege of Elands River {{was one of the}} major achievements of the Australians during the war, with <b>the</b> <b>post</b> finally relieved on 16 August.|$|E

5|$|At 03:00, {{just before}} dawn, Spragg took {{command of the}} trench in the {{southern}} sector of No.3 Post, opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> He successfully deployed his men {{so that when the}} attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' small arms fire. But by 03:30 <b>the</b> <b>post</b> was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully to the north of <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own small arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post, making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of <b>the</b> <b>post.</b> At 06:30 communications were re-established with No.3 Post by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who had to see to themselves.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} process, when the NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner of a posting, it also sets <b>the</b> <b>posting</b> fee, {{which is now}} capped at a maximum of $20million.
