5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is being evaluated, and that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{only true}} {{way to test}} GNSS {{receivers}} (commonly known as Sat-Nav's in the commercial world) is by using an RF Constellation Simulator. A receiver that may for example be used on an aircraft, can be tested under dynamic conditions without {{the need to take}} it on a real flight. The test conditions can be repeated exactly, and there is full control over all the test parameters. this is not possible in the 'real-world' using the actual signals. For testing receivers that will use the new Galileo (satellite navigation) <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>alternative,</b> as the real signals do not yet exist.|$|E

Intracranial pressure may be increased due to medications such as high-dose vitamin A derivatives (e.g. isotretinoin for acne), long-term tetracycline antibiotics (for a variety of skin conditions) and hormonal contraceptives. There are numerous other diseases, mostly rare conditions, {{that may lead to}} intracranial hypertension. If there is an underlying cause, the condition is termed [...] "secondary intracranial hypertension". Common causes of secondary intracranial hypertension include obstructive sleep apnea (a sleep-related breathing disorder), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic kidney disease, and Behçet's disease.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the cost of}} a new procurement program, industry officials stated that to merely extend the operating life of the current fleet is a risky choice because it is both less secure and costly to maintain. Lawmakers {{from both sides of the}} aisle, including Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Representative Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) have been outspoken critics of the Pentagon in the matter—Bartlett recently claiming that [...] "they had this conversation outside the partnership and we regret that." [...] Loren Thompson, an analyst for the Lexington Institute, stated [...] "I do not believe that the story of VH-71 is over...

[...] This has led UNICEF to be skeptical of international adoption efforts {{as a solution to}} child care problems in developing countries; UNICEF has preferred to see children cared for in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents.|$|E
2500|$|The Trident nuclear missile {{system is}} based at Coulport weapons depot and naval base of Faslane in the Firth of Clyde area. While the SNP objects to having nuclear weapons on Scottish territory, British {{military}} leaders have said that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>alternative</b> site for the missiles; in April 2014, several British military leaders co-signed a letter stating that forcing Trident to leave Scottish waters would place the UK nuclear deterrent in jeopardy. Nowhere to Go, a report by Scottish CND, concluded that the removal of Trident from Scotland would force unilateral nuclear disarmament by the United Kingdom, as the weapons have no viable alternative base. A report by the Royal United Services Institute said that relocating Trident would be [...] "very difficult, but not impossible" [...] and estimated {{that it would take}} about 10 years and create an additional cost of around £3 billion.|$|E
