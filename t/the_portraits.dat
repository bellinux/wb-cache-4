50|$|<b>The</b> <b>portrait</b> is {{currently}} {{in the possession of}} a private owner, Lloyd Sullivan of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. However, in December 2013 it was announced that a tentative deal was in the works for an unnamed Canadian family to purchase <b>the</b> <b>portrait.</b> <b>The</b> family is reported to be excited to keep <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> in <b>the</b> Canadian public domain and is expected to donate <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> to a public arts institution.|$|R
50|$|Legend {{holds that}} Carpignano {{was once a}} thick forest where a {{portrait}} of a black Madonna hung on a tree. Neighboring farmers, who had stumbled across <b>the</b> <b>portrait,</b> tried to take <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> back to their city several times, yet during the night, somehow, <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> returned to <b>the</b> tree. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> was kept in that spot, upon which a grand sanctuary was built, called the Santuario Di Carpignano. <b>The</b> <b>portrait</b> is adorned on the main wall in the church to this day.|$|R
50|$|For those {{unfamiliar}} with <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> of Dr. Sun, the Martyrs issue of 1932 also has Corinthian columns {{on either side}} of <b>the</b> <b>portrait,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> itself is framed by a wreath rather than a double line oval, as with the Sun Yat-sen stamps.|$|R
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. <b>The</b> <b>portraits</b> show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
5|$|In Larkin at Sixty, amongst <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> {{by friends}} and colleagues such as Kingsley Amis, Noel Hughes and Charles Monteith and dedicatory poems by John Betjeman, Peter Porter and Gavin Ewart, the various strands of Larkin's output were {{analysed}} by critics and fellow poets: Andrew Motion, Christopher Ricks and Seamus Heaney looked at the poems, Alan Brownjohn wrote on the novels, and Donald Mitchell and Clive James looked at his jazz criticism.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, {{partly because of the}} variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life. <b>The</b> <b>portraits</b> of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E

5|$|The red canopy {{bed in the}} King's bedchamber is a 1989 copy of a bed kept in the Château d'Azay-le-Rideau, {{thought to}} be {{very similar to the}} lost original. <b>The</b> <b>portraits</b> of kings Louis XIV and Louis XV of France in the library are copies made in 1950 of originals by Hyacinthe Rigaud kept in the Palace of Versailles. These 20th-century copies are {{replacements}} for the 18th-century copies of the same paintings that were destroyed during the French Revolution {{at the same time as}} <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> of the prince-bishops in the Bishops' Hall (see above, History). The overdoor paintings in the antechamber of the prince-bishop are also 20th-century copies, replacing 18th-century copies of French Baroque masters such as Antoine Coypel, Charles Le Brun, and Charles de La Fosse, that were destroyed in 1944. These paintings represent biblical stories; the lost first copies were made in 1737–1740 in Versailles. The other paintings on the walls belong to the Musée des beaux-arts, including Louis XV offrant la Paix à L'Europe ("Louis XV presenting Peace to Europe", 1737) by François Lemoyne, on display in the Garde-robe du prince-évêque, and La déification d'Énée ("The Deification of Aeneas", 1749) by Jean II Restout, on display in the Chambre du prince-évêque.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{created more}} than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889. They were usually {{completed}} in series, {{such as those}} painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death. Generally <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> were studies, created during introspective periods when {{he was reluctant to}} mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> on the Makkotai coins {{are that they}} do not have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Portrait</b> of Pauline: Pauline Grey {{gets her}} {{portrait}} {{done by a}} street artist, she is told that it will show {{the true nature of}} the sitter. Pauline does not believe it, but changes her mind when <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> begins to change for the worse. Realizing she must change her ways if <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> is to improve, Pauline makes genuine efforts to do so, but things tend to go wrong and <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> ends up looking bad again.|$|R
50|$|On November 28, 2013 all of {{the current}} {{information}} on <b>the</b> Sanders <b>Portrait</b> was made public by researchers from the University of Guelph and supplemented by discussions of the scientific studies done, the internal evidence (that is, {{a reading of the}} clothing of the sitter, the status of the sitter, the date on <b>the</b> <b>portrait,</b> and <b>the</b> artistic style), and a discussion of the media and cultural importance of <b>the</b> <b>portrait.</b> <b>The</b> day sought to renew interest in <b>the</b> <b>portrait,</b> establish it as <b>the</b> only <b>portrait</b> thought to be done in Shakespeare’s own lifetime, and to act as catalyst in a sale that would move <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> from private to public domain.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>portrait</b> weighs 1.5 tonnes and is {{generally}} {{replaced by a}} spare when it is vandalised. In 1989, three dissidents, including Yu Dongyue, attacked <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> with eggs during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Yu was sent to prison and was not released until 17 years later in 2006. On May 12, 2007 <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> of Mao caught fire. A 35-year-old unemployed man from Urumqi was arrested for the incident. About 15% of <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> was damaged, {{and had to be}} repaired later. On April 5, 2010, a protester threw ink in a plastic bottle and hit a wall near <b>the</b> <b>portrait.</b> He was then arrested.|$|R
5|$|Another theory, {{which was}} {{put forward by}} early Serbian historians and has {{subsequently}} lost support in Serbian scholarship, is that despot Michael is {{to be identified with}} mid-15th-century Serbian noble Mihailo Anđelović, a brother of Ottoman statesman Mahmud Pasha Angelović. However, in-depth research of the frecoes has concluded that they cannot be ascribed to the 1450s, as the artistic style, the clothing and hairstyles in <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> are uncommon for this period. Furthermore, the church seems to bear little architectural similarity to churches of the Morava school, which dominated 15th-century Serbian architecture. It has also been revealed that in 1454–1455, Donja Kamenica was controlled by the Ottomans and in possession of a certain Yusuf, rather than part of the Serbian Despotate, and Mihailo Anđelović was never titled despot.|$|E
5|$|In 1558, Elizabeth succeeded her {{half-sister}} to {{the throne}} {{and set out to}} rule by good counsel. She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the Supreme Governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir to continue the Tudor line. She never did, despite numerous courtships. As she grew older, Elizabeth became famous for her virginity. A cult grew around her which was celebrated in <b>the</b> <b>portraits,</b> pageants, and literature of the day.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. <b>The</b> <b>portraits</b> of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair with a slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E

5|$|Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the {{collective}} name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), {{when she was}} around 39 and he was 63 years. <b>The</b> <b>portraits</b> are unflinching records of {{the physical and emotional}} effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the quality}} of Meessen's photography, Boom and Wachilin write that his Javanese {{pictures}} are among his best, whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality. They note considerable detail in his cityscapes. He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers, including the Governor General's Palace {{and the home of}} Raden Saleh. Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial, leading Boom and Wachlin to suggest that they were meant to fund Meessen's landscape photography. Some of his images, particularly <b>the</b> <b>portraits,</b> were hand-tinted.|$|E

5|$|Several hôtels particuliers (large townhouses) {{date from}} the Renaissance. Most of them have oriel windows that are {{characteristic}} of German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these hôtels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey {{and it has a}} large three-story granary. The Ziegler house has a beautiful oriel that shows the interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The oriel partly reflects Vitruvius's architectural legacy and displays <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later hôtels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the mansard roof, were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.|$|E
5|$|The archaic is {{demonstrated}} by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos, circa 570–560BC. After the 4thcenturyBC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including The Winged Victory of Samothrace (190BC) and the Venus de Milo, symbolic of classical art. The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding {{collection of more than}} one thousand Greek potteries. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed. The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.|$|E
5|$|The church's upper story {{features}} {{fragments of}} frescoes, {{mostly on the}} interior, though there are traces of mural painting {{on one of the}} blind arches as well.

Among <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> of saints that can be recognised are John the Baptist, the apostles Peter and Paul, Constantine and Helena and the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Military saints were depicted on the south wall, while the north wall mostly features monks. All of the preserved frescoes were done in the 14th century and are an example of Palaiologan art. All captions to the frescoes are in Medieval Greek.|$|E
