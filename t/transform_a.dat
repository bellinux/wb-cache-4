5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to <b>transform</b> <b>a</b> given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E
5|$|Alchemy {{was already}} well {{established}} before {{the rise of}} Islam. It {{was based on the}} belief that substances were made up of the four Aristotelian elements, fire, earth, air, and water in different proportions. Alchemists supposed that gold was the noblest metal, and that other metals formed a series down to the basest, such as lead. They believed, too, that a fifth element, the elixir, could <b>transform</b> <b>a</b> base metal into gold. Jabir ibn Hayyan (8th–9th centuries) wrote on alchemy, based on his own experiments. He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue to be used when alchemy had transformed into chemistry. Ibn Hayyan identified many substances including sulphuric and nitric acids. He described processes such as sublimation, reduction and distillation. He made use of equipment such as the alembic and the retort stand.|$|E

It is further {{shown that the}} method <b>transforms</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary prefix-free LR(k) grammar to an equivalent LR(0) grammar. It is argued that the method is efficient and offers some advantages over tradltmnal &quot;look-ahead &quot; parsing methods. Finally, it is demonstrated that the method {{can be used to}} <b>transform</b> <b>an</b> LR(1) grammar to an equivalent SLR(1) grammar, which in turn can be easdy <b>transformed</b> to <b>an</b> equivalent (1, 1) bounded right-context grammar.

5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which <b>transform</b> <b>a</b> geometric problem into algebraic equations. These {{methods were}} simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify {{the configuration of the}} given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.|$|E
5|$|So {{yesterday}} morning the Tories, {{by the hand}} of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and G Hardy. Only {{the execution of the}} three has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed which will now be sung to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America... To my knowledge, the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least the decency to treat J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here everything is being done to <b>transform</b> <b>a</b> political attempt into a common crime.|$|E
5|$|To <b>transform</b> <b>a</b> {{probabilistically}} checkable proof {{system of}} this type into a clique problem, one forms a graph with a vertex for each possible accepting run of the proof checker. That is, a vertex is defined {{by one of the}} possible random choices of sets of positions to examine, and by bit values for those positions that would cause the checker to accept the proof. Two vertices are adjacent, in this graph, if the corresponding two accepting runs see the same bit values at every position they both examine. Each (valid or invalid) proof string corresponds to a clique, the set of accepting runs that see that proof string, and all maximal cliques arise in this way. One of these cliques is large if and only if it corresponds to a proof string that many proof checkers accept. If the original satisfiability instance is satisfiable, it will have a valid proof string, one that is accepted by all runs of the checker, and this string will correspond to a large clique in the graph. However, if the original instance is not satisfiable, then all proof strings are invalid, each proof string has {{only a small number of}} checker runs that mistakenly accept it, and all cliques are small. Therefore, if one could distinguish in polynomial time between graphs that have large cliques and graphs in which all cliques are small, or if one could accurately approximate the clique problem, then applying this approximation to the graphs generated from satisfiability instances would allow satisfiable instances to be distinguished from unsatisfiable instances. However, this is not possible unless P=NP.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{interpretation}} of the Fourier transform is as a transformation of a time domain signal into a frequency domain signal. On the other hand, the {{interpretation of}} the inverse Fourier transform is as a transformation of a frequency domain signal into a time domain signal. Apparently, fractional Fourier transforms can <b>transform</b> <b>a</b> signal (either in the time domain or frequency domain) into the domain between time and frequency: it is a rotation in the time-frequency domain. This perspective is generalized by the linear canonical transformation, which generalizes the fractional Fourier transform and allows linear transforms of the time-frequency domain other than rotation.|$|E
