He spent {{approximately}} 437 days aboard Mir conducting experiments and performing scientific research. During this flight, he completed just over 7,000 orbits of the Earth. On January 9, 1995, after 366 days in space, Polyakov formally broke the spaceflight duration record previously set by Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov six years earlier.

Upon landing, Polyakov opted not to be carried the few feet between the Soyuz capsule and a nearby lawn chair, instead walking the short distance.

50|$|Queue jumps {{are only}} {{effective}} in certain situations. First, {{there has to}} be an existing source of delay or roadway congestion; if there is no congestion and the normal traffic signal is usually green, then the bus driver has no reason to move into the queue jump. The length of the queue jump lane needs to be long enough to provide a meaningful time savings. Queue jumps can also be used in situations such as bus stop pullouts or at the end of a bus-only lane, in order to help expedite the bus merge into traffic. Queue jumps may not work well where there are high volumes of right turning vehicles (left turning in UK) that might get in the way of the bus through movement, although in some cases these turning vehicles can be provided a separate lane and/or a protected signal phase at the same time as the advanced <b>transit</b> <b>phase.</b> Available right-of-way is needed to provide the bypass lane.|$|E

Exoplanet atmosphere studies require stellar background spectra {{to be known}} along the transit path while detection of Earth analogs require stellar microvariability to be understood. Hydrodynamic 3 D models can be computed for widely different stars but have been tested in detail only for the Sun with its resolved surface features. Model predictions include spectral line shapes, asymmetries, and wavelength shifts, and their center-To-limb changes across stellar disks. Aims. We observe high-resolution spectral line profiles across spatially highly resolved stellar surfaces, which are free {{from the effects of}} spatial smearing and rotational broadening present in full-disk spectra, enabling comparisons to synthetic profiles from 3 D models. Methods. During exoplanet transits, successive stellar surface portions become hidden and differential spectroscopy between various <b>transit</b> <b>phases</b> provides spectra of small surface segments temporarily hidden behind the planet. Planets cover no more than ~ 1 % of any main-sequence star, enabling high spatial resolution but demanding very precise observations. Realistically measurable quantities are identified through simulated observations of synthetic spectral lines. Results. In normal stars, line profile ratios between various <b>transit</b> <b>phases</b> may vary by 0. 5 %, requiring S/N 5000 for meaningful spectral reconstruction. While not yet realistic for individual spectral lines, this is achievable for cool stars by averaging over numerous lines with similar parameters. Conclusions.

Hydrodynamic 3 -D models can be computed for widely different stars but have been tested in detail only for the Sun with its resolved surface features.

AIMS: To observe high-resolution spectral line profiles across spatially highly resolved stellar surfaces, which are free {{from the effects of}} spatial smearing and rotational broadening present in full-disk spectra, enabling comparisons to synthetic profiles from 3 -D models. METHODS: During exoplanet transits, successive stellar surface portions become hidden and differential spectroscopy between various <b>transit</b> <b>phases</b> provides spectra of small surface segments temporarily hidden behind the planet. Planets cover no more than about 1 % of any main-sequence star, enabling high spatial resolution but demanding very precise observations.

The comparison of our predictions with the experimental results shows quite a good agreement with observations and reveals the range of applicability of the approximated "universality" property...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that Earth {{passages}} of fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) trigger geomagnetic storms. Early identification of fast earth-directed CME can help provide storm warnings, but detection of such by coronagraphs is extremely difficult. We suggest that energetic hydrogen atoms (EHA) between 2 and 10 keV produced during the <b>transit</b> <b>phase</b> of an Earth-directed CME by recombination between protons and electrons in the CME can travel ahead of the CME and act as harbingers of a magnetic storm. This forecasting scheme should work if enough EHA are produced, because while CMEs decelerate continuously after their ejection, the EHA fluxes produced in the initial phase of fast CMEs propagate at their initial high speeds. Model simulations support this proposed mechanism...|$|E

An adversary thus has a clear motive to observe, alter, and delete log entries, considering that she could (i) start by using the log's content to identify new security vulnerabilities, and (ii) exploit them without ever being detected.

Using N-body simulations we show that masses greater than approximately 10 ^ 20 kg (a tenth of the mass of Ceres) or orbits that are not nearly circular (eccentricity> 10 ^- 3) dramatically increase the chances of the system becoming unstable within two years, which would contrast with the observational data over this timespan.
