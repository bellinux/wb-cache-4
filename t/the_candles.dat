He {{opens the door to}} the kitchen, revealing all of the other employees holding candles. Various members of the office ask Holly if she will marry them (all of Michael's plan) and she politely says no. Michael then leads Holly out to her desk, which is surrounded by dozens of candles. Michael gets down on his knee and begins to make a speech when the sprinklers go off from <b>the</b> <b>candles.</b> The water drenches everyone in the office and Michael proposes. Holly accepts.

Afterwards, D'Sora reveals to Data over a romantic dinner in his quarters that she broke up with her boyfriend because he was emotionally unavailable and then pursued him because he was the same. Data realises that she is breaking up with him and explains that he will delete the subroutine. D'Sora departs and Data blows out <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> seemingly unperturbed.|$|E
5|$|The {{honor of}} {{becoming}} an altar server, was, in the past, a privilege only available to boys but has since become coed. Altar servers wear long, white, plain robes and assist the priest in his duties during the Mass. At Mt. St. Peter Church, there are four altar servers at every Mass. One is the book bearer and {{is in charge of}} bringing the Bible to the priest at the times during which the priest reads from the Bible during the Mass. The cross bearer holds a large, wooded crucifix and commences the procession in which the priest enters the church. Also present in the procession are the acolytes, and the book bearer. He or she also leads the procession out of the church {{at the end of the}} Mass. The last two altar servers are acolytes and are in charge of lighting <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> in the church prior to the beginning of the Mass and extinguishing them after Mass.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>candle</b> was {{originally}} built with an actual wick. On May 9, 1971, the town's mayor and Oregon Governor Tom McCall lit <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> with a specially-made 60-foot-long match. President Richard Nixon declined {{a request to}} light <b>the</b> <b>candle.</b> Due to difficulties in keeping <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> lit during rainfall, the wick was replaced with a natural gas line up the center of <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> to create a real flame at the top. However, due to environmental concerns and high gas bills, the flame was eventually replaced with an electric neon light flame structure.|$|R
5000|$|Extinguisher: <b>The</b> <b>candle</b> {{is placed}} on a pulley system, and the team must {{traverse}} through an obstacle course {{to the other side}} of the room, keeping tension on a rope used to balance <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> vertically. If <b>the</b> rope is pulled too hard, <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> is snuffed out by a piece of metal above it. Not hard enough, and <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> falls into a jug of water. Their binding impedes their progress through the course.|$|R
5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into a {{house to}} the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out <b>the</b> <b>candles.</b> The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E

25|$|The holy day {{is celebrated}} with an all-night vigil {{on the eve}} of the feast, and a celebration of the Divine Liturgy the next morning, at which beeswax candles are blessed. This blessing {{traditionally}} takes place after the Little Hours and before the beginning of the Divine Liturgy (though in some places it is done after). The priest reads four prayers, and then a fifth one during which all present bow their heads before God. He then censes <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> and blesses them with holy water. <b>The</b> <b>candles</b> are then distributed to the people and the Liturgy begins.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>candles</b> {{are placed}} on altars and devotees turn to {{specific}} colored candles depending on their circumstance. Some keep {{the full range of}} colored candle while others focus on one aspect Santa Muerte's spirit. Santa Muerte's image as satanic or evil has been derived from her association with drug trafficking and the dead bodies found at her altar, however, the specific colors for <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> indicate that Santa Muerte's devotees stem from many walks of life beyond crime, violence, and the drug trade. Santa Muerte is called upon for matters of the heart, health, money, wisdom, and justice. There is the brown candle of wisdom, the white candle of gratitude and consecration, the black candle for protection and vengeance, the red candle of love and passion, the gold candle for monetary affairs, the green candle for crime and justice, the purple candle for healing.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, President George W. Bush held an {{official}} Hanukkah reception in the White House {{in conjunction with}} the candle-lighting ceremony, and since then this ceremony has become an annual tradition attended by Jewish leaders from around the country. In 2008, George Bush linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting <b>the</b> <b>candles.</b>|$|E
25|$|The blessings {{are said}} {{before or after}} <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> are lit {{depending}} on tradition. On {{the first night of}} Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit {{on the right side of}} the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.|$|E

50|$|Later, Rita crafts a Green Candle out {{of special}} wax {{that had been}} enchanted with Tommy's touch when he was evil. Once lit, <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> {{continues}} to burn until it is gone, and when it is, so too would Tommy's powers. Because Tommy's proximity to <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> accelerates <b>the</b> <b>candle's</b> melting process, Tommy is captured and placed in its proximity by Goldar. However, he eventually escapes and Jason is left to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>candle.</b> Jason does well in his fight with Goldar, but is recalled into the battle with Rita's Cyclops monster {{in order to save}} Tommy's life.|$|R
25|$|While Hanukkah is a {{relatively}} minor Jewish holiday, {{as indicated by the}} lack of religious restrictions on work other than a few minutes after lighting <b>the</b> <b>candles,</b> in North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.|$|E
25|$|Santa Muerte is a {{multifaceted}} saint, with various symbolic meanings and her devotees can call upon her {{a wide range}} of reasons.

On the back of <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> are prayers associated with the color's meaning and may sometimes come with additional prayer cards.|$|E
25|$|Conclusive {{evidence}} {{appears in}} 1291 when an argument was settled by Bishop Godfrey Giffard regarding {{who owned the}} wax from <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> used at the feast of St Swithun. It was decided that the scholars of the Worcester School owned it, and the Rector of Saint Nicholas Church {{had to rely on}} the generosity of the scholars in order to get candle wax. The headmaster is mentioned as Stephen of London. The letter dated December 1291 is in the County Records Office in Worcester.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>candle,</b> whose rate {{of burning}} was known, bore against the {{underside}} of the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> burned away, <b>the</b> weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>candle.</b> No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known.|$|R
60|$|What ails this fly thus {{desperately to}} enter A combat with <b>the</b> <b>candle?</b> Will she venture To clash at light? Away, thou silly fly; Thus doing thou wilt burn thy wings and die.

Nor doth <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> let her quite escape, But gives some little check unto the ape: Throws up her heels it doth, so down she falls, Where she lies sprawling, and for succour calls. When she recovers, up she gets again, And at <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> comes with might and main, But now behold, <b>the</b> <b>candle</b> takes <b>the</b> fly, And holds her, till she doth by burning die.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>candle</b> {{is meant}} {{to serve as a}} symbol for the desire for world peace.

25|$|In the Ashkenazi tradition, {{each night}} after the {{lighting}} of <b>the</b> <b>candles,</b> the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, and praises God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory), and a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.|$|E

25|$|Inexpensive small wax candles {{sold for}} Hanukkah burn for {{approximately}} {{half an hour}} so should be lit no earlier than nightfall. Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, <b>the</b> <b>candles</b> must be lit before sunset. However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual, followed by the Shabbat candles. At {{the end of the}} Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.|$|E
