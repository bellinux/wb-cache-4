40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modelling attempt to endogenise {{the level and}} timing of environmental <b>taxes</b> within an <b>optimisation</b> framework. First, a base model of energy economy environmental interactions is extended to allow for exogenous tax analysis. Two types of environmental taxes, one on the sulphur content of fuels {{and the other on}} the level of emissions, are exogenously included in the model as alternative instruments to mitigate pollution. Next, the base model is modified to endogenise pollution abatement. This has been achieved by incorporating a preference rate, depending on an index of emissions, into the utility function. Finally, the emission index and emission tax are taken as substitutes and modelled within a CES form to endogenise the emission tax. Results for all cases, obtained with Turkish data, are discussed. It is found that a tax on SO 2 emissions is more effective in reducing SO 2 emissions than a tax applied on the sulphur content of fuels. It is also found that a gradually increasing tax is more effective in reducing emissions than a constant tax...|$|R
40|$|D. Com. (Business Economics) A clear {{distinction}} {{should be made}} between the straightforward financing of a project and project finance itself. In short, project finance {{can be defined as}} the financing of a particular economic unit with the aim of the financial structuring to be such that there is as little recourse as possible to the sponsor of the project and the lender is thus satisfied to look at the cash flows and earnings as the source of repayment and the assets of the project as security. Usually, project finance would incorporate all or some of the following characteristics namely, off balance sheet financing, recourse limited to the pre-commissioning stage, an element of fixed rate debt, utilisation of <b>tax</b> allowances, <b>optimisation</b> of <b>tax</b> position, long term finance and some degree of foreign exchange activity. If the project is sponsored by an existing company, it will be looking to maximise debt, minimise recourse and group tax liability, optimise financial costs and retain or improve financial ratios after consolidation of the project. However, the degree of project financing appropriate for any project depends on what lenders are prepared to accept and what sponsors are prepared to provide in order to let the project become a reality. The project financier's role is to formulate financial structures, assess financial feasibility, develop funding proposals, secure sources of finance and to manage the financing facilities once they are in place. A project sponsor employs a project financier because the latter is objective, impartial, has access to required information and is able to process it into a professional presentation to the financial community, has the experience and expertise to advise on the most appropriate and cost effective financing structure and is best equipped to perform a thorough project financial analysis. This study has been undertaken to point out the differences between project finance and finance for a project, to identify the role of project financier and is as such largely concentrated on the financial side of a project. The goal was to discuss the importance of project finance from the financial institutions' viewpoint and to identify those aspects that would be important to a project advisor or lender. Although relatively little has been published on project finance, it is a multidisciplinary subject and references have been used wherever available. The author's attendance at seminars on the subject, as well as discussions with international project financiers and bankers have also contributed {{to the understanding of the}} subject. In addition to an in-depth exposure to project finance in South Africa, several months have been spent with an international bank's project finance division in London...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} tax status and capital structure while controlling for company history. The capital structure of a sample of IPOs is compared to seasoned companies as {{it is argued that}} the capital structure of IPOs is not as affected by the history of decisions and experiences as that of seasoned firms. Thus any link between <b>tax</b> <b>optimisation</b> and capital structure {{is more likely to be}} identified in IPO firms. Australia however, unlike many parts of the world, has had a full dividend imputation system since 1987. This theoretically at least should remove any bias between the use of debt and equity for taxpaying companies, while the bias remains for non-taxpaying companies unable to take advantage of the tax saving from debt. We find that non-taxpaying IPOs have significantly lower levels of debt than taxpaying IPOs, a result consistent with the tax incentive hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|The present chapter {{addresses}} the general {{phenomenon of the}} proliferation of codified rules by examining the difficulties that the proliferation of novel social forms (social morphogenesis unbound) creates for the interpretation of codified rules. My argument starts from the ontological observation that the codification of rules is always fundamentally incomplete as codifications never fully specify the range of actions subject to them or the contexts in which they ought to apply (section 1). A number of realist concepts are introduced in this section to account for how agents manage nonetheless to reach some form of consensus when interpreting codified rules. The second section mobilises these concepts to examine the import of social integration for rule interpretation in morphogenetic settings. The third and last section examines the import of systemic integration for rule coherence, first {{in a situation of}} predominant morphostasis and then in a situation of overwhelming morphogenesis. An example of contemporary relevance - <b>tax</b> <b>optimisation</b> - illustrates the argument...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{an issue of}} {{indirect}} taxes evasion and analyzes how to fight them. The aim of this piece of work is to provide basic insight into the issue of indirect tax evasion and also to describe and evaluate {{some of the latest}} tools used in the fight against them. I have no intention to analyze the topic in detail as the possibility to do so is limited by the extent of the diploma thesis. The thesis itself is divided into three parts. In the introductory part, a term tax is defined and a system of indirect taxes is briefly described. Moreover, specific indirect taxes in the Czech Republic are defined with the respect to their legal construction and regulation. To demonstrate the importance of indirect taxes, the first chapter of the thesis covers also information about the revenue of each indirect tax for the state budget. The second chapter deals with theoretical background of the taxes evasion issue and ways of their realisation. Firstly, the term tax evasion is defined as a technical term and then it is compared to <b>tax</b> <b>optimisation</b> as described. To make the theoretical picture complete, psychological and economical aspects of the issue are mentioned as models describing factors influencing origin of tax evasions. Another part of the thesis is focused on ways of realisation of tax [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this diploma thesis is the <b>tax</b> <b>optimisation</b> of a {{selected}} business entity. The thesis aims at finding the most optimum tax solution possible, especially of corporation income tax in order that the selected entity has as low tax liability as possible. The diploma thesis is divided into a theoretical and practical part, {{each of which is}} divided into individual chapters and subchapters, dealing with specific problems. The introduction of the theoretical part includes basic terms relating to tax issues, general data on the taxation system of the Czech Republic. The following and, simultaneously, most comprehensive chapter is devoted to corporation income tax, namely for the reason that the practical part deals with alternatives of optimisation of corporation income tax. In these chapters I proceeded mainly from the current wordings of tax laws and other specialised publications. The practical part of the thesis provides, one by one, suggestions of individual alternatives for reducing tax liability, which are subsequently theoretically explained and practically calculated. When calculating the individual alternatives I proceeded on the basis of exact data and details that the selected enterprise had been provided to me. Thanks to it, I had the opportunity to obtain a good knowledge of its internal functioning, economic situation but also the ownership structure. A summary of these resultant alternatives is then given in chapter 7. It exactly shows what impact each of the alternatives would have on the enterprises tax liability and what the tax liability would amount to if all the alternatives proposed were used...|$|E
40|$|Transfer pricing plays a crucial {{role in the}} {{financial}} management of TNC as it significantly influences revenues and costs allocation among affiliates of TNC that are located in countries with different tax regimes, interest rates, political situation and economic environment. Recently, transfer pricing is scrutinized in respect of tax minimisation strategies adopted by TNC which raises various conflicts of interest with tax authorities in some countries of their presence. The main objective of the dissertation thesis is to provide a comprehensive empirical study on international transfer pricing in the Czech Republic {{from the perspectives of}} both taxpayer and the tax authority. With regard to the complexity of transfer pricing, manufacturing afiliates of TNC located in the Czech Republic were selected to be examined in more detail. The thesis is structured into five chapters. The first chapter defines theoretical framework based on which the analytical part of the thesis is elaborated. The strategies applied by TNC in setting transfer prices are strongly affected by the transfer pricing regulation and interpretative experience of the particular countries in which they operate. In this context, the Czech transfer pricing legislation as well as selected case law is analyzed in the second chapter. Given the complexity of the issue of transfer pricing, the third chapter deals with selected aspects that are considered critical when setting transfer prices. The fourth chapter presents key findings regarding transfer pricing strategies applied by TNC located in the Czech Republic to transfer pricing issues. The fifth chapter summarizes the approach of the Czech tax authorities to the transfer pricing audits {{and at the same time}} evaluates related risks borne for taxpayers in this respect. The thesis reveals that manufacturing afiliates of TNC located in the Czech Republic generally prefer non market (cost based) transfer pricing methods when setting transfer prices, whereby there are several factors influencing their decision making, out of which internal economic conditions and foreign exchange risk management are deemed the most important factors, while <b>tax</b> <b>optimisation</b> as well as restrictions on profit repatriation are considered relatively less important factors. The study further indicates certain inconsistency between declared functional and risk profiles and decision making competences. In this connection, it was found out that the Czech afiliates in which the foreign parent company is involved in transfer pricing set-up incur tax losses. In response to the increasing importance of transfer pricing and international initiative Action Plan BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) it can be stated that the approach of the Czech tax authorities has become more intensified and sophisticated. The Czech tax authorities challenge declared and actual functional and risk profile of taxpayers as well as economic substance of realized intercompany transactions. Furthermore, number of transfer pricing audits has increased and become targeted on risky taxpayers such as companies granting investment incentives or incurring tax losses etc. As a result, additional tax assessment due to incorrect transfer pricing significantly increases over recent years...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades there has been an {{increasing}} focus on transfer pricing both from firms and authorities. Today, many CFOs identify transfer pricing as their most important tax issue, and more and more countries realise that there are considerable tax revenues that could be collected from a stricter enforcement of the transfer pricing legislation. When looking at the academic literature, however, one will see that transfer pricing is an issue that spans much wider than the firm’s tax report, and, if used correctly, it can be a very efficient tool for management control. With this background, this master thesis sets out to study the differences between the advice given about transfer pricing in the academic literature and the practices that can be observed in Norwegian multinational firms. Emphasis is put on how the practices are impacted by tax legislation. Due to the current globalisation, transfer pricing is an issue that constantly increase in importance. The world is becoming more interconnected and both the number of multinational enterprises and the level of intra-firm cross-border trade are growing. This trend makes it both interesting and important to get an understanding of how firms approach the issue of pricing their internal transfers, in order to identify improvements that could increase the efficiency of firms and legislation. In {{the first part of this}} master thesis we conduct a literature study to get a proper understanding of the transfer pricing problem and its implications. In the second part we turn our attention to the transfer pricing practices in Norwegian firms. Here, we first create a set of research hypotheses about the transfer pricing practices in Norway based on the literature study and former empirical studies of transfer pricing practices. We then test our hypotheses through a survey that is sent out to four transfer pricing advisory consultants. The consultants answer the survey based on their observations from more than 150 Norwegian firms. The result being that five out of the six research hypotheses are confirmed or partly confirmed. In the third and final part, the results from the study of practices are compared with findings from the literature study, to say something about the differences between theory and the practices in Norwegian firms. The results of our analyses show that, when it comes to transfer pricing, there are considerable differences between the advice given in the academic literature and the practices observed in Norwegian multinationals. While theory suggests that a firm should use transfer pricing for both strategic optimisation, including management control, and <b>tax</b> <b>optimisation,</b> the study of practices shows that firms in Norway almost exclusively are concerned with complying with the tax legislation. Thus, our results show that tax legislation has a fairly big impact on the observed practices in Norwegian firms. P a g e | 2 Important to notice here is that the transfer pricing legislation in Norway is quite new, and my research suggests that Norwegian firms could have had an even less structured approach to transfer pricing before the new legislation came into effect in January 2008. When looking at the countries that are leading within transfer pricing, we can see that they have had legislation in the area for more than a decade. The development in these countries suggests that as time passes by and firms mature in their view and understanding of transfer pricing, strategic considerations are also adopted as a part of their transfer pricing policy. This leads us to believe that, in the long term, Norwegian firms will also adopt a more mature approach to transfer pricing, an approach that is more congruent with the advice given in the academic literature. As a conclusion to this master thesis, I make five proposals for improvements that will help accelerate the maturation process for Norwegian firms...|$|E
