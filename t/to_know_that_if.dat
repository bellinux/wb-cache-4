25|$|He {{laid down}} the laws for me. It was a good chat. I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head. It gave me a lot of {{confidence}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I went back and scored runs in grade cricket and 2nd XI, I could get back into the team straight away.|$|E
25|$|My {{father was}} very slow {{to get into}} the cornfield. He was so indignant at the ruffians that he was unwilling to retreat before them. My little {{children}} were in the field three hours. They seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they cried the noise would betray their parents whereabouts, and so they kept as still as mice. The baby was very hungry & I gave her an ear of raw green corn which she ate ravenously.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. President Barack Obama lent {{his voice}} to the {{movement}} against bullying and contributed a video on October 21, 2010, saying, [...] "We've got to dispel this myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage; that it's just some inevitable part of growing up. It's not. We {{have an obligation to}} ensure that our schools are safe for all of our kids. And for every young person out there you need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you're in trouble, there are caring adults who can help." [...] In March 2011, Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama hosted an anti-bullying conference.|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{will care}} little for that, girl. 'Tis a great {{consolation}} <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> Hetty, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> mother ever did commit any heavy fault when young, she lived sincerely to repent of it; no doubt her sins were forgiven her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you know}} how the straps go," [...] Sir Ralph said, in a tone of satisfaction. [...] "Well, it is {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> even <b>if</b> you don't <b>know</b> what <b>to</b> do with it when you have got it on. Now, Master Edgar, have at you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Incentive theory distinguishes {{itself from}} other {{motivation}} theories, such as drive theory, {{in the direction}} of the motivation. In incentive theory, stimuli [...] "attract" [...] a person towards them, and push them towards the stimulus. In terms of behaviorism, incentive theory involves positive reinforcement: the reinforcing stimulus has been conditioned to make the person happier. As opposed to in drive theory, which involves negative reinforcement: a stimulus has been associated with the removal of the punishment—the lack of homeostasis in the body. For example, a person has come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they eat when hungry, it will eliminate that negative feeling of hunger, or if they drink when thirsty, it will eliminate that negative feeling of thirst.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, Peter Porco {{was notified}} that Christopher had also obtained {{a line of}} credit from Citibank to finance the Jeep Wrangler, again using his father's name as a cosignatory. Peter once again wrote to his son, who had not answered his parents' phone calls in weeks: [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you abuse my credit again, I will be forced to file forgery affidavits in order to disclaim liability and that applies to the Citibank college loan if you attempt to reactivate it or use my credit to obtain any other loan." [...] The email concluded: [...] "We may be disappointed with you, but your mother and I still love you and care about your future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of their {{previous}} album, The Real Thing and its subsequent tour, Faith No More took a break {{for a year and a}} half before beginning work on the follow-up, Angel Dust. During this time Mike Patton rejoined his high-school band Mr. Bungle to record their eponymous début album. This situation had an effect on the band, since drummer Mike Bordin thought the writing process was like the state of a [...] "magic slate" [...] having been [...] "completely covered in writing; there was not any more room for any more writing on that slate, so we all went and said all right, and erased everything, and started writing new stuff," [...] and Patton was creatively revitalized. They decided not to [...] "play it safe" [...] and instead took a different musical direction, much to the dismay of guitarist Jim Martin. [...] Martin also didn't like the title of the album as chosen by keyboardist Roddy Bottum. [...] In an interview taken while they were in the studio he said that [...] "Roddy [...] wanted to name it Angel Dust, I don't know why, I just want you <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it's named Angel Dust, it didn't have anything to do with me.|$|E

6000|$|... "It isn't whether I {{want to stay}} or not," [...] Ellen {{spoke into}} her pillow. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I have got <b>to</b> go. You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I saw him--Oh, why do you make me talk?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The album's title, Two Eleven, is a {{reference}} to both Norwood's birthday and the day her idol and mentor, entertainer Whitney Houston, died in 2012. Norwood declared selecting a title a [...] "tough decision". About the title, she stated: [...] "Some of the titles I was working with were Rebirth, Reincarnation, Reinvention, Resurrection [...] I just felt like Two Eleven describes all of that. It’s the day I was born, and each year, I evolve and change with time. It also has {{a whole new meaning}} to it because I gained my angel. My icon is my angel now. It’s all tied in there and I just think it best represents who I am and the responsibilities I have moving on." [...] Dismissing ongoing reproaches, that she was [...] "trying to use the passing of Whitney Houston to sell records," [...] Norwood remarked that the title was nothing but a homage, “I need for everybody <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> it wasn’t for Whitney Houston, there would be no me, because she was the possibility for me. She was the vision of my dreams actually coming true, and she meant everything to me.” The official album, photograpphed by Gomillion & Leupold, cover was revealed on August 29, 2012. The deluxe edition cover is entirely identical to the standard edition but is tinged yellow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, do ask it," [...] she said, [...] "and {{get rid of}} your woebegone face. You ought <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it is {{anything}} within my power I shall not hesitate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> by {{any chance}} you loved me, you would not flinch. But there were other things; your {{upbringing}} and traditions. I couldn't hope your parents would agree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes, I {{ought to}} have {{mentioned}} her {{in the same breath}} with yourself, Enoch, for she has been kind--very kind and patient. Now, I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> snake has come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Must I {{remind you}} that you owe {{something}} to your old comrade?" [...] he asked. [...] "I left my father and mother, the morning I got your letter--and my one thought has been to serve you. Reward me. Be a man, and hear what is your right and duty <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> After <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> you like, we will never refer to the woman again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see by {{the papers}} to-day {{that one of}} the cursed rebel {{officers}} who gave them the slip at Elmira is traveling in the disguise of a minister. I guess it's mighty unpleasant <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> you meet a parson in a train, like as not he is a rebel in disguise. Now, mister, may I ask where you have come from and where you are going to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Black coat or {{no black}} coat," [...] Vincent said, [...] "you {{may find it}} more {{difficult}} than you think. My profession is a peaceful one; but even a peaceful man, if assaulted, may defend himself. You say it's unpleasant <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you travel with {{a man in a}} black coat he may be a traitor. It's quite as unpleasant to me <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I travel with a man in a brown one he may be a notorious ruffian, and may as likely as not have just served his time in a penitentiary." ...|$|E
6000|$|This nettled him. [...] "It don't {{take much}} wisdom <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{you go on}} advising people in that way you'll get into trouble. That's what that writer said in the paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm not!" [...] {{cried the}} girl [...] "How could I be? I've only met him twice. It would be {{perfectly}} ridiculous. I know I'm not. I ought <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I know anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Welcome, indeed," [...] she said. [...] "I will be {{a mother}} to you, poor child, till I can hand you over to your own. I thank God for sending you to me. It {{will be a}} comfort <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> even <b>if</b> my son should never bring my husband back to me, he has at least succeeded in rescuing one victim from Tippoo, and in making one family happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{spirited}} and proper, no doubt, sir," [...] returned Sir Joseph, smiling; [...] "but {{you ought}} <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> young gentleman, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{there are such}} things as heirs there are also such things as executors!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I feel so, Colonel; and it {{is really}} a {{pleasure}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> one does go down, a thoroughly good fellow will benefit by it, instead of some unknown person who might be a very objectionable representative of the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I view {{you almost}} as a son," [...] he said; [...] "and it is terrible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you win in the battle, my patron Caius and my countrymen will be destroyed, while if they win, you may fall." ...|$|E
60|$|Marguerite shuddered. She {{felt that}} from this man she could expect no mercy. All-powerful, {{he held the}} beloved life {{in the hollow of}} his hand. She knew him too well not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> he failed in gaining his own ends, he would be pitiless.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, never;" [...] {{answered}} David, the old chain-bearer already mentioned; [...] "my business {{never having}} brought me out so far east.--A black oak, with corner blazes on it, and its top {{broken down by}} the wind, and standing atween three chestnuts, howsomedever, can be nothing so very hard to find, for a person that's the least acquainted.
