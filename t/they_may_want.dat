500|$|Olympus convened an {{extraordinary}} shareholders' meeting for 20 April 2012 {{to vote on}} its proposal for the new board and to approve the restated accounts. The board slate consisted of 11 candidates, the majority of whom were [...] "completely independent" [...] of Olympus. The company controversially [...] sought to promote its executive officer, Hiroyuki Sasa, to president; its candidate for chairman was Yasuyuki Kimoto, a former senior executive of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. – the largest creditor of Olympus. Another proposed director is Hideaki Fujizuka, formerly with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. While the company argued the candidates were well-qualified, a shareholder advisory firm urged investors to vote down the proposed president citing his lack of experience as a corporate manager of a turnaround situation; it also {{expressed concern that the}} ex-bankers may put banks' interests ahead of shareholders'. ISS also recommended shareholders not to approve the accounts on grounds that it could undermine any legal recourse <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> to pursue in future. Foreign shareholders oppose the nominations, citing [...] "undue influence" [...] of the creditor banks.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is clearly {{one of the best}} shows on television right now. I just think <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> to lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E

After 15 minutes, gently comb out the flakes with a fine tooth comb or brush. Be sure to wash out all of the oil to avoid making the cradle cap worse.|$|E
2500|$|Public {{attention}} to the pepper-sprayings resulted in a spike of news media coverage, a pattern {{that was to be}} repeated in the coming weeks following confrontations with police. Clyde Haberman, writing in The New York Times, said that [...] "If the Occupy Wall Street protesters ever choose to recognize a person who gave their cause its biggest boost, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>want</b> to pay tribute to Anthony Bologna," [...] calling the event [...] "vital" [...] for the still nascent movement. On 1 October 2011, protesters set out to march across the Brooklyn Bridge. The New York Times reported that more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across. Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, [...] "The cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway." [...] A spokesman for the New York Police Department, Paul Browne, said that protesters were given multiple warnings to stay on the sidewalk and not block the street, and were arrested when they refused.|$|E

40|$|Acquiring and {{modeling}} knowledge effectively {{can be the}} most time-consuming portion of the knowledge engineering process. Little methodology is practiced beyond unstructured interviewing. Automated methods are, for the most part, still in the research stage. Several well-known factors contribute to interviewing problems: o Plausible lines of reasoning can {{have little to do with}} actual problem-solving. o Academic (novice) knowledge is often obtained in place of compiled (expert) knowledge. o Experts <b>may</b> be insecure. <b>They</b> could be afraid of losing their jobs; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not <b>want</b> computers encroaching on their "private domain; " <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not <b>want</b> to expose their problem-solving methods to the scrutiny of colleagues or of the general public. o Interpersonal interviewing problems can result when knowledge engineers are not trained in interviewing techniques. o There are inherent problems in introspection. o Protocol analysis (discussed below) is labor intensive, error-prone, and results in a series of random behavior samples that must be synthesized by the knowledge engineer.
