It is debatable as to whether the intentions of the testator should be taken into account; in Re Steed's Will Trusts [...] 1 All ER the courts refused to alter a trust document, partially due to the testator's wishes; in Re Remnant's Settlement Trusts [...] 2 All ER 554, however, the court took the opposite view.|$|E
500|$|Chapter five {{assesses the}} {{relationship}} between animals and communitarianism. Communitarians criticise liberalism's focus on a state which does not interfere with individuals, instead favouring a political order which takes a stand on moral concerns, drawing from the shared moral values of a given society. Cochrane initially argues that communitarianism, using British society as an example, {{can be used to}} expand justice to animals. He devotes the remainder of the chapter to four arguments against this line of thought. First, communitarianism is particularist; that is, the principles it expounds are wholly contingent on the values in the particular society. Second, there are difficulties inherent in finding [...] "authentic" [...] values within a given society. Third, societies often favour some animals over others, leaving unfavoured animals vulnerable. Fourth, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whose values within a society matter: states often contain multiple communities with very different attitudes to animals. Consideration of this fourth question involves analysis of multiculturalism.|$|E

Shorey's {{review of}} the initial seven reel Broadway release {{declared}} it another masterpiece of Mack's writing and notes that the film {{would be the best}} example to go before the courts to argue for [...] "free speech" [...] in films. Shorey notes that the propaganda film [...] "is bold, clear, tremendous in the force of its convincing showing that to drive the scarlet woman from a restricted district into the hotels and apartment houses of a city is a worse crime than it seeks to cure." [...] The only complaint was found that it [...] "does not sufficiently misrepresent the ease and luxury of the underworld. It shows a scarlet woman who finds the [...] "easiest way" [...] truly easy. She does not die, nor even suffer. The intended moral of the picture, that once abandoned to that life a woman finds it to her taste to remain in it and cannot be [...] "reformed," [...] necessarily does include the above corollary to that proposition." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film [...] "deals with a question that has perplexed the sages from the beginning of time and it traverses life's scroll, writing with thought and deed certain actions of everyday application.

2500|$|Besides the {{argument}} {{over whether the}} returns on Social Security contributions should or {{can be compared to}} returns on private investment instruments, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether the contributions are nonetheless analogous to pooled insurance premiums charged by for-profit commercial insurance companies to maintain and generate a return on a [...] "risk pool of funds". Like any insurance program, Social Security [...] "spreads risk" [...] as the program protects workers and covered family members against loss of income from the wage earner's retirement, disability, or death. For example, a worker who becomes disabled at a young age could receive a large return relative to the amount they contributed in FICA before becoming disabled, since disability benefits can continue for life. As in private insurance plans, everyone in the particular insurance pool is insured against the same risks, but not everyone will benefit to the same extent.|$|E

Furthermore, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of Edward's sexuality in a period when homosexuality of any sort was considered a very serious crime, but there is no direct evidence of his sexual orientation.

Nonetheless, Isabella bore four children by Edward, leading to an opinion amongst some historians that Edward's affairs with his male favourites may have been platonic.|$|E

In the centre of Józef Sebastian Pelczar’s concept <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of <b>the</b> role of evangelical mysteries of the life of Christ, the problem of the cooperation between man and God’s grace and, finally, the need to change one’s life following the pattern of Jesus.
