25|$|Crittenden {{proposes that}} {{both kinds of}} {{information}} can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized {{to be based on}} reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond' Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since <b>they</b> <b>trust</b> that their needs and communications will be heeded.|$|E

The focus of the film is on trafficking victims, especially women and children, the latter of whom are often betrayed by adults that <b>they</b> <b>trust.</b> The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking, including members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Free the Slaves, Girls Educational and Mentoring Services (GEMS), International Justice Mission (IJM), the Somaly Mam Foundation, Terre des hommes, Tostan, UNICEF, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the United States Department of State (US DoS).

2500|$|Also, players cannot select {{members of}} their own team.

Rather than a popularity contest or the staleness of players selecting only their own, LCBL voters must put some thought into the ballot. Receiving a peer vote is the ultimate sign of respect; a non-teammate selection recognizes a rival's talent enough to count on him to win the game.

2500|$|Marketers target {{influential}} {{people on}} social media who are recognised as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their target audiences and amplify {{the impact of their}} message. A social media post by an opinion leader can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or [...] "liking" [...] of the post) than a social media post by a regular user. Marketers have come to the understanding that [...] "consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals" [...] who <b>they</b> <b>trust</b> (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p.216). The reason the opinion leader or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's are people who have a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because <b>they</b> <b>trust</b> the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). The adjusted communication model shows the use of using opinion leaders and opinion formers. The sender/source gives the message to many, many OL's/OF's who pass the message on along with their personal opinion, the receiver (followers/groups) form their own opinion and send their personal message to their group (friends, family etc.) [...] (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p.39).|$|E
2500|$|NPC AI is {{determined}} {{primarily by the}} [...] "Fear/trust system". The trust system determines whether the NPCs will follow Blake's orders and join him in combat. To do so, the player must ensure the NPC trusts Blake, and does not suspect him of being a Thing. NPCs have four levels of trust; red, amber, green and 100%. Red means they are convinced Blake is a Thing and will attack him. Amber means they are {{not sure if he}} is a Thing, and although they won't attack him, they won't follow his orders. Green means <b>they</b> <b>trust</b> him and will follow his orders. 100% means they have complete faith in him, will follow his orders, and even if he attacks another NPC, they will support him. To gain the trust of NPCs, Blake can give them weapons and ammo, heal them, put himself at risk to protect them, or use a blood test kit on himself to prove he is not a Thing. Actions which deplete trust include accidentally shooting teammates, taking away teammate's weapons or ammo, or pointing a weapon at them for a sustained period of time to force them to do something.|$|E
