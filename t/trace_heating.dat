40|$|A non-conventional type {{of heating}} system is being tested at Sandia National Laboratories for solar thermal power tower applications. In this system, called {{impedance}} heating, electric current flows directly through the pipe to maintain the desired temperature. The pipe becomes the resistor where the heat is generated. Impedance heating has many advantages over previously used mineral insulated (MI) <b>heat</b> <b>trace.</b> An impedance <b>heating</b> system should be much more reliable than <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> cable since delicate junctions and cabling are not used and the main component, a transformer, is inherently reliable. A big advantage of impedance heating is the system can be sized to rapidly heat up the piping to provide rapid response times necessary in cyclic power plants such as solar power towers. In this paper, experimental results from testing an impedance heating system are compared to MI cable <b>heat</b> <b>trace.</b> We found impedance heating was able to heat piping rapidly and effectively.

We also demonstrate that the more precise asymptotic behavior of the remainder is determined by and conversely distinguishes higher (Sobolev) regularity on the potential or weight function. In the case of a smooth weight function, we determine the full asymptotic expansion of the <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> for the drifting Laplacian for small times. We then use the <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> to study the asymptotics of the eigenvalue counting function.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of noncommutative geometry the singular (Dixmier) traces, originally introduced by J. Dixmier in 1966, have become an indispensable tool. These traces are defined via dilation invariant extended limits on the space of bounded measurable functions. Important results in noncommutative geometry (e. g. Connes Character Theorem, relation between Dixmier <b>traces,</b> <b>heat</b> functionals and zeta-function residues) are proved under various additional conditions on these extended limits. Every such condition distinguishes a subclass of Dixmier traces. The present thesis studies the relation between these classes and an important concept of measurable operators (with respect to these subclasses) introduced in noncommutative geometry by A. Connes in 1988. In most cases we provide new characterisations of measurability and definitive description of classes of measurable operators...|$|R

40|$|In {{multiple}} family dwellings {{of central}} Europe heat pumps {{are not only}} used for space heating but also increasingly for domestic hot water (dhw) supply. The water is often heated in a centralized or decentralized installation with a large distribution network. This leads to the combination of heat pumps with various <b>trace</b> <b>heating</b> systems to ensure both comfort and protection from legionella disease. The COP of the heat pump can be greatly affected by {{the choice of the}} heat tracing system which influences the overall efficiency (OE) of the domestic hot water supply system significantly. In this study several heat storage and heat tracing methods were coupled with heat pumps as the main heat source. The investigated installations feature either a recirculation loop or some kind of electrical <b>trace</b> <b>heating.</b> Focused on multiple family dwellings the energy consumption of the overall system including hot water supply system and water heating system is analyzed. A physics based model for four different systems was built and applied to several virtual building complexes sized from 8 to 192 apartments. After the validation of the model (using data from three different field measurements) each system was simulated for a week of domestic hot water consumption. In order to compare the systems the overall efficiency was evaluated using the amount of energy provided by hot water at the distributed tap devices in relation to the electrical power consumption of the complete installation. In general dhw supply systems using heat pumps can reach good performances especially when the dhw storage tank is kept unmixed. Installations featuring an externally reheated recirculation loop (using a dedicated heat pump) therefore show the best performances. Without this external reheating the overall efficiency is reduced by about 5 % in the best case. Installations using electric heating cables are showing a performance reduction of about 10 % compared to the optimized system. Installations using a central heat pump to increase the temperature of the overall heating system, which in turn is used to load decentral dhw-storage tanks, are consuming at least twice the amount of electrical energy compared to the other investigated systems...|$|E
