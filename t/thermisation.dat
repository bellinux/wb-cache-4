50|$|Thermization, also spelled <b>thermisation,</b> is {{a method}} of {{sanitizing}} raw milk with low heat. It is useful for partial removing of pathogens, while keeping the good bacteria flora in. The process is not used on other food products, and is similar to pasteurization but uses lower temperatures, allowing the milk product to retain more of its original taste. In Europe, there is a distinction between cheeses made of thermized milk and raw-milk cheeses. However, the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) places the same regulations on all unpasteurized cheeses. As a result, cheeses from thermized milk must be aged for 60 days or more before being sold in the United States, the same restriction placed on raw-milk cheeses by the FDA.|$|E
40|$|Model samples {{kashkaval}} cheese {{were made by}} the microwave processing of cow's milk in <b>thermisation</b> mode (62 - 67 °C) and direct microwave treatment of cheddared curd with subsequent dry salting. Control cheese samples were produced by the conventional approach with classical <b>thermisation</b> (62 - 67 °C) of cow's milk and classic hot brining in brine solution (72 - 74 °C, 14 %NaCl). Samples were placed in ripening conditions (8 - 10 °C). The changes of microbiological and proteolytic profile on the 5 th, 15 th, 30 th and 45 th day of ripening were studied. Higher survival levels of the starter culture responsible for ripening were established in {{kashkaval cheese}} produced by microwave treatment in comparison with classical cheese. It was found that the higher cell concentration of the starter culture leads to active and accelerate process of proteolysis with production of free amino acids in concentrations significantly exceeding the obtained in the classical cheese: 490, 10 ± 2, 10 mg 100 g- 1 (microwave kashkaval cheese) versus 216, 50 ± 2, 00 mg 100 g- 1 (classical kashkaval cheese) ...|$|E
40|$|Traditional and novel {{approaches}} for {{the calculation of}} the heat treatment efficiency are compared in this work. The Mild Heat value (MH-value), an alternative approach to the commonly used sterilisation, pasteurisation and cook value (F, P, C–value), is calculated to estimate the efficiency of a mild heat process. MH-value is {{the time needed to}} achieve a predefined microbial reduction at a reference temperature and a known thermal resistant constant, z, for log-linear or specific types of non log-linear microbial inactivation kinetics. An illustrative example is given in which microbial inactivation data of Listeria innocua CLIP 20 - 595 are used for estimating the inactivation parameters under isothermal conditions of 58, 60, 63 and 66 oC by the use of the log-linear and the Geeraerd et al., (2000) model. Thereafter, dynamic temperature profiles (targeting at 54 and 57 C) representing milk <b>thermisation</b> are exploited for illustrating the application of MH-value. Finally, the equivalent holding times of different temperatures are calculated taking into account the observed non-linearity...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate, {{identify}} and select, with respect to acidification and proteolytic activities, the autochthonous mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) present in milk and Caciotta della Garfagnana, a cheese produced either with raw or thermised cow’s milk in small dairies and family plants of Garfagnana (Tuscany), to obtain LAB strains with attributes suitable to be employed as starter cultures in this type of cheese, particularly when thermised milk is used to control spoilage microflora. Samples of raw milk, curd and cheese were collected from three representative farmers of the production area and used to isolate autochthonous LAB. Phenotypic and genotypic (species-specific PCR assay) identification of isolated LAB was done. Twenty-eight strains of LAB isolated from milk, curd and cheese were screened for acidifying and proteolytic activities. LAB strains with the better attributes were used as mesophilic starter cultures in technological trials: experimental cheeses manufactured with the addition of autochthonous LAB and control cheeses were compared for LAB and pH evolution. Experimental cheeses presented a significant increase in the mesophilic lactic acid microflora up to 14 days of ripening and significantly lower pH values up to seven days of ripening. The use of wild selected mesophilic lactic acid bacteria, together with <b>thermisation</b> of milk, for the Caciotta della Garfagnana looks very promising and could help to both standardise the production and improve quality and traditional characteristics of this type of chees...|$|E
40|$|In our {{experiments}} the fermentation of lactose at Camembert type cheese by {{classic and}} stabilised technology was monitored. In {{each of the}} two technologies two experiments were made. The difference between these two technologies is in pH level, which drops below 5 by classic technology and remains above 5 by stabilised technology at all times. To achieve the criteria of stabilised technology the fermentation was stopped at a desired level of pH, by dropping the cheese in brine at 14 °C. After salting and moulding cheesewas transferred from the first three experiments into a ripening chamber at 11 °C. With the last experiment (stabilised technology) the cheese ripened for 3 days at 5 °C. During ripening process pH dropped below 5 in all experiments. The process of fermentation was performed by the following lactic acid bacteria: Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. As these lactic acid bacteria ferment differently D-galactose during manufacture and ripening process, the contentof lactose and D-galactose was measured. Based on the results of our research the following conclusion can be made: the action of lactic acid bacteria can not be stropped even at 5 °C. The native microflora, which remains in the milk after <b>thermisation,</b> might be responsible for the fermentation of Dgalactose. It could be possible that the Streptococcus thermophilus enzymes were not inactivated, causing continuation of lactose fermentation even at low temperature. Mesophilic lactococci were inhibited and for that reason Dgalactose accumulated in cheese. Only after cheese were transferred into a ripening chamber at 11 °C and with low lactose concentration in medium left, mesophilic lactococci started to ferment D-galactose...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundInfection {{pathways}} of S. aureus udder {{infections in}} heifers {{are still not}} well understood. One hypothesis is that calves become infected with S. aureus via feeding mastitis milk. Especially on small-scale farms, pasteurisers are not economic. The purpose of this randomised comparative {{study was to investigate}} the influence of feeding milk containing S. aureus genotype B (SAGTB) on the health and development of calves and udder health of the respective heifers. Additionally, a method reducing the bacterial load to obtain safer feeding milk was tested. Thirty-four calves were fed mastitis milk from cows with subclinical SAGTB mastitis. One group was fed untreated milk (UMG). For the other group, milk was thermised at 61 °C for one minute (heat treated milk group¿=¿HMG). After weaning, calves were followed up until first calving. A milk sample of these heifers was taken at first milking to compare udder health of both groups. ResultsThermisation of milk led to an effective reduction of S. aureus in the feeding milk. 78 % of the analysed pools were free of S. aureus, a reduction of at least one log was obtained in the other pools. Quarter milk samples revealed that two heifers had a S. aureus intramammary infection, but caused by a genotype different from genotype B. During the suckling period, the UMG had a significantly higher incidence rate of 1. 09 diarrhoea cases per 100 calf days at risk compared to 0. 26 cases per 100 calf days in the HMG (p¿<¿ 0. 05). ConclusionsUnder the conditions of this study, no effects of feeding milk containing SAGTB on udder health after first calving were observed. But a power analysis indicated that the sample size in the current setup is insufficient to allow for assessment on mastitis risk after SAGTB exposition, as a minimal number of 4 calves infected (vs. 0 in the HMG) would have shown significant effects. High bacterial load, however, was associated with an increased incidence rate of diarrhoea. Thus, <b>thermisation</b> as a minimal preventive measure before feeding mastitis milk to calves might be beneficial for maintaining calf health...|$|E

Presence of spoilage {{bacteria in}} milk can cause defects {{in the milk}} and shorten it is shelf life. Therefore it is important, both for the dairy industries {{point of view and}} for the con- sumer, to keep the bacteria count low. The purpose of this literature review is to compile part of the literature about spoilage bacteria, common spoilage flora in milk, what problem they cause and how they can be prevented. In this review the psychrotrophic and thermo resistant bacteria are discussed. The spoilage bacteria can enter the milk in any stage of the milk processing: at the farm or at the dairy industry. Thermo resistant bacteria can cause problem in the pasteurized milk since they survive the heat treatment that is applied at the dairy plant. Bacillus for example, are spore formers and therefore survive pasteurization. The spores are activated by the heat treatment and since some strains of Bacillus also can grow in low temperature they can be present and grow in pasteurized milk. Other psychrotrophic, cold tolerant, bac- teria however does not survive pasteurization. Even though the bacteria are killed in the pasteurization, they can produce heat resistant enzymes that can spoil the pasteurized milk. Pseudomonas for example has these properties. The enzymes that are produced can cause lipolysis or proteolysis of the fat and proteins, respectively. The peptides and fatty acids that are released in the process can cause putrid respectively rancid off-flavour. They can also alter the milk composition which may decrease the yield in cheese making. Different techniques can be used to prevent and decrease the amount of spoilage bacteria in milk. <b>Thermisation</b> (60 - 65 oC, 10 s) can kill psycrothrophs at the farm before they start to produce enzymes. The endospores are activated by the heat treatment and can then be killed in the pasteurization step. By lowering the storage temperature of the milk and change the gas composition in the tank, the keeping time of the milk can increase. Bactofugation and microfiltration is other alternative {{that can be used to}} separate endo- spores and bacteria from milk. By combining these strategies and keep a good hygiene at the farm and at the dairy plant, the bacteria amount in the milk can decrease and the keep- ing time can be prolonged...|$|E
