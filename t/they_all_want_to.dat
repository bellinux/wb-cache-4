25|$|Almost {{everyone}} I've {{talked to}} says, 'We're gonna move to Houston.' What I'm hearing, {{which is sort}} of scary, is <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stay in Texas... Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, and so many {{of the people in the}} arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this (as she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.|$|E
500|$|Producer John Lloyd, {{speaking}} to The Times in 1989 hinted {{that it was}} the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: [...] "Things do get very tense by the end of a series, because everyone involved in the thing is very clever, and very funny, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> push the scripts along. It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one. But then you start to think how rare it is to get so many good people in the same room and you talk yourself into doing another series." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1964 season, Timberlake {{was awarded}} the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference. [...] He placed fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting (losing to Notre Dame's John Huarte), and was also named to {{multiple}} All-American teams. [...] After attending an All-American dinner at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Timberlake reported, [...] "There {{is a great deal of}} loneliness in being an All-America[...] [...] [...] I get sick of it. [...] <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> shake your hand, but they don't really know you. [...] All they do is stick out the glad hand. [...] I don't mind talking to anyone who is interested in ideas, but nothing makes me sicker than having my name dropped by people who don't know anything about me except that I'm an All-America." [...] He joked that he might write an autobiography called, [...] "The Loneliness of an All-America." [...] He was also an A-minus student majoring in sociology, was named a scholar-athlete by National Football Association, and was placed on the Big Ten All-Academic team two years in a row.|$|E

60|$|That {{relieved}} {{the tension}} and everybody laughed. Thursday released Hetty and shook Uncle John's hand most gratefully. Then <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> shake hands, and did until it came to Fogerty's turn. But now Smith drew back and looked askance at the detective.|$|R
2500|$|To Nimoy's surprise, Spock {{became a}} sex symbol; Isaac Asimov {{described}} the character as [...] "a security blanket with sexual overtones", and Nimoy reported that [...] "I've never had more female {{attention on a}} set before. And get this: <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> touch the ears!" [...] (When a young woman asked [...] "Are you aware {{that you are the}} source of erotic dream material for thousands and thousands of ladies around the world?", he replied [...] "May all your dreams come true".) Nimoy speculated that Spock appealed to women because ...|$|E
2500|$|Susan Griffin {{was one of}} {{the first}} feminists to write on pornography's {{implications}} in her 1981 Pornography and Silence. Beyond Brownmiller and Griffin's positions, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin influenced debates and activism around pornography and prostitution, particularly at the Supreme Court of Canada. MacKinnon, a lawyer, has stated, [...] "To be about to be raped is to be gender female in the process of going about life as usual." [...] She explained sexual harassment by saying that it [...] "doesn't mean that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fuck us, they just want to hurt us, dominate us, and control us, and that is fucking us." [...] Some see radical feminism as the only movement that truly expresses the pain of being a woman in an unequal society, as it portrays that reality with the experiences of the battered and violated, which they claim to be the norm. Critics, including some feminists, civil libertarians, and jurists, have found this position uncomfortable and alienating.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the success}} of rock in Australia is {{attributed}} to the non-commercial Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio station Triple J, which focuses heavily on Australian alternative music, and has done so since its formation as 2JJ in 1975. Throughout the station's history, they have helped jump start the careers of numerous bands, through programs such as Unearthed, the Australian Music program Home & Hosed and the Hottest 100. The Big Day Out festival has showcased Australian and international acts, with line-ups spanning multiple genres, with an alternative focus. It has become highly popular amongst musicians; Foo Fighters lead singer Dave Grohl said [...] "We play the Big Day Out because it's the best tour in the world. You ask any band in the world – <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play the Big Day Out, every single one of them." [...] Other festivals, such as Homebake, Livid, and Splendour in the Grass, are also rock focused, and together with Big Day Out are [...] "united by the dominant presence of the indie-guitar scene".|$|E

50|$|In an {{interview}} by Pam Pastor of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, all the coaches expressed that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{come back for}} the second season. In an article published by Sun Star Manila on March 20, 2014, all coaches will return in the second season.|$|R
60|$|Few {{points in}} this episode {{struck me as}} more {{remarkable}} than the similarity of taste which prevailed, as concerned myself, {{among the members of}} Mr MacGinnis's gang. Men, doubtless of varying opinions on other subjects, on this one point they were unanimous. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> assault me.|$|R

50|$|The young {{students}} discarded {{what they called}} “parent words.” They also discussed how they liked stories where they could “escape to imaginary places that were safe.” They also wanted characters “who they could be friends with.” No matter {{where in the world}} the children came from <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> believe in Santa Claus.|$|R

"Yes, I know that; but you who {{had fought}} before should have known well enough that, {{as long as you}} kept together, you could have beaten them off; and they would have been glad enough to have given up the pursuit, at last.

5000|$|In November 2007, Layzie Bone {{confirmed}} {{that he had}} completed the Bone Brothers III album with Bizzy Bone, spurring speculation about a full Bone reunion. In a video interview, Krayzie Bone stated that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> reunite but that record label issues might prevent an official reunion. Bizzy Bone had attended a Bone Thugs performance during that time, and he and the three then-active members had a [...] "good conversation".|$|R
60|$|They was homeward bound on a steamer from Melbourne {{when they}} made their minds up; and Isaac Lunn, the oldest fireman aboard--a very steady old teetotaler--gave {{them a lot of}} good advice about it. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> rejoin the ship when she sailed agin, and 'e offered to take a room ashore with them and mind their money, giving 'em what 'e called a {{moderate}} amount each day.|$|R
50|$|As for Richter;After {{it became}} clear the picture was a failure, {{the most amazing thing}} happened: I got more job offers than ever before in my life. People seemed so mad at Peter that they were eager to make excuses for me and help me out.

No--she needn't--and she shan't--and I won't be a slave in my own house--and I won't be starved and choked with poison. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> kill me--all--all"--and with this the lonely old woman burst into a scream of hysterical tears.|$|E

50|$|Initially Masembe-Kabali {{tried to}} base his efforts at {{establishing}} the Conservative party on alliances between the then existing small political parties but soon realised {{this could not}} work. The professional politicians were dogged by two disadvantages. Not only was their loyalty to the Kabaka in question------but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be leaders rather than followers. Masembe-Kabali soon realised that the various political groupings {{he was working with}} were incapable of uniting or winning the support of Buganda.|$|R

6000|$|CUTHBERTSON (vehemently). It's not ignorance or superstition, Paramore: it's sheer downright Ibsenism: that's what it is.

I couldn't go and plump myself down on a seat beside her: {{goodness}} knows what she'd think I wanted. That's one of the delights of having women in the club: when they come in here <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sit at the fire and adore that bust.

60|$|All {{the peasants}} {{have a passion}} for a high-road. They want their land opening out, opening out. They seem to hate the ancient Italian remoteness. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to get out}} at a moment's notice, to get away--quick, quick. A village which is two miles off the high-road, even if it is perched like a hawk's nest on a peak, still chafes and chafes for the great road to come to it, chafes and chafes for the daily motor-bus {{connection}} with the railway. There is no placidity, no rest in the heart of the land. There is a fever of restless irritation all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{fear that}} <b>they</b> won't <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to,</b> {{especially}} Stuffy," [...] and Mrs. Bhaer's eyes twinkled {{more than ever}} as she patted a queer knobby bundle in her lap.|$|R
50|$|During the Thirty Years' War, Swedes, Hessians, Lüneburg {{troops and}} Imperial forces passed through Nordhorn {{on the old}} Flemish army and trade road. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> feed on the scanty crop yields. The harried town, however, was left hardly any time {{to recover from the}} war's ravages. Only a few years later, the warlike Bishop Christoph Bernhard Count of Galen from Münster waged a war against the Dutch on the plains outside Nordhorn, which was brought to an end in 1666 by the Peace of Nordhorn.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} inspired, in part, by Diamond's own {{experiences}} {{as a child in}} Waskaganish, Quebec, where he and other Native children would play cowboys and Indians after local screenings of Westerns in their remote community. Diamond remembers that although the children were Indians, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be cowboys. When Diamond was older, he would be questioned by non-Native people about whether his people lived in teepees and rode horses, causing him to realize that their preconceptions about Native people were also derived from movies.|$|R
