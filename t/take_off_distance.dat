[...] The aircraft was later developed into the ICA IS-24, chiefly by replacing the radial engine {{with a flat}} 6-cylinder Lycoming, reducing the cabin glazing and lowering and widening the undercarriage.|$|R
40|$|Complex gait (e. g. {{obstacle}} avoidance) {{requires a}} higher cognitive load than simple steady state gait, {{which is a}} more automated movement. The higher levels of the central nervous system, responsible for adjusting motor plans to complex gait, develop throughout childhood into adulthood. Therefore, we hypothesize that gait strategies in complex gait are likely to mature until adulthood as well. However, {{little is known about}} the maturation of complex gait from childhood into adolescence and adulthood. To address this issue, we investigated obstacle avoidance in forty-four 8 to 18 years old participants who walked at preferred speed along a 6 meter walkway on which a planar obstacle (150 % of step length, 1 meter wide) was projected. Participants avoided the obstacle by stepping over this projection, while lower body kinematics were recorded. Results showed that step length and speed adjustments during successful obstacle avoidance were similar across all ages even though younger children modified step width to a greater extent. Additionally, the younger children used larger maximal toe elevations and <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>distances</b> than older children. Moreover, during unsuccessful trials, younger children deployed exaggerated <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>distances,</b> which resulted in obstacle contact upon the consecutive heel strike. These results indicate that obstacle avoidance is not fully matured in younger children and that the inability to plan precise foot placements is an important factor contributing to failures in obstacle avoidance. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|The first Higgins {{airborne}} lifeboat used in {{an emergency}} was dropped on March 31, 1945, in the North Sea, some [...] offshore of the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog. In the evening of March 30, a PBY Catalina landed in six-foot (2 m) swells to save the pilot of a downed P-51 Mustang, {{but one of the}} Catalina's engines lost its oil in the process, rendering the flying boat unable to <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> Darkness, <b>distance,</b> and poor visibility prevented the Catalina men from making contact with the Mustang pilot who drifted in a raft and was eventually taken prisoner of war. The next morning, a Vickers Warwick located the Catalina and dropped a Fox-designed airborne lifeboat nearby, but after being retrieved the lifeboat began to break up from repeatedly smashing against the Catalina in the increasingly heavy seas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{airport is}} {{equipped}} to handle VFR (Visual Flight Rules) traffic and is situated on the southern border of the TMA Čáslav Military Airport. During the take-off one should respect {{the fact that the}} runway 15 is slightly uphill and the <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>distance</b> increases, landing the opposite way [...] "downhill" [...] on RWY 33 increases the landing distance of the arriving aircraft. Throughout the year the wind blows in perpendicular direction to the RWY's. Sometimes with light SE winds RWY 33 (down hill) is used. In such case aircraft take off with light tail wind and land on opposite RWY 15 with headwind. During the spring and summer gliding season the airfield host many sailplanes, therefore the traffic becomes quite dense.|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} numbers of Police forces using drones for crime scene surveillance, {{the effect of the}} drones on trace evidence present needs evaluation. In this investigation the effect of flying a quadcopter drone at different heights over a controlled scene and taking off at different distances from the scene were measured. Yarn was placed on a range of floor surfaces and the number lost or moved from their original position was recorded. It was possible to estimate "safe" distances above and <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>distance</b> from the bath mat (2. m and 1. m respectively), and carpet tile (3. m and 1. m) which were the roughest surfaces. The maximum distances tested of 5. m above and 2. m from was not far enough to prevent significant disturbance with the other floor surfaces.

Tagliani began to fall back from the top four drivers as the pace quickened. Gidley continued to stalk Wilson for several laps, making unsuccessful moves for the lead going into Turn 1.

Some L-3s were shipped to north Africa, and subsequently given to the Free French Forces in the area at the time. At least one of the aircraft served with US forces in Italy.And minimally one other did service in Normandy, as reported by the Detroit Free Press on 25 June 1944, with a photograph indicating transport of medical supplies to the advancing front-line regiments.|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has {{standard}} times, power settings and velocities for LTO cycles. Those parameters do not contemplate aircraft type, engine, airport configuration and specific operation conditions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to make a comparison among those parameters in ten different and significant airports around the European Union, to develop an alternative to the ICAO standards. The variation of parameters is related to different operational times and fuel consumption, and as a consequence different amounts of emissions are produced: unburned hydrocarbons (HC), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO 2), inter alia. The difference between <b>take</b> <b>off</b> times, velocities, <b>distances</b> and power settings, and the standards values make the development of indicators feasible, which is the main goal of this study. Equivalent aircraft mixes and different operative scenarios were used in each airport, emphasizing the minimum and maximum conditions in “Taxi In” and “Taxi Out” situations. From the comparison, differences between the standard parameters and issues related to the operative strategy in each airport were observed...|$|R
5000|$|Frustrated, the fox tries {{one last}} ditch effort {{to capture the}} duck, who's flying just out of his reach. Using many boards and nails, he creates himself a crude wooden bridge to reach him, though the duck outsmarts him yet again by almost-completely sawing off {{the part of the}} tree the boards were {{attached}} to, leaving it on the verge of collapsing should even the slightest bit of movement be had... and as luck would have it, the bridge is balanced dangerously over a rather large ravine. Though he's frightened, the fox still persists on capturing the duck, who then lets loose one of his feathers onto the wooden bridge... which the extra weight proves to be just enough to cause it to collapse, along with the fox, who falls to his death. Satisfied, the duck starts to fly away, but he's stopped by the angel spirit of the now-dead fox. Panicked that the fox now has the ability to fly with his newly-gained angel wings, the duck quickly <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> into the <b>distance</b> with the fox following closely behind.|$|R
