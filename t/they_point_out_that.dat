5|$|In a 2009 {{review of}} the genus Gyromitra, authors van Vooren and Moreau say that Bosc's {{original}} species description is ambiguous, leaving much room for interpretation, and they suggest that several reports of the species occurring in Europe should be referred to Gyromitra fastigiata. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> in 1970, Estonian mycologist Ain Raitviir considered Bosc's Morchella caroliniana a nomen dubium, and Fries's description as nomen confusum, and advocated the abandonment of the specific epithet caroliniana. In the early 1970s, Kent McKnight redefined the taxon and selected a neotype, based on five specimens collected from Lorton, Virginia in 1942.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E

5|$|Barbara Ketcham Wheaton and Stephen Mennell {{provided}} the definitive arguments against these claims. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Catherine’s father-in-law, King Francis I, and the flower of the French aristocracy had dined {{at some of}} Italy’s most élite tables during the king’s Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during King Charles VIII’s invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de’ Medici’s father to her French-born mother; {{and that she had}} little influence at court until her husband’s death because he was so besotted by his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning Renaissance. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.|$|E
5|$|The First Prussian Uprising was {{influenced}} by three major events. Firstly, the Teutonic Knights lost the Battle of the Ice on Lake Peipus to Alexander Nevsky in April 1242. Secondly, southern Poland was devastated by a Mongol invasion in 1241; Poland lost the Battle of Legnica and the Teutonic Knights lost {{one of its most}} trusted allies that often supplied troops. Thirdly, Duke Swantopolk II of Pomerania was fighting against the Knights, who supported his brothers' dynastic claims against him. It has been implied that the new castles of the Knights were competing with his lands over the trade routes along the Vistula River. While some historians embrace the Swantopolk–Prussian alliance without hesitation, others are more careful. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the historical information came from documents written by the Teutonic Knights and must have been ideologically charged to persuade the Pope to declare a crusade not only against the pagan Prussians but also against the Christian duke.|$|E

There were many Jews in Eastern Europe who spoke German as a primary language and identified with the German nationality prior to the war, and many others spoke German as a second language.

25|$|Operation Barga (and West Bengal's land {{reforms in}} general) {{have been criticized}} for their small scope and {{inability}} to solve all the major problems. This criticism has been mainly due to policies not accounting for the high landmass-population ratio in Bengal (the highest in the country), the small and highly segregated land holding patterns and failure of the Government to develop agri-industrial markets for farm produce. These failures, critics contend, have distributed poverty rather than creating prosperity. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> in spite of these measures, Bengal’s agricultural infrastructure and financial situation is no better than in most other states.|$|E

25|$|Historians, {{constitutional}} {{scholars and}} biographers all dismiss the claim. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Atchison's Senate term had ended on March 4 as well, {{and he also}} was not sworn in for another term, or re-elected President pro tempore, until March 5. Furthermore, the Constitution doesn't require the President-elect to take {{the oath of office}} to hold the office, just to execute the powers. As Atchison never swore the oath either, that did not make him Acting President. Most historians and scholars assert that as soon as the outgoing President's term expires, the President-elect automatically assumes the office. Some claim instead that the office is vacant until the taking of the oath.|$|E

Also, thirteen years elapsed between the first printing and the appearance of the second edition; it seems improbable that Houghton Mifflin would not have reprinted the book (presuming the arrangements with Allen & Unwin permitted). And finally, while the bowing hobbit (first printing) version appears on the market uncommonly, first editions as a whole show up scarcely less often than all the printings of the second edition combined.|$|E
25|$|The {{studies that}} {{conclude}} abuse {{is a bigger}} problem in military families than civilian families attribute this to the long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> military families may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse {{because of the potential}} impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members {{are more likely to be}} ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.|$|E

25|$|From {{the start}} of the war until Germany invaded the Soviet Union less than two years later, Stalin {{supplied}} Hitler with 1.5 million tons of oil, the same quantity of grain, and many thousands of tons of rubber, timber, phosphates, iron, and other valuable metal ores, particularly chromium, manganese, and platinum. At the time of the invasion, Nazi Germany was heavily in debt to the Soviet Union. Russian historians dispute the importance of the Soviet Union's trade with Germany. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> in mid-1941 Germany's oil resources totalled 10 million tons: of these 500,000 were produced in Germany proper, 800,000 by the countries occupied by Germany, and 8,700,000 tons by Germany's European allies, with Romania accounting for the bulk of this amount.|$|E
25|$|In {{following}} years, UEFA made {{it possible}} for nations to forfeit Intertoto places. For example, in 1998, Scotland, San Marino and Moldova forfeited their places, and England, Portugal, and Greece forfeited one of their two, Crystal Palace being the sole English entrant despite finishing bottom of the Premier League. Other clubs have built upon their success in the UI Cup, following it up with great campaigns in the UEFA Cup. Furthermore, UEFA rejected this assertion that the tournament is disruptive. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> in the 2004–05 season, two of the three 2004 Intertoto Cup winners went on to qualify directly for the Champions League, whilst the 3rd one qualified by winning its 3rd qualifying round tie (Schalke and Lille directly, Villarreal by winning their 3rd qualifying round tie).|$|E
25|$|Specialists in Europe's Early Modern {{witchcraft}} beliefs {{view the}} pagan witch-cult theory as pseudohistorical; {{there is an}} academic consensus among experts that those accused and executed as witches during the period were not members of any witch religion, whether pre-Christian or Satanic in nature. Critics highlight that the theory rested on a highly selective use of the evidence from the trials, thereby heavily misrepresenting the events and the actions of both the accused and their accusers. Further, <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it relied on the erroneous assumption that the claims made by accused witches were truthful and not distorted by coercion and torture. They also note that despite claims that the witch-cult was a pre-Christian survival, {{there is no evidence}} of such a pagan witch-cult throughout the intervening Middle Ages.|$|E
