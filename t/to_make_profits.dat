5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to be overly corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, {{it is hard to}} be able to publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E
5|$|Started in 1743 and {{originally}} {{known as}} Temple Park, Castle Park is located {{to the south}} of the castle. Its original name derived from the Knights Templar, who used to own a manor in Warwick. Houses {{around the perimeter of the}} park were demolished and the land they stood on incorporated into the park. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> from the park in the late 18th century included leasing it for grazing, growing wheat, and keeping sheep.|$|E
5|$|The United Fruit Company {{had been}} formed in 1899 by {{the merger of}} two large American corporations. The new company had major {{holdings}} of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. In 1900 it was already the world's largest exporter of bananas. By 1930 it had an operating capital of 215 million US dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Under Manuel Estrada Cabrera and other Guatemalan presidents, the company obtained a series of concessions {{in the country that}} allowed it to massively expand its business. These concessions frequently came at the cost of tax revenue for the Guatemalan government. The company supported Jorge Ubico in the leadership struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932, and upon assuming power, Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it. This new contract was immensely favorable to the company. It included a 99-year lease to massive tracts of land, exemptions from virtually all taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Under Ubico, the company paid virtually no taxes, which hurt the Guatemalan government's ability to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Ubico asked the company to pay its workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic ocean, allowing the company <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> from the flow of goods through the port. By 1950, the company's annual profits were 65 million US dollars, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government.|$|E

25|$|The case {{stemmed from}} {{multiple}} referrals to FERC from market monitors in 2011 and 2012 regarding JPMVEC's bidding practices. FERC investigators determined that JPMVEC engaged in 12 manipulative bidding strategies designed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> from power plants that were usually {{out of the}} money in the marketplace. In each of them, the company made bids designed to create artificial conditions that forced California and Midcontinent Independent System Operators (ISOs) to pay JPMVEC outside the market at premium rates.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, it was {{announced}} that the Thorp reprocessing plant would be closed in 2010 (later extended to 2018 to allow completion of agreed contracts). Originally predicted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> for BNFL of £500m, by 2003 it had made losses of over £1bn. Subsequently, Thorp was closed for almost two years from 2005, after a leak had been undetected for 9 months. Production eventually restarted at the plant in early 2008; but almost immediately had to be put on hold again, for an underwater lift that takes the fuel for reprocessing to be repaired.|$|E
500|$|Tourism {{developers}} have marketed Tana Toraja as an exotic adventure—an area rich in culture {{and off the}} beaten track. Western tourists expected to see stone-age villages and pagan funerals. Toraja is for tourists who have {{gone as far as}} Bali and are willing {{to see more of the}} wild, [...] "untouched" [...] islands. However, they were more likely to see a Torajan wearing a hat and denim, living in a Christian society. Tourists felt that the tongkonan and other Torajan rituals had been preconceived <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits,</b> and complained that the destination was too commercialised. This has resulted in several clashes between Torajans and tourism developers, whom Torajans see as outsiders.|$|E

500|$|Bessie's {{aggressive}} anti-Toryism {{was frequently}} in evidence {{during her first}} years in parliament, especially when she could attribute to them the economic miseries of her Liverpool constituents. In a Commons debate on 28March 1946 she welcomed the government's decision to close the Liverpool Cotton Association, which she denounced as [...] "the bulwark of the Tory administration in Liverpool", {{nothing more than a}} group of financiers who gambled with the industry in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> for themselves. On 1May 1947 The Manchester Guardian, reporting the chaotic Commons scenes during the divisions following a debate on the nationalisation of the railways, recorded that [...] "Mrs E.M. Braddock... danced a jig as she moved over to the Opposition benches where she occupied the seat usually used by Mr Churchill." [...] When the Bolton Evening News called her performance [...] "nauseating, a sorry degradation of democratic discussion" [...] she sued the newspaper for defamation. She lost the case, and a subsequent appeal was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|By 1950, the United Fruit Company's annual {{profits were}} 65 million U.S. dollars, {{twice as large}} as the revenue of the {{government}} of Guatemala. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic Ocean, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> from the flow of goods through the port. Due to its long association with Ubico's government, Guatemalan revolutionaries saw the UFC as an impediment to progress after 1944. This image was reinforced by the company's discriminatory policies against its workers of color. Due to its size, the reforms of Arévalo's government affected the UFC more than other companies. Among other things, the new labor code allowed UFC workers to strike when their demands for higher wages and job security were not met. The company saw itself as being specifically targeted by the reforms, and refused to negotiate with the numerous sets of strikers, despite frequently being in violation of the new laws. The company's troubles were compounded with the passage of Decree 900 in 1952. Of the [...] that the company owned, only 15 percent was being cultivated; the rest was idle, and thus came under the scope of the agrarian reform law.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reason for}} fraud is over-insurance, when the amount insured {{is greater than}} the actual value of the {{property}} insured. This condition can be very difficult to avoid, especially since an insurance provider might sometimes encourage it in order to obtain greater profits. This allows fraudsters <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> by destroying their property because the payment they receive from their insurers is of greater value than the property they destroy. [...] The most common form of insurance fraud is inflating the value of the loss.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, {{ecological}} economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, {{appeal to}} a different line of reasoning. [...] Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism {{is the best way}} forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by Karl William Kapp explains why the concept of [...] "externality" [...] is a misnomer. In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits.</b> Charles Einsentein has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive As social ecological economist Clive Spash has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system. [...] Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'.|$|E
2500|$|That same year, RKO put {{out another}} {{historically}} notable film made at low cost {{and with an}} only faintly starry cast: the 85-minute-long Split Second comes to a head in a desert ghost town {{about to become a}} nuclear blast site, making it perhaps the first example of an [...] "atomic noir." [...] The most famous such movie, Kiss Me Deadly (1955), independently produced by Victor Saville and his Parklane Pictures company, typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture. Film historian Richard Maltby identifies it as a [...] "programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre's double-bill [...] budgeted at approximately $400,000. [...] distributor, United Artists, released around twenty-five programmers with production budgets between $100,000 and $400,000 in 1955. For UA, these movies served to spread the overhead costs of their distribution operation rather than <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> in themselves." [...] The film's length, 106minutes, is A level, but its star, Ralph Meeker, had previously appeared in only one major film. It is based on an unequivocally pulpy source, one of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels, but is directed in a self-consciously aestheticized fashion by Robert Aldrich. The result is a brutal genre picture that chillingly evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb.|$|E
2500|$|The Corporation of the City of Edinburgh (then {{the formal}} {{name for the}} city council) {{introduced}} a motor bus service in July 1914. This service was short lived, with the buses being requisitioned for wartime use, and services did not resume until after the First World War. In December 1916 the Corporation published a report they commissioned from various tram experts. Having only been tasked {{to report on the}} future of cable-trams regarding potential expansion and alternative methods of traction, it commented on the potential of the motor bus to substitute trams. It concluded that the introduction of motor buses instead of tramcars would incur a total loss of £39,425 per annum, and that the bus only had a future serving thinly populated districts, or acting as a feeder for trams. The report was heavily criticised by Commercial Motor magazine as being wholly one-sided, with fallacious assumptions, seeming to them a deliberate attempt to discredit buses. It recommended the Corporation procure independent advice from people with experience running motor buses at the necessary scale. In contrast to the negativity of the tram experts, bus operator the Scottish Motor Traction Company Ltd was reportedly in good financial health, being able to both [...] "pay the petrol tax and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> in Edinburgh and district." [...] in the same year.|$|E

60|$|Nature's way {{of dealing}} with {{unhealthy}} conditions is unfortunately not one that compels us to conduct a solvent hygiene on a cash basis. She demoralizes us with long credits and reckless overdrafts, and then pulls us up cruelly with catastrophic bankruptcies. Take, for example, common domestic sanitation. A whole city generation may neglect it utterly and scandalously, if not with absolute impunity, yet without any evil consequences that anyone thinks of tracing to it. In a hospital two generations of medical students way tolerate dirt and carelessness, and then go out into general practice to spread the doctrine that fresh air is a fad, and sanitation an imposture set up <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>profits</b> for plumbers. Then suddenly Nature takes her revenge. She strikes at the city with a pestilence and at the hospital with an epidemic of hospital gangrene, slaughtering right and left until the innocent young have paid for the guilty old, and the account is balanced.
