50|$|In {{this type}} of clock, water is run into a {{stationary}} vessel from a tank which is kept meniscus-full meaning that water rises over {{the top edge of}} the tank forming a convex meniscus and excess water is drained away. Since the depth of the water in the supply tank is constant, water is released at a constant rate; the depth of water in the <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel</b> is a measure of time.|$|R
50|$|Most common {{essential}} oils such as lavender, peppermint, tea tree oil, patchouli, and eucalyptus are distilled. Raw plant material, {{consisting of the}} flowers, leaves, wood, bark, roots, seeds, or peel, is put into an alembic (distillation apparatus) over water. As the water is heated, the steam passes through the plant material, vaporizing the volatile compounds. The vapors flow through a coil, where they condense back to liquid, which is then collected in the <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R

50|$|Freezing a {{water-based}} solution converts all {{bulk water}} into ice crystals, but water associated with solutes—in {{the case of}} a soup stock, gelatin, fat, and flavor compounds—remains unfrozen to much lower temperatures; in practice, the freezing temperature of this associated water is well below the reach of conventional freezers. Thus, gelatin filtration works by freezing a gelatin-containing, water-based solution and then allowing it to thaw in a mesh strainer at just above the freezing temperature of water. The gelatin and other solutes concentrate in the unfrozen, associated water, and the gelatin forms a stable network through cross-linking, just as it would in a standard gel. This stable network acts as a filter, trapping large particles of fat or protein, while allowing water and smaller, flavor-active compounds to pass. As the bulk water melts, it passes first through the gelatin network and then through the mesh strainer, into a <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel.</b> Because the temperature is kept just above the freezing point, the bulk water melts slowly and, as it is strained into a separate vessel, it is never in contact with the gelatin for long enough to begin dissolving the gelatin network. After all of the bulk water melts, the gelatin network remains in the strainer with the trapped macroscopic particles, and the clarified stock (the bulk water and flavor compounds) is collected in the <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R

50|$|Calibration is {{generally}} accomplished through means of gravimetric analysis. This entails dispensing samples of distilled {{water into a}} <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel</b> perched atop a precision analytical balance. The density of water is a well-known constant, and thus {{the mass of the}} dispensed sample provides an accurate indication of the volume dispensed. Relative humidity, ambient temperature, and barometric pressure are factors in the accuracy of the measurement, and are usually combined in a complex formula and computed as the Z-factor. This Z-factor is then used to modify the raw mass data output of the balance and provide an adjusted and more accurate measurement.|$|R
50|$|Mercury bubblers are avoided where possible, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} and expense in dealing with mercury spills. In addition, mercury can react with various chemicals, such as ammonia and acetylenes, with potentially hazardous results. In the context of cannula transfer, mercury bubblers may be avoided by pulling (instead of pushing) liquids through the cannula by vacuum. Alternatively, the oil bubbler may be closed off from the inert gas line with a stopcock, allowing inert gas to push the reagent through the cannula. Excess pressure is bled off from a bubbler fitted directly over the <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to determine the value of color Doppler imaging as an adjunct to gray-scale sonography to reveal the intra- or extraparotid origin of jugulodigastric nodules of uncertain location. Forty nodules in the jugulodigastric area from 38 patients were imaged with gray-scale, color, and power Doppler sonography. Nodules <b>receiving</b> <b>vessels</b> from salivary glands were assumed to be intraglandular; those accepting vessels from paraparotid spaces were considered to arise from outside the gland. Imaging results were correlated with biopsy and surgical findings. In 38 of 40 cases, color and power Doppler sonography displayed discrete feeding arteries leading to the nodules: 25 nodules had one supplying artery, nine received two arteries, and four had three or more arteries. Intraparotid nodules <b>received</b> <b>vessels</b> from the gland in 20 cases. In two cases, the source of vessels was indeterminate. In two malignant tumors, multiple arteries derived from both the parotid and the neck spaces. All 14 extraparotid nodules received the arterial supply from paraparotid spaces. Color Doppler sonography enabled prediction of the intraglandular location of the nodules in 91 % of cases and the extraglandular location in 87. 5 % of cases. The correct diagnosis was achieved in 34 of 40 nodules, with a global accuracy of 85 %. Color Doppler sonography can help to assess the intra- or extraparotid location of jugulodigastric nodules.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} the time to washout of radiographic contrast medium trapped distal to an occluded collateral <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel</b> is inversely related to collateral flow, and that this provides an accurate method for characterising coronary collaterals.  METHODS—An intracoronary pressure derived collateral flow index was determined in 54  patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty (PTCA). The study group was subdivided according to whether the collateral vessels were sufficient (n =  17) or insufficient (n =  37) to prevent ECG signs of myocardial ischaemia during PTCA. Washout collaterometry—an angiographic washout method—was carried out simultaneously; after injection of radiographic contrast medium into the collateral <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel</b> followed immediately by vascular occlusion, the number of heart beats was counted until approximately half the length of the epicardial vessel was cleared of contrast.  RESULTS—The collateral flow index was higher (0. 28  (0. 09) v 0. 12  (0. 07); p <  0. 0001) and the contrast washout time shorter (8. 0  (2. 9) v 17. 5  (6. 7) heart beats; p <  0. 0001) in patients with sufficient versus insufficient collaterals. There was an inverse correlation between contrast washout time and collateral flow index (r =  0. 72, p <  0. 0001). Washout of contrast distal to the occluded vessel within 11  heart beats correctly determined sufficient and insufficient collaterals with 88 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity.  CONCLUSIONS—Washout collaterometry is a new radiographic contrast washout method based on the inverse relation between collateral flow and the time to clearance of radiographic dye injected into the ipsilateral vessel during PTCA. It appears to be an accurate method of characterising coronary collateral vessels.    Keywords: coronary artery disease; collateral circulation; coronary angiograph...|$|R
40|$|Management Plan was {{prepared}} by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and is intended to improve management of the scup commercial fishery, pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) in 1996. The commercial fishery for scup is managed under a system that allocates quota to three periods: Winter I: January-April (45. 11 %), Summer: May- October (38. 95 %), and Winter II: November-December (15. 94 %). During the winter periods, a coastwide quota and possession limits are in effect. This document considers alternatives {{that could result in}} no action (Alternative 1) or allow for the transfer at sea of scup between vessels (Alternative 2 - Preferred Alternative). The Council intends that the transfer of scup at sea would occur only under safe weather and sea conditions. Under the transfer at sea alternative, any amount of scup less than the possession limit could be transferred between two vessels given the following conditions:- transfers could only occur between vessels with Federal scup permits- transfer could only occur seaward of a boundary line that is roughly 20 nm from shore (see Figure 1) - the donating and <b>receiving</b> <b>vessels</b> must possess gear which is Federally approved for scup harvest- transfers would occur in the Winter I or Winter II period- only one transfer would be allowed per fishing trip for the donor vessel- the transfer would include the entire codend- only scup and its normal bycatch could be transferred- only scup could be retained by the receiving vessel- the donating and <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel</b> would report the transfer amount on the vessel trip report for each vesse...|$|R
