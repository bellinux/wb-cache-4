5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Great {{confidence}} {{was placed in}} being able to reduce <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> a turbojet and massive strides by SNECMA in silencer design were reported during the programme. However, by 1974 the spade silencers which projected into the exhaust were reported to be ineffective. The Olympus Mk.622 with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise but it was not developed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>noise</b> {{regulation}} restricts <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>noise,</b> <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> and <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> It usually places restrictions {{for certain}} {{times of the}} day.|$|R

5|$|In Mingora, the Taliban had set an edict that no {{girls could}} attend school after 15 January 2009. The group had already blown {{up more than}} a hundred girls' schools. The night before the ban took effect was filled with <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> {{artillery}} fire, waking Yousafzai several times. The following day, Yousafzai also read for the first time excerpts from her blog that had been published in a local newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Zobel and Carson {{helped to}} {{establish}} the nature of noise in electric circuits, concluding that—contrary to mainstream belief—it is not even theoretically possible to filter out noise entirely and that noise {{will always be a}} limiting factor in what is possible to transmit. Thus, they anticipated the later work of Claude Shannon, who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel is related to <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> the channel.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
50|$|This {{explains}} why {{the quality of a}} preamplifier or RF amplifier is of particular importance in an amplifier chain. In most cases only <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first stage need be considered. However one must check that <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second stage is not so high (or that the gain of the first stage is so low) that there is SNR degradation due to the second stage anyway. That will be a concern if <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first stage plus that stage's gain (in decibels) is not much greater than <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second stage.|$|R

5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|Géricault, who {{had just}} been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic {{existence}} in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.|$|E
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> the things clashing at his waist.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Raymond's {{office had}} {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that one}} can only speak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> {{temperature}} <b>of</b> a component or source whose impedance has a substantial (and measurable) resistive component.

5|$|The Moldavians {{made the}} first move by sending musicians {{to the middle of}} the valley. The sound of drums and bugles made Suleiman think that the entire Moldavian army awaited him there. Instead, the centre of the valley held the Székely forces and the Moldavian {{professional}} army, which were ordered to make a slow retreat when they encountered the enemy. Suleiman ordered his troops to advance and, when they made enough progress, the Moldavian artillery started to fire, followed by archers and handgunners firing from three different directions. The archers could not see the enemy for the fog, and, instead, had to follow <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> their footsteps. The Moldavian light cavalry then helped to lure the Ottoman troops into the valley by making hit-and-run attacks. Ottoman cavalry tried to cross the wooden bridge, causing it to collapse. Those Ottoman soldiers who had managed to survive the attacks from the artillery and the archers, and who did not get caught in the marshes, had to confront the Moldavian army, together with the Székely soldiers further up the valley. The 5,000 Székely soldiers were successful in repelling the 7,000 Ottoman infantrymen. Thereafter, they made a slow retreat, as instructed by Stephen, but were later routed by the Ottoman sipahi, while the remaining Ottoman infantry attacked the Moldavian flanks.|$|E
5|$|The privateers {{arrived at}} Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped {{overnight}} before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine {{that led to}} the foot of a small hill on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgan's main force of troops. When the party came into view {{at the end of the}} ravine, they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgan's forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed.|$|E
5|$|The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, {{were ordered}} to begin their {{simultaneous}} assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down {{the rear of the}} building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the staff sergeant leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{importance}} <b>of</b> amplitude-modulated (AM) <b>noise.</b> AM noise is often neglected and considered as a minor problem. However, AM noise can become very important in high performance systems that require ultra-low phase-modulated (PM) <b>noise</b> and where <b>the</b> designer is struggling with AM-PM conversion. Few discussions are available on <b>the</b> AM <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> different microwave components. In this paper we report <b>the</b> AM <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> different commercial amplifiers and oscillators at 10 GHz. To adequately characterize <b>the</b> AM <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> high performance amplifiers, we design and investigate an air-dielectric cavity resonator oscillator with outstanding AM noise performance.

40|$|Abstract—The {{phase noise}} {{is a very}} {{important}} index to wireless system, especially in millimeter-wave continuous wave radar systems. <b>The</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal, which is firstly leaked from transmitter and then mixed to intermediate frequency band by the local oscillator (Tx-IF), will worsen the sensitivity of superheterodyne radar system used for Doppler velocity detection. In this paper, the coherent analysis is applied on <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> after nonlinear process, which shows that <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tx-IF is affected by those factors: the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitter and that of the local oscillator, and the correlationship between each other. In practice, by reducing <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitter and that of the local oscillator and ameliorating the correlationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two phase <b>noises,</b> <b>the</b> phase <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tx-IF can be improved greatly. Such proposition is successfully applied in the design of a millimeter-wave Doppler radar working at 95 GHz. The experimental measurement shows that the sensitivity of this radar is better than − 70 dBm. 1...|$|R

5|$|To {{relieve the}} {{garrison}} of Svetigrad, Skanderbeg continually harassed the Ottoman army. Many of these attacks had been surprise ambushes of isolated Ottoman forces. Hoping to evade Ottoman patrols, Skanderbeg moved towards the Ottoman camp. On June 22, Skanderbeg led a night {{attack on the}} Ottoman camp which disillusioned the Ottoman soldiers who had been expecting a quiet campaign. Soon after, when the besiegers were taking their afternoon naps, Skanderbeg sent Moses with some men, again dressed as peasants, inside the Ottoman camp to reconnoiter for a future assault. Skanderbeg spoke to his troops, encouraging them not to take booty from the camp as this might give the Ottoman forces time to react and launch a counterattack. That night, the Albanians launched their attack, but <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> the armor and the neighing of the horses inhibited a complete surprise. The periphery of the camp was thrown into confusion, {{but the bulk of}} the Turkish troops gathered and organized themselves, pushing the Albanians out of the camp but not before suffering heavy casualties. To prevent further attacks of this sort, Murad detached a contingent of troops under Firuz Pasha to watch the Albanians but it was prone to desertion and thoroughly destroyed with its baggage train being captured. A breach in the walls of Svetigrad was made, but the following infantry assault was repulsed. The Albanians began to hope that the sultan would now be returning to Edirne.|$|E
5|$|Upon hearing <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> explosions, the on-duty U.S. {{technicians}} {{rushed out}} the front door of their operations building where they were met by North Vietnamese gunfire. Blanton, the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other U.S. technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to {{the west side of the}} mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the U.S. technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades. At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the U.S. technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting. Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.|$|E
5|$|The crowd's {{agitation}} increased, {{and they}} overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested {{that someone who}} could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} break the political system of the viceroyalty without discussing it with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times in the last few days, Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>of</b> the demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that the demonstrators could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out {{that the only way to}} calm the demonstrators was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the people and not by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400people already gathered, the barracks were full of people who supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary. The Cabildo replied by requesting their demands in writing.|$|E
