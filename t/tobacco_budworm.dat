50|$|Spinosyn A {{does not}} appear to {{interact}} directly with known insecticidal-relevant target sites, but rather acts via a novel mechanism. Spinosyn A resembles a GABA antagonist and is comparable to the effect of Avermectin on insect neurons. Spinosyn A is highly active against neonate larvae of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm,</b> Heliothis virescens, and is slightly more biologically active than spinosyn D. In general, spinosyns possessing a methyl group at C6 (spinosyn D-related analogs) tend to be more active and less affected by changes {{in the rest of the}} molecule. Spinosyn A is slow to penetrate to the internal fluids of larvae; it is also poorly metabolized once it enters the insect. The apparent lack of spinosyn A metabolism may contribute to its high level of activity, and may compensate for the slow rate of penetration.|$|E

50|$|Some {{specialized}} herbivores tolerate L-canavanine {{either because}} they metabolize it efficiently (cf. L-canaline) or avoid its incorporation into their own nascent proteins. An example of this ability {{can be found in}} the larvae of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> Heliothis virescens, which can tolerate massive amounts of dietary canavanine. These larvae fastidiously avoid incorporation of L-canavanine into their nascent proteins (presumably by virtue of highly discriminatory Arginine—tRNA ligase, the enzyme responsible for the first step in the incorporation of arginine into proteins). In contrast, larvae of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta can only tolerate tiny amounts (1.0 microgram per kilogram of fresh body weight) of dietary canavanine because their arginine-tRNA ligase has little, if any, discriminatory capacity. No one has examined experimentally the arginine-tRNA synthetase of these organisms. But comparative studies of the incorporation of radiolabeled L-arginine and L-canavanine have shown that in Manduca sexta, the ratio of incorporation is about 3 to 1.|$|E

40|$|Berliner {{insecticides}} {{have demonstrated}} considerable potential in cotton insect pest management, although problems with persistence have limited commercial use. One {{option for the}} control of insecticide resistant <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> includes the use of B. thuringiensis insecticides with chemical ovicides for control of low infestations of <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> in normal non-transgenic B. thuringiensis cotton cultivars during phase I (June) of the cotton production season. The primary objective of these studies {{was to determine the}} efficacy and persistence of two B. thuringiensis insecticides, Dipel ES and Condor OF, compared with a standard chemical insecticide, Larvin 3. 2 F, against this pest in laboratory and field tests. Literature Summary. The <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> has developed resistance to all recommended classes of insecticides used on cotton. Applied entomologists have recommended the use of B. thuringiensis at rates of 2. 0 to 64. 0 oz acre- 1 as a component of insecticide resistance management guidelines to manage <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> populations resistant to pyrethroid insecticides. Researchers in Texas have suggested that low rates are not recommended to produce mortality but rather to slow development of <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> and expose them to natural mortality factors. Other information suggests rates less than 48 oz acre- 1 is generally ineffective against <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm.</b> Therefore, cost-effective rates of B. thuringiensis insecticides need to be defined for <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> management in cotton.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Nabis alternatus Parshley to reduce <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm,</b> Heliothis virescens (F.), populations was {{studied in the}} laboratory, {{greenhouse}} and field. Tests were conducted at different temperatures and with different larval instars of <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> to determine their effects on predatory efficiency. Both immature and adult N. alternatus consumed more first-instars than of either second- or third-instars, or of the egg stage. Temperature significantly affected the predatory capability of N. alternatus. All instars and the adult exhibited {{a higher rate of}} consumption at 30 °C than at temperatures of 20, 25 and 35 °C; adults consumed more <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> larvae and eggs at all temperatures than did any of the nymphal instars. There were no differences in survival of the different N. alternatus stages at the different temperatures but the average number of days required to complete each instar was affected. Each increase in the predator-to-prey ratio resulted in a reduced survival of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> population. Release rates of 2500, 3750 and 5000 adults per acre resulted in mortalities of 55, 77, and 87 %, respectively. Both adult and third-instar N. alternatus exhibited the higher searching and consumptive capacities at different ratios of first-, second-, and third-instar <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> infestations. All N. alternatus fed more at the 1 : 4 (predator/prey) ratio than at ratios of 1 : 1, 1 : 2, or 1 : 3. Longevity of adult N. alternatus varied when provided with food substances of sugar solution, green bean, no food or cotton plants at the different temperatures.

40|$|Efficacy of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner {{against the}} first three larval instars of Heliothis virescens (F.) was studied under {{greenhouse}} and field conditions. The primary objective of these studies {{was to determine the}} susceptibility of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> to Dipel, a commercial preparation of Bacillus thuringiensis. Both greenhouse and field studies showed that first-instar larvae were more susceptible to all dosage levels of Dipel tested (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1. 0 1 b/A). The higher rates of 0. 5 and 1. 0 1 b/A gave better control and remained effective for longer periods against the first-, second- and third-larval instars than did the lower rates of 0. 125 and 0. 25 1 b/A. The efficacy of all Dipel rates decreased significantly with each subsequent post-application-date bioassay, and only the higher dosages of 0. 5 and 1. 0 1 b/A remained effective at the three-day residue period in the field studies. The addition of a feeding stimulant, Coax, at 0. 25 1 b/A, to all Dipel treatments resulted in a significant increase in larval mortality of all instars tested. Dipel plus Coax exhibited longer residual activity than did Dipel alone, indicating that Coax may protect the spores and toxin from degradation by the direct sunlight. When second-instar <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> larvae were allowed to feed on Dipel-treated terminals for 6, 18 or 30 hours and then transferred to untreated diet, they showed a great capacity to recover from the effect of the toxin. However, as the Dipel rate or exposure time was increased, the ability of larvae to recover was decreased. Dipel did {{have an effect on the}} biological activity of treatment-surviving larvae. Larval and pupal development was delayed, pupal weight was decreased, and female fecundity was reduced. In all cases the changes were proportional with the Dipel rate and with the length of exposure. No apparent effect was shown relative to adult longevity or egg viability for those surviving Dipel treatments as larvae. When Dipel was applied directly on <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> eggs, it had no effect on egg hatch but did significantly affect survival of newly-emerged larvae, indicating the larvae consumed a lethal dose of the toxin during eclosion. The compatibility of Dipel in combination with Geocoris punctipes (Say) against first-instar larvae of Heliothis virescens was also studied under greenhouse and field conditions. Results of these studies indicated the possibility of utilizing the two biological agents to suppress <b>tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> populations in the field. A minimum density of one Geocoris nymph per 4 row feet is required, plus an effective field rate of Dipel.

The original diet formula contained 2. 51 % protein. When the proportions of soybean flour and wheat germ were changed to 2. 15 % protein the net reproductive rate of the first generation was significantly lower.

40|$|<b>Tobacco</b> <b>budworm</b> (TBW), Heliothis virescens (F.), larvae {{were highly}} {{susceptible}} to feeding on Bt cotton leaves or flower buds with 100 % and 96 % mortality occurring within 4 days, respectively, {{compared to an}} average mortality of 95 % for cabbage looper (CL), Trichoplusia ni (Hübner), and 57 % for beet armyworm (BAW), Spodoptera exigua (Hübner), after 14 days feeding on Bt leaves. Larval weights, of CL and BAW after 7, 10, or 14 days of feeding on Bt leaves were lower compared with those feeding on non-Bt cotton leaves. BAW, CL, and TBW larvae consumed significantly less Bt leaf area per feeding day compared with DPL 5415...|$|E
