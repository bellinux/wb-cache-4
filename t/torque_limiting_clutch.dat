50|$|The clutch is the {{component}} that defines a torque screwdriver. This is achieved with steel balls rolling between indented plates, compressed by a spring at one end, {{and the other}} side driving a screw or fastener. The <b>torque</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>clutch</b> is the part of the tool that limits the amount of torque being applied to the fastener at the receiving end of the tool. On simpler tools the clutch settings may be marked with arbitrary numbers (e.g., from 1 for the lowest available torque to 20 for the highest, without necessarily having a linear relationship with actual torque) rather than torque values.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a mechanism for}} permitting convenient manual or servo-powered control of a boom assembly, which is rotatably positionable about yaw and pitch axes by means of releasably locking, yaw and pitch torque-limiting mechanisms, each {{of which may be}} locked, unlocked, and positioned by respective yaw and pitch levers. The boom may be longitudinally projected and withdrawn by rotating a boom extension/retraction crank. Torque limiting is provided by spring loaded clutch mechanisms, whereby positioning forces applied to the handles are effective to move the boom unless overcome by greater opposing forces, sufficient to overcome the torque applied by the <b>torque</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>clutch</b> mechanisms. In operation, a structure positionable by the invention (e. g., and end-effector or robot arm) may be rotatably moved about yaw and pitch axes by moving a selected one of the three levers...|$|E
40|$|The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) {{requested}} a two-axis pan tilt mechanism be designed, built, and tested for shipboard deployment of a sensor payload. Of paramount consideration to this design was the robustness {{of the system}} {{in the face of}} wave impact loading from "green water" taken over the superstructure of naval vessels. Central to providing such a system is the prevention of drive train failures given wave or other forms of impact loading. Through the course of work completed for his Master's thesis, Nathan M. Mills brought the design effort through initial bench testing. Several failures were experienced due to minor design flaws and mechanical component selection. One component selection that required improvement was the <b>torque</b> <b>limiting</b> slip <b>clutch</b> used in both the pan and tilt drive sections. The unit selected induced positioning errors resulting from backlash inherent to its design. The backlash encountered is unavoidable when using the type of slip clutch selected, as it is with many of the slip clutches available to the machine designer. Slip clutches are available that have limited backlash, but the majority of these are friction based and have setpoints that either do not have tight tolerances or change as the component is cycled. The goal of the present work was to design a slip clutch that maintains its setpoint and minimizes backlash to allow for its shipboard use in the NRL sponsored pan tilt system. The design was completed in a manner that supports the use of the slip clutch in other systems that require accurate positioning and torque overload protection in both marine and non-marine environments. by Thomas Patrick Finley.

40|$|On January 6, 2016 at El Paso, the Guppy {{winch motor}} was changed. After {{completion}} of the operational checks, the load bar was being reinstalled on the cargo pallet when the motor control FORWARD relay failed in the energized position. The pallet was pinned at all locations (each pin has a load capacity of 16, 000 lbs.) while the winch was running. The wire rope snapped before aircraft power could be removed. After disassembly, the fractured wire rope was shipped to ES 4 lab for further characterization of the wire rope portion of the failure. The system was being operated without {{a clear understanding of}} the system capability and function. The proximate cause was the failure of the K 48 -Forward Winch Control Relay in the energized position, which allowed the motor to continuously run without command from the hand controller, and operation of the winch system with both controllers connected to the system. This prevented the emergency stop feature on the hand controller from functioning as designed. An electrical checkout engineering work instruction was completed and identified the failed relay and confirmed the emergency stop only paused the system when the STOP button on both connected hand controllers were depressed simultaneously. The winch system incorporates a <b>torque</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>clutch.</b> It is suspected that the clutch did not slip and the motor did not stall or overload the current limiter. Aircraft Engineering is looking at how to change the procedures to provide a checkout of the clutch and set to a slip torque limit appropriate to support operations...|$|E

This presentation focuses {{on the development of}} a high fidelity dynamic module of the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) on board the ISS. The ARED module, illustrated in the figure below, was developed using the Adams (MSC Santa Ana, California) simulation package. The Adams package provides the capabilities to perform multi rigid body, flexible body, and mixed dynamic analyses of complex mechanisms. These capabilities were applied to accurately simulate: Inertial and mass properties of the device such as the vibration isolation system (VIS) effects and other ARED components, Non-linear joint friction effects, The gas law dynamics of the vacuum cylinders and VIS components using custom written differential state equations, The ARED flywheel dynamics, including <b>torque</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>clutch.</b> Design data from the JSC ARED Engineering team was utilized in developing the model. This included solid modeling geometry files, component/system specifications, engineering reports and available data sets. The Adams ARED module is importable into LifeMOD (Life Modeler, Inc., San Clemente, CA) for biomechanical analyses of different resistive exercises such as squat and dead-lift. Using motion capture data from ground test subjects, the ExPC developed biomechanical exercise models in LifeMOD. The Adams ARED device module was then integrated with the exercise subject model into one integrated dynamic model. This presentation will describe the development of the Adams ARED module including its capabilities, limitations, and assumptions. Preliminary results, validation activities, and a practical application of the module to inform the relative effect of the flywheels on exercise will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} for formal {{guarantees}} on the stability and safety of controllers for challenging robot control tasks, we present a control design procedure that explicitly seeks to maximize {{the size of an}} invariant "funnel" that leads to a predefined goal set. Our certificates of invariance are given in terms of sums of squares proofs of a set of appropriately defined Lyapunov inequalities. These certificates, together with our proposed polynomial controllers, can be efficiently obtained via semidefinite optimization. Our approach can handle time-varying dynamics resulting from tracking a given trajectory, input saturations (e. g. <b>torque</b> <b>limits),</b> and can be extended to deal with uncertainty in the dynamics and state. The resulting controllers can be used by space-filling feedback motion planning algorithms to fill up the space with significantly fewer trajectories. We demonstrate our approach on a severely <b>torque</b> <b>limited</b> underactuated double pendulum (Acrobot) and provide extensive simulation and hardware validation...|$|R
40|$|When the minimum-time {{trajectory}} of a manipulator along a geometrically prescribed path is planned {{taking into consideration}} the manipulator's dynamics and actuator's <b>torque</b> <b>limits,</b> {{at least one of}} the joints should be at the <b>torque</b> <b>limit.</b> The execution of such a trajectory by a conventional feedback control scheme results in torque saturation. Consequently, the tracking error cannot be suppressed and the manipulator may deviate from the desired path. In this paper, we propose a feedback control method for path tracking which takes the torque saturation into account. Based on the desired path, a coordinate system calledpath coordinates is defined. The path coordinates are composed of the component along the path and the components normal to the path. The equation of motion is described in terms of the path coordinates. Control of the components normal to the path is given priority in order to keep the motion of the manipulator on the path. Simulations of a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator show the effectiveness of this method...|$|R
40|$|Although learning-based {{methods have}} great {{potential}} for robotics, one concern is that a robot that updates its parameters might cause large amounts of damage before it learns the optimal policy.

We study this optimization for {{the case of a}} robot manipulator with safety-based <b>torque</b> <b>limits.</b> We would like to ensure that the damage constraint is maintained at every step of the optimization and not just at convergence. To achieve this aim, we introduce a novel method which predicts how modifying the <b>torque</b> <b>limit,</b> as well as how updating the policy parameters, might affect the robot's safety. We show through a number of experiments that our approach allows the robot to improve its performance while ensuring that the expected damage constraint is not violated during the learning process...|$|R
