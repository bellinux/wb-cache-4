We adapted established technology and reagents to develop an imaging approach, ViewHIV, which allows evaluation of early HIV- 1 replication intermediates, from reverse transcription to integration.

Helper viruses differed in the efficiency with which they aided potato aucuba mosaic virus and potato virus C, and some potato aucuba mosaic virus isolates were transmitted more frequently than others. With potato virus Y as helper, up to 3 o % of the aphids transmitted potato aucuba mosaic virus. Aphids were usually fed for brief periods on plants infected with the helper virus but aphids fed for 2 days also transmitted potato aucuba mosaic virus readily. Starving the aphids for I to 2 hr between their acquisition feeds on plants infected with helper and <b>aided</b> <b>virus</b> decreased but did not eliminate transmission.

5000|$|Similar {{to other}} flaviviruses, SPONV has a positive-sense single {{stranded}} RNA genome, which is approximately 11 kilobases in length. The RNA genome contains 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions that surround a single {{open reading frame}} (ORF) that encodes for a polyprotein that is specifically cleaved. The polyprotein is cleaved into three specific proteins: the capsid (C), the premembrane (prM) and the envelope (E) along with seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5). The SPONV capsid is icosahedral and the similar to other flaviviruses which have an enveloped consisting of glycoproteins.

In growing cells both endogenous total cell proteins and microinjected proteins were degraded at a slower rate than in confluent cell monolayers. The inhibition by NH 4 Cl of the degradation of both the endogenous and microinjected proteins is decreased compared with the inhibition observed in confluent monolayers. The results are discussed in terms of the cytoplasmic capacity to segregate microinjected homologous proteins before protein degradation can take place...|$|R

40|$|The 2 b protein encoded by Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) {{and other}} cucumoviruses is multifunctional, having roles in local and {{systemic}} virus movement, symptom determination, evasion of defense mediated by salicylic acid, and in suppression of antiviral RNA silencing.

This revealed that binding of short RNAs, the key determinants of RNA silencing specificity, correlates with RNA silencing suppression activity. Two putative phosphorylation sites were found to be required for virus symptom induction, despite having no influence on RNA silencing suppression. This indicates that the ability to suppress silencing is not the only factor affecting symptom induction by the 2 b protein.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{recently}} {{provided evidence}} that HIV- 1 enters HeLa-derived TZM-bl and lymphoid CEMss cells by fusing with endosomes, whereas its fusion with the plasma membrane does not proceed beyond the lipid mixing step. The mechanism of restriction of HIV- 1 fusion at the cell surface and/or <b>the</b> factors that <b>aid</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> entry from endosomes remain unclear. Results We examined HIV- 1 fusion with {{a panel of}} target cells lines and with primary CD 4 + T cells. Kinetic measurements of fusion combined with time-resolved imaging of single viruses further reinforced the notion that HIV- 1 enters the cells via endocytosis and fusion with endosomes. Furthermore, we attempted to deliberately redirect virus fusion to the plasma membrane, using two experimental strategies. First, the fusion reaction was synchronized by pre-incubating the viruses with cells at reduced temperature to allow CD 4 and coreceptors engagement, but not the virus uptake or fusion. Subsequent shift to a physiological temperature triggered accelerated virus uptake followed by entry from endosomes, but did not permit fusion at the cell surface. Second, blocking HIV- 1 endocytosis by a small-molecule dynamin inhibitor, dynasore, resulted in transfer of viral lipids to the plasma membrane without any detectable release of the viral content into the cytosol. We also found that a higher concentration of dynasore is required to block the HIV-endosome fusion compared to virus internalization. Conclusions Our results further {{support the notion that}} HIV- 1 enters disparate cell types through fusion with endosomes. The block of HIV- 1 fusion with the plasma membrane at a post-lipid mixing stage shows that this membrane is not conducive to fusion pore formation and/or enlargement. The ability of dynasore to interfere with the virus-endosome fusion suggests that dynamin could be involved in two distinct steps of HIV- 1 entry - endocytosis and fusion within intracellular compartments. </p...|$|R
40|$|Viruses have {{developed}} several strategies {{to evade the}} complement system, {{a part of the}} immune system. The fourth open reading frame of the human virus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein. This contains four complement control protein domains (CCP domains), and is thus structurally similar to human complement inhibitors. We named it KSHV complement control protein (KCP). Using recombinant KCP, we showed that it can inhibit the complement system by disrupting a key enzymatic complex, the C 3 convertase. We predicted the 3 D structure of KCP by homology modeling. Functionally important sites in KCP were mapped using mutants where either one to three amino acids, or entire CCP domains, were altered. We also found that a patch of positively charged amino acids in CCP 1 - 2 of KCP can bind to heparin and weakly to heparin like proteoglycans at the surface of cells, which seems to <b>aid</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> in the attachment step prior to cell entry. In order to study the biological role of complement inhibition for this type of virus, we want to use the KSHV homologue rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV), since this virus is both technically easier to work with than KCP and also permits in vivo studies, by naturally infecting Rhesus Macaques.

Largely {{due to the lack of}} appropriate model systems, the mechanisms of viral replication and MCPyV persistence remain poorly understood. Using a semi-permissive replication system, we here report a comprehensive analysis of the role of the MCPyV-encoded microRNA (miRNA) mcv-miR-M 1 during short and long-term replication of authentic MCPyV episomes. We demonstrate that cells harboring intact episomes express high levels of the viral miRNA, and that expression of mcv-miR-M 1 limits DNA replication. Furthermore, we present RACE, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies which allow insight in the viral transcription program and mechanisms of miRNA expression. While our data suggest that mcv-miR-M 1 can be expressed from canonical late strand transcripts, we also present evidence for the existence of an independent miRNA promoter that is embedded within early strand coding sequences. We also report that MCPyV genomes can establish episomal persistence in a small number of cells for several months, a time period during which viral DNA as well as LT-Ag and viral miRNA expression can be detected via western blotting, FISH, qPCR and southern blot analyses. Strikingly, despite enhanced replication in short term DNA replication assays, a mutant unable to express the viral miRNA was severely limited in its ability to establish long-term persistence.
