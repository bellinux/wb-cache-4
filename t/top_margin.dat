5|$|The tip of {{the angular}} is {{situated}} close to {{the midpoint of the}} bone in K. langenbergensis rather than being at the back as in K. guimarotae. In both species, the back of the angular contributes to the retroarticular process. The inner surface of the angular is roughened in K. guimarotae, and the <b>top</b> <b>margin</b> of the inner wall transitions from an upward-projecting tip at the front to a low, rounded crest at the back; the same margin maintains its height along the angular in K. langenbergensis. The surangular bears a thin, forward-projecting process that, in K. langenbergensis, extends forward {{to the back of the}} tooth row and bears a groove on the bottom. The presence of the oval-shaped external mandibular fenestra is unique to the genus among atoposaurids.|$|E
5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the <b>top</b> <b>margin</b> of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E
5|$|In Kirkland's initial {{description}} of Eolambia, he considered {{it to be}} a member of the Hadrosauridae, as defined by David B. Weishampel, David B. Norman, and Dan Grigorescu in 1993. Weishampel and colleagues used seven unifying characteristics to define the Hadrosauridae: the upward expansion of the ascending process of the maxilla; the absence of the paraquadrate foramen, which separates the quadrate and quadratojugal; the location of the angular on the inner surface of the lower jaw; the absence of the surangular foramen on the surangular; the narrow teeth of the maxilla; the presence of three or more teeth in each dentary tooth position; and the reduction of the <b>top</b> <b>margin</b> of the scapular blade. The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of these traits were recognized in Eolambia, with the rest being unknown due to missing material. Kirkland further assigned Eolambia to the Euhadrosauria, defined by Weishampel and colleagues to include the common ancestor of Hadrosaurinae (now the Saurolophinae) and Lambeosaurinae – the two primary branches of hadrosaurids – and all of its descendants. This assignment was based on five characteristics, all present in Eolambia: the presence of denticles on the premaxilla; the quadrate's narrow joint with the lower jaw; the narrow dentary teeth; the presence of a single edge, or carina, on each dentary tooth; and the angled deltopectoral crest on the humerus.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} used matting has an equal margin {{all the way}} around. On artwork with the visual center lower than actual center,. Bottom weighting, or off-sets are used {{frequently}} in matting. The bottom margin are made larger than the side and <b>top</b> <b>margins.</b> When looking at an image, the eyes tend to center higher up than the physical center of the image. By creating a larger bottom margin and off-setting the mat you draw the eye to physical center of the image. Top Center is a subset of bottom weighting where the <b>top</b> and side <b>margins</b> are equal, which creates a visually pleasing effect. This is particularly true in mats where the borders are not equal, such as an 11x14 with an 8x10 opening.|$|R
25|$|The {{pancreas}} receives {{blood from}} branches {{of both the}} coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery. The splenic artery runs along the <b>top</b> <b>margin</b> of the pancreas, and supplies the neck, body and {{tail of the pancreas}} through its pancreatic branches, the largest of which is called the greater pancreatic artery. The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries run along the anterior and posterior surfaces of the head of the pancreas at its border with the duodenum. These supply the head of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|Various {{alternative}} phylogenetic placements of Xingxiulong were tested; out of these, {{the most}} plausible alternative involves it being placed as a basal {{member of the}} Massopoda, outside of either Massospondylidae or Sauropodiformes, which only requires two additional evolutionary steps. This is {{probably due to the}} curved <b>top</b> <b>margin</b> of the postorbital and the presence of a process behind the jaw joint on the articular, which are traits that, compared to either Massospondylidae or Sauropodiformes, can be regarded as relatively primitive. Such an alternative scenario would involve significant mosaic evolution in this evolutionary grade. Placements that required three additional evolutionary steps placed Xingxiulong between Jingshanosaurus and Anchisaurus, or between Yunnanosaurus and Jingshanosaurus.|$|E
500|$|The preacetabular (i.e. {{located in}} front of the hip socket) process of the ilium bears a {{horizontal}} [...] "boot" [...] which forms an obtuse angle with the bottom of the process. Additionally, the top edge of the bone projects outwards to form a rim located above the ilium-ischium articuation on the bottom edge of the bone. These traits are also seen in Probactrosaurus and other iguanodonts. The hip socket itself is quite large relative to the ilium for an iguanodont. A distinctive flange is present along the top surface of the ilium, a trait which is shared with an unnamed hadrosauroid from the Woodbine Formation. The postacetabular (i.e. located behind the hip socket) process of the ilium tapers at its rear with no break in its <b>top</b> <b>margin.</b> On the pubis, the forward-projecting process expands towards the front, like Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, and other iguanodonts.

6000|$|Upon {{the return}} of Glen from abroad, the commonest courtesy, {{not to say the}} blood-relation between them, {{prompted}} Pierre to welcome him home, with a letter, which though not over-long, and little enthusiastic, still breathed a spirit of cousinly consideration and kindness, pervadingly touched by the then naturally frank and all-attractive spirit of Pierre. To this, the less earnest and now Europeanized Glen had replied in a letter all sudden suavity; and in a strain of artistic artlessness, mourned the apparent decline of their friendship; yet fondly trusted that now, notwithstanding their long separation, it would revive with added sincerity. Yet upon accidentally fixing his glance upon the opening salutation of this delicate missive, Pierre thought he perceived certain, not wholly disguisable chirographic tokens, that the [...] "My very dear Pierre," [...] with which the letter seemed to have been begun, had originally been written [...] "Dear Pierre;" [...] but that when all was concluded, and Glen's signature put to it, then the ardent words [...] "My very" [...] had been prefixed to the reconsidered [...] "Dear Pierre;" [...] a casual supposition, which possibly, however unfounded, materially retarded any answering warmth in Pierre, lest his generous flame should only embrace a flaunted feather. Nor was this idea altogether unreinforced, when on the reception of a second, and now half-business letter (of which mixed sort nearly all the subsequent ones were), from Glen, he found that the [...] "My very dear Pierre" [...] had already retreated into [...] "My dear Pierre;" [...] and on a third occasion, into [...] "Dear Pierre;" [...] and on a fourth, had made a forced and very spirited advanced march up to [...] "My dearest Pierre." [...] All of which fluctuations augured ill for the determinateness of that love, which, however immensely devoted to one cause, could yet hoist and sail under the flags of all nations. Nor could he but now applaud a still subsequent letter from Glen, which abruptly, and almost with apparent indecorousness, under the circumstances, commenced the strain of friendship without any overture of salutation whatever; as if at last, owing to its infinite delicateness, entirely hopeless of precisely defining the nature of their mystical love, Glen chose rather to leave that precise definition to the sympathetical heart and imagination of Pierre; while he himself would go on to celebrate the general relation, by many a sugared sentence of miscellaneous devotion. It was a little curious and rather sardonically diverting, to compare these masterly, yet not wholly successful, and indeterminate tactics of the accomplished Glen, with the unfaltering stream of Beloved Pierres, which not only flowed along the <b>top</b> <b>margin</b> of all his earlier letters, but here and there, from their subterranean channel, flashed out in bright intervals, through all the succeeding lines. Nor had the chance recollection of these things at all restrained the reckless hand of Pierre, when he threw the whole package of letters, both new and old, into that most honest and summary of all elements, which is neither a respecter of persons, nor a finical critic of what manner of writings it burns; but like ultimate Truth itself, of which it is the eloquent symbol, consumes all, and only consumes.|$|E

50|$|Ukrainian {{basketball}} League {{was created}} on 20 June 2008 {{as an alternative}} body to Ukrainian basketball Federation. The following key principles are put to the basis of UBL operation: sight, competition and openness. That is why today in UBL, as in NBA, the clubs are limited with their budget <b>top</b> <b>margins,</b> which guarantees to all teams the same and equal opportunities. Another key difference of UBL is “the course to Ukrainization” of domestic basketball.

During {{the first year of}} its existence UBL had organized several arrangements that combined the sporting activities with elements of show, such as All-Star Game and UBL Cup Final Four.|$|R
