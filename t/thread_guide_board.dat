30|$|The {{operative}} {{principle is}} based on stretching of the vaginal membrane intraabdominally. Via a pluggable segmented dummy, which is connected to two threads, pressure is continuously exerted on the vaginal membrane resulting in the formation by stretching of a neovagina {{within a matter of}} days. Using the vagino-abdominal perforation method of Wallwiener the two threads are drawn intraabdominally from the vaginal membrane using the straight single-prong <b>thread</b> <b>guide,</b> by means of which the vaginal membrane is perforated (through a single perforation), and then pulled outside the abdominal wall with a large curved <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> which is positioned retroperitoneally from cranial to caudal. Using the abdomino-vaginale perforation method of Fedele one of the curved <b>thread</b> <b>guides</b> is used. This <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> is also positioned retroperitoneally from cranial to caudal, then the vaginal membrane is perforated with this <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> and the <b>threads</b> executing traction are threaded extraabdominal/extravaginal and then also pulled outside the abdominal wall. Outside the abdomen the threads are held taut by a traction device and tightened daily so that a constant stretching pressure is exerted on the vaginal membrane.|$|R

40|$|DE 102005050126 B 3 UPAB: 20070517 NOVELTY - In a {{monitored}} <b>thread</b> <b>guiding</b> {{device in}} a knitting machine, {{in which a}} <b>thread</b> is <b>guided</b> under tension along a free thread transport zone, having thread supply unit(s), a receiving unit and an optical sensor unit for contact-free detection of thread in the transport zone, sideways oscillation of the thread from its path is caused along the transport zone. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A monitored <b>thread</b> <b>guiding</b> device in a knitting machine, in which at least one <b>thread</b> is <b>guided</b> under predetermined tension along a free thread transport zone, has unit(s) for supplying the thread along the zone and a unit for receiving and/or further <b>guiding</b> the tensioned <b>thread.</b> An optical sensor unit, for contact-free detection of thread in the transport zone, generates a control or regulation signal for the thread supply and/or receiving unit(s). The novel feature is that a device for causing sideways oscillation of the thread from its path is provided along the transport zone. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a corresponding monitored <b>thread</b> <b>guiding</b> process, in which controlled transverse oscillations are induced in the thread in the transport zone, optical detection of a consequent dynamic sensor signal is used to indicate an undamaged thread and lack of detection of such a signal is used to detect a broken thread, in which case operation of the knitting machine is halted. USE - For monitored <b>guiding</b> of <b>thread</b> in a knitting machine, especially a circular knitting machine. ADVANTAGE - <b>Guiding</b> of the <b>threads</b> is effectively monitored (especially as regards thread tension) while avoiding additional wear on the knitting machine side components (including the thread itself), so {{that the need for}} expensive and time-consuming maintenance operations is eliminated. Constant thread quality is ensured, especially so that threads of low (specifically non-optically resolvable) roughness are obtained. Yarn <b>guiding</b> within several <b>thread</b> <b>guides</b> can be individually monitored, so that a higher quality knitted product is obtained. The thread tension can be regulated in individual <b>thread</b> <b>guides...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Guide</b> <b>Board</b> Corners is {{accessible}} by several different roads leading {{from other parts}} of the town. The most major of these is Central Chapel Road (part of County Route 115), which runs from north to south through the center of <b>Guide</b> <b>Board</b> Corners. This road provides access to Brooktondale and Slaterville, which are near New York State Route 79. Central Chapel Road, where it comes to the large intersection, was once part of New York State Route 330, which ran from <b>Guide</b> <b>Board</b> Corners to Besemer (at NY 79). Heading southward out of <b>Guide</b> <b>Board</b> Corners along Central Chapel Road brings you to Brearley Hill. The road leading west out of <b>Guide</b> <b>Board</b> Corners is Grove School Road, which heads westward, ending at an intersection with Bald Hill Road. Although the road goes only for a short distance, it has a history dating back to 1972, when the remains of Hurricane Agnes struck the area. The road was closed due to major flooding and damaged bridges. However, according to Tompkins County officials, the roads were [...] "generally awful all over". Middaugh Road and NY 79 were also closed off due to Agnes. The last major road in <b>Guide</b> <b>Board</b> Corners is the Seventy-six Road. This highway, part of County Route 115, heads from Speedsville and the Tioga County line all the way to <b>Guide</b> <b>Board</b> Corners. This section was built in 1804-1808 as [...] "76 Road", often corrupted in popular speech to [...] "Old 76 Road".|$|R

50|$|A {{ring frame}} was {{constructed}} from cast iron, and later pressed steel. On {{each side of}} the frame are the spindles, above them are draughting (drafting) rollers and on top is a creel loaded with bobbins of roving. The roving (unspun thread) passes downwards from the bobbins to the draughting rollers. Here the back roller steadied the incoming thread, while the front rollers rotated faster, pulling the roving out and making the fibres more parallel. The rollers are individually adjustable, originally by mean of levers and weights. The attenuated roving now passes through a <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> that is adjusted to be centred above the spindle. <b>Thread</b> <b>guides</b> are on a thread rail which allows them to be hinged out of the way for doffing or piecing a broken thread.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Bilateral vocal cord {{paralysis}} {{in early}} childhood is a life-threatening condition, which often requires immediate intervention. One of the treatment options is a quick, reversible simple suture vocal cord lateralizing technique, whereby the arytenoid cartilage is directly lateralized to the normal abducted position. Considering pediatric laryngeal anatomy, a small endolaryngeal <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> instrument was designed for precise suture insertion. STUDY DESIGN: New instrument validation. METHODS: Four newborns had inspiratory stridor immediately after birth; two had to be intubated. Laryngotracheoscopy revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Unilateral, left-sided endoscopic arytenoid abduction lateropexy was performed with supraglottic jet ventilation on the 4 th, 5 th, 5 th, and 27 th day {{of life for the}} four patients, respectively. RESULTS: All babies remained intubated for 3 to 7 days with an uncuffed tracheal tube. After extubation, no dyspnea or swallowing disorder occurred. A subjective quality of life questionnaire, laryngotracheoscopy, clinical growth charts, and voice analysis showed satisfactory functional results. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive, quick, reversible endoscopic arytenoid abduction lateropexy might be a more favorable solution for neonatal bilateral vocal cord paralysis than earlier treatment strategies. In one step, the airway can be maintained without the risk of any permanent damage to voice production. Good swallowing function is also preserved. The specially modified endolaryngeal <b>thread</b> <b>guide</b> instrument gives a fast and effective option for creating the lateralized arytenoid position even in the technically challenging surgical context of a neonate larynx.
