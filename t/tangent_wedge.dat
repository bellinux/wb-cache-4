40|$|We {{consider}} a simply connected Lie group G with Lie algebra g and Lie semigroups S; T ` G with <b>tangent</b> <b>wedges</b> L(S), resp. L(T).

40|$|Neeb Let G be a {{connected}} Lie group, g = L(G) its Lie algebra and exp: g → G {{the corresponding}} exponential function. In Part I of this sequence we have defined the <b>tangent</b> <b>wedge</b> of a subsemigroup S ⊆ G {{to be the}} set of subtangent vectors L 1 (S) in the unit element 1. Since this set {{is the same for}} the closed semigroup S we will restrict our attention in the following to closed subsemigroups of G. For a closed subsemigroup the <b>tangent</b> <b>wedge</b> L 1 (S) agrees with the wedge L(S) = {X ∈ g: exp(IR + X) ⊆ S} of infinitesimal generators of S. We say that a closed subsemigroup S of G is a Lie semigroup if it is reconstructable from its <b>tangent</b> <b>wedge</b> L(S), i. e. if S = 〈exp L(S) 〉. We have also seen that L(S) is a Lie wedge in the Lie algebra g and that, in general, not every Lie wedge W ⊆ g is the <b>tangent</b> <b>wedge</b> of a subsemigroup S of G. Those who are will be called global in G. Note that the subalgebras a of g which are global in G are exactly those which are tangent to closed subgroups of G. Nevertheless there exists for every subalgebra a of g a Lie group A such that a ∼ = L(A) (Lie’s Third Theorem). The situation in the semigroup case is more complicated. As we will see in the following there exist Lie semialgebras W, even invariant wedges, which are not global in any Lie group G with W ⊆ L(G), where the inclusion W → L(G) is compatible with the local semigroup structure on a neighborhood of 0 in W (cf. Part II of this sequence). In this third part we will consider the globality problem for invariant Lie semigroups, i. e. Lie semigroups which are invariant under all inner automorphisms of G. It follows directly from the definitions that the pairs (S, G), S an invariant Lie semigroup in G, are in one-to-one correspondence with the pairs (W, g), W an invariant wedge in g which is global in G. So the problem is to characterize those invariant wedges W ⊆ g which are global in G. We will mainly concentrate on simply connected Lie groups G because all the information about the simply connected group associated with a given Lie algebra g is contained in the algebraic structure of g, and we may reasonably hope that in this case one can find algebraic and geometric characterizations of the global wedges W ⊆ g. If W is a subalgebra then it is an ideal of g and the answer is simple. 48 Nee...|$|E

40|$|Study design: A {{retrospective}} chart {{review study}} combined {{with data from}} the Oswestry Disability survey (ODI), and SF- 36 Quality of life questionnaires. Objectives: This study is intended to identify and quantify Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PUF) surgery successes and compare this information to data on Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) surgery. Quality of life, patient satisfaction, fusion stability, continued nerve decompression and need for more surgery are parameters investigated. We use surveys combined with chart review of PLIF patients and compare data with that of previous ALIF research. Background: Lumbar interbody fusion is generally an elective surgical procedure performed to relieve low back pain from segmental instability and/or nerve root compression in the lumbar spine. Indications for this surgery range from intractable back pain and radicular pain occurring over time to sudden nerve compression. Progressive weakness is an urgent indication for surgery. Orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons commonly perform spinal fusion with good success and few complications. Neurosurgical advances in technique and instrumentation allow the lumbar 2 ̆ 7 fusion to be performed using a posterior approach or PLIF (posterior lumbar interbody fusion). The PLIF approach uses a small incision, 5 - 7 cm on average directly over the vertebrae to be fused. After decompression of nerve roots, <b>tangent</b> <b>wedges</b> placed in the interspace maintain the vertebral height and pedicle screws and rod fixation maintain the segmental stability until fusion occurs. This approach necessitates working around delicate spinal nerves with nerve damage as an inherent risk. Anterior approach to lumbar interbody fusion, (ALIF) must traverse abdominal musculature, vasculature and organs, which require longer hospital stays {{and the possibility of}} injury to these structures. Mini-open and laparoscopic techniques have been successful thereby reducing risks during an anterior approach. Methods: Inclusion criteria for the first arm of the study were patients who filled out the SF- 36. (short form 36) quality of life questionnaire within the last 8 months. A retrospective chart review of these patients was performed to compare objective measures of current PLIF technique with the same parameters reported in the literature for AUF. These same patients were asked to complete an Oswestrylow back pain questionnaire (ODI) and contributed to arm 2 of the study. This information was used to compare overall immediate post-surgical disability of PLlF patients to ratings reported for ALIF. In the second arm of the study stability over time and patient satisfaction with PLIF was analyzed by way of current disability ratings 12 to 27 months out from surgery. Inclusion criteria consisted of 150 consecutive patients from October 2000 to March 2002 who underwent PLIF surgery and returned Oswestry questionnaires. ODI surveys contained an additional four questions assessing patient satisfaction. The study was performed as a cross-sectional survey of patients representing a broad spectrum of diagnosis and chronicity.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model (2 D FEM) has been developed to improve the modeling {{and understanding of the}} friction damping characteristics of freight bogie suspensions. The specific suspension considered utilizes friction dampers with constant pre-load force as are widely used in three-piece bogie wagons in Australia. Unlike simpler models commonly used in rail vehicle dynamics, the FE model developed can accommodate distributed normal forces across the wedge surfaces. The model was tested in bounce modes and compared with the normal equations used to model wedge friction forces, which treat the forces on the wedge as a static problem. The simulation results using the 2 D FEM model showed that the friction damping force is not constant and changes when the suspension is in motion. It was also shown that the force changes magnitude during the loading and unloading situations. The factors, which affect the change in friction force, are the friction characteristics on wedge contact surfaces, the direction and change in <b>tangent</b> force on <b>wedge</b> angular surface, the elastic deformation of the wedge, the wedge relative movement, and the wedge structure arrangement.

40|$|AbstractAimOur aim was {{to improve}} dose {{distribution}} to the left breast and to determine the dose received by the ipsilateral lung, heart, contralateral lung and contralateral breast during primary left-sided breast irradiation by using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques compared to conventional tangential techniques (CTT). At the same time, different beams of IMRT plans were compared {{to each other in}} respect to CI, HI and organs at risk (OAR) dose. BackgroundConventional early breast cancer treatment consists of lumpectomy followed by whole breast radiation therapy. CTT is a traditional method used for whole breast radiotherapy and includes standard <b>wedged</b> <b>tangents</b> (two opposed <b>wedged</b> tangential photon beams). The IMRT technique has been widely used for many treatment sites, allowing both improved sparing of normal tissues and more conformal dose distributions. IMRT is a new technique for whole breast radiotherapy. IMRT is used to improve conformity and homogeneity and used to reduce OAR doses. Materials and methodsThirty patients with left-sided breast carcinoma were treated between 2005 and 2008 using 6, 18 or mixed 6 / 18 MV photons for primary breast irradiation following breast conserving surgery (BCS). The clinical target volume [CTV] was contoured as a target volume and the contralateral breast, ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung and heart tissues as organs at risk (OAR). IMRT with seven beams (IMRT 7), nine beams (IMRT 9) and 11 beams (IMRT 11) plans were developed and compared with CTT and among each other. The conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), and doses to OAR were compared to each other. ResultsAll of IMRT plans significantly improved CI (CTT: 0. 76; IMRT 7 : 0. 84; IMRT 9 : 0. 84; IMRT 11 : 0. 85), HI (CTT: 1. 16; IMRT 7 : 1. 12; IMRT 9 : 1. 11; IMRT 11 : 1. 11), volume of the ipsilateral lung receiving more than 20 Gy (>V 20 Gy) (CTT: 14. 6; IMRT 7 : 9. 08; IMRT 9 : 8. 10; IMRT 11 : 8. 60), and volume of the heart receiving more than 30 Gy (>V 30 Gy) (CTT: 6. 7; IMRT 7 : 4. 04; IMRT 9 : 2. 80; IMRT 11 : 2. 98) compared to CTT. All IMRT plans were found to significantly decrease >V 20 Gy and >V 30 Gy volumes compared to conformal plans. But IMRT plans increased the volume of OAR receiving low dose radiotherapy: volume of contralateral lung receiving 5 and 10 Gy (CTT: 0. 0 – 0. 0; IMRT 7 : 19. 0 – 0. 7; IMRT 9 : 17. 2 – 0. 66; IMRT 11 : 18. 7 – 0. 58, respectively) and volume of contralateral breast receiving 10 Gy (CTT: 0. 03; IMRT 7 : 0. 38; IMRT 9 : 0. 60; IMRT 11 : 0. 68). The differences among IMRT plans with increased number of beams were not statistically significant. ConclusionIMRT significantly improved conformity and homogeneity index for plans. Heart and lung volumes receiving high doses were decreased, but OAR receiving low doses was increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparison}} of radiotherapy techniques regarding secondary cancer risk has yielded contradictory results possibly {{stemming from the}} many different approaches used to estimate risk. The {{purpose of this study}} was to make a comprehensive evaluation of different available risk models applied to detailed whole-body dose distributions computed by Monte Carlo for various breast radiotherapy techniques including conventional open tangents, 3 D conformal <b>wedged</b> <b>tangents</b> and hybrid intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). First, organ-specific linear risk models developed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) VII committee were applied to mean doses for remote organs only and all solid organs. Then, different general non-linear risk models were applied to the whole body dose distribution. Finally, organ-specific non-linear risk models for the lung and breast were used to assess the secondary cancer risk for these two specific organs. A total of 32 different calculated absolute risks resulted in a broad range of values (between 0. 1 % and 48. 5 %) underlying the large uncertainties in absolute risk calculation. The ratio of risk between two techniques has often been proposed as a more robust assessment of risk than the absolute risk. We found that the ratio of risk between two techniques could also vary substantially considering the different approaches to risk estimation. Sometimes the ratio of risk between two techniques would range between values smaller and larger than one, which then translates into inconsistent results on the potential higher risk of one technique compared to another. We found however that the hybrid IMRT technique resulted in a systematic reduction of risk compared to the other techniques investigated even though the magnitude of this reduction varied substantially with the different approaches investigated. Based on the epidemiological data available, a reasonable approach to risk estimation would be to use organ-specific non-linear risk models applied to the dose distributions of organs within or near the treatment fields (lungs and contralateral breast in the case of breast radiotherapy) as the majority of radiation-induced secondary cancers are found in the beam-bordering regions...|$|R

This paper investigates {{the question whether}} this local semigroup can be embedded into a global topological semigroup in such a fashion that the embedding preserves all existing products and its image is open. In {{the case of a}} strictly positive cone (in particular a finite-dimensional pointed cone) this question will be answered affirmatively. This result contrasts the situation of open embeddings into global subsemigroups of Lie groups, where counterexamples even in low-dimensional Lie groups occur.

In the algebraic {{as well as in the}} topological theory of groups and semigroups divisibility is the major basic concept which allows the introduction of a linear structure by defining an exponential function: If an element is divisible then there is usually a good chance to find a (rational or, by continuous extension, real) one-parameter semigroup passing through it; combining ‘sufficiently many' such one-parameter semigroups gives rise to an exponential function. The solution of Hilbert’s fifth problem and the theory of divisible compact topological semigroups are familiar examples for the successfull application of these ideas.

All wings had a common span, aspect ratio, taper ratio, planform area, and thickness ratio. Wings were translated longitudinally on the body to make tests possible with the total and exposed mean aerodynamic chords located at a fixed body station.
