40|$|This study explores whether {{discourse}} markers {{play a role}} in L 2 {{listening comprehension}} and whether software programs make a difference in L 2 listening comprehension. Two groups of approximately 25 freshman students listened to two versions of three different talks with and without higher order discourse markers. The talks were delivered by a native speaker, a non-native speaker and by a software listening program (NaturalReader © 7. 0). The scorings, compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, indicate that discourse markers play a significant role only in native speaker speech (p< 0, 05). It is seen that the highest mean of comprehension is found in the talks delivered by the native speaker. Computers ranked second in providing more comprehensive <b>talks.</b> <b>Key</b> words: discourse markers, L 2 listening comprehensio...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} how speakers {{contribute to the}} interactive {{rise and fall of}} emotion in problematic interactions in a data set of in-bound telephone conversations collected from call centres in the Philippines. These interactions are between the Filipino Customer Service Representatives (CSR) and American clients who initiate the calls to seek information, clarification, or resolution to a problem. The study draws on Appraisal theory (Martin & White, 2005) to analyse the contribution of the caller and the CSR to initiating, maintaining and adjusting the interpersonal intensity of the interaction. Findings point to a limited reliance on explicit attitude {{on the part of both}} speakers, with attitude more often implied rather than expressed explicitly. Of note, too, is the interdependence of the attitudinal choices on the part of each speaker, and the role that concessive contractors such as just, already, once, yet, and actually, as well as moments of silence can play in the management of the emotive intensity. While we intend the outcomes to make a contribution to professional training in the industry, we also look beyond that context to contribute in theoretical and methodological terms to the analysis of interactions in other contexts where problems need to be resolved through <b>talk.</b> <b>Key</b> words: call centre, spoken interaction, interpersonal meaning, appraisal analysis...|$|R

30|$|The {{final phase}} of coding {{consisted}} of evaluating and comparing the code groups and further combining them to create categories. Code groups represented distinct portions of students’ talk during the interviews. However, quotations within those code groups often co-occurred. This means a single quotation could be assigned more than one code and/or code groups. Consequently, code co-occurrence was used to gauge the level of association between the categories that comprised the final emergent model. Using the patterns of code co-occurrences and my interpretations of how participants <b>talked</b> about <b>key</b> topics also helped determine the semantic relationships between categories and also to inform {{the construction of the}} model.|$|R
