25|$|Throughout Tyrol, the Bavarian {{troops were}} killed or driven out. The <b>Tyroleans</b> fought mainly as skirmishing sharpshooters, taking {{advantage}} of the mountainous nature of the land. They were highly mobile and made use of artificial avalanches to combat their enemies. Following the defeat of the Austrian Army on the Bavarian front, Napoleon dispatched Charles Lefebvre to Tyrol, and by May 19 Innsbruck had been seized again and the rebellion seemed quelled.|$|E

25|$|Following the Treaty of Schönbrunn Tyrol {{was again}} ceded to Bavaria by the Austrian Emperor. On October 21 Bavarian, French and Italian troops {{under the command}} of the Duke Drouet d’Erlon poured into Tyrol, forcing the <b>Tyroleans</b> to retreat to the Bergisel again. As Winter approached, {{supplies}} began to dwindle, and many men left to return to their homes. On 28/29 October, news of the peace treaty that had been signed by Austria reached Tyrol. This had catastrophic effects on the morale of the <b>Tyroleans,</b> and Andreas Hofer, betrayed by his emperor, resorted to drinking. The Tyrolean morale had been broken. On November 1 Drouet d'Erlon had recaptured Innsbruck and the Bergisel, and by 11 November 1809, Tyrol was entirely occupied. Hofer fled into the mountains, and on 5 January 1810 he was betrayed and denounced to the authorities. On 28 January, he, his wife and his son were taken to Bolzano. Napoleon learnt of the capture at the start of February and ordered Hofer to be tried and executed. This order was acted upon soon and Hofer died at the dungeon of the fortress of Mantua on February 20, 1810.|$|E
25|$|After Napoleon's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling and his {{subsequent}} concentration of troops for a decisive battle, the Tyrolean revolt flared {{again and the}} rebels scored many successes in June and July. Lefebvre reoccupied Innsbruck, but the <b>Tyroleans</b> beat the Bavarians in the third Battle of Bergisel on 13 August, chasing {{them out of the}} mountains again. Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon replaced Lefebvre and won a clear cut victory over the rebels in the fourth Battle of Bergisel on 1 November.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with the}} arrival of new Italian-speaking migrants, this led to strong dissatisfaction among South <b>Tyroleans,</b> which culminated in {{terrorist}} acts perpetrated by the Befreiungsausschuss Südtirol (BAS–Committee for the liberation of South Tyrol). In a first phase only public buildings and fascist monuments were targeted. One of the most notable attacks was the Night of Fire, when the South Tyrolean Liberation Committee destroyed a number of electricity pylons. The second phase was bloodier, costing 21 lives (among them four activists and 15 Italian policemen and soldiers), four of them during a BAS ambush at Cima Vallona, province of Belluno, on 25 June 1967.|$|E

25|$|On 11 May, Deroy {{relieved}} Kufstein and its 576-man Bavarian garrison. Major D'Aicher had resisted 3,000 Tyrolean and Austrian besiegers {{for exactly}} a month. The same day, Wrede advanced southeast from Salzburg to attack 600 <b>Tyroleans</b> at Lofer. The Bavarians lost 22 dead and 44 wounded, while inflicting about 70 casualties on their opponents. Wrede pressed on with 7,500 soldiers to Waidring where he battled General-Major Franz Fenner on 12 May. Fenner's 9th Jäger battalion, three squadrons of light horse, six guns, and 1,000 irregulars were driven off with about 100 casualties. The Bavarians lost 40 dead and wounded.|$|E
25|$|Desiring {{to sustain}} the rebellion, Generalissimo Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen ordered his brother Archduke John of Austria to detach a regular {{division}} to support the revolt. Accordingly, John sent Chasteler from the Army of Inner Austria. Before he arrived, the <b>Tyroleans</b> scored a tremendous early success at Innsbruck. For two days, the Tyrolean leader Major Martin Teimer harassed the local Bavarian garrisons with a large force of irregulars. On 13 May, Bavarian Lieutenant General Baron Kinkel surrendered four battalions, two squadrons, and five cannons, a total of 3,860 troops. Teimer's men also trapped a column of 2,050 French conscripts. After an ineffectual defense by hard-drinking General of Division Baptiste Pierre Bisson, the entire column surrendered along with the eagle of the 3rd Line Infantry Regiment.|$|E
25|$|Following defeat by Napoleon in 1805, Austria {{was forced}} to cede Tyrol to the Kingdom of Bavaria in the Peace of Pressburg. Tyrol, {{as a part of}} Bavaria, {{became a member of the}} Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. Consequently, King Maximilian I of Bavaria {{introduced}} far reaching economic, religious and administrative reforms. When in 1808 a new constitution for the Kingdom of Bavaria was introduced, Tyrol was integrated into South Bavaria, and divided into three districts, losing its special status in the kingdom. Furthermore, <b>Tyroleans</b> were now subjected to the Bavarian conscription levies, and faced the prospect of having to fight against Austrian troops. This, together with the economic decline under Bavarian rule, and the kingdom's religious reforms which were opposed by the Catholic population, led to a growing conflict between the Tyrolean population and the Bavarian authorities.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, Mussolini was deposed and Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies, who had invaded southern Italy via Sicily. German troops promptly invaded northern Italy, and South Tyrol {{became part of the}} Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills, annexed to Greater Germany. Many German-speaking South <b>Tyroleans,</b> after years of linguistic oppression and discrimination by Fascist Italy, wanted revenge upon ethnic Italians living in the area (particularly in the larger cities) but were mostly prevented from doing so by the occupying Nazis, who still considered Mussolini head of the Italian Social Republic and wanted to preserve good relations with the Italian Fascists, still supporting Mussolini against the Allies. Although the Nazis were able to recruit South Tyrolean youth and to capture local Jews, they prevented anti-Italian feelings from getting out of hand. Mussolini, who wanted to set up his new pro-German Italian Social Republic in Bolzano, was still a Nazi ally.|$|E
25|$|In 1809 Bavaria {{was again}} engaged in war with Austria {{on the side}} of France. The <b>Tyroleans</b> rose up against the Bavarian {{authority}} and succeeded three times in defeating Bavarian and French troops trying to retake the country. Austria lost the war of the Fifth Coalition against France, and got even harsher terms in the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809. Often glorified as Tirol's national hero, Andreas Hofer, the leader of the uprising, was executed in 1810 in Mantua, having lost a third and final battle against the French and Bavarian forces. By the treaty signed at Paris on 28 February 1810 Bavaria ceded southern Tirol to Italy and some small districts to Württemberg, receiving as compensation parts of Salzburg, the Innviertel and Hausruck and the principalities of Bayreuth and Regensburg. So far the policy of Montgelas had been brilliantly successful; but the star of Napoleon had now reached its zenith and already the astute opportunist had noted the signs of the coming change.|$|E
25|$|After Archduke Karl’s Austrian {{army was}} {{defeated}} by Napoleon at the Battle of Wagram, the Armistice of Znaim was signed. Point IV of the agreement stated that Austria was to withdraw its troops from the territories of Vorarlberg and Tyrol, returning them to Bavarian rule. But the Bavarians and the French {{found it difficult to}} gain control of the territory, with Tyrolean sharpshooters occupying high places along the roads, blocking roads and setting off avalanches to harm the occupying army. The <b>Tyroleans</b> managed to hold off and inflict heavy casualties on the French and Bavarian troops, and on August 13 the Tyrolean peasant army rallied at the Bergisel again for the decisive Battle. 15000 Bavarian, French and Saxon troops faced almost the same number of Tyrolean irregulars. Surrounded on all sides by the irregulars, and having sustained heavy casualties, Lefebvre was forced to withdraw. Andreas Hofer, who in the meantime had advanced to supreme commander of the insurgents, became regent of Tyrol {{in the name of the}} Emperor.|$|E

25|$|During the {{fighting}} at Tarvis, Joubert's column continued to advance. The French general repulsed {{an attack by}} General-major Johann Ludwig Alexius von Loudon at Neumarkt on 21 March. Dropping off Delmas' 5,000-man division to guard his supply line, Joubert pressed forward to Klausen where he again defeated Kerpen on the 22nd. The Austrian retreated northeast to Mittenwald where he was beaten again on 28 March and pushed out of Sterzing. With the Tyrolese militia turning out in droves to fight the French invaders, Joubert was compelled to fall back to Brixen. On 31 March, Kerpen attacked the French at Brixen {{but was unable to}} dislodge them. After being reinforced to 12,000 men by the arrival of Laudon's brigade, Kerpen again assaulted Brixen on 2 April without success. Nevertheless, under continuing pressure, Delmas withdrew from Bolzano (Bozen) on 4 April. The next day, Joubert set out for Villach and the appointed junction with Bonaparte. After continuous skirmishing with the <b>Tyroleans,</b> his column reached there on 8 May, well after the Leoben agreement. During Joubert's campaign French losses may have reached as high as 8,000 men.|$|E
25|$|When the {{guardianship}} of Sigismund {{ended on}} 25 July 1443 and Friedrich, now King Friedrich III of the Holy Roman Empire, decided to prolong it for another six years, the Landstände of Tyrol organized an open revolt. Oswald {{became one of}} five military commanders and was tasked with the defence {{of the most important}} of all positions, the Mühlbacher Klause (Mühlbach fortress), which blocked the most likely invasion route from Styria, where King Friedrich had taken up residence. The cities of Merano and Bolzano provided funds and troops to reinforce the fortress, and all other passes and entrances into Tyrol were blocked by troops. As the city of Trento backed the King, an army of 3,000 men was sent south to besiege the city. On 10 December, a Tyrolean delegation arrived in Graz to demand the release of Sigismund and the return of the county's treasures, taken by Friedrich in 1440. Friedrich refused and threatened war. The <b>Tyroleans</b> responded by sacking Trento and electing Johann Röttel as the new bishop on 4 January 1440. Röttel's first declaration was to fully support the Landstände against the King. Oswald was one of the electors and the main instigator of this election. The next session by the Landstände began in Merano on 16 May 1445, and as it was now clear that King Friedrich was not planning an attack, options were discussed on how to bring Sigismund to Tyrol.|$|E
500|$|Under {{the auspices}} of State Secretary Wilhelm Stuckart the Reich Interior Ministry {{produced}} an initial memo for the planned annexation of a strip of eastern France in June 1940, stretching {{from the mouth of}} the Somme to Lake Geneva, and on July 10, 1940, Himmler toured the region to inspect its Germanization potential. According to documents produced in December 1940, the annexed territory would consist of nine French departments, and the Germanization action would require the settlement of a million Germans from [...] "peasant families". Himmler decided that South Tyrolean emigrants (see South Tyrol Option Agreement) would be used as settlers, and the towns of the region would receive South Tyrolean place-names such as Bozen, Brixen, Meran, and so on. By 1942 Hitler had, however, decided that the South <b>Tyroleans</b> would be instead used to settle the Crimea, and Himmler regretfully noted [...] "For Burgundy, we will just have to find another [...] ethnic group." ...|$|E
50|$|As its {{successor}} in Tyrol, the 64th <b>Tyrolean</b> Rifles (Tiroler Jägerregiment Nr. 64) was established, {{based on}} a <b>Tyrolean</b> rifle corps and the battalion of Kurzschen Jäger ("Kurz Rifles"). When Tyrol fell to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1805, the name <b>Tyrolean</b> Rifles was withdrawn. After the return of Tyrol to the Austrian Empire in 1814, the reorganization of a <b>Tyrolean</b> rifle corps was immediately begun. Initially it consisted of one battalion, but was later expanded to three. The inhaber of the Rifles was Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Philipp Fenner von Fenneberg (1762-1824), {{which resulted in the}} contemporary title of Fennerjäger.|$|R

500|$|Following the Axis {{occupation}} of Yugoslavia, Drljević {{had become a}} proponent of the theory that Montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from Serbs. As early as 1921, he had stated that Serbian and Montenegrin [...] "mentalities" [...] were diametrically opposed. He stated: [...] "The mentalities of Serbians and Montenegrins are irreconcilable. The visage of the former was speckled with [...] slavery; liberty gave the latter a new visage." [...] It was not until 1941 that Drljević advanced the notion that Montenegrins were not Slavs at all, but Dinaric people descended from the ancient Illyrians. He wrote:Races are communities of blood, whereas people are creatures of history. With their language, the Montenegrin people belong to the Slavic linguistic community. By their blood, however, they belong [...] According to the contemporary science of European races, [...] peoples are descended from the Illyrians.

2500|$|South Tyrol, a disputed {{territory}} in the Alps, was returned to Italy. The [...] "thirty-second decision" [...] of the Council of Foreign Ministers to grant South Tyrol to Italy (4 September 1945) disregarded popular opinion in Austria and the possible effects of a forced repatriation of 200,000 German-speaking <b>Tyroleans.</b> The decision was motivated largely by the British desire to reward Italy, a country far {{more important for the}} containment of world communism. Renner's objections came in too late and carried too little weight to have effect. Popular and official protests continued through 1946. The signatures of 150,000 South <b>Tyroleans</b> did not alter the decision. South Tyrol is today an Italian autonomous province (Bolzano/Bozen) with a German-speaking majority.|$|E
