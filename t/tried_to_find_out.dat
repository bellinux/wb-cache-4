500|$|The Archbishop of Ohrid, Atanasije, {{after his}} {{movement}} had largely failed in Albania, {{was now in}} Rome. [...] The Serb uprising had no better luck; the Herzegovinian tribes, Drobnjaci, Nikšić and Piva began fighting, but were defeated at the field of Gacko (Gatačko Polje) by Dervish Bey sometime in 1597. According to the Venetian Lazzaro Soranzo (1599), the Piperi, Kuči, Klimenti, Bjelopavlići and others tried to liberate themselves from Ottoman tyranny, and upon hearing the false claim that Sultan Mehmed III lost the battle and his life at the Siege of Eger, [...] "they all rose up {{under the command of}} vojvoda Grdan and there was a great slaughter of Turks who were on their land. As I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> more, I heard the contrary, that they unhappily withdrew into their mountains"; Montenegrin historian Gligor Stanojević, based on Soranzo's account, which he described as [...] "the most interesting and most contradicting note on the movement of the Brda and Herzegovina tribes in this time", believed that the rebellion did not have the scale of a national uprising.|$|E

2500|$|Dan gave Chrissie the {{impression}} he was homophobic. Astill said that his actions to a certain extent, were homophobic. He covered up his feelings {{because he did not}} like them. Astill and Akingbola filmed [...] "technical" [...] fight scenes which followed, which resulted in Dan having noticeable injuries to his face.

2500|$|It's notable that Einstein's paper {{contains}} no direct references to other papers. However, many historians of science like Holton, Miller, Stachel, have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> possible influences on Einstein. He stated that his thinking {{was influenced by}} the empiricist philosophers David Hume and Ernst Mach. Regarding the Relativity Principle, the moving magnet and conductor problem (possibly after reading a book of August Föppl) and the various negative aether drift experiments were important for him to accept that principle— but he denied any significant influence of the most important experiment: the Michelson–Morley experiment. Other likely influences include Poincaré's Science and Hypothesis, where Poincaré presented the Principle of Relativity (which, as has been reported by Einstein's friend Maurice Solovine, was closely studied and discussed by Einstein and his friends {{over a period of years}} before the publication of Einstein's 1905 paper), and the writings of Max Abraham, from whom he borrowed the terms [...] "Maxwell-Hertz equations" [...] and [...] "longitudinal and transverse mass".|$|E
2500|$|When President Ronald Reagan signed {{legislation}} {{establishing the}} Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, {{she was at}} the event. Reagan called her to personally apologize for a remark he made during a nationally televised conference, where he said we would know in [...] "35 years" [...] whether or not King was a communist sympathizer. Reagan clarified his remarks came {{from the fact that the}} papers had been sealed off until the year 2027. King accepted the apology and pointed out the Senate Select Committee on Assassinations had not found any basis to suggest her husband had communist ties. On February 9, 1987, eight civil rights activists were jailed for protesting the exclusion of African-Americans during the filming of The Oprah Winfrey Show in Cumming, Georgia. Oprah Winfrey <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> why the [...] "community has not allowed black people to live there since 1912." [...] King was outraged over the arrests, and wanted members of the group, [...] "Coalition to End Fear and Intimidation in Forsyth County," [...] to meet with Georgia Governor Joe Frank Harris to [...] "seek a just resolution of the situation." [...] On March 8, 1989, King lectured hundreds of students about the civil rights movement at the University of San Diego. King tried to not get involved in the controversy around the naming of the San Diego Convention Center after her husband. She maintained it was up to the [...] "people within the community" [...] and that people had tried to get her involved in with [...] "those kind of local situations." ...|$|E
