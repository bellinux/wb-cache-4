5|$|The Smart Cover, {{introduced}} {{with the}} iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically {{attaches to the}} face of the iPad. The cover has three folds which allow it <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> a stand, which is also held together by magnets. The Smart Cover can also assume other positions by folding it. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the unit when the cover is removed. It comes in five colors of both polyurethane and the more expensive leather.|$|E
5|$|When it was {{announced}} that the wing would be restructured and Otis Air National Guard Base would remain open, discussions began {{about the future of the}} 102d. Staff of the 102d and those at Massachusetts Air National Guard headquarters considered a plan centered on the idea that the wing could transition to an intelligence mission to support the growing War on Terror. The idea hit a roadblock when it {{was announced}} that the funds which the wing could use <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> its new mission had been depleted.|$|E
5|$|The Smart Cover, first {{introduced}} with the iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically {{attaches to the}} face of the iPad. The cover has three folds which allow it <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> a stand, which is also held together by magnets. While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive than the polyurethane version.|$|E

5|$|Smart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to {{the face}} of the iPad 2, 3, or 4. The cover has three folds which allow it <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> a stand, which is also held {{together}} by magnets. While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad (which wakes up when the cover is removed). There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive. Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad. In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case - a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship would}} have been faster and larger {{than any of the}} other ships Germany {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> auxiliary carriers. However, a number of design problems emerged as the drawing up of the conversion plan progressed. Her speed and capacity advantages were offset by several serious practical problems. These included structural weakness, caused by the need to recess the hangar deck into the primary structural deck; instability, normally resolved by adding bulges; and high fuel consumption. Another significant obstacle was the unwillingness of Hermann Göring, the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, to provide the Kriegsmarine with sufficient aircraft and pilots. By the time the design was completed in November 1942, these problems had proved impossible to rectify, and so the project was abandoned. As a result, no construction work began. After the end of the war, Europa was seized by the US Army and commissioned as a troop transport under the name AP 177 before being transferred to France, where she resumed her commercial duties.|$|E
5|$|Domestically, Henry {{is known}} for his radical changes to the English Constitution, {{ushering}} in the theory of the divine right of kings to England. Besides asserting the sovereign's supremacy over the Church of England, he greatly expanded royal power during his reign. Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial, by means of bills of attainder. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, Richard Rich, and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in Henry's administration. He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> royal revenue the money that was formerly paid to Rome. Despite the influx of money from these sources, Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars, particularly with Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as he sought to enforce his claim to the Kingdom of France. At home, he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{formation}} of The Monkees, Michael Nesmith liked twelve-string electric guitars. At the time, only Rickenbacker and Vox mass-produced them. Nesmith preferred the bluesy twangy {{sound of a}} Gretsch over the distinctive pop sound of a Rickenbacker. According to Nesmith, there was a luthier in Los Angeles who converted six-string electric guitars into twelve-string guitars. Nesmith bought a Gretsch Country Gentleman <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> a twelve-string, {{and that is the}} guitar he used in the pilot episode of The Monkees.|$|E
25|$|Vanilla {{convertible}} bonds {{are the most}} plain convertible structures. They grant the holder the right <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> {{a certain number of}} shares determined according to a conversion price determined in advance. They may offer coupon regular payments during the life of the security and have a fixed maturity date where the nominal value of the bond is redeemable by the holder. This type is the most common convertible type and is typically providing the asymmetric returns profile and positive convexity often wrongly associated to the entire asset class: at maturity the holder would indeed either convert into shares or request the redemption at par depending on whether or not the stock price is above the conversion price.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Sean Canfield threw an {{interception}} on the Cal 1-yard line, but Kevin Riley was intercepted in turn, which the Beavers were able <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> a field goal. In the fourth quarter, Oregon State {{put together a}} scoring drive over six minutes long that culminated in a 24-yard touchdown run by Jacquizz Rodgers. With the game out of reach, Riley led the Bears on a drive lasting {{less than a minute}} that ended in a 2-yard touchdown pass to Verran Tucker with a minute left to play. An attempt at an onside kick was recovered by Oregon State, and Canfield took two straight knees to end the game.|$|E

25|$|Lecca's other {{proposal}} {{was for the}} CE to replace all Jewish political bodies. As a result, in January 1942, Antonescu outlawed the traditional Jewish Federation, which had been founded by activist Wilhelm Filderman. Antonescu's order also hindered the growing Zionist movement, who had Mișu Benvenisti for its animator. According to Benvenisti's own reports, Richter and the CE were directly interested in destroying Romania's Zionist organizations. In practice, the CE was unable to earn the respect of most Romanian Jews, and Lecca resorted to co-opting Federation activists, and even some committed Zionists, on the CE leadership board. When the Zionists threatened <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> an anti-German resistance movement, Lecca reluctantly overturned some of Richter's anti-Zionist measures.|$|E
25|$|Saad and {{his wife}} Sangeeta now run eco-resorts {{on the banks of}} the Kabini River in Karnataka. They started their {{conservation}} career at Bandipur National Park in Karnataka in 1992. The Jungs owned a hunting lodge in Bandipur which Sangeeta decided <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> an eco-resort. The Bandipur lodge was then bought by Club Mahindra. As Bandipur turned commercial, the Jungs purchased a piece of land near the Kabini backwaters in 1993. Today their son Shaaz Jung runs the eco-tourism resort with African-style tents and local cuisine. They aim to reconcile the needs of the local people with the needs of conservation. They have also been taking safari tours to Africa since 1995.|$|E
25|$|The {{extracellular}} {{domain of}} Eph receptors {{is composed of}} a highly conserved globular ephrin ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich region and two fibronectin type III domains. The cytoplasmic domain of Eph receptors is composed of a juxtamembrane region with two conserved tyrosine residues, a tyrosine kinase domain, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a PDZ-binding motif. Following binding of an ephrin ligand to the extracellular globular domain of an Eph receptor, tyrosine and serine residues in the juxtamembrane region of the Eph become phosphorylated allowing the intracellular tyrosine kinase <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> its active form and subsequently activate or repress downstream signaling cascades. The structure of the trans-autophosphorylation of the juxtamembrane region of EPHA2 has been observed within a crystal of EPHA2.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the matter of holding public office, Jews were also unequal to Christians {{with respect to the}} ownership of slaves. Restrictions on the ownership of Christian slaves by Jews were in place through the reign of many emperors, under the fear that Jews would use conversion of slaves as a means to increase their number. Additionally, this was designed to provide an incentive for non-Christian slaves <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> Christianity, and an economic restriction on the Jews. Restrictions on slave-owning could not, however, be excessively burdensome, because slaves, although numerous, were between 10-15% of the population. Under the Theodosian Code, therefore, ownership of Christian slaves by Jews was not prohibited, although their purchase was. Thus, one who gained possession of a slave by means such as inheritance would remain his or her owner. Purchase of slaves was usually penalized by compelled sale at the original purchase price.|$|E
25|$|When the Germans {{began their}} {{offensive}} in the Ardennes in December 1944 (the Battle of the Bulge) and briefly threatened {{to break through}} to Antwerp, 80 AA Bde was warned on 20 December to prepare <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> an Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) at short notice. AGRAs were groups of (usually) medium and heavy artillery held at Corps level. If necessary, the brigade would control 98th and 99th (London Welsh) HAA Rgts {{to operate in the}} medium role supporting 11th Armoured Division and 3rd AGRA. The brigade would also be responsible for the ground defence of the approaches to Tirlemont, taking anti-paratroop measures. 86th (HAC) HAA regiment, which was relieving 98th HAA Rgt in the Antwerp X defences, was to lend its transport (1584 Platoon, RASC) to make the latter regiment fully mobile. Despite concerted attacks on nearby airfields by Luftwaffe fighters on 1 January (Operation Bodenplatte), the ground situation was well under control and the AGRA and local defence plans were cancelled on that day.|$|E
25|$|The term carpet bag, which {{literally}} {{refers to}} a suitcase made from a piece of carpet, is used in several figurative contexts. The term gained a popular usage after the American Civil War to refer to carpetbaggers, Northerners {{who moved to the}} South after the war, especially during the Reconstruction era (1865–1877). Carpetbaggers allegedly politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for financial and power gains. In modern usage in the U.S., the term is sometimes used derisively to refer to a politician who runs for public office in an area where he or she does not have deep community ties, or has lived only for a short time. In the United Kingdom, the term was adopted to refer informally to those who join a mutual organization, such as a building society, in order to force it to demutualize, that is, <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>into</b> a joint stock company, solely for personal financial gain.|$|E
