5|$|Children {{may have}} {{behaviors}} that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not. These include breath-holding spells, bed wetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks.

5|$|Immature {{birds have}} duller and less demarcated plumage.

The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen.|$|E

5|$|The juveniles’ {{markings}} {{follow a}} similar pattern to adult birds, but they are washed with a rusty brown {{on the head and}} upper breast, and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> wings are mottled buff or brown with prominent white tips. The young birds’ eyes are brown.|$|E

5|$|The spiny {{plates on}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{tail of the}} tuatara {{resemble}} those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to break off its tail when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it.|$|E
5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits down the middle of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> bottom of the eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, {{the top of the}} eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E

5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Another nimja palace {{structure}} lies to {{the southeast}} of the main plaza. Excavations in 1972 uncovered a simple superstructure consisting of {{a room with a}} bench at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> an altar in the middle. Six funerary urns were found in the remains of the palace, one of which was found near the altar and contained rich offerings that included a gold necklace. There were traces of hearths at each extreme of the main chamber.|$|E
5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Van Nistelrooy was {{immediately}} confronted by Arsenal players Martin Keown, Lauren, Ray Parlour, Ashley Cole and Kolo Touré. Keown jumped {{up next to}} Van Nistelrooy and brought his arms {{down hard on the}} Dutchman's back, while Lauren pushed Van Nistelrooy in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> Parlour and Cole offered verbal abuse. Van Nistelrooy did not react and was escorted away by Manchester United captain Roy Keane, but the incident escalated away from the two of them. In defence of their teammate, Manchester United players Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gary Neville, Mikaël Silvestre, Quinton Fortune and Rio Ferdinand also became involved in the situation.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{description}} of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> loins, as well as features typical of a spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty swallowing, muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep reflexes, paresthesia (pins and needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to {{ten days after}} early symptoms begin, progresses {{for two to three}} days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.|$|E

5|$|Editors' own {{variation}} of dark indie guitar rock draws on influences from both older and contemporary bands.

The band draw their musical style {{particularly from the}} latter two bands' debut albums Asleep in <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> <b>and</b> Murmur. While often compared to Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen by the media, the band commented that those bands are too old {{to have a major}} impact on their musical style. Upon Editors' first appearances in the British music scene, they were also heavily compared to American indie band Interpol.|$|E
5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch.

The interior of the building was plastered by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the plastering for free.|$|E
5|$|Gail Kim {{defended the}} TNA Women's Knockout Championship against Awesome Kong in a No Disqualification match. It {{began with the}} two {{fighting}} throughout the crowd, before entering the ring. There, Kong performed her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver on the referee and followed by hitting him with a steel chair. Kim took the steel chair from Kong, bashed her over <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> head with it, before getting a near-fall which was counted by a replacement referee. Kong then proceeded to try an Awesome Bomb on the second referee, but was stopped by Kim as she attempted a roll-up pin {{which led to the}} three count and the retaining of the TNA Women's Knockout Championship at twelve minutes and forty-four seconds. Following the contest, Kong and Kim fought at ringside before it was broken up by security.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the mechanical load on <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> <b>and</b> shoulders during pushing and pulling in combination with three task constraints: the use of one or two hands, three cart weights, and two handle heights. The second objective was to explore the relation between the initial and sustained exerted forces and the mechanical load on <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> <b>and</b> shoulders. Detailed biomechanical models of <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> <b>and</b> shoulder joint were used to estimate mechanical loading. Using generalized estimating equations (GEE) the effects were quantified for exerted push/pull forces, net moments at <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> <b>and</b> shoulders, compressive and shear forces at <b>the</b> low <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> compressive forces at the glenohumeral joint. The results of this study appeared to be useful to estimate ergonomics consequences of interventions in the working constraints during pushing and pulling. Cart weight as well as handle height had a considerable effect on the mechanical load and it is recommended to maintain low cart weights and to push or pull at shoulder height. Initial and sustained exerted forces were not highly correlated with the mechanical load at <b>the</b> low <b>back</b> <b>and</b> shoulders within <b>the</b> studied range of the exerted force...|$|R
