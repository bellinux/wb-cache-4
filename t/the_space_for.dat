5|$|Gravesend Blockhouse was {{designed}} by the Clerk of the King's Works, James Nedeham, and the Master of Ordnance, Christopher Morice, with Robert Lorde serving as the paymaster for the project and Lionel Martin, John Ganyn and Mr Travers acting as the local overseers. The Crown bought the land for the fort, along with <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> Gravesend Blockhouse, from William Burston for £66; it is uncertain how much the building work cost, but earlier estimates in 1539 had suggested that it would cost £211 to build such a blockhouse, including the 150,000 bricks and quantities of stone, chalk, lime, timber and labour that would be needed. The work was quickly completed, and by 1540 the blockhouse was fully operational.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{structure}} {{was used by}} and for student organizations. Formerly housed in the Calisthenium and Riding Academy and later the Alumnae Gymnasium, the Philaletheis Society moved into the Students' Building upon its opening and began to use <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> its theatrical performances. The junior prom, lectures from {{a wide array of}} speakers, and faculty-led skits all took place beneath the building's roof. Vassar's yearbook, the Vassarion, as well as its weekly newspaper, The Miscellany News, were also headquartered in the Students' Building. An annual Christmas party, complete with students clad as reindeer pulling a sled on which sat political science professor Charles Gordon Post dressed as Santa Claus, once occurred within the building as well.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk opened up <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur {{stuck in a}} tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E

5|$|The trend had {{substantial}} {{implications for}} many early skyscrapers. Some were redesigned to fit new tastes. Much of the ornate detail {{was removed from}} the Metropolitan Life Tower in the 1960s, for example, to fit contemporary, plainer fashions. Many older skyscrapers could not be adapted, however, as they lacked the physical depth to build larger modern offices or <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> new service facilities. Some were demolished to make way for new, larger structures. Amongst these was the Singer Tower, demolished in 1968 and replaced by the international style United States Steel Building. In the 21st century, buildings such as 90 West Street have been renovated as upmarket housing, partially because of their extensive windows and access to sunlight.|$|E

This end board style was recreated for the, less frequently seen, static captions. This style was changed on 1 May 2004 to an orange background that would close shut over {{the end of a}} promotion to contain the programme title.

25|$|Corvettes had {{adequate}} endurance for MOEF assignments, but {{the fuel}} economy of destroyers was poor at the speeds that convoys operated. The escort group leaders were modern destroyers with adequate endurance but, {{of the older}} destroyers allocated to trade convoy escort, only the Clemson subgroup of the Town-class destroyers proved suitable for MOEF assignments. Wickes-class destroyers were useful for the Canadian WLEF and the American Iceland shuttle; but lacked endurance to stay with a trade convoy for the full distance covered by the MOEF Escort Groups. The Admiralty converted some V and W-class destroyers to long range escorts by removing the forward boiler and using <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> additional fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|The Syrian Cultural Caravan has the {{political}} aim to re-establish {{the complexity of}} the Syrian conflict. It provides the public with another narrative, counterweighting the simplified stories of bombings, attacks and terrorism found in the media. The work of artists is, according to Leila Shahid in La Marseilleise, a universal language to express the Syrian people’s suffering. It gives the opportunity for artists of the caravan to contribute in their own way to raise awareness and engage the public, {{while at the same time}} reflecting on what kind of change art can bring. They do not wish to offer a blueprint, unidimensional solution to the conflict but rather they open up <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> dialogue by creating a platform of exchange.|$|E

25|$|Various {{manufacturers}} {{use different}} driver mounting arrangements {{to create a}} specific type of sound field in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal (some using this approach are called monitors, as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose—the 2201. Later Bose models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by the loudspeaker itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in high fidelity circles, but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.|$|E
25|$|Parallel to {{the same}} process, SR Slovenia {{witnessed}} a policy of gradual liberalization since 1984, somewhat similar to the Soviet Perestroika. This provoked tensions between the League of Communists of Slovenia on one side, and the central Yugoslav Party and the federal army on the other side. By the late 1980s, many civil society groups were pushing towards democratization, while widening <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> cultural plurality. In 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging civil society and the Communist regime culminated with the so-called Slovene Spring, a mass movement for democratic reforms. The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights was established as the platform of all major non-Communist political movements. By early 1989, several anti-Communist political parties were already openly functioning, challenging the hegemony of the Slovenian Communists. Soon, the Slovenian Communists, pressured by their own civil society, came into conflict with the Serbian Communist leadership.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 2006, the station's studios {{moved to}} a new {{facility}} near Winnipeg's MTS Centre. This move was mostly caused by recent retail developments in the area, which includes the Polo Park Shopping Centre, and the likelihood that CKY's studios were bought off by developers who would use <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>for</b> additional retail opportunities. The recent demolition of Winnipeg Arena and the possible development of a new football stadium to replace Canad Inns Stadium would have likely placed the broadcasting facility in an awkward position of being surrounded by retail developments, making their property more valuable. CKY's new studios uses state-of-the-art technology, and virtually nothing was moved from the old studios to the new facility. The existing news set was moved to CFQC, the CTV affiliate in Saskatoon, and some technical equipment was sent to CTV's Quebec City bureau. In addition, the master control of the station was moved to 9 Channel Nine Court, home of flagship CTV station CFTO-TV in Toronto.|$|E
