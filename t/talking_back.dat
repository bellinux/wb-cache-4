5|$|In 2009, Winslet narrated the English {{version of}} an Icelandic {{documentary}} named A Mother's Courage: <b>Talking</b> <b>Back</b> to Autism, about Margret Ericsdottir whose child, Keli Thorsteinsson, suffers from non-verbal autism. Inspired by the story, she teamed with Ericsdottir in 2010 to form an NGO named the Golden Hat Foundation. The organisation aims to create autism awareness and was named after a poem written by Thorsteinsson. As the brand ambassador of the luxury brands Lancôme and Longines, Winslet partnered with these companies to raise awareness and funds for the foundation. She created a make-up collection for Lancôme in 2011, and in 2017, she designed a new watch for Longines.|$|E

In 2015 the play Rizzo by Bruce Graham based on Paolantonio's book premiered at Theatre Exile in Philadelphia. More critical comments on Rizzo's tenure as police commissioner and mayor are found in Andrea Mitchell's book <b>Talking</b> <b>Back.</b> Phyllis Kaniss' The Media and the Mayor's Race is an analysis of local journalistic coverage of Rizzo's last campaign; it describes the tactics he used against Castille and planned to use against Rendell.|$|E

500|$|Both sides {{committed}} {{human rights}} abuses in Anbar Province, often involving civilians {{caught in the middle}} of the conflict. [...] By late 2005, abuses had gotten so common that one American officer nonchalantly referred to [...] "discovering... 20 bodies here, 20 bodies there" [...] and the head of MNF-W referred to them as [...] "a cost of doing business." [...] During Operation Steel Curtain, insurgents forced their way into peoples' houses and held them hostage while engaging in gun battles with American forces, who often destroyed the homes. One Sunni Iraqi family described how in 2006 they fled the sectarian violence in Baghdad to Hīt. During their yearlong stay in Hīt, they watched AQI fighters kidnap a man for <b>talking</b> <b>back</b> to them; the fighters later dumped the man's body on his doorstep. The family also watched an American patrol hit a mine in front of their house, and worried that the Americans would conduct reprisal killings on the family. [...] An Iraqi sheikh spoke about how he was accidentally shot and arrested by the Americans and thrown in Abu Ghraib prison where he was tortured. [...] After his release he was targeted by insurgents in Fallujah who thought he was an American spy.|$|E

500|$|In Olajuwon's {{college career}} and {{early years in}} the NBA, he was often undisciplined, <b>talking</b> <b>back</b> to officials, getting in minor fights with other players and {{amassing}} technical fouls. Later, Olajuwon took an active interest in spirituality, becoming a more devout Muslim. On March 9, 1991, he altered his name from Akeem to the more conventional spelling of Hakeem, saying, [...] "I'm not changing the spelling of my name, I'm correcting it". He later recalled, [...] "I studied the Qur'an every day. At home, at the mosque...I would read it in airplanes, before games and after them. I was soaking up the faith and learning new meanings each time I turned a page. I didn't dabble in the faith, I gave myself over to it." [...] "His religion dominates his life", Drexler said in 1995. Olajuwon was still {{recognized as one of}} the league's elite centers despite his strict observance of Ramadan (i.e., abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours for about a month), which occurred during the playing season throughout his career. Olajuwon was noted as sometimes playing better during the month, and in 1995 he was named NBA Player of the Month in February, even though Ramadan began on February 1 of that year.|$|E

The study aimed to examine how <b>Talk</b> <b>Back,</b> an interactive HIV and AIDS educational programme on Botswana television, capacitates the school community to deal with challenges brought about by the HIV and AIDS epidemic. The study was based on recordings of 2014 Term One theme— ‘Paediatric care and support: challenges and implications in the teaching and learning environment. The study conducted a content analysis of <b>Talk</b> <b>Back</b> to determine behaviour change communication categories employed in producing the programme. All aspects of the <b>Talk</b> <b>Back</b> programme were also analysed to establish communication strategies employed in the presentation of content. <b>Talk</b> <b>Back</b> employed communication approaches such as panel discussions of matters related to HIV and AIDS by various specialists, video clips to present content, and viewers phoning in to interact with the panellists. A number of the callers identified challenges; the most common identified challenge was that parents tended not to disclose their children’s HIV status to the children due to the negative social stigma attached to HIV and AIDS. Although <b>Talk</b> <b>Back</b> provides a forum for interactive behaviour change communication, some listeners questioned the use of technical language...|$|R
