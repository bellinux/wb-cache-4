The rates of development of larvae were assessed. The larvae did not reach adulthood in fat and liver. Comparisons between data from different tissues indicated differences in the size, weight and development of larvae of the same age. Brain and muscle were the substrates that had the lowest frequencies of emergence of imagoes. A longer time for development was observed in the brain, while shorter times were observed in lung and intestine. Lung and intestine were also the substrates from which greater numbers of imagoes emerged. Larvae in muscle presented smaller size and lower weight.

Solvent pots are not usually bombs, or even Schlenk flasks in the classic sense. The most common configuration of a solvent pot is a simple round bottom flask attached to a 180° adapter fitted with some form of valve. The pot can be attached to a manifold and the contents distilled or vacuum <b>transferred</b> to other <b>flasks</b> free of soluble drying agents, water, oxygen or nitrogen. The term [...] "solvent pot" [...] can also refer to the flask containing the drying agents in a classic solvent still system. Due to fire risks, solvent stills have largely been replaced by solvent columns in which degassed solvent is forced through an insoluble drying agent before being collected. Solvent is usually collected from solvent columns through a needle connected to the column which pierces the septum of a flask or through a ground glass joint connected to the column, {{as in the case}} of a Straus flask.|$|R
40|$|The Brazilian micro-orchid Microlaelia lundii enchants by its {{beautiful}} blooms in winter, but its cultivation {{is still a}} challenge, requiring specific care. The objectiv of this work was to evaluate the influence of light sources and culture media on in vitro growth and ex vitro survival of this micro-orchid. M. lundii seedlings were <b>transferred</b> to <b>flasks</b> containing the culture medium ½ MS and Simplified Medium, consisting of 5 mL L- 1 of Biofert Plus® NPK fertilizer (09 - 08 - 09) and 60 g L- 1 of ‘Nanica’ banana pulp. These flasks were placed in a growth chamber composed of seven environments, characterized by types of lighting: L 1) LEDtube 4000 K; L 2) LEDtube 6500 K; L 3) L 1 + L 2; L 4) L 1 + L 1; L 5) red LED; L 6) blue LED; L 7) fluorescent lamp (control). After 200 days of cultivation, biometric growth parameters and leaves chlorophyll content were evaluated together with the percentage of seedling survival when acclimatized. At {{the end of the}} experiment, an analysis of individual variances and a combined analysis of the environments were carried out. The simplified medium led to higher seedlings, especially for light source L 6. Light sources L 1, L 2, L 3 and L 4 promoted an increase in the seedlings root system in the simplified medium. As for the chlorophyll content, L 4 and L 7 showed higher contents of chlorophyll a and b. The simplified medium led practically to 100 % of seedling survival, regardless of the light source used. Results shown that the simplified medium for light sources L 1, L 2, L 3 and L 4 is recommended for the in vitro propagation of M. lundii...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the capability of fungal mycelia for biosorption of HA, four fungal strains were grown separately in potato dextrose broth (PDB) in a shaker incubator for 10  days (26  ±  1  °C, 150  rpm). Fungal biomass, grown {{in the form of}} pellets, were collected and washed five times with distilled water. Afterwards the jars containing the fungal pellets in distilled water were autoclaved (121  °C, 20  min) to deactivate the fungi. The deactivated (heat-killed) fungal pellets were then used for the biosorption experiment. Different amounts of biomass for each fungal strain were used to study the HA sorption on fungal biomass. The fungal biomass was <b>transferred</b> to 4 <b>flasks</b> containing 100  mL HA solution (~ 200  mg/L, pH 5) in four levels. The same amount of pellets were also filtered and dried (100  °C, 24  h) and weighted separately to estimate the dry biomass weight (DBW) of each experiment. Flasks were kept in a shaker incubator for 48  h (26  ±  1  °C, 130  rpm). At the end of the incubation period, 1  ml samples were withdrawn from each flask to be analyzed for color. Then the HA was recovered to estimate the efficiency of the recovery procedure via SEC analysis. Experiments were done in duplicate under sterile conditions.|$|R
