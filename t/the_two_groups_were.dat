5|$|Many abelisaurid skull {{features}} are shared with carcharodontosaurids. These shared features, {{along with the}} fact that abelisaurids seem to have replaced carcharodontosaurids in South America, have led to suggestions that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> related. However, no cladistic analysis has ever found such a relationship and, aside from the skull, abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids are very different, more similar to ceratosaurs and allosauroids, respectively.|$|E
5|$|People {{who kept}} more {{traditional}} ways had settlements along the Tamiami Trail {{and tended to}} speak the Mikasuki language. They later were federally recognized in 1962 as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. As metropolitan areas in South Florida began to grow, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> {{closely associated with the}} Everglades. They struggled to maintain privacy while serving as tourist attractions. They earned money by wrestling alligators and selling craftworks. As of 2008, the Seminole Tribe of Florida had five reservations, and the lands of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians were collectively considered a sixth reservation. The two tribes have each developed casino gaming on some of their properties to generate revenue for support, services and economic development.|$|E
5|$|The {{pay-per-view}} event {{featured the}} buildup of a rivalry among two stables, groups {{of at least three}} wrestlers. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> the Corporate Ministry and the Union. The Corporate Ministry was formed when the Corporation merged with the Ministry of Darkness; the Corporate Ministry consisted of Viscera, the Big Boss Man, and the Acolytes (Bradshaw and Faarooq). Throughout the month of May, the Ministry was involved in matches with Mankind, Ken Shamrock, the Big Show, and Test, and in retaliation, the four wrestlers formed the Union stable. The WWF continued to enhance the feud over several weeks, which included a brawl among all eight wrestlers on May 10, 1999. The evolving plot led to the promotion of an eight-man elimination tag team match between both groups at Over the Edge. In this bout, the team that eliminated all of its opponents would win.|$|E

("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed enough to warrant a separate genus. She found that T. horridus and several other species belonged together, and T. prorsus and T. brevicornus stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> two species.

5|$|Gabriel de Rojas {{was still}} in Olancho, and was told by native {{informants}} of new Spanish arrivals in Trujillo. He sent a letter and gifts with messengers, who met Gonzalo de Sandoval, who was imposing Spanish control over Papayeca at that time, then proceeded onwards to Cortés at Trujillo. Cortés at first responded in a friendly manner to Rojas' overtures. Rojas' party was attempting to expand Hernández de Córdoba's Nicaraguan territory; upon meeting native resistance his men began pillaging the district and enslaving the inhabitants. Upon receiving complaints from native informants, Cortés dispatched Sandoval with ten cavalry to hand papers to Rojas, ordering {{him out of the}} territory, and to release any Indians and their goods that he had seized. Sandoval was under orders to either capture Rojas, or expel him from Honduras, but in the event was unable to do either, due to the intervention of other Spaniards present who tried to calm the situation. While <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> still gathered, Rojas received orders from Francisco Hernández de Córdoba to return to Nicaragua to assist him against his rebellious captains, while Sandoval returned to face Cortés' displeasure.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{inspired}} by Breizh Atao's message, Célestin Lainé, a reserve artillery officer, gathered {{a small group}} of companions to found Gwenn ha du, a terrorist organization advocating the creation of an independent Breton state through direct action. In August 1932, Gwenn ha du blew up a 400 year old monument dedicated to the union of Brittany and France. Lainé was arrested, however he was released after a former coworker provided him with an alibi. Gwenn ha du attracted the support of many young nationalists who became disillusioned with the failure of mainstream political parties to gain ground in formal elections. Gwenn ha du ceased its operations between 1933 and 1936, while Lainé was working at the Kuhlmann plant in Loos, French Flanders. There he established links with Flemish nationalists, who introduced him to , an Abwehr agent, who converted Lainé into Nordic neopaganism. Lainé returned to Brittany in 1937, relegating Gwenn ha du the responsibility of sabotage and forming Kadevernn a group that was intended to form the nucleus of a Breton national army. Lainé's most trusted supporters from <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> placed in Service Spécial, a secret special operations unit.|$|E

The Ba'ath party was nominally secular, nationalist. The Muslim Brotherhood, like other Islamist groups, saw nationalism as un-Islamic and religion as inseparable from politics and government.

However, Abu Mohammad al-Julani and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leaders of al-Nusra and al-Qaeda respectively, rejected the merger. Al-Julani issued a statement denying the merger, and complaining that neither he nor anyone else in al-Nusra's leadership had been consulted about it. In June 2013, Al Jazeera reported that it had obtained a letter written by al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, addressed to both leaders, in which he ruled against the merger, and appointed an emissary to oversee relations between them {{to put an end}} to tensions.

Others talked to the hijackers, but they did not agree to the transfer. Barešić thereafter convinced all but one of them to accept the deal. Planning the practical aspects of the transaction was forcing the issue past the deadline. This was finalised at 03:02 when it was decided that the dissident would not be exchanged.

25|$|Slovakia was {{the only}} Axis nation other than Germany {{to take part in}} the Polish Campaign. With the {{impending}} German invasion of Poland planned for September 1939, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) requested the assistance of Slovakia. Although the Slovak military was only six months old, it formed a small mobile combat group consisting of a number of infantry and artillery battalions. Two combat groups were created for the campaign in Poland for use alongside the Germans. The first group was a brigade-sized formation that consisted of six infantry battalions, two artillery battalions, and a company of combat engineers, all commanded by Antonín Pulanich. The second group was a mobile formation that consisted of two battalions of combined cavalry and motorcycle recon troops along with nine motorised artillery batteries, all commanded by Gustav Malár. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>were</b> organized around the headquarters of the 1st and 3rd Slovak Infantry Divisions.
