Deafblind people who are skilled in Finger Braille can catch up with speech conversation and express various emotions by changing dotting strength and speed. In this paper, we designed the emotion <b>teaching</b> <b>interface</b> in order to express joy, sadness, anger and neutral for the Finger Braille emotion teaching system.

We also designed 8 kinds of dot patterns with different horizontal width and vertical length. The experiment to select the most suitable emotion teaching interfaces for joy, sadness, anger and neutral was conducted.

40|$|Abstract—Scarce {{attention}} has been given to Human Computer Interaction teaching methods to promote creativity and innovation. Standard approaches to <b>teaching</b> <b>interface</b> design include the use of design aids such as usability guidelines, interaction design patterns and anti-patterns. These approaches do not, however, encourage creativity properly. Interaction design space is usually limitedly and unsystematically explored during student designs. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical framework for design exercises for use in the teaching of Human Computer Interaction and present some examples of its usage. The use of the pedagogical framework makes it possible to teachers create significant Human Computer Interaction experiences to students, fostering them to activate mental processes underlying creativity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formalism for representing knowledge, {{intended for use}} in <b>teaching</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The driving concern in developing the formalism was to get an explicit method for sequencing the presentation of materials to be learned. The first criterion for doing the sequencing is that it satisfies a relation of constructability or learning support among the materials. If the relation is restricted to be a function then {{it is possible to}} represent it by a directed acyclic graph, as it happens in other constructive processes. The directed acyclic graph representation enables automatic generation of presentation sequences satisfying the learning support relation. It turns out that the formalism suggests other criteria in a natural way.

The framework extends prior work in apprenticeship learning and builds off of recent advancements in learning to recognize activities and modeling domains with multiple objects. In our studies, we show how to both learn a verb model {{and turn it into}} reward and heuristic functions that can then be composed with a dynamics model. The resulting “combined model ” can then be efficiently searched by a sample-based planner which determines a policy for enacting a verb command in a given environment.

The Proposal framework is built on Schumpeter’s 1934 advocate that entrepreneurship plays a great role in economic development. This is because entrepreneurs are able to innovate in order to transform commercial products through processes that add economic value. According to Acs et al (2004), that transformation is only made possible when entrepreneurship plays the role of "knowledge filter".

40|$|The tutor-tutee hand-in-hand {{teaching}} may be {{the most}} effective approach for a tutee to acquire new motor skills. Repetitive nature of such procedures in a group setting usually results in a high labour cost and time inefficiency. Potential solution can be utilizing robotic platforms playing the role of tutors for demonstrating and transferring the required skills. This requires an appropriate guidance scheme to integrate the tutor's motor functionalities into the robot's control architecture. For instance, for hand-in-hand supervision of the writing task, the tutor's corrections can be applied when necessary, while a very compliant motion can be achieved if no errors are detected. Inspired by this behavior, we develop a <b>teaching</b> <b>interface</b> using a dual-arm robotic platform. In our setup, one arm is connected to the tutees arm providing guidance through a variable stiffness control approach, and the other to the tutor to capture the motion and to feedback the tutees performance in a haptic manner. The reference stiffness for the tutors arm stiffness is estimated in real-time and replicated by the tutees robotic arm. Comparative experiments have been carried out on a dual-arm Baxter robot. The results imply that the human tutor is able to intuitively transfer writing skills to the tutee and also show superior learning performance over over some conventional teaching by demonstration techniques...|$|E
40|$|Current {{methods of}} robot task {{teaching}} and learning have several limitations: highly-trained personnel are usually required to teach robots specific tasks; service-robot systems are limited in learning different types of tasks utilizing the same system; and the teacher’s expertise in the task is not well exploited. A human-inspired robot-task {{teaching and learning}} method is developed in this research {{with the aim of}} allowing general users to teach different object-manipulation tasks to a service robot, which will be able to adapt its learned tasks to new task setups. The proposed method was developed to be interactive and intuitive to the user. In a closed loop with the robot, the user can intuitively teach the tasks, track the learning states of the robot, direct the robot attention to perceive task-related key state changes, and give timely feedback when the robot is practicing the task, while the robot can reveal its learning progress and refine its knowledge based on the user’s feedback. The human-inspired method consists of six teaching and learning stages: 1) checking and teaching the needed background knowledge of the robot; 2) introduction of the overall task to be taught to the robot: the hierarchical task structure, and the involved objects and robot hand actions; 3) teaching the task step by step, and directing the robot to perceive important state changes; 4) demonstration of the task in whole, and offering vocal subtask-segmentation cues in subtask transitions; 5) robot learning of the taught task using a flexible vote-based algorithm to segment the demonstrated task trajectories, a probabilistic optimization process to assign obtained task trajectory episodes (segments) to the introduced subtasks, and generalization of the taught task trajectories in different reference frames; and 6) robot practicing of the learned task and refinement of its task knowledge according to the teacher’s timely feedback, where the adaptation of the learned task to new task setups is achieved by blending the task trajectories generated from pertinent frames. An agent-based architecture was designed and developed to implement this robot-task teaching and learning method. This system has an interactive human-robot <b>teaching</b> <b>interface</b> subsystem, which is composed of: a) a three-camera stereo vision system to track user hand motion; b) a stereo-camera vision system mounted on the robot end-effector to allow the robot to explore its workspace and identify objects of interest; and c) a speech recognition and text-to-speech system, utilized for the main human-robot interaction. A user study involving ten human subjects was performed using two tasks to evaluate the system based on time spent by the subjects on each teaching stage, efficiency measures of the robot’s understanding of users’ vocal requests, responses, and feedback, and their subjective evaluations. Another set of experiments was done to analyze the ability of the robot to adapt its previously learned tasks to new task setups using measures such as object, target and robot starting-point poses; alignments of objects on targets; and actual robot grasp and release poses relative to the related objects and targets. The results indicate that the system enabled the subjects to naturally and effectively teach the tasks to the robot and give timely feedback on the robot’s practice performance. The robot was able to learn the tasks as expected and adapt its learned tasks to new task setups. The robot properly refined its task knowledge based on the teacher’s feedback and successfully applied the refined task knowledge in subsequent task practices. The robot was able to adapt its learned tasks to new task setups that were considerably different from those in the demonstration. The alignments of objects on the target were quite close to those taught, and the executed grasping and releasing poses of the robot relative to objects and targets were almost identical to the taught poses. The robot-task learning ability was affected by limitations of the vision-based human-robot teleoperation interface used in hand-to-hand teaching and the robot’s capacity to sense its workspace. Future work will investigate robot learning of a variety of different tasks and the use of more robot in-built primitive skills...|$|E
