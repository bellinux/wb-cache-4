50|$|A <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> {{at bottom}} of the Gemflex allows {{attachment}} to tripod.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Leicaflex {{is readily}} identifiable from its CdS meter window and battery cover {{on the front}} of the prism housing just above the lens. It was offered in chrome and black enamel finishes, the latter being rare. The first series had a fan-shaped exposure counter window and a <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> attached by three screws, whereas the second series had a round exposure counter window, a <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> integrated in the bottom plate and a meter switch built in the advance lever. In use, the two series are virtually identical. 32,500 serial numbers were allotted to the original Leicaflex.|$|E
5000|$|Even point-and-shoot cameras usually {{include a}} <b>tripod</b> <b>socket.</b> A system camera {{includes}} {{at the very}} least a camera body and separate, interchangeable lenses, whence the alternative name interchangeable-lens camera (ILC). In addition it often includes: ...|$|E
50|$|Hand Grip: The metal grip {{provides}} a secure hold. The <b>tripod</b> mounting <b>socket</b> is {{aligned with the}} optical axis and the battery can be replaced without removing the grip.|$|R
50|$|The HTC RE Camera {{does not}} include a power button. Instead, it {{includes}} a grip sensor that allows the camera to be turned on by holding it in a hand. The capturing of videos and photos is done through the shutter button, a large silver button {{at the top of}} the device. Photos are taken by tapping on the button, and videos are taken by pressing and holding on the button. LED lighting embedded in the button shows the status of the camera. Videos and photos are recorded onto a microSD card inserted into the bottom of the camera, which supports a microSD card of up to 128 GB, but HTC provides an 8 GB card. Apart from a microSD card slot, the bottom of the device also includes a 1/4 in 20-thread <b>tripod</b> screw <b>socket</b> and a microUSB port for battery charging and data transfer.|$|R
50|$|Available shutter speeds were 1/1000 second through 10 seconds, with a 1/150 second X-sync {{speed and}} support for bulb exposure. There was no {{built-in}} flash, but a hot shoe on the top allowed an external flash to be attached. A <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> was provided.|$|E
50|$|Canon {{kept the}} Leica screw mount on the VT, and little else. They changed the film advance from a {{top-mounted}} knob to a bottom-mounted trigger. The <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> {{was moved to}} mount a trigger wind grip. They added a swing-open back making the camera easier to load than previous bottom loading Canons.|$|E
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the {{film rewind knob}} with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the <b>tripod</b> <b>socket,</b> the film advance lever, the back release latch, and the film rewind release button.|$|E
50|$|Major controls, {{including}} {{shutter release}} button, surrounding off/mode switch, film-speed/exposure-compensation dial and shutter speed dial {{are located on}} the right-hand side of the top plate, as seen from the rear, as is the LCD displaying he current frame count. The viewfinder is located on the upper left-hand side of the camera. The manual rewind button, release catch for the camera back and cable release socket are on the left-hand side of the camera. The lens mount release and frameline preview lever are located {{on the front of the}} camera. The bottom plate has the cover for the batteries and a <b>tripod</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On August 19, 2014, Nikon {{acknowledged}} {{a problem}} reported by some users, of bright spots appearing in long-exposure photographs {{as well as}} [...] "in some images captured at an Image area setting of 1.2× (30×20)." [...] Existing owners of D810 cameras were asked to visit a website to determine whether their camera could be affected, {{on the basis of}} serial numbers. Repairs would be made by Nikon free of charge. If bright spots still appear in images after servicing, Nikon recommends enabling Long exposure NR. Products already serviced have a black dot inside the <b>tripod</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} camera top, hinged at the front, is a flush {{cover with}} no protruding controls. When flipped open, it reveals the waist-level finder. On {{the right-hand side}} is the single-stroke wind-on lever with the manual reset frame counter on top, and next to it the remote-release-threaded shutter button. On the left-hand side is the rewind knob with a film reminder on top. When the top lid is fully opened, the large square magnifier swings up over the focusing screen. An action finder is also incorporated into the top cover. At the base are the ¼ inch <b>tripod</b> <b>socket,</b> the A/R (advance/rewind) switch, and a release button for the removable back.|$|E
50|$|The {{camera back}} is {{removable}} for changing film. A milled button {{next to the}} <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> rotates either way to lock the back, while in a position in between it is unlocked. The back comes off downwards as a single unit including the base-plate. A quite small film-pressure plate of thick glass is mounted {{on a piece of}} rubber foam on the back. Inside the camera, on the left-hand side, is the 35mm film cassette chamber, and to the right is the counter clockwise rotating film take-up drum. It has a narrow slit for the film leader, and it rotates freely whenever the small film rewind button on the top plate is depressed. No sprocket wheel is employed; instead, the film is pulled by, and wound onto the drum that always rotates the same angular amount for next picture frame. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|E
50|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature is the}} {{combined}} wind-on and shutter release lever. It swings out forward 65 degrees and is operated by the index finger. In the stowed-away position, the shutter is cocked and the film wound on {{ready for the next}} picture. A small rocking lever in front of the accessory shoe serves as a shutter-release lock at this stage, it is disengaged by sliding it to the left-hand side. Depressing the lever releases the shutter and it relocates to the 65 degrees standoff position. Depressing the lever again cocks the shutter and winds on the film. At the camera base is a special flash sync connector protected by coin-operated O-ring sealed aluminium plug, as well as an automatic resetting frame counter, visible behind a glass window. No <b>tripod</b> <b>socket</b> is provided. A small rewind knob at the left-hand top is extended for easy access and to engage the film transport mechanism. No rewind release facility is required; a function that was later added to the Nikonos and marked R on the shutter-speed dial.|$|E
