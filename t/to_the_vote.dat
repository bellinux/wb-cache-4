5|$|Cẩn's men {{helped to}} cowl the populace into voting for his brother. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water often forced down their nostrils. The {{violations}} were particularly flagrant in Cẩn's area, {{which was the}} home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a source of sympathy towards Bảo Đại. Cẩn ordered the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> In Hội An, some people were killed in election day violence.|$|E

In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the Reform Bill to widen the franchise to include women. The petition, which was supported by the MP and philosopher John Stuart Mill, was ignored and the bill became law.|$|E

5|$|The bill {{then goes}} through a third reading. At this stage, only {{amendments}} not of a material character may {{be made to the}} bill. The minister moving the third reading may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the bill. The bill is then put <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> In most cases, a simple majority of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} d'Hondt {{formula is}} applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> (except for the twelfth constituency in which national minority representatives are elected), with a five-percent election threshold in each constituency. Since 2015, the parliamentary elections have {{an element of}} preferential voting by letting voters choose not only {{for a list of}} candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as if it was an open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E
5|$|Emboldened by his success, Diệm {{began to}} plot Bảo Đại's downfall. He {{scheduled}} a referendum for 23 October 1955 and pushed Bảo Đại {{out of the}} political scene, hindering the former emperor's attempts to derail the poll. In the period leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote,</b> campaigning for Bảo Đại was banned, while Diệm's election campaign focused on personal attacks against Bảo Đại. These included pornographic cartoons {{of the head of}} state and unverified rumours claiming he was illegitimate and linking him to various mistresses. The government-controlled media launched polemical attacks on Bảo Đại, and police went door-to-door, warning people of the consequences of failing to vote. After his brother Ngô Đình Nhu successfully rigged the poll, Diệm proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Pankhurst visited North America in 1916 {{together}} with the former Secretary of State for Serbia, Čedomilj Mijatović, whose nation {{had been at the}} centre of fighting {{at the start of the}} war. They toured the United States and Canada, raising money and urging the US government to support Britain and its Canadian and other allies. Two years later, after the US entered the war, Pankhurst returned to the United States, encouraging suffragettes there – who had not suspended their militancy – to support the war effort by sidelining activities related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> She also spoke about her fears of communist insurgency, which she considered a grave threat to Russian democracy.|$|E
5|$|Support for the Provisional Government {{began to}} be tested when the issue of land reform and corvées was again brought to the forefront. Aside from the {{important}} conservative forces, opponents of the measure were to be found inside the leadership body itself, and included the moderates Heliade Rădulescu and Ioan Odobescu. Revolutionaries who favored passing land into the property of peasants were divided over the amount {{that was to be}} ceded, as well as over the issue of compensation to be paid to boyars. A compromise was reached through postponing, with a decision taken to submit all proposals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> of the Assembly, which was yet to be convened, instead of drafting a decree. Nevertheless, a Proclamation to estate-holders was issued (June 28, 1848), indicating that the reform was to be eventually enforced in exchange for unspecified sums, and calling on peasants to fulfill their corvées until autumn of the same year.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistics}} of the referendum were organised and supervised by Diệm's brother and confidant, Nhu, {{who was the}} leader of the family's secret Cần Lao party, which supplied the Ngôs' electoral base. Reports of violence and intimidation were widespread. During the referendum, Nhu's staff told voters to throw away the green ballots. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water sometimes being forced into their nostrils. The violations were particularly flagrant in central Vietnam, a region over which another of Diệm's younger brothers, Ngô Đình Cẩn, ruled. Cẩn was based in the former imperial capital city of Huế, home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a source of support for Bảo Đại. He stifled this support by ordering the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> In the city of Hội An, several people were killed in election violence {{on the day of the}} poll. Voting started at 07:00 and ended at 17:00.|$|E

25|$|New liturgical {{resources}} were introduced, which would culminate in {{the publication of}} the Book of Alternative Services in 1985. Agitation for the ordination of women led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> on 18 June 1975, by the Anglican Church of Canada in favour of ordination as priests, and, eventually, bishops.

The 1916 vote was influenced by a recent riot involving drunken soldiers. In February 1916, troops mutinied against conditions at the Casula Camp.
