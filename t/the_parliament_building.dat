5|$|Montreal was {{the capital}} of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> <b>building</b> to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill. For {{strategic}} reasons, Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital. The reasons were twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, it was less susceptible to US attack. Perhaps more importantly, as it lay on the border between French and English Canada, the then small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, who were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May, tens of {{thousands}} of university students demanding Suharto’s resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> <b>building.</b> Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet.
