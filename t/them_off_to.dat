5|$|The {{following}} season, Maryland {{earned a}} number-two seeding after defeating Hopkins, 12–9. The teams met {{again in the}} tournament quarterfinals, where, playing at home, Hopkins gained a 7–0 lead against heavily favored Maryland. The Terrapins rallied, but the Blue Jays held <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> preserve victory, 9–7. In 1998 at Homewood Field, Hopkins upset first-ranked Maryland, 10–6 during the regular season. This time when they met in the tournament quarterfinals, Maryland had the homefield advantage at Byrd Stadium. The Terps led 10–6 {{in the fourth quarter}} before the Blue Jays rallied to force overtime. Maryland, however, won the ensuing faceoff and scored after several shots on goal, never allowing Hopkins to gain possession of the ball. The Terps eventually advanced to the final, where they were defeated by Princeton.|$|E

He responded with 205 in the Second Test at Melbourne, setting up a total of 510 after asking the tourists to bat first and forcing an innings victory to square the series. After the Third Test saw a convincing ten-wicket victory, the captain making 29 in the first innings, Lawry scored 62 and 89 in a drawn Fourth Test in Adelaide. With Australia needing 360 to win, the captain got <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a good start but they fell away and the last pair had to survive 26 balls at the end to save the match, 21 runs adrift of the target.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{rapid transit}} is an {{automated}} cab service {{that runs on}} rails or a guideway. This is an uncommon mode of transportation (excluding elevators) due {{to the complexity of}} automation. A fully implemented system might provide most of the convenience of individual automobiles with the efficiency of public transit. The crucial innovation is that the automated vehicles carry just a few passengers, turn off the guideway to pick up passengers (permitting other PRT vehicles to continue at full speed), and drop <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the location of their choice (rather than at a stop). Conventional transit simulations show that PRT might attract many auto users in problematic medium-density urban areas. A number of experimental systems are in progress. One might compare personal rapid transit to the more labor-intensive taxi or paratransit modes of transportation, or to the (by now automated) elevators common in many publicly accessible areas.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire {{never managed}} to score in the semi-final match at The Rose Bowl, which meant that Hampshire were set a {{relatively}} easy target of 198 to win. Michael Lumb top-scored with 43, but the late order failed to score runs quickly enough to get past 200; number ten John Blain only made six off 20 deliveries, while number nine Tim Bresnan made three off ten. Yorkshireman Deon Kruis served up some economical bowling early on to John Crawley, and bowled him for a 28-ball 8, but a 147-run partnership between Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine saw Hampshire right on track, as they won with over 10 overs to spare. Ervine made his second List A century, off 96 balls, but was caught and bowled by Richard Dawson three balls later. It did nt matter much – Hampshire only needed 20 runs to win, and Shane Watson and Nic Pothas knocked <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> book Hampshire's place in the C Trophy final.|$|E

25|$|Lupin remains {{active in}} the Order {{throughout}} the year. He provides the casualty reports section on the pirate radio station Potterwatch under the pseudonym of Romulus. Lupin commands a group of defenders on the school grounds during the Battle of Hogwarts. Both Lupin and Tonks die in combat, killed by Antonin Dolohov and Bellatrix Lestrange respectively. At {{the time of his}} death, Lupin was the last surviving member of his group of friends. Rowling has since stated that she originally intended for both Lupin and Tonks to survive, but finally killed <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> compensate for the last-minute reprieve she gave to Arthur Weasley in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Lupin, along with Sirius, James, and Lily, makes one last appearance in the series when Harry uses the Resurrection Stone to bring them forth to comfort him. He expresses his regret that Teddy will never know his father, but says that he will know why he died: trying to make a world in which his son could live a better life.|$|E
25|$|No {{team had}} ever managed to chase down a T20I score {{of more than}} 200 in England, and it had only been done three times {{anywhere}} in the world. Michael Lumb and Alex Hales got <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a good start, reaching 50 runs in just 3.3 overs; however, Lumb was out to the very next ball, bowled by Nathan McCullum. Hales was joined at the wicket by Luke Wright, and the pair put on another 55 runs for the second wicket, before Hales holed out to Franklin at mid-wicket for 39. Morgan was next to go, his 7 runs off 10 balls making him the only England batsman to score {{at a rate of}} less than a run a ball, and he was followed in the very next over by Wright. However, Wright's 52 off 34 balls left England needing 63 off the last five overs. An unbeaten 30 from Ravi Bopara, Buttler's quick-fire 17 and a six off the first ball of the final over from Ben Stokes got England to within five runs of the New Zealand total, but {{in the end it was}} too little, too late and the tourists took a 1–0 lead in the series.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} what {{followed}} during the students' clash with the police vary. According to police reports, the police chased the students because they had hijacked three buses and attempted to drive <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> carry out the protests {{and then return to}} their college. Members of the student union, however, stated that they had been protesting and were hitchhiking when they clashed with the police. As the buses sped away and the chase ensued, the police opened fire on the vehicles. Two students were killed in one of the buses, while some fled into the surrounding hills. Roughly three hours later, escaped students returned to the scene to speak with reporters. In a related incident, unidentified gunmen fired at a bus carrying players from a local soccer team, which they had presumably mistaken for one of the buses that picked up the student protestors. Bullets struck the bus and hit two taxis. The bus driver, a football player, and a woman inside one of the taxis were killed. The next morning, the authorities discovered the corpse of a student, Julio César Mondragón, who had attempted to run away during the gunfire. His eyes had been gouged out and the skin of his face flayed to a bare skull. In total, 6 people were killed and 25 wounded.|$|E

500|$|A fan of Christmas {{television}} specials growing up, series creator Eric Kripke {{desired to}} make [...] "the most violent Christmas special {{in the history}} of television". The myth of the anti-Clausan evil antithesis of Santa who [...] "stuffs his victims in sacks and takes <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> eat them"became the episode's inspiration. However, the writers were hesitant to establish the creature as an anti-Claus because it would implicate the existence of an actual Santa Claus. To remedy the dilemma, they incorporated the mythology of the pagan god Hold Nickar, who generally {{is believed to be the}} precedent of Santa. Kripke proudly noted that the lore is [...] "one of [...] most accurate" [...] since most Christmas traditions have pagan origins.|$|E
500|$|On 25 May, Warne asked Potter to {{send him}} one of the two dummy books she had in her {{possession}} in order to check the size of the plates before continuing with the printer's blocks.

He kept the two plates back for Potter's inspection before sending <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> make the blocks. On 26 May, he received two more originals and the circular portrait of the cat for the cover. He thought the background of the colour illustration of Ribby and Duchess sitting at the table too light, but liked the pen-and-ink sketches.

500|$|People {{would gather}} in the rooms in the evening for balls and other public functions, or simply to play cards. Mothers and chaperones {{bringing}} their daughters to Bath for the social season, hoping to marry <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a suitable husband, would take their charge to such events where, very quickly, one might meet all the eligible men currently in the City. At one concert in 1779, attended by around 800 ladies and gentlemen, 60 members of the nobility were present. During the season, which ran from October to June, at least two balls a week were held, {{in addition to a}} range of concerts and other events. Scenes such as this feature in the novels of Jane Austen, who lived in Bath with her parents and sister from 1801 to 1805. Her two novels set in Bath, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, were published in 1818 and both mention the Assembly Rooms: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1580s, with the {{development}} of English colonization schemes, initially in Ireland and later in North America, a new method to alleviate the condition of the poor would be suggested and utilized considerably over time. [...] Merchant and colonization proponent, George Peckham noted the then-current domestic conditions; [...] "there are at this day great numbers which Hue in such penurie & want, as they could be content to hazard their Hues, and to [...] one yeere for meat, drinke and apparell only, without wages, in hope thereby to amend their estates." [...] With this, he may have been the first to suggest what became the institution of [...] indentured service. [...] At the same time Richard Hakluyt, in his preface to Divers Voyages, likens English planters to [...] "Bees...led out by their Captaines to swarme abroad"; he recommends [...] "deducting" [...] the poor out of the realm. Hakluyt also broadens the scope and additionally recommends to empty the prisons and send <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the New World. By 1619 Virginia's system of indentured service would be fully developed, and subsequent colonies would adopt the method with modifications suitable to their different conditions and times. English penal transportation would be implemented soon afterwards, and evolve into a subsidized government endeavor with the Transportation Act 1717.|$|E
500|$|Eager {{to engage}} and defeat {{one of the}} American frigates that had already scored a number of {{victories}} over the Royal Navy in single-ship confrontations, Broke prepared a challenge. [...] had already {{slipped out of the}} harbour under the cover of fog and had evaded the British. Constitution was undergoing extensive repairs and alterations and would not be ready for sea in the foreseeable future. However, Chesapeake appeared to be ready to put to sea. Consequently Broke decided to challenge Chesapeake, which had been refitting in Boston harbour under the command of Captain James Lawrence, offering single ship-to-ship combat. Whilst patrolling offshore, Shannon had intercepted and captured a number of American ships attempting to reach the harbour. After sending two of <b>them</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Halifax, he found that his crew was being dangerously reduced. Broke therefore resorted to burning the rest of the prizes in order to conserve his highly trained crew in anticipation of the battle with Chesapeake. The boats from the burnt prizes were sent into Boston, carrying Broke's oral invitation to Lawrence to come out and engage him. Broke had already sent Tenedos away {{in the hope that the}} more favourable odds would entice the Americans out, but eventually began to despair that Chesapeake would ever come out of the harbour. He finally decided to send a written challenge. In this he was copying his adversary. Lawrence had earlier in the war, when captain of the sloop of war , sent a written invitation to the captain of the British sloop of war [...] to a single-ship contest. Lawrence's offer had been declined.|$|E
