30|$|Overall, Chinese trade cost shows a {{downward}} trend with 108.4 % in 2000 declining to 0.9089 in 2013, which falls by 16.2 %.

During this period, the trade cost reached 0.973, which ranks fourth. This is due to the declining economic since the global financial crisis, which contributes to the deterioration of external situation. For example, the year of 2009 has the highest number of Chinese trade friction cases and highest amount.

Incorporating both the extensive and intensive margins of trade and innovation leads to different possible equilibria.

The impact of trade on aggregate productivity and welfare depends crucially on the equilibrium the economy is in. When lowering the variable costs of trade, the welfare effects arising from reallocating market shares across firms may be non-negligible, and when lowering the fixed cost of <b>trade,</b> <b>aggregate</b> productivity need not always increase.

The increase in Chinese <b>aggregate</b> <b>trade</b> cost significantly reduces the export share of manufacturing. This effect in the industry with higher trade cost sensitivity is more obvious, and thereby affects the structure of trade commodities. Specifically, the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacturing of office, accounting and computing machinery (C 30)” is highest with the value of 0.523639; the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacture of radio, television and communication equipment and apparatus (C 32)” ranks second with the value of 0.464463; the trade cost sensitivity of “manufacture of medical equipment, precision instruments and optical instruments, watches and clocks manufacturing (C 33)” ranks third with the value of 0.464463. The decline of <b>aggregate</b> <b>trade</b> cost contributes to the effect of these industries export ranking the top three.

It also generates, by far, the largest leeway for fiscal balances. The reason is that, by reducing the workers’ (policy-induced) outside option, wage claims fall and Spanish goods become relatively cheaper. At the same time, fiscal balances benefit from reducing expenditures, which gives room to additionally reduce taxation because of lower steady-state debt levels further boosting demand. However, it is also evident that RoT-households do not benefit from these measures because the wage drop dominates the rise in employment such that their steady-state consumption possibilities deteriorate while optimizers benefit from the positive wealth effect. The argument also holds for a decrease in public employment, however, to a lesser extent and not for unemployment. This is due, first, to the definition of GDP and, second, to the “unemployment shock”; both are described in the previous section.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of a real current account {{adjustment}} on terms of <b>trade,</b> <b>aggregate</b> productivity and welfare-based exchange rate in a two-country general equilibrium model. As in Melitz (2003), firms are heterogeneous in productivity and endogenously enter and exit their domestic and export markets. The real adjustment of the current account leads to the increase of Home exports through the intensive and the extensive margins of trade : incumbent firms export more and new exporters endogenously enter the market. In the benchmark case, the extensive margin of trade accounts for about 19 % of the overall adjustment and the depreciation of the national currency is lower with respect to models where this margin is not considered. In the literature, the change in the terms of trade is lower when goods are more substituable. This common finding is overturned by the endogenous entry of new exporters. For a given dispersion of productivity across firms, a higher elasticity of substitution reduces the role played by the extensive margin on the adjustment and yields a higher depreciation of the exchange rate.

As a result, this paper finds that developing countries with higher trade facilitation levels export a wider range of products, especially primary goods. While trade facilitation levels do not have a statistically significant association with trade at the intensive margin in general, further analysis shows that the impact of advanced trade facilitation is the largest for lower middle-income countries in primary goods trade at the intensive margin, and the largest for upper middle-income countries in manufactured goods trade at the intensive margin.

In so doing, it will become part of a customs union applying free movement of goods and services within the member states, without any tariff or non-tariff barriers and a common foreign trade policy in relation to third countries. The objective of this paper is to analyze the impacts of a medium and long term macroeconomic, foreign trade policy of Slovak Republic; the period under evaluation is from year 1996 to 2006. This research aims to find out how the abolishment of tariffs and non-tariff barriers in relation to EU countries and the foreign trade policy unification will influence the development of Slovak Republic’s balance of <b>trade,</b> <b>aggregate</b> domestic product and other macroeconomic indicators. In addition, the author also investigates the impacts of tax policy unification with the EU, owing to the existing differences.

How do domestic political institutions affecttrade policy? In particular, are groups ofdemocracies better able to liberalize trade than groups of autocracies or groups composed of both democracies and autocracies? To address these questions, Mansfield, Milner, and Rosendorff (2000) analyze a take-it-or-leave-it (TILI) bargaining game, in which they compare the <b>aggregate</b> <b>trade</b> barri-ers agreed upon by democratic pairs with those by autocratic pairs and by mixed pairs. To distinguish democracies from autocracies, Mans...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new channel through which {{international}} trade affects macroeconomic volatility. We study a multi-country model with heterogeneous firms that {{are subject to}} idiosyncratic firm-specific shocks. When the distribution of firm size follows a power law with exponent sufficiently close to - 1, the idiosyncratic shocks to large Þrms {{have an impact on}} aggregate volatility. Opening to trade increases the importance of large Þrms to the economy, thus raising macroeconomic volatility. We next explore the quantitative properties of the model calibrated to data for the 50 largest economies in the world. Our simulation exercise shows that the contribution of <b>trade</b> to <b>aggregate</b> ßuctuations depends strongly on country size: in an economy such as the U. S., that accounts for one-third of world GDP, international trade increases volatility by about 3. 5 %. By contrast, <b>trade</b> increases <b>aggregate</b> volatility by some 30 % in a small open economy, such as Belgium or Poland. The model performs well in matching the elasticity of macroeconomic volatility with respect to country size observed in cross-country data.
