50|$|The crew of Atlantis awoke {{on flight}} day 11, {{and after a}} couple of hours of {{personal}} time, began the late inspection of the shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. The crew finished the scans {{about two and a half}} hours ahead of schedule. By 09:50 UTC, they had finished their look at the right wing, by 10:52 UTC the nose cap survey was complete, and the left wing survey was finished at 11:17 UTC. The TPS survey was done using the shuttle's robotic arm and its OBSS extension. While the scans were going on, some of the crew stowed items that were no longer needed or were <b>transferred</b> <b>right</b> before undocking. Spacewalkers Mike Good and Steve Bowen cleaned up and stowed their spacesuits for landing. The latter part of the crew's day was spent with some off-duty time.|$|E
40|$|The bill of exchange, the {{promissory}} note and the cheque are debt instruments {{regulated by the}} bill of exchange law. The debt instruments are differentiated from other instruments used in civil and commercial relations by {{the inclusion of the}} debt in the instrument, hence the name of debt instrument. The main features of the debt instruments are: formal, literal and autonomous nature. The debt instruments are formal {{in the sense that the}} creation, the existence, the circulation and the exercise and the use of the patrimonial rights included depend on the existence of the elements included in the instrument. Moreover, the high rigorous nature of the debt instruments is reflected by the obligation to meet some requirements regarding the form (the bill of exchange, the {{promissory note}} and the cheque imply some compulsory requirements in order to be valid). The debt instruments are literal, in the sense that the existence and the coverage of the patrimonial rights are established through the wording included in the instrument; thus, the juridical relation that caused the issuing of the debt instrument no longer influences the right deriving from the instrument (whether a sales-purchase agreement, or a loan or a debt opening); no possibility for the debt instrument to be interpreted or completed with other documents. The autonomous nature of the debt instruments can be seen, on the one hand, in relation to the fundamental juridical relation that caused it, and in this case, we shall consider that the individual who issued the instrument has an obligation which is not under the existing fundamental relation but exclusively under the instrument which the individual signed; on the other hand, each new signatory has an autonomous juridical position and acquires a new, original right, not a <b>transferred</b> <b>right.</b> The autonomy of the debt instruments explains the principle according to which the holder of the instrument exercises one’s own right and exceptions cannot be opposed to him, namely the protection measures that could be opposed to the previous holders (principle of non-opposability of exceptions) ...|$|E

The transfer is accomplished by means of an agreement of transfer or oordrags-ooreenkoms between the cedent and the cessionary arising out of a justa causa from which the former's intention to <b>transfer</b> the <b>right</b> (animus transferendi) and the latter's intention to become the holder of the right (animus acquirendi) appears or can be inferred. It is an agreement to divest the cedent of the right and vest it in the cessionary.|$|R

40|$|Commonly {{employed}} global {{tests for}} separability between {{production and consumption}} decisions are theoretically inappropriate when the market failures creating non-separabilities differentially constrain some, but not all households. Simulated maximum likelihood estimates using Chinese panel data reject the restrictions implied by a global separability test in favor of regime-specific or local separability tests. The estimates also show that a global approach to separability obscures the significant effect that less-encumbered land <b>transfer</b> <b>rights</b> would have on shadow factor price equalization across households and allocative efficiency.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{examined}} the effects of secure tenure on agricultural investment and productivity. The authors also study the importance of rights to household residual income and land use being transferable. Contemporary China - where industrialization has spread rapidly, if unevenly - {{is a good place to}} study the economic effects of <b>transfer</b> <b>rights</b> as well as conventional security of tenure. Village collectives formally own land in China, so there can be no individual land sales, but farmers are sometimes entitled to sell their rights to use the land allocated to them under the household responsibility system. Whether a household has secure tenure depends on whether its landholding will be reduced if the household population declines, whether the landholding will be increased if the household population increases, and how frequent average land adjustments are under the household responsibility system. Analyzing panel data for a sample of farm households, the authors study the"investment regret mitigation effect", which results when greater <b>transfer</b> <b>rights</b> make households more willing to invest because they are less likely to regret such investments when they can recoup the investment value even if they exit farming. The authors find that <b>transfer</b> <b>rights</b> may be especially important in an industrializing economy. A property rights system with incomplete security of tenure but with strong <b>transfer</b> <b>rights</b> that permit"specialization without regret"- so farmers can recoup the value of an investment even if they exit farming - may have much to recommend it.

Specialization without Regret: <b>Transfer</b> <b>Rights,</b> Agricultural Productivity and Investment in an Industrializing Economy Among those mutable factors that constrain economic performance in low income and transitional economies, property rights over land rank high by most calculations. 1 With a few important exceptions, the literature that has tried to quantify the economic effects of property rights has concentrated on the security with which individuals hold rights over land. The goal of this paper is to broaden the focus of these earlier efforts to include <b>transfer</b> <b>rights,</b> meaning an individual’s liberty to rent or sell the use, income and other rights that he or she holds.
