No matter what anyone <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E

In step 4 it restricts you to orbits where initial and final momentum are the same i.e. periodic orbits.

25|$|Amateur {{radio and}} some {{cellular}} or PCS wireless systems use direction finding or triangulation of transmitter signals radiated by the mobile. This {{is sometimes called}} radio direction finding or RDF. The simplest forms of these systems calculate the bearing from two fixed sites to the mobile. This creates a triangle with endpoints at the two fixed points and the mobile. Trigonometry <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> roughly where the mobile transmitter is located. In wireless telephone systems, the phones transmit continually when off-hook, making continual tracking and the collection of many location samples possible. This is one type of location system required by Federal Communications Commission Rules for wireless Enhanced 911.|$|E

25|$|Bass once {{described}} his main goal for his title sequences as being to ‘’try {{to reach for}} a simple, visual phrase that <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> what the picture is all about and evokes {{the essence of the}} story”. Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world in an unfamiliar way. Examples of this or what he described as “making the ordinary extraordinary” can be seen in Walk on the Wild Side (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in Nine Hours to Rama (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape. In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for Anatomy of a Murder (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and live-action sequences.|$|E

Keane noted that maquettes are not just supposed to be [...] "like a mannequin in a store", but rather has to be [...] "something that <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> [...] personality" [...] and that maquettes also helped inspire the way actors would portray their roles.|$|E
