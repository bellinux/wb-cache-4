40|$|After having {{shown that}} the {{corresponding}} components of a four vector transform via the same transformation factors as the space-time coordinates of the same event do, we design a relativistic diagram that displays in true values theirs components.

We consider both approaching and receding <b>tardyons</b> respectively photons in each case. We also show how the relativistic diagram for radar and photographic detections of moving profiles...|$|R
40|$|The Foldy [...] Wouthuysen {{transformation}} {{is known to}} uncover the nonrelativistic limit of a generalized Dirac Hamiltonian, lending an intuitive physical interpretation to the effective operators within Schrödinger [...] Pauli theory. We here discuss the opposite, ultrarelativistic limit which {{requires the use of}} a fundamentally different expansion where the leading kinetic term in the Dirac equation is perturbed by the mass of the particle and other interaction (potential) terms, rather than vice versa. The ultrarelativistic decoupling {{transformation is}} applied to free Dirac particles (in the Weyl basis) and to high-energy tachyons, which are faster-than-light particles described by a fully Lorentz-covariant equation. The effective gravitational interactions are found. For tachyons, the dominant gravitational interaction term in the high-energy limit is shown to be attractive, and equal to the leading term for subluminal Dirac particles (<b>tardyons)</b> in the high-energy limit.

40|$|The second law of thermodynamics, i. e. the law {{stating that}} the entropy in {{isolated}} macroscopic system can never decrease, is tightly connected {{to the work of}} the device called perpetual motion machine of second kind. Often this law is also defined as the inability to construct such a device. In the current paper we give complete, independent and consistent definitions of static, stationary and changing physical field. Based on {{that for the first time}} we give summarising, correct and complete definitions of natural resource machine and perpetual motion machine of second kind as well as motion machine of second kind in the set of <b>tardyons</b> and luxons. We present a principal structure of a motion machine of second kind using which we show that the Clausius statement and its equivalent statements in the thermodynamics can be violated for a practically big interval-time even under equilibrium fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{transformation}} equation for the <b>tardyon</b> velocity involves two generic functions which in turn depend on the relative velocity of the involved reference frames, on the <b>tardyon</b> velocity u and on the polar angle which define the direction along which the <b>tardyon</b> moves. The same functions are further involved in the transformation equations for the space-time coordinates of the same event generated by a moving <b>tardyon</b> and for its relativistic mass, momentum and energy. Taking the limits of these functions for u approaching c we obtain exactly the transformation equations for the space-time coordinates of the same event generated by a photon and for its momentum and energy. The same procedure works also for {{the transition from a}} plane acoustic wave to an electromagnetic wave. Comment: A generic rule to derive relativistic equation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} {{a theory of}} Special Relativity valid for the entire speed range without the assumption of constant speed of light. Two particles species are defined, one species of particles have rest frames with rest mass, and another species of particles do not have rest frame and can not define rest mass. We prove that for the particles which have rest frames, the Galilean transformation is the only linear transformation of space-time that allows infinite speed of particle motion. Hence without any assumption, an upper bound of speed is required for all non-Galilean linear transformations. We then present a novel derivation of the mass-velocity and the mass-energy relations {{in the framework of}} relativistic dynamics, which is solely based on the principle of relativity and basic definitions of relativistic momentum and energy. The generalized Lorentz transformation is then determined. The new relativistic formulas are not related directly to the speed of light c, but are replaced by a Relativity Constant C_R which is an universal speed constant of the Nature introduced in relativistic dynamics. Particles having rest mass are called <b>tardyons</b> moving slower than C_R. Particles having neither rest frames nor rest mass are called tachyons moving faster than C_R, and with the real mass-velocity relation m=|p⃗_∞ |(v^ 2 -C_R^ 2) ^- 1 / 2 where p⃗_∞ is the finite momentum of tachyon at infinite speed. Moreover, the particles with constant-speed C_R, also having neither rest frames nor rest mass, are called constons. For all particles, p^ 2 =p⃗^ 2 -(E^ 2 /C_R^ 2) remains invariant under transformation between inertia frames. The invariant reads p^ 2 =-m_ 0 ^ 2 C_R^ 2 0 for tachyons, respectively.

40|$|Using {{two methods}} we deduce the new {{gravitational}} formula, In the Universe {{there are two}} matters: (1) observable subluminal matter called <b>tardyon</b> and (2) unobservable superluminal matter called tachyon which coexist in motion. Tachyon can be converted into <b>tardyon,</b> and vice versa. Tardyonic rotating motion produces the centrifugal force, but tachyonic rotating motion produces the centripetal force, that is gravity.

40|$|We {{compute the}} {{scattering}} amplitudes of four massless states for chiral (closed) bosonic and type II superstrings using the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye ($KLT$) factorization method.

Chiral type II superstrings amplitude only possess poles associated with the massless gravitational sector. We briefly discuss {{the extension of the}} calculation to heterotic superstrings.

40|$|Transformation {{equations}} for the {{kinetic energy}} of a <b>tardyon</b> are derived in the limits of classical and of special relativity theory. Two formulas are presented. In the first one {{the energy of the}} particle in one of the involved reference frames is presented as a function of its proper energy, of the relative velocity of the two frames and of its speed in the second one. In the second one the kinetic energy in one of the involved reference frames is expressed as a function of its kinetic energy in the second one of its proper energy, of the relative velocity of the involved inertial reference frames and of its velocity relative to that frame. The obtained results are extended to the case of a photon that moves under the same geometrical conditions, recovering the formulas that account for the relativistic Doppler Effect, illustrating the behavior of a transformation equation when it should account for the properties of an electron and for those of a photon as well.

40|$|The weak {{convergence}} theorems of the one- and two-dimensional simple quantum walks, SQW^(d), d= 1, 2, show {{a striking}} {{contrast to the}} classical counterparts, the simple random walks, SRW^(d). The limit distributions have novel structures such that they are inverted-bell shaped and the supports of them are bounded. In the present paper we claim that these properties of the SQW^(d) {{can be explained by}} the theory of relativistic quantum mechanics. We show that the Dirac equation with a proper ultraviolet cutoff can provide a quantum walk model in three dimensions, where the walker has a four-component qubit. We clarify that the pseudovelocity (t) of the quantum walker, which solves the Dirac equation, is identified with the relativistic velocity. Since the quantum walker should be a <b>tardyon,</b> not a tachyon, |(t) | < c, where c is the speed of light, and this restriction (the causality) is the origin of the finiteness of supports of the limit distributions universally found in quantum walk models. By reducing the number of components of momentum in the Dirac equation, we obtain the limit distributions of pseudovelocities for the lower dimensional quantum walks. We show that the obtained limit distributions for the one- and two-dimensional systems have the common features with those of SQW^(1) and SQW^(2).
