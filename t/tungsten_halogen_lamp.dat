40|$|I-V {{characterization}} of solar cells is generally done under natural sunlight or solar simulators operating {{in either a}} continuous mode or a pulse mode. Simulators are classified on three features of irradiance, namely, spectral match with respect to air mass 1. 5, spatial uniformity, and temporal stability. Commercial solar simulators use Xenon <b>lamps</b> and <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps,</b> whereas LED-based solar simulators are being developed. In this work, we build and test seven simulators for solar cell characterization, namely, one <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> simulator, four monochromatic (red, green, blue, and white) LED simulators, one multicolor LED simulator, and one tungsten halogen-blue LED simulator. The seven simulators provide testing at nonstandard test condition. High irradiance from simulators is obtained by employing elevated supply voltage to <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> and high pulsing voltages to LEDs. This new approach leads to higher irradiance not previously obtained from <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> and LEDs.

40|$|For the {{diffusion}} of phosphorus in silicon {{it has been reported}} that rapid thermal processing (RTP) leads to an enhanced diffusion compared to conventional processing in quartz tubes (CFP). This enhancement has been attributed by several authors to photoelectrical or photochemical effects induced by visible and/or UV photons from <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> (THL) used in RTP. In this work, we attempt to verify the proposed photon-enhanced diffusion of P in Si. An extensive study has been carried out using a special RTP reactor equipped with <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>lamps</b> and additional excimer UV lamps. Various P sources such as spin-on dopants (SOD), APCVD Pdoped SiO 2 and POCl 3 pre-diffused wafers have been tested. The experimental results show no evidence of photonenhanced diffusion. For all dopant sources, additional irradiation of the dopant covered surface with high-energy photons causes neither a significant difference in the sheet resistance nor in the P profile compared to diffusion without photon irradiation. An important output of these experiments is that the implementation of excimer UV lamps in future RTP furnaces designed for PV applications is not necessary...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the illuminated surface areas of high-intensity discharge (HID) and <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> low-beam headlamps in the USA.

The main find-ing is that the HID low (passing) beams generally have smaller illuminated surface areas than do the <b>tungsten</b> <b>halogen</b> low beams. Because smaller light sources result in more discomfort glare (presumably via greater luminance), the present finding suggests that the smaller illuminated area is one reason for drivers report-ing more discomfort from HID lamps.
