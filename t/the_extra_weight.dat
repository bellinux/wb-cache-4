5|$|Although {{twice as}} {{powerful}} as the Alpine, the Tiger is only about twenty per cent heavier, but <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> of the larger engine required some minor suspension modifications. Nevertheless, the Tiger's front-to-back weight ratio is substantially similar to the Alpine's, at 51.7/48.3 front/rear.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} {{captured}} Zero had been {{transmitted to the}} U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) and Grumman Aircraft. After careful study, Roy Grumman decided that he could match or surpass the Zero in most respects, except in range, without sacrificing pilot armor, self-sealing tanks and fuselage structure. The new F6F Hellcat would compensate for <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> with additional power.|$|E
5|$|Improvements to {{artillery}} technology necessitated {{significant changes}} to the fort's structure {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and the start of the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types of explosive shells. To alleviate this threat, massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort's roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> on the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.|$|E

5000|$|The Coptercam 8 CS has a 3 axis stabilised gimbal {{system which}} allows 360 degree pan in {{addition}} to roll and pitch stabilisation. Due to <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> payload <b>weight,</b> its maximum flight time is reduced to 8 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The Windstar was {{paired with}} an AX4S transaxle, which {{was prone to}} {{internal}} failure. The transmission suffered from cracked forward and reverse clutch pistons. These transmission failures were most susceptible with the 3.8L engine, as the transmission could not handle <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> torque and <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> vehicle <b>weight.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from one to another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> of each car on a Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary vertical drop, a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|Double-action {{triggers}} {{provide the}} ability to fire the gun whether the hammer is cocked or uncocked. This feature is desirable for military, police, or self-defense pistols. The primary disadvantage of any double-action trigger is the extra length the trigger must be pulled and <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> required to overcome the spring tension of the hammer or striker.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{addition}} of <b>extra</b> <b>weights</b> on <b>the</b> wheels reduces the unbalanced reciprocating {{forces on the}} locomotive but causes it {{to be out of}} balance vertically creating hammer blow.|$|R
50|$|The Titleist Drivers always {{feature the}} ability to further {{customize}} the club to fine tune it to the golfer's swing. This is done through {{many aspects of the}} club: <b>the</b> variable <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> in <b>the</b> back of the head, the loft of the driver face, and the SureFit Hosel design.|$|R
5000|$|When an {{airplane}} is being loaded, <b>the</b> capacity for <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> in <b>the</b> wings {{is greater than}} <b>the</b> capacity for <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> in <b>the</b> fuselage. Designers of airplanes can optimise the maximum takeoff weight and prevent overloading in the fuselage by specifying a MZFW. This is usually done for large airplanes with cantilever wings. (Airplanes with strut-braced wings achieve substantial wing bending relief by having the load of the fuselage applied by the strut mid-way along <b>the</b> wing semi-span. <b>Extra</b> wing bending relief cannot be achieved by particular placement of the fuel. There is usually no MZFW specified for {{an airplane}} with a strut-braced wing.) ...|$|R
25|$|The Delta IV Medium+ (5,2) (Delta 9250) {{is similar}} to the Medium+ (4,2), but has a 5-m–diameter payload fairing for larger {{payloads}} and a modified second stage with a 5-meter liquid hydrogen tank and stretched liquid oxygen tank. Because of <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> of the larger payload fairing and second stage, the Medium+ (5,2) can launch 5,072kg to GTO.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{derivative of}} the A321, the A321-100, featured {{a reduction in}} range compared to the A320 as extra fuel tankage was not added to the initial design to compensate for <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight.</b> The maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of the A321-100 was increased to 83,000kg (183,000lb). The A321-100 entered service with Lufthansa in 1994. Only about 90 were ever produced.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Aeronautics {{analyzed}} {{the possibilities of}} the plane becoming a competitive race plane, and decided that <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> of the supercharger could be better put to use by installing an epicyclic reduction gear, for improved propeller efficiency, thereby providing greater improvement in performance than what the supercharged engine with a direct drive propeller could provide for the same weight.|$|E

5000|$|The German-designed bow anchor, Bügelanker (or Wasi), has a sharp tip for {{penetrating}} weed, {{and features}} a roll-bar {{which allows the}} correct setting attitude to be achieved without <b>the</b> need for <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> to be inserted into the tip.|$|R
5000|$|A {{limited edition}} M20G for the KGB (number unknown, but very small), {{powered by a}} [...] {{straight}} six (from the GAZ M12 ZIM), was also produced, giving the Pobeda a top speed reportedly 87 mph, and 0 - 60 mph time was down to 16 seconds from the stock model's 34; handling was compromised by <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> front-end <b>weight.</b>|$|R
25|$|Until June 2013, plug-in hybrids {{have not}} been {{eligible}} for these benefits. Because the Norwegian tax system levies higher taxes to heavier vehicles, plug-in hybrids are more expensive than similar conventional cars due to <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> of the battery pack and its additional electric components. Beginning on 1 July 2013, the existing weight allowance for conventional hybrids and plug-in hybrids of 10% will be increased to 15% for PHEVs.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of this technique, {{introduced in the}} early 2000s, uses three rings instead of two. The idea of this technique {{is to increase the}} number of friction points trapping the skin to make it less likely for the skin to slip between the rings as tension is applied. There is no firm consensus in the djembe community as to whether the benefits of this mounting are worth <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> and added complexity.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} during {{production}} of the F.K.3 there was a shortage of the RAF engines, and twelve aircraft were fitted with longer and heavier 120hp (90kW) six-cylinder inline water cooled Beardmore 120 hp. To carry <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight,</b> span was increased by 2ft (610mm), but though the extra power enhanced the climb rate, top speed was little changed and these machines were converted back to RAF engines when they became available.|$|E
50|$|Drivers {{are free}} to meet the {{specified}} power-to-weight ratios in any manner they choose. Some target lower horsepower but with low weight while others feel high horsepower (and <b>the</b> related <b>extra</b> <b>weight)</b> is <b>the</b> hot ticket. Many, of course, split the difference and sit somewhere in the middle. The concept behind GTS is that, as a car owner or driver, you can pursue your own chosen path to an optimal configuration.|$|R
500|$|Revisions {{were made}} to the {{suspension}} over the sedan's setup. These included stiffer springs, anti-roll bar changes and an additional ball-joint in the rear suspension to handle <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> load. <b>Weight</b> increases by [...] over the sedan. Aggressive pricing means Sportwagon variants of each specification level receive a A$1,000 premium over the sedan and are cheaper than the outgoing VZ wagons.|$|R
25|$|The {{airplane}} {{was delivered}} to Wright Field for testing on 27 July 1927, but it quickly {{became apparent that the}} Packard engine did not have sufficient power to compensate for <b>the</b> 800lbs of <b>extra</b> <b>weight,</b> <b>the</b> craft performing more poorly than its predecessor, and the project was quickly abandoned.|$|R
25|$|Hawker {{had long}} experimented with {{improving}} the armament of the fighter by fitting cannons. Their first experiments used two 20mm (.79in) Oerlikon cannons in pods, one under each wing, (one aircraft was tested during 1940 with 151 Squadron) but <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> and drag seriously compromised the aircraft's performance and manoeuvreability, {{and the limited}} amount of ammunition carried coupled with the frequent stoppages suffered by the drum-fed guns, meant the arrangement was unsatisfactory.|$|E
25|$|For duties {{closer to}} the front lines some Hurricanes were {{converted}} to Tactical Reconnaissance (Tac R) aircraft. An additional radio was fitted for liaison with ground forces who were better placed to direct the Hurricane. Some Hurricane Tac R aircraft also had a vertical camera fitted in the rear fuselage, so to compensate for <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> either one or two Brownings or two cannons would be omitted. Externally these aircraft were only distinguishable by the missing armament.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{a single}} {{standard}} BN-2 was re-engined with Dowty Rotol ducted fans. The ducted fan produced less noise than conventional propeller propulsion, some structural {{strengthening of the}} main wing spar at the root was required due to <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight.</b> This aircraft was subject to 18 months of flying trials to test the suitability of the ducted fan {{as a means of}} reducing aircraft noise; these tests reportedly demonstrated a 20 decibel noise reduction as well as increased thrust and reduced pollution.|$|E
30|$|In {{patients}} with severe obesity, <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> load of <b>weight</b> might represent a severe limitation per se for performing regular physical activity, therefore, the overall energy expenditure is reduced {{and the body}} weight tends to increase over the long-term (Gradaschi et al. 2014).|$|R
25|$|The vehicle's inner {{structure}} {{received as}} much attention as the aerodynamics of its exterior. Fiberglass outer panels were retained, but the Sting Ray emerged with nearly twice as much steel support in its central structure as the 1958—62 Corvette. <b>The</b> resulting <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> was balanced by a reduction in fiberglass thickness, so the finished product actually weighed a bit less than the old roadster. Passenger room was as good as before despite the tighter wheelbase, and the reinforcing steel girder made the cockpit both stronger and safer.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the modern}} Australian Stock Horse {{differs from the}} Waler horse {{in that it is}} not as big. The horses shipped abroad to fight in war and kept at home to be bred on as Walers were the larger animals, as they were {{required}} to carry a rider with <b>the</b> considerable <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> of weapons and a full pack. Some of the heaviest animals were also required pull water carts and carriages. However, the characteristics of toughness and endurance remain with the Australian Stock Horse of today.|$|R
25|$|When a {{piece of}} {{lithosphere}} that was heated and stretched cools again, its density rises, causing isostatic subsidence. If this subsidence continues long enough, the basin is called a sag basin. Examples of sag basins are the regions along passive continental margins, but sag basins {{can also be found}} in the interior of continents. In sag basins, <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> of the newly deposited sediments is enough to keep the subsidence going in a vicious circle. The total thickness of the sedimentary infill in a sag basins can thus exceed 10km.|$|E
25|$|The {{first car}} to be {{fitted with a}} new U.E.C. lower saloon was no. 16 and this {{appeared}} in service during the summer, the remaining rebuilt cars appearing shortly afterward. The fitting of top covers to these earlier cars had caused the original lower saloon frames to bow owing to <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight.</b> These new saloons had normal staircases, while the existing equipment {{was replaced by the}} new Dick, Kerr 40 h.p. motors and D.B.I. controllers. The position of the track wheel was altered, and roller blind indicators were fitted.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just the right moment, and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>weight</b> allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered with a flick of the wrist.|$|E

50|$|A {{helmet and}} gloves are usually {{regarded}} as {{sufficient for the}} majority of non-technical riding.
