5|$|In 1908–09, the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association became {{completely}} {{professional and}} {{changed its name}} to the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA). This led to the retirement of several stars, including Ottawa's Harvey Pulford and Montreal's Russell Bowie, who insisted on keeping their amateur status. The Montreal Victorias and Montreal HC founded the Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union, leaving only Ottawa, Quebec, Montreal Wanderers and Montreal Shamrocks in the ECHA. It was another season of player <b>turn-over</b> for Ottawa. Besides Pulford, Ottawa lost Alf Smith, who formed a competing Ottawa Senators professional team in the Federal League, and Tommy Phillips, who joined Edmonton. The club picked up Bruce Stuart from the Wanderers, Fred Lake from Winnipeg and Dubby Kerr from Toronto. This lineup had a successful season, winning 10 out of 12 games. Walsh led all scorers with 38 goals in 12 games, while Stuart had 22 and Kerr had 20. The season was clinched with a win against the Wanderers on March 3 in Ottawa, 8–3, as Ottawa won the league and Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|The exosome is {{involved}} in the degradation and processing {{of a wide variety of}} RNA species. In the cytoplasm of cells, it {{is involved}} in the <b>turn-over</b> of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors, through interactions with proteins from the nonsense mediated decay or non-stop decay pathways. In alternative fashion, mRNAs are degraded as part of their normal turnover. Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex. In the nucleus, the exosome is required for the correct processing of several small nuclear RNA molecules. Finally, the nucleolus is the compartment where the majority of the exosome complexes are found. There it plays a role in the processing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (the first identified function of the exosome) and of several small nucleolar RNAs.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that most mountain species, especially in the species-rich genera close to Pedaliodes, have very narrow altitudinal ranges, and are restricted to one or few mountain ranges. This leads to high <b>turn-over</b> of species along altitudinal gradients within a mountain range, and high <b>turn-over</b> between ranges. Most species {{appear to be more}} closely related to those occupying a similar altitudinal range in neighboring mountains, than to the species below or above. A possible mechanism was proposed by Adams and extensively discussed by Viloria. This involves a series of alternative events of colonization and isolation that would be linked to repeated cycles of cold-wet and warm-dry climate (glaciations and interglaciation periods).|$|E

25|$|The Overseas Passenger Terminal is host to both {{international}} and domestic cruise ships and liners. As a result of this, the Customs Hall, located within the OPT building is sometimes subject to the regulation and control of Border Protection, managed by the Australian Department of Immigration. Temporary spaces within the Customs Hall are prepared when a cruise ship is moored to allow immigration offers to screen passengers, providing health questionnaires, outbound/inbound passenger cards as well as passport control. Since the millennium upgrades, the efficiency and capacity of the OPT have been significantly improved, allowing for an average <b>turn-over</b> of 4,000 passengers within {{the course of a}} single day.|$|E

Command of the battalion also changed a couple of times, with Lieutenant Colonel Peter Webster taking over on 22 March, before he handed over to Lieutenant Colonel Eric Barnes.

500|$|The Trojans again showed {{inconsistency}} {{for most}} of the game before coming alive in the fourthquarter and pulling away to a 20–13 victory. [...] USC started out well, going ahead 10–0 in the secondquarter after running back Chauncey Washington's 18-yard touchdown run and David Buehler's 27-yard field goal. [...] However, the offense began to sputter; the Trojans amassed only 12total yards in the secondquarter and 50 in the third. [...] Part of the offense's problems were turnovers; Sanchez threw twointerceptions in the secondquarter, allowing Arizona to tie the game going into halftime. [...] The Wildcats kicked another field goal early in the thirdquarter to go up 13–10, raising speculation that USC was going to be upset for the secondconsecutive week. [...] The momentum of the game quickly changed in the fourthquarter after freshman running back Joe McKnight, touted as the next great Trojans tailback but yet to meet expectations, made a 45-yard punt return that Sanchez followed up on the next play with a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Fred Davis. [...] After a defensive stop, Arizona punter Keenyn Crier kicked an 83-yard punt to the Trojans one-yard line. [...] The Trojans pushed forward with fullback Stanley Havili before McKnight again made a big play, running 59yards and setting up what would be a Trojans field goal. [...] The USC defense then forced an Arizona <b>turn-over</b> on downs to preserve the victory. Sanchez recovered from his poor firsthalf performance with a strong performance in the second, where he completed 11 of 15passes for 74yards and a touchdown while later making a key 10-yard scramble on third and seven late in the fourthquarter.|$|E

60|$|But {{there was}} another new factor in the {{situation}} which was of greater local importance. The British Prime Minister had perceived that the conclusion of hostilities might soon bring with it the break-up of the political bloc upon which he was depending for his personal ascendency, and that the domestic difficulties which would be attendant on demobilization, the <b>turn-over</b> of industry from war to peace conditions, the financial situation, and the general psychological reactions of men's minds, would provide his enemies with powerful weapons, {{if he were to}} leave them time to mature. The best chance, therefore, of consolidating his power, which was personal and exercised, as such, independently of party or principle, to an extent unusual in British politics, evidently lay in active hostilities before the prestige of victory had abated, and in an attempt to found on the emotions of the moment a new basis of power which might outlast the inevitable reactions of the near future. Within a brief period, therefore, after the Armistice, the popular victor, {{at the height of his}} influence and his authority, decreed a General Election. It was widely recognized at the time as an act of political immorality. There were no grounds of public interest which did not call for a short delay until the issues of the new age had a little defined themselves and until the country had something more specific before it on which to declare its mind and to instruct its new representatives. But the claims of private ambition determined otherwise.|$|E
60|$|This is {{essentially}} a theatrical neighbourhood. There is not a potboy in the vicinity who is not, {{to a greater or}} less extent, a dramatic character.

There are several of these shops in the narrow streets and dirty courts, of which there are so many near the national theatres, and they all have tempting goods of this description, with the addition, perhaps, of a lady’s pink dress covered with spangles; white wreaths, stage shoes, and a tiara like a tin lamp reflector. They have been purchased of some wretched supernumeraries, or sixth-rate actors, and are now offered for the benefit of the rising generation, who, on condition of making certain weekly payments, amounting in the whole to about ten times their value, may avail themselves of such desirable bargains.|$|E

There has never surely, since the world began, been any suddenness so big, so instantly mobilised, any more than there has been an equal enormity so sudden (if, after all, that can be called sudden, or more than comparatively so, which, it is now clearly visible, had been brewing in the councils of the two awful Kaisers from a good while back.) The entrance of this country into the fray has been supremely inevitable--never doubt for an instant of that; up to a few short days ago she was still multiplying herself over Europe, in the magnificent energy and pertinacity of Edward Grey, for peace, and nothing but peace, in any way in which he could by any effort or any service help to preserve it; and has now only been beaten by what one can only call the huge immorality, the deep conspiracy for violence, for violence and wrong, of the Austrian and the German Emperors. Till the solemnly guaranteed neutrality of Belgium was three or four days ago deliberately violated by Germany, in defiance of every right, in her ferocious push to get at France by that least fortified way, we still hung in the balance here; but with that no [...] "balance" [...] was any longer possible, and the impulse to participate to the utmost in resistance and redress became as unanimous and as sweeping a thing in the House of Commons and throughout the land as it is possible to conceive. That is the one light, as one may call it, in so much sickening blackness--that in an hour, here, all breaches instantly healed, all divisions dropped, the Irish dissension, on which Germany had so clearly counted, dried up in a night--so that there is at once the most striking and interesting spectacle of united purpose. For myself, I draw a long breath that we are not to have failed France or shirked any shadow of a single one of the implications of the Entente; for the reason that we go in only under the last compulsion, and with cleaner hands than we have ever had, I think, in any such matter since such matters were.

6000|$|Distributive {{co-operation}} is at {{once the}} simplest and the most [...] successful form, not merely because it requires less for capital [...] than any other for its inception, {{but also because it}} calls for [...] less business and executive capacity. The number of persons [...] capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than [...] the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties [...] involved in the care of wholesale houses—or, at all events, of [...] mills and factories. Distributive co-operation has its origin in [...] the fact that the expenses of a middle-man between the producer [...] and consumer may be entirely dispensed with, and in the fact that [...] more capital had collected in the business of distribution than [...] could economically be so employed. Its educating power on the men [...] concerned in teaching them to save, in showing the need of [...] business methods, and in instilling the elements of industrial [...] management, is of no little importance. It is, therefore, the best [...] gateway to any further or more difficult co-operative [...] experiments—such experiments as can be attempted only after the [...] proper capital is saved, and the necessary executive capacity is [...] discovered, or developed by training. In England co-operation [...] began its history in distributive stores, and has finally led to [...] such a stimulus of self-help in the laborer, that now co-operative [...] gymnasiums, libraries, gardens, and other results have proved the [...] wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions. Under [...] the system which separates employers and the employed, high wages [...] are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish; [...] for it is sometimes found that the best-paid workmen are the most [...] unwise and intemperate.(316) For the most ignorant and unskilled [...] of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to [...] give not merely more wages, but give more {{in such a way as}} might [...] excite new and better motives, a desire as well as a possibility [...] of improvement. Self-help must be stimulated, not deadened by [...] stifling dependence on a class of superiors, or on the state. The [...] extraordinary growth of co-operation is one of the most cheering [...] signs of modern times. Distributive co-operation originated in [...] Rochdale, in England, about 1844, with a few laborers desirous of [...] saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions. [...] By uniting, they purchased tea by the chest, sugar by the [...] hogshead, which they sold to each member at market prices. They [...] were surprised to find a large profit by the operation, which they [...] divided proportionally to the capital subscribed. Others soon [...] joined them; they took a store-room, and in 1882 there were 10,894 [...] members, with a share capital of $1,576,215, and with realized [...] profits in that year of $162,885. They have erected expensive [...] steam flour-mills, and the society occupies eighteen branch [...] establishments in Rochdale. Libraries containing more than 15,000 [...] volumes, and classes in science, language, and the technical arts, [...] attended by 500 students, have been maintained. The extension of [...] the Rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale [...] establishment of their own. It is now a large institution with [...] branches in London and Newcastle. “It owns manufactories in [...] London, Manchester, Newcastle, Leicester, Durham, and Crumpsall; [...] and it has depots in Cork, Limerick, Kilmallock, Waterford, [...] Tipperary, Tralee, and Armagh, for the purchase of butter, [...] potatoes, and eggs.
