40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} {{identify the}} various methods of speed management and their effects. Methods: A systematic search {{was performed in}} Science Direct, Ovid Medline, Scopus, PubMed and ProQuest databases from April to June 2015. Hand searching and reference of selected articles were used to improve article identification. Articles published after 1990 which had reported on efficacy/effectiveness of speed management strategies were included. Data were extracted using pre-defined extraction table.

30|$|An {{electronic}} {{search of}} the literature was performed via MEDLINE by crossing the key words “systemic lupus erythematosus” AND [“bone marrow fibrosis” OR “myelofibrosis”]. We then examined additional references from <b>the</b> <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles.</b> The study period ran from January 1975 through December 2013. Only papers written in English were reviewed.|$|E
30|$|The {{resulting}} outputs {{were then}} combined. Duplicated results were excluded. The remaining articles were independently evaluated by 3 investigators (PVM, CAG and MP) for eligibility.

30|$|A {{systematic}} {{search of}} the electronic literature database of the National Library of Medicine (PubMed-MEDLINE) was conducted using search terms to identify relevant articles regarding {{the aim of the}} review. The search was restricted to articles published in English between January 1985 and September 2013, and the references of <b>the</b> <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> were also searched.|$|E
30|$|In addition, the {{references}} cited by <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> <b>retrieved</b> were examined for potential relevance. Data was {{extracted from the}} studies included {{by one of the}} authors and this extraction checked independently by a second author.|$|R
30|$|We {{constructed}} the search string using several iterations and pilot tests {{to ensure that}} we used a comprehensive set of synonyms to allow for high coverage while keeping <b>the</b> number of <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> under control.

30|$|For {{the present}} {{systematic}} review, two reviewers independently analysed the titles and abstracts of <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> <b>retrieved</b> from <b>the</b> literature search and reviewed {{the full text}} of the published articles.

30|$|The {{use of a}} {{combination}} of LSF or HP with other methods of fixation and non-English studies were excluded.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> {{were then}} {{independently}} screened for eligibility by two authors. Studies were included into this review when healthy parturients scheduled for caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia {{were randomly assigned}} to at least one intervention arm that aimed to prevent or treat anaesthesia-induced hypotension. In agreement with others [6], blinding of the graders was not performed since research on the impact of blinding on the evaluation of quality of RCTs has yielded ambiguous results [7, 8].|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a framework to supplement and tag computerized CPG with related best-evidence automatically sourced from on-line medical literature repositories. The {{idea is to}} provide CPG users with additional published evidence pertaining to the different sections of a CPG of their interest. We present a webenabled Best-evidence Retrieval and Delivery (BiRD) system that autonomously retrieves pertinent medical literature with respect to user-specified content from a GEM-encoded CPG. This is achieved via a multi-level literature search strategy that uses the actual CPG content to autonomously generate a search query. The featured search strategy firstly categorizes the search query towards a priori defined clinical query subjects and secondly filters out insignificant medical terms from the search query. The technical architecture comprises existing medical language processing tools and vocabularies, together with newly developed tools to automatically (a) generate optimum search queries; (b) <b>retrieve</b> medical <b>articles</b> from MEDLINE; and (c) embed <b>the</b> <b>retrieved</b> medical <b>articles</b> within XML-based CPG encoded according to the GEM formalism. 1...|$|R
40|$|Biologists {{often need}} to find {{information}} about genes whose function is not described in the genome databases. Currently they must try to search disparate biomedical literature to locate relevant articles, and spend considerable efforts reading <b>the</b> <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> in order to locate the most relevant knowledge about the gene. We describe our software, the first that automatically generates gene summaries from biomedical literature. We present a two-stage summarization method, which involves first retrieving relevant articles and then extracting the most informative sentences from <b>the</b> <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> to generate a structured gene summary. The generated summary explicitly covers multiple aspects of a gene, such as the sequence information, mutant phenotypes, and molecular interaction with other genes. We propose several heuristic approaches to improve the accuracy in both stages. The proposed methods are evaluated using 10 randomly chosen genes from FlyBase and a subset of Medline abstracts about Drosophila. The {{results show that the}} precision of the top selected sentences in the 6 aspects is typically about 50 - 70 %, and the generated summaries are quite informative, indicating that our approaches are effective in automatically summarizing literature information about genes. The generated summaries not only are directly useful to biologists but also serve as useful entry points to enable them to quickly digest the retrieved literature articles. 1...|$|E
30|$|This {{original}} {{search was}} then refined {{with the additional}} keywords: “infertility”, “bleeding”, and “cancer”. Data were extracted from the original and refined searches regarding number of retrieved publications, source journals, the language, and the geographical origin of each article. The number of retrieved articles per year was also normalized to {{the total number of}} articles indexed by Scopus. We divided <b>the</b> <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> into two different periods (1982 – 1996 and 1997 – 2012) in order to allow for comparative analysis. For source journals analysis, we focused on the period 2007 – 2012, in order to provide recent data.|$|E
30|$|The initial {{selection}} excluded all {{titles and}} abstracts {{not related to}} the topic or that involved any exclusion criteria.

Titles with no abstract available that suggested a relationship to the objectives of this review were selected to screen the full text. The reference lists of <b>the</b> <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> also were hand searched for additional relevant publications that could have been missed in the databases.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} modifiable {{risk factors}} for child pedestrian injuries. DATA SOURCES: (1) MEDLINE search from 1985 to 1995; search term used was traffic accidents; (2) review of reference lists from <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles</b> and books; (3) review of reference lists from three systematic reviews on childhood injuries and (4) consultation with 'key informants'. STUDY SELECTION: All studies that examined the {{risk factors for}} child pedestrian injuries were targeted for retrieval. Seventy potentially relevant articles were identified using article titles, and, when available, abstracts. Of <b>the</b> 70 <b>retrieved</b> <b>articles,</b> 44 were later assessed as being relevant. QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Articles were classified {{on the basis of}} study design as being either descriptive (hypothesis generating) (26) or analytical (hypothesis testing) (18) studies. Consensus was used for difficult to classify articles. DATA EXTRACTION: Variables judged to be risk factors for child pedestrian injuries were extracted by one author. DATA SYNTHESIS: A qualitative summary of the information extracted from relevant articles is presented in tabular form. RESULTS: Risk factors for child pedestrian injuries were classified as: (1) child, (2) social and cultural, (3) physical environment, and (4) driver. Risk factors within each classification are summarized and discussed...|$|R
