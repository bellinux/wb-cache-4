5|$|Maurice's natural {{goodness}} never wavers in the story. Unlike Shelley's Frankenstein, {{which suggests}} that environment determines a person's morality, Maurice assumes <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be innately good. Maurice even forgives Dame Smithson, who stole him from his nurse. The story aims to generate sympathy in its readers. In contrast with other children's stories of its day, it lacks didacticism and draws no clear distinctions between virtue and vice.|$|E
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw her views {{as a unique}} and final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another distinction (<b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be harmed by the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E
5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> take {{to increase the}} chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E

5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological {{excavations}} {{that have}} been undertaken since 1998 are funded by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council and grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and have received news coverage. The site {{is used as a}} training excavation for students and a community dig to introduce people to ancient history, with the participation of Mellor Archaeological Trust. In 2002, students from Ridge Danyers Sixth Form College built a replica roundhouse that is still standing on the site. Many of the artefacts discovered at Mellor during the excavations are on permanent display at Stockport Museum. The site {{is open to the public}} annually, in the first week of September, so <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> view the work done over the past season of digging.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

25|$|The Lining: lining is {{considered}} an unnecessary burden and the Neapolitan tailors keep it as minimal as possible. Usually, the jacket is unlined or only half lined, {{in order to provide}} lightness; even the sleeves are completely unlined, as they’re meant to fit like a second skin. Additionally, the lining is often left open (“volante,” literally “flying”) so <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> admire the fine details and construction of the jacket.|$|E
25|$|A cyberpsychology {{research}} {{study conducted by}} Australian researchers demonstrated {{that a number of}} positive psychological outcomes are related to Facebook use.

Importantly, this online social connectedness was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater levels of subjective well-being. These findings suggest that the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use.|$|E

25|$|According to the International Labour Organization, as of 2014 {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside {{their country of origin}} for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment). International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, freedom of movement for workers in the European Union means <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.|$|E
25|$|A karaoke bar, {{restaurant}}, club or lounge is a bar or {{restaurant that}} provides karaoke equipment so <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> sing publicly, sometimes {{on a small}} stage. Most of these establishments allow patrons to sing for free, {{with the expectation that}} sufficient revenue will be made selling food and drink to the singers. Less commonly, the patron wishing to sing must pay a small fee for each song they sing. Both are financially beneficial for the establishment by not having to pay a professional singer or a cabaret tax which is usually applied to any entertainment of more than 1 person.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other sexual behaviors, but {{its association with}} dominance and submission, as well as taboo, makes it an appealing stimulus to people of all sexual orientations. In addition to sexual penetration by the penis, people may use sex toys such as butt plugs or anal beads, engage in fingering, anilingus, pegging, anal masturbation or fisting for anal sexual activity, and different sex positions may also be included. Fisting is the least practiced of the activities, partly because it is uncommon <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> relax enough to accommodate an object {{as big as a}} fist being inserted into the anus.|$|E
