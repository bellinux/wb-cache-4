40|$|Abstract. Disregarded for centuries, Mediterranean {{pine forests}} in Spain have been {{severely}} affected by human activities including fires and livestock grazing. As a consequence, reforestation programs were {{started by the}} late 1800 s, albeit {{the origin of the}} seeds was not considered until the late 1960 s. In July 2005, a large Pinus pinaster Ait. forest, located in Guadalajara (central Spain), burned down. In this area, we studied fire-related fitness traits in natural stands (zone N) and compared them to those of trees sown with seeds from foreign sources (<b>zone</b> <b>S).</b> Cone production per hectare in zone N doubled that found in <b>zone</b> <b>S.</b> In addition, <b>zone</b> N resulted in more saplings per hectare as well as more small trees bearing cones than <b>zone</b> <b>S.</b> In <b>zone</b> <b>S,</b> trees showed thicker crowns and less fructification resulting in open formations with low intraspecific competition. Whereas in the natural stands the average percentage of serotiny per tree was 32 %, in the sown stands only one serotinous cone was found in seven unburned harvested trees. Compared with <b>zone</b> <b>S,</b> the presence of seedlings after springtime was almost nine times higher in zone N in spite of the damaging effects of logging and removal of burnt wood...|$|R

High concentration occurrence during mining of a longwall panel raises a number of potential problems which demand greater understanding to allow efficient mining while maintaining safe and healthy environmental conditions. Longwall panels at Mine A and Mine B have recently mined through H 2 <b>S</b> <b>zones.</b> The high H 2 <b>S</b> <b>zone</b> mined through at Mine A was wide and covering the whole length of the face comparing to the narrow H 2 <b>S</b> <b>zone</b> which was cutting the panel at 45 degree at Mine B. Longwall panels had been sampled for H 2 S in pre-mining phases with vertical and inseam exploration boreholes and rib sampling of gateroad development headings. During mining face coal samples were collected in an intensive program and tested in a drum tumbler to determine an “indicated ” seam concentration level through contouring {{that could be used}} to calculate the concentrations of H 2 S liberated to the atmosphere. Data was analysed to determine a geostatistical method which would best represent the “indicated ” seam concentration level from the given data and the block dimension of the data set. This study discusses the different sampling methods used, selection of the most suitable geostatistical method and the impact of grid size on results of data analysis. Some general observations are made correlating “indicated ” seam H 2 S concentrations from production face sampling with both predictions made from exploration and liberation rates during mining of the longwall panel...|$|R

This observation was somewhat similar to what happened with nitrate. Phosphate concentrations were generally low (mean: 0. 75 muM- maximum: 2. 4 muM) compared to the other dissolved nutrients. Mean nitrate concentrations were about 18 muM but some extreme concentrations, up to 140 muM were observed.

40|$|To {{predict the}} heat {{transfer}} behavior of A 380 alloy in a shot sleeve, a numerical approach (inverse method) is used and validated by high {{pressure die casting}} (HPDC) experiment under non-shooting condition. The maximum difference between the measured and calculated temperature profiles is smaller than 3 ℃, {{which suggests that the}} inverse method can be used to predict the heat transfer behavior of alloys in a shot sleeve. Furthermore, the results indicate an increase in maximum interfacial heat flux density (qmax) and heat transfer coefficient (hmax) with an increase in sleeve filling ratio, especially at the pouring <b>zone</b> (<b>S</b> 2 <b>zone).</b> In addition, the values of initial temperature (TIDS) and maximum shot sleeve surface temperature (Tsimax) at the two end <b>zones</b> (<b>S</b> 2 and S 10) are higher than those at the middle <b>zone</b> (<b>S</b> 5). Moreover, in comparison with fluctuations in heat transfer coefficient (h) with time at the two end <b>zones</b> (<b>S</b> 2 and S 10), 2. 4 - 6. 5 kW·m- 2 ·K- 1, 3. 5 - 12. 5 kW·m- 2 ·K- 1, respectively, more fluctuations are found at <b>S</b> 5 <b>zone,</b> 2. 1 - 14. 7 kW·m- 2 ·K- 1. These differences could theoretically explain the formation of the three zones: smooth pouring zone, un-smooth middle zone and smooth zone, with different morphologies in the metal log under the non-shot casting condition. Finally, our calculations also reveal that the values of qmax and hmax cast at 680 ℃ are smaller than those cast at 660 ℃ and at 700 ℃...|$|R

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) -specific {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) was {{analyzed}} by electrophoresis on 0. 5 % agarose gels. Four classes of RNA were resolved {{as a function}} of mobility in agarose: two classes of slowly migrating multistranded RNA, the infectious viral RNA with intermediate mobility, and a minor fast-moving class of lower-molecular-weight single-stranded RNA. The major RNA species were infectious viral RNA and the slowest migrating class of multistranded RNA. The latter RNA was polydisperse when analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, it was partially ribonuclease resistant, and it was the predominant RNA species labeled during the initial period of 3 H-uridine triphosphate incorporation in the cell-free system. Heat treatment studies indicated that part of the slowest-moving RNA was degraded at 60 C and almost complete degradation was detected at 100 C. It was concluded that this RNA is the replicative intermediate in viral RNA synthesis. The second class of multistranded RNA contained both a ribonuclease-resistant RNA and a second RNA peak which was detected only after heat treatment at temperatures above 75 C. Fractions of FMDV-specific RNA isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis. Infectious viral RNA was detected only in the 37 <b>S</b> <b>zone</b> and was the major species of RNA {{in this part of the}} gradient. The ribonuclease-resistant RNA (the 20 <b>S</b> <b>zone)</b> contained about equal amounts of multistranded RNA (both classes) and the low-molecular-weight single-stranded RNA.

40|$|The {{passage of}} {{immunoglobulin}} from plasma to the oral cavity was studied in rhesus monkeys. Immunoglobulins G, A and M were purified from pooled rhesus monkey serum, radiolabelled with 125 I and injected intravenously into twelve monkeys. Sequential samples of oral fluids were taken over a 24 h period and were assayed for radioactivity. Radioactivity could be detected in crevicular fluid washings after 0. 5 h in monkeys injected with IgG and IgA, and after 2 h in monkeys given IgM. Maximal levels were found after 4 h with each immunoglobulin. Radioactivity in parotid and mixed saliva could be detected in all animals after 30 min, reaching a maximal level after 4 h. Ultracentrifugation on sucrose density gradients revealed {{that most of}} the radioactivity in crevicular fluid washings was in the 7 <b>S</b> <b>zone</b> in the animals given IgG and IgA, and in a 19 <b>S</b> <b>zone</b> in animals given IgM. The radioactivity in partoid saliva did not represent intact immunoglobulin molecules, since all the activity was present in zones of low molecular weight in animals given IgG, IgA or IgM. In mixed saliva a small amount of radioactivity was found in the immunoglobulin zones. The results suggest that intact molecules of IgG, IgA and IgM can pass from plasma to the oral cavity via crevicular fluid, and could contribute to oral defence mechanisms particularly in the crevicular domain. The volume of crevicular fluid in the approximal space of deciduous molars of rhesus monkeys was estimated to be approximately 0. 3 microliter...|$|R
