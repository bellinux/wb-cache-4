500|$|In her 2014 biography, Valerie Solanas, Breanne Fahs {{argues that}} it is {{unlikely}} that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias. Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the SCUM Manifesto, which he had published. Fahs states that [...] "the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning." [...] Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Miles said that Solanas [...] "had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> her mind." [...] Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then [...] "... shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn't know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble." ...|$|E
50|$|On November 27, 2013 Wood was {{recruited}} by Carlton Football Club in the rookie draft. He made his debut for Carlton on July 18, 2014 in an upset win over North Melbourne, {{in what was}} his first AFL game since round 22 of the 2012 home and away season. He took seven marks and won 26 hit-outs as well as 10 disposals in an impressive return to AFL football. In a post-match interview with CFC TV after the win Wood said, 'this time last year playing AFL again was one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> my mind'. He played <b>the</b> <b>last</b> six games of the season, and was a regular in Carlton's ruck rotation in 2015, playing eighteen games.|$|R

500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2001 Masters, Hunter {{beat his}} {{close friend and}} {{defending}} champion Matthew Stevens 6–5 in the last 16, Peter Ebdon 6–3 in the quarter-finals and Stephen Hendry 6–4 in the semi-finals. In the final Hunter recovered from a 3–7 deficit against Fergal O'Brien to win 10–9. Hunter compiled four centuries in six frames, and earned the £175,000 first prize. In his post-match interview, Hunter caused a media sensation by admitting he resorted to [...] "Plan B" [...] with Lindsey Fell, then his girlfriend, during the interval while 2–6 down. The 'B' in [...] "Plan B" [...] purportedly refers to the word [...] "bonk", a British slang term for sexual intercourse. Hunter and Fell retired to their hotel room and he recalled: [...] "Sex was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> my mind. I just wasn't in the mood. But I {{had to do something}} to break the tension. It was a quick session – around 10 minutes or so – but I felt great afterwards. She jumped in the bath, I had a kip and then played like a dream. I reeled off four centuries in six frames. I won easily." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several days later, it was {{reported}} that Hayley Erin—who previously appeared as Abby Newman on The Young and the Restless had been hired to recast the role of Kiki Jerome. The network released a statement to wish Alderson well on her career and to confirm Hayley Erin's casting. Alderson herself also congratulated Erin on her casting on Twitter. Erin received a callback after her initial audition to read opposite head writer Ron Carlivati. [...] "It was between me and one other girl" [...] though she was unaware that it was for a recast. After the audition, Erin left the studio and was quickly contacted by her agent and manager instructing her to return to the studio for a wardrobe fitting. [...] "I started crying a little bit" [...] she revealed. Up until a few days before her audition, Erin revealed that a return to daytime after five years was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> her mind. Erin had just expressed her interest in appearing on another soap and she booked the role of Kiki later that week. In the summer of 2015, rumors circulated that Erin would be replaced by a returning Kristen Alderson. Network executive Nathan Varni denied the rumors and said [...] "I have a lot of faith in the role of Kiki moving forward. Varni also praised the actress and said [...] "I think Hayley [...] is doing a fantastic, admirable job as Kiki." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Damita Jo {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews from most music critics. The album holds an average score of 53 based on 13 reviews on Metacritic. Jesse Washington of The Associated Press commended Damita Jo as [...] "sinfully appealing" [...] and [...] "infectious," [...] saying [...] "relaxation is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> her agenda with this sinfully appealing concoction of infectious beats and scandalous lyrics." [...] Washington added, [...] "Such content isn’t unusual in today’s pop culture landscape, where cable TV’s raunch is stealing viewers and awards from broadcast networks and the Cat in the Hat tells dirty jokes on movie screens." [...] Jackson's voice was considered [...] "sweet and frosting-light" [...] among the record's [...] "excellent tunes," [...] specifying [...] "We {{look for her}} to entertain us with excellent videos, saturate the radio with catchy tunes, and move our bodies in the club. Damita Jo" [...] has the goods to do exactly that." [...] USA Today rated the album {{three out of four}} stars, saying Jackson [...] "isn't sweating it musically" [...] despite negative publicity. The critique regarded Jackson to [...] "freely pursues her sexual and love fantasies", noting [...] "If she ever seemed tentative in her erotic explorations in the past, she's completely self-assured here. [...] This is a happy, loving Jackson, as prone to romantic walks on the beach as to roadside quickies." [...] Its premise of split personae was considered [...] "a bit complicated", but clarified [...] "that's who Damita Jo is." [...] Jackson's new collaborators were said to induece a [...] "freshening" [...] effect while maintaining familiarity.|$|E

A minute later the other boat was on the spot, and the men were at work picking up their comrades. By the time all were in, she was only {{an inch or two}} out of the water, and there was only room for two men to pull; and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> those <b>on</b> board <b>the</b> lugger saw of her in the gathering darkness, she was slowly making her way towards shore.|$|R
50|$|The season {{started in}} {{worrying}} fashion, {{with just one}} win in the club's opening seven fixtures, and despite a brief rally of 6 wins in 10 over September to November, a 0-1 defeat at Luton Town on 21 December 1974 left {{the idea of a}} title charge as <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> club's mind. However, a run of just 3 defeats in their last 20 games, which saw the club take 30 points from a possible 40, helped urge Derby up the title and the title was sealed after a 0-0 draw away to Leicester combined with Ipswich Town drawing at Manchester City, confirmed Derby as champions {{for the second time in}} four years. Peter Daniel, who stepped in for Roy McFarland who suffered an Achilles Tendon injury whilst on international duty and missed all but <b>the</b> <b>last</b> four matches, warned the club's Player of the Season award and Ron Webster became only the fifth player to break 500 appearances for Derby during his appearance in the defeat at Luton, whilst Boulton broke the record for goalkeeping appearances during the campaign, on his way to 344 appearances total for the club. Colin Todd was awarded the PFA Players' Player of the Year award for the 1974-75 season, the only Derby County player to do so.|$|R

6000|$|The land {{suddenly}} {{at night}} looms up right over your bows, {{or perhaps the}} cry of [...] "Broken water ahead!"

You ask yourself, Where on earth did I get to? How on earth did I get there? with a conviction that it could not be your own act, that there has been at work some mysterious conspiracy of accident; that the charts are all wrong, and if the charts are not wrong, that land and sea have changed their places; that your misfortune shall for ever remain inexplicable, since you have lived always with the sense of your trust, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> closing your eyes, the first on opening them, as if your mind had kept firm hold of your responsibility during the hours of sleep.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Wilson entertained a great abhorrence {{of what is}} {{commonly}} called accomplishments in a woman; she knew that {{too much of that}} precious time which could never be recalled, was thrown away in endeavoring to acquire a smattering in what, if known, could never be of use to the party, and what can never be well known but to a few, whom nature and long practice have enabled to conquer. Yet as her niece had early manifested a taste for painting, and a vivid perception of the beauties of nature, her inclination had been indulged, and Emily Moseley sketched with neatness and accuracy, and with great readiness. It would have been no subject of surprise, had admiration, or some more powerful feeling, betrayed to the artist, on this occasion, the deception the young man was practising. She had entered the room from her walk, warm and careless; her hair, than which none was more beautiful, had strayed on her shoulders, freed, from the confinement of the comb, and a lock was finely contrasted to the rich color of a cheek that almost burnt with the exercise and the excitement. Her dress, white as the first snow of the winter; her looks, as she now turned them {{on the face of the}} sleeper, and betrayed by their animation the success of her art; formed a picture in itself, that Denbigh would have been content to gaze on for ever. Her back was to a window that threw its strong light on the paper--the figures of which were reflected, as she occasionally held it up to study its effect, in a large mirror so placed that Denbigh caught a view of her subject. He knew it at a glance--the arbor--the gun--himself, all were there; it appeared to have been drawn before--it must have been, from its perfect state, and Emily had seized a favorable moment to complete his own resemblance. Her touches were light and finishing, and as the picture was frequently held up for consideration, he had some time allowed for studying it. His own resemblance was strong; his eyes were turned on herself, to whom Denbigh thought she had not done ample justice, but the man who held the gun bore no likeness to John Moseley, except in dress. A slight movement of the muscles of the sleeper's mouth might have betrayed his consciousness, had not Emily been too intent on the picture, as she turned it in such a way that a strong light fell on the recoiling figure of Captain Jarvis. The resemblance was wonderful. Denbigh thought he would have known it, had he seen it in the Academy itself. The noise of some one approaching closed the portfolio; it was only a servant, yet Emily did not resume her pencil. Denbigh watched her motions, as she put the picture carefully in a private drawer of the secretary, reopened the blind, replaced the screen, and laid the handkerchief, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> his face, with a movement almost imperceptible to himself.|$|E
