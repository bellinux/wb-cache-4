5|$|Teeth {{from what}} is now {{documented}} as a <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> were found in 1874 by Arthur Lakes near Golden, Colorado. In the early 1890s, John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming. The fossils {{were believed to be}} from a large species of Ornithomimus (O. grandis) but are now considered <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> remains. Vertebral fragments found by Edward Drinker Cope in western South Dakota in 1892 and assigned to Manospondylus gigas have also been recognized as belonging to <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex.</b>|$|E

5|$|Barnum Brown, {{assistant}} {{curator of}} the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial skeleton of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> in eastern Wyoming in 1900. H. F. Osborn originally named this skeleton Dynamosaurus imperiosus in a paper in 1905. Brown found another partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 1902. Osborn used this holotype to describe <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> in the same paper in which D. imperiosus was described. In 1906, Osborn recognized the two as synonyms, and acted as first revisor by selecting Tyrannosaurus as the valid name. The original Dynamosaurus material resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} for sexual dimorphism has been weakened. A 2005 {{study reported that}} previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting doubt {{on the existence of}} similar dimorphism between <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> sexes. A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E
5|$|Like many bipedal dinosaurs, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> was {{historically}} {{depicted as}} a 'living tripod', with the body at 45 degrees or less from the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground, similar to a kangaroo. This concept dates from Joseph Leidy's 1865 reconstruction of Hadrosaurus, the first to depict a dinosaur in a bipedal posture. In 1915, convinced that the creature stood upright, Henry Fairfield Osborn, {{former president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, further reinforced the notion in unveiling the first complete <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> skeleton arranged this way. It stood in an upright pose for 77 years, until it was dismantled in 1992.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{retrospective}} review, Dave Thompson, {{writing for}} AllMusic, called it [...] "the most underrated of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>Rex's</b> four albums". Tiny Mix Tapes wrote, [...] "Prophets, {{nearly four decades}} after its initial release, remains a timeless album for everyone".|$|R
5000|$|Each episode {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} evolutionary origins of a particular trait of living creatures: for example, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>Rex's</b> 13-inch teeth, the gecko's [...] "Velcro-like" [...] toe pads, and the bald eagle's [...] "telescopic" [...] vision capable of spotting a hare a mile away.|$|R
50|$|We {{know that}} <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rexs</b> {{position}} of the eyes were {{similar to that of}} modern humans. But their eyes and optic lobe were much larger than that of modern humans. T. rex, unlike most dinosaurs, had a combination of powerful eyesight and great sense of smell.|$|R
5|$|More than 50specimens of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> {{have been}} identified, {{some of which}} are nearly {{complete}} skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in {{at least one of these}} specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology and potential speed of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to be a second Tyrannosaurus species while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{commonly}} understood Tyrannosauroidea {{to include}} the tyrannosaurids and their immediate ancestors. With the advent of phylogenetic taxonomy in vertebrate paleontology, however, the clade has received several more explicit definitions. The first was by Paul Sereno in 1998, where Tyrannosauroidea {{was defined as a}} stem-based taxon including all species sharing a more recent common ancestor with <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> than with neornithean birds. To make the family more exclusive, Thomas Holtz redefined it in 2004 to include all species more closely related to <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> than to Ornithomimus velox, Deinonychus antirrhopus or Allosaurus fragilis. Sereno published a new definition in 2005, using Ornithomimus edmontonicus, Velociraptor mongoliensis and Troodon formosus as external specifiers. The Sereno definition was adopted in a 2010 review.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is closely}} related to the much larger and more recent tyrannosaurid <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex.</b> Like most tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus was a multi-tonne bipedal {{predator}} equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. Daspletosaurus had the small forelimbs typical of tyrannosaurids, although they were proportionately longer than in other genera.|$|E
50|$|The {{album was}} paired with <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>Rex's</b> {{follow-up}} album Prophets, Seers & Sages: The Angels of the Ages (1968) and released in 1972 as the double album Tyrannosaurus Rex: A Beginning, following {{the success of}} T. Rex's Electric Warrior (1971) and The Slider (1972) albums. It reached No. 1 in the UK. The double release remains the longest album title of any UK No. 1 album.|$|R
5000|$|Toft {{started at}} Tony Pike music in 1964 as a trainee {{and two years}} later moved to CBS Studios. He joined Europe's first 8-track {{recording}} facility, Trident Studios in London, in 1967 as its first engineer after being offered the position while attending the studio's opening party. He worked with Tony Visconti during the recording of British band <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>Rex's</b> first three albums and David Bowie's Space Oddity album. He later engineered James Taylor's debut album and was the mix engineer on The Beatles' song [...] "Hey Jude." ...|$|R
5000|$|Took {{developed}} his own songwriting and in early 1969, with recording just complete on <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>Rex's</b> third LP, Unicorn, Took suggested to Bolan that the duo could perform {{some of his}} own material; Bolan refused. By this time, their lifestyles were in direct conflict. Bolan was living quietly with wife-to-be June Child, while Took was rapidly forging links with [...] "revolutionary" [...] underground acts, such as The Deviants and The Pretty Things. The relationship was deteriorating badly—Bolan barely tolerated Took's drug use, and Steve Mann recalled that it was clear they [...] "cordially detested each other".|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} groups of dinosaurs, very {{complete}} remains have been discovered for most known tyrannosaurids. This has allowed a variety of research into their biology. Scientific {{studies have focused on}} their ontogeny, biomechanics and ecology, among other subjects. Soft tissue has been reported from one specimen of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Soviet {{paleontologist}} Evgeny Maleev named a new species, Tyrannosaurus bataar, from Mongolia. By 1965, {{this species}} had been renamed Tarbosaurus bataar. Despite the renaming, many phylogenetic analyses have found Tarbosaurus bataar {{to be the}} sister taxon of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex,</b> and {{it has often been}} considered an Asian species of Tyrannosaurus. A recent redescription of the skull of Tarbosaurus bataar has shown that it was much narrower than that of <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> and that during a bite, the distribution of stress in the skull would have been very different, closer to that of Alioramus, another Asian tyrannosaur. A related cladistic analysis found that Alioramus, not Tyrannosaurus, was the sister taxon of Tarbosaurus, which, if true, would suggest that Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus should remain separate. The discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus would later disprove this and revealed that Alioramus belonged to the clade Alioramini. The discovery of the tyrannosaurid Lythronax further indicates that Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus are closely related, forming a clade with fellow Asian tyrannosaurid Zhuchengtyrannus, with Lythronax being their sister taxon. A further study from 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al., also indicates Tyrannosaurus may have been an immigrant from Asia, as well as a possible descendent of Tarbosaurus. The study further indicates the possibility that Tyrannosaurus may have driven other tyrannosaurids that were native to North America extinct through competition. Other finds in 2006 indicate giant tyrannosaurs may have been present in North America as early as 75 million years ago. Whether or not this specimen belongs to <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex,</b> a new species of Tyrannosaurus, or a new genus entirely is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat unusually among theropods, T.rex had a {{very long}} cochlea. The length of the cochlea is often related to hearing acuity, {{or at least the}} {{importance}} of hearing in behavior, implying that hearing was a particularly important sense to tyrannosaurs. Specifically, data suggests that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> heard best in the low-frequency range, and that low-frequency sounds were an important part of tyrannosaur behavior.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{progressively}} shorter titles, <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>Rex's</b> albums {{began to}} show higher production values, more accessible songwriting from Bolan, and experimentation with electric guitars and a true rock sound. A breakthrough had been [...] "King of the Rumbling Spires" [...] (recorded with Took and released in summer 1969 shortly prior to his departure), which used a full rock band setup, and the electric sound had been further explored on A Beard of Stars. The group's next album, T. Rex, continued the process of simplification by shortening the name, and completed the move to electric guitars. Visconti supposedly got fed up with writing the name out in full on studio charts and tapes and began to abbreviate it; when Bolan first noticed he was angry but later claimed the idea was his. The new sound was more pop-oriented, and the first single, [...] "Ride a White Swan" [...] released in October 1970 made the Top 10 in the UK by late November and reached number two in January 1971. In early 1971, T. Rex reached the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart.|$|R

5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may {{have been at the}} top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex,</b> growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E

5|$|Gigantic and {{visually}} impressive, the Megalosaurus {{became one of}} the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal; palaeontologists now believe it to have been bipedal (standing like <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex).</b> The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.|$|E
5|$|Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has {{suggested}} that Tyrannosaurus may have been pack animals. Currie compared <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> favorably to related species Tarbosaurus bataar and Albertosaurus sarcophagus, fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used {{to suggest that they}} lived in packs. Currie pointed out that a find in South Dakota preserved three <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> skeletons in close proximity to each other. After using CT scanning, Currie stated that Tyrannosaurus would have been capable of such complex behavior, because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size. Currie elaborated that Tyrannosaurus had a larger brain-to-body-size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops of the same size. Currie believed Tyrannosaurus to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for Tyrannosaurus to hunt in groups. Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together, with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill, by analogy to modern-day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill.|$|E

It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of phylogenetic {{taxonomy}} in vertebrate paleontology, Tyrannosauridae has been given several explicit definitions. The original was produced by Paul Sereno in 1998, and included all tyrannosauroids closer to Tyrannosaurus than to either Alectrosaurus, Aublysodon or Nanotyrannus. However, Nanotyrannus is often {{considered to be a}} juvenile <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex,</b> while Aublysodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium unsuitable for use in the definition of a clade. Definitions since then have been based on more well-established genera.|$|E
5|$|Alioramus were bipedal {{like all}} known theropods, and their sharp teeth {{indicate}} that they were carnivores. Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex,</b> but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur. The genus Alioramus {{is characterized by a}} row of five bony crests {{along the top of the}} snout, a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull than other tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it {{does not necessarily mean that}} it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> <b>rex</b> had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E
