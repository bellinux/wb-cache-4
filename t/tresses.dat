5|$|Gamma Comae Berenices (15 Comae Berenices) is an orange-hued giant {{star with}} a {{magnitude}} of 4.4 and a spectral class of K1III C. In the southwestern {{part of the}} constellation, it is 170 ± 7 light-years from Earth, Estimated to be around 1.79 times as massive as the Sun, it has expanded to around 10 times its radius. It is {{the brightest star in}} the Coma Star Cluster. With Alpha Comae Berenices and Beta Comae Berenices, Gamma Comae Berenices forms a 45-degree isosceles triangle from which Berenice's imaginary <b>tresses</b> hang.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand.

Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's <b>tresses</b> and yellow bird's nest.|$|E

5|$|The Coma Star Cluster {{represents}} Berenice's sacrificed <b>tresses</b> {{and as a}} {{naked eye}} object has been known since antiquity, appearing in Ptolemy's Almagest. It doesn't have a Messier or NGC designation, but is in the Melotte catalogue of open clusters (designated Melotte 111) and is also catalogued as Collinder 256. It is a large, diffuse open cluster of about 50 stars ranging between magnitudes five and ten, including several of Coma Berenices' stars which are {{visible to the naked}} eye. The cluster is spread over a huge region (more than five degrees across) near Gamma Comae Berenices. It has such a large apparent size because it is relatively close, only 288 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Three of the constellation's {{stars are}} {{visible to the}} naked eye: Alpha Comae Berenices, Beta Comae Berenices and Gamma Comae Berenices. They form a 45-degree triangle, from which Berenice's {{imaginary}} <b>tresses,</b> formed by the Coma Star Cluster, hang. The constellation's brightest star is Beta Comae Berenices, a 4.2-magnitude main sequence star similar to the Sun. Coma Berenices contains the North Galactic Pole and one of the richest known galaxy clusters, the Coma Cluster, part of the Coma Supercluster. Galaxy Malin 1, in the constellation, is the first known giant low-surface-brightness galaxy. Supernova SN 2005ap discovered in Coma Berenices is the brightest known, and SN 1940B was the first observed example of a type II supernova. The star FK Comae Berenices is the prototype of an eponymous class of variable stars. The constellation is the radiant of one meteor shower, Coma Berenicids, which has one of the fastest meteor speeds, up to 65km/s (40 mps).|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{clothing}} {{was used by}} people during this age, including those made of cotton and silk. People living in hilly and deserted areas wore dresses made of foliage and flowers. Sheaths of grassy weeds (Korai) were used for making dress by the hill and forest area people. Skins of animals and barks of trees were also used. Men of the poorer classes wore only one piece of cloth around the waist. Women covered their upper body {{with a kind of}} dress called, kachchu. Among the higher classes, men wore two pieces: one around the waist and the other, the upper cloth, thrown over the shoulders. Women of sophisticated society wore half sarees, made of the finest cotton and silk fabrics, with embroidery. Both men and women sported long <b>tresses</b> of hair. The diet was plain, rice being the staple cereal, with millet, milk, butter and honey being in common use. Meat eating was common - people ate flesh of rams, deer, hare, fowl, porcupines, pigs and boar, fresh and dried fish. The kind of housing was determined by the type of geography of the land and the economic status of the occupants. The rich built their houses with tiled roofs and walls made of burnt bricks and mud, while the poor built their huts with mud and thatched it with grass, coconut leaves or palmyra palm leaves. Both in the huts and houses, the flooring was smeared with cowdung. The affluent had houses with porticoes, many storeys, open terraces and furnished their houses well. The inner walls of their houses were decorated with flowers and paintings, with cottages to protect them from the wind. Cots were in common use – the rich had luxurious beds decked with swan’s feathers and flowers, while the common people had beds woven with the straw of maize and the poorest people used beds made of grass or hay.|$|E

500|$|Coma Berenices {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an asterism since the Hellenistic period (or much earlier, according to some authors), {{and is the only}} modern constellation named for an historic figure. It was introduced to Western astronomy during the third century BC by Conon of Samos, the court astronomer of Egyptian ruler Ptolemy III Euergetes, to honour Ptolemy's consort, BereniceII. Berenice vowed to sacrifice her long hair as a votive offering if Ptolemy returned safely from battle during the Third Syrian War. Modern scholars are uncertain if Berenice made the sacrifice before or after Ptolemy's return; it was suggested that it happened after Ptolemy's return (around March–June or May 245 BC), when Conon presented the asterism jointly with scholar and poet Callimachus during a public evening ceremony. In Callimachus' poem, Aetia (composed around that time), Berenice dedicated her <b>tresses</b> [...] "to all the gods". In the Latin translation of the poem by the Roman poet Catullus and in Hyginus' De astronomica, she dedicated her <b>tresses</b> to Aphrodite and placed them in the temple of Arsinoe II (identified after Berenice's death with Aphrodite) at Zephyrium. According to De astronomica, by the next morning the <b>tresses</b> had disappeared. Conon proposed that Aphrodite had placed the <b>tresses</b> in the sky as an acknowledgement of Berenice's sacrifice. Callimachus called the asterism plokamos Berenikēs or bostrukhon Berenikēs in Greek, translated into Latin as [...] "Coma Berenices" [...] by Catullus. Eratosthenes (3rd century BC) called it [...] "Berenice's Hair" [...] and [...] "Ariadne's Hair", considering it part of the constellation Leo. The astronomer Geminus (1st century BC) recognized it as a distinct constellation. Astronomer Ptolemy (2nd century AD) considered it part of Leo, and called it Plokamos.|$|E

500|$|The castle {{began to}} deteriorate, and the {{antiquarian}} John Britton noted {{during his visit}} in 1813 {{that it had been}} [...] "abandoned to neglect, and rapidly advancing to ruin: the glass is destroyed, the ceilings and floors are falling, and the rains streams through the opening roof on the damp and mouldering walls". The smithy {{in the basement of the}} south tower resulted in a fire in 1830, which caused considerable damage to the castle, gutting the south tower. Extensive decay in the bases of the cruck <b>tresses</b> in the castle's roof posed a particular threat to the hall, as the decaying roof began to push the walls apart.|$|E

[...] Above these curly <b>tresses</b> and behind the head is a tiered coronet of jewels, the curved edge of which rises to form a halo. From the waist down, the image is dressed in {{what seems to be}} the most delicate of material; except for the pattern of embroidery traced over it, it is difficult to tell where the drapery begins and where it ends.|$|E
500|$|The {{relief is}} a {{terracotta}} (fired clay) plaque, [...] large, [...] thick, {{with the head}} of the figure projecting [...] from the surface. To manufacture the relief, clay with small calcareous inclusions was mixed with chaff; visible folds and fissures suggest the material was quite stiff when being worked. The British Museum's Department of Scientific Research reports, [...] "it would seem likely that the whole plaque was moulded" [...] with subsequent modelling of some details and addition of others, such as the rod-and-ring symbols, the <b>tresses</b> of hair and the eyes of the owls. The relief was then burnished and polished, and further details were incised with a pointed tool. Firing burned out the chaff, leaving characteristic voids and the pitted surface we see now; Curtis and Collon believe the surface would have appeared smoothed by ochre paint in antiquity.|$|E
