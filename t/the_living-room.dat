5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of <b>the</b> <b>living-room,</b> pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on <b>the</b> <b>living-room</b> window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until early}} 2010, the keeper's cottage had been off-limits to visitors. Two of the ground-floor rooms {{have now been}} opened: <b>the</b> <b>living-room</b> is {{furnished}} in a 1930s/40s style, while the old kitchen area currently holds a couple of display cases, {{with a view to}} showing hitherto unseen artefacts from the museum's collection of smaller items. The upper floors remain closed to visitors.|$|E

50|$|The {{land was}} {{acquired}} by Jesse P. Norfleet on January 3, 1845. The cottage, designed in the Greek Revival architectural style, was built later that year. The rafters were made of pine tree wood while the bricks were handcrafted.

500|$|Johnson {{demonstrated}} {{signs of}} great intelligence as a child, and his parents, to his later disgust, took pleasure in showing off his [...] "newly acquired accomplishments". His education {{began at the}} age of three, when his mother had him memorise and recite passages from the Book of Common Prayer. When Johnson turned four, he was sent to a nearby [...] "school" [...] on Dam Street, where [...] "Dame" [...] Anne Oliver, the proprietor, gave lessons to young children in <b>the</b> <b>living-room</b> of a cottage. Johnson especially enjoyed his time with Dame Oliver, later remembering her fondly. At the age of six he was sent to a retired shoemaker to continue his education, and a year later was enrolled at Lichfield Grammar School; he excelled in Latin under Humphrey Hawkins, his teacher in the lower school.|$|E

60|$|Then {{late one}} night a man came gasping up the veranda stairway, and Appleby and Maccario descended half‐dressed to meet him in <b>the</b> big <b>living‐room.</b> <b>The</b> dust was white upon him, and he blinked at them out of half‐closed eyes, while Appleby noticed that he limped a little. Maccario pointed to a chair, and poured him out a glass of wine.|$|R

500|$|Kurt M. Koenigsberger {{analyzed}} a {{scene from}} the episode in his piece [...] "Commodity Culture and Its Discontents", published in the compilation work [...] edited by John Alberti. He commented that The Simpsons literary and cultural awareness extends to the [...] "conventions of its own medium" [...] in this episode. Bart criticizes an Itchy & Scratchy episode because Itchy stakes down Scratchy's appendages and props his belly to form a tent with faulty knots. With Homer looking on from the couch, Lisa reminds Bart that cartoons do not simply reproduce reality, a point hammered on as a second Homer meanders past <b>the</b> <b>living-room</b> window. Koenigsberger said that [...] "this moment and many others like it reveal a strong sense of self-awareness within the show, an awareness especially characteristic of high modernism." ...|$|E

Upon his return, his wife Judy, seeing his inebriated state, laid him on <b>the</b> <b>living-room</b> floor and questioned his friends as to what had happened. Judy then moved Buckley into bed. [...] Checking on him later, she found he had turned blue and was no longer breathing. Attempts by friends and paramedics to revive him were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead on arrival.|$|E
2500|$|Voddler's first {{media player}} client {{required}} a separate download and its graphical 10-foot user interface was primarily designed for <b>the</b> <b>living-room</b> TV with a remote control, {{instead of a}} desktop computer interface. [...] In March 2010, Voddler updated the interface to allow for mouse and keyboard control, both for selecting movies and for playing them in the Voddler media player. [...] This first mediaplayer {{was based on the}} GNU Public Licensed (GPL) source code of XBMC Media Center, a free and open source software, that Voddler used as its application framework for the media player. After a controversy in 2010 surrounding the source code for Voddler's video player (see below under [...] "GPL controversy"), Voddler changed the framework for its player and has based it since then on Adobe Flash and Adobe Air, both of which are not open source code. [...] At about the same time, Voddler also stopped demanding a separate download of the media player and instead started using a player that was embedded directly into the browser page. This new player, just like the old one, takes it stream from Voddler's streaming cloud Vnet.|$|E

On the ground floor were the shop, the private office, and <b>the</b> <b>living-rooms.</b> <b>The</b> old doctor and Jaqui lodged on the third floor. The second floor was very handsomely furnished, but was not then occupied--at least, not in the ordinary way. It belonged to Dr. Paltravi, the old doctor's former partner; a somewhat younger man, and married. He had been greatly attached to his wife, and had furnished these rooms to suit her fancy. He was a scientific man, and much more devoted to making curious experiments than he was to the ordinary practice of medicine and surgery. In a small room on this floor, at the very back of the house, was Donna Paltravi, in a box." ...|$|R

60|$|Madeline was charmed {{with the}} old Spanish house, and the more she saw of it the more she thought what a {{delightful}} home it could be made. All the doors opened into a courtyard, or patio, as Florence called it. The house was low, {{in the shape of}} a rectangle, and so immense in size that Madeline wondered if it had been a Spanish barracks. Many of the rooms were dark, without windows, and they were empty. Others were full of ranchers' implements and sacks of grain and bales of hay. Florence called these last alfalfa. The house itself appeared strong and well preserved, and it was very picturesque. But in <b>the</b> <b>living-rooms</b> were only <b>the</b> barest necessities, and these were worn out and comfortless.|$|R

60|$|While Hare lay there, {{trying to}} gather his {{shattered}} senses, the merry sound of voices {{and the music}} of an accordion hummed from <b>the</b> big <b>living-room</b> next to his. Presently heavy boots thumped {{on the floor of}} the hall; then a hand rapped on his door.|$|R
