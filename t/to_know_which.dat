5|$|On {{the upright}} collar of full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It was not possible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore two rows of nine buttons in groups of three {{down the front of}} the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore two rows of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the uniform of a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these problems, the wide fan-shaped signal presented serious problems when more than one aircraft entered the beam.

Even the most experienced crews were unable to satisfactorily track a target in these conditions.|$|E

25|$|Okurigana {{are also}} used as phonetic {{complements}} to disambiguate kanji that have multiple readings, and consequently multiple meanings.

Both individual kanji and multi-kanji words may have multiple readings, and okurigana are used in both cases.|$|E

25|$|The DM also {{includes}} the ability to save partially complete DSN's, with code and logic to ask the user for any missing information at runtime. For instance, a DSN can be created without a required password. When an ODBC application attempts to connect to the DBMS using this DSN, the system will pause and ask the user to provide the password before continuing. This frees the application developer from having to create this sort of code, as well as having <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> questions to ask. All of this {{is included in the}} driver and the DSNs.|$|E
25|$|GIS {{offers a}} {{superior}} method for landslide analysis {{because it allows}} one to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, and display large amounts of data quickly and effectively. Because so many variables are involved, {{it is important to}} be able to overlay the many layers of data to develop a full and accurate portrayal of what is taking place on the Earth's surface. Researchers need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> variables are the most important factors that trigger landslides in any given location. Using GIS, extremely detailed maps can be generated to show past events and likely future events which have the potential to save lives, property, and money.|$|E
25|$|The bearing {{measurement}} {{was received}} {{on a separate}} receiver and antenna system. In this case, two half-wave dipoles were used, located about one wavelength apart horizontally on the antenna framework. Both antennas were connected together electrically before entering the receivers, with the outputs {{of one of them}} inverted. This meant that the output signal would drop to zero when the antennas were precisely aligned with the target. Any mis-alignment changed the relative phase of the signals slightly, producing a net signal that entered the receiver and produced a display. However, it was not possible <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> of the two antennas was the one producing the net output; the system provided an indication of when the antenna was on-target, but not which side to turn to when it was off-target.|$|E

Among those quoting Dylan were US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, both conservatives. The most widely cited lines included [...] "you don't need a weatherman <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> way the wind blows" [...] from [...] "Subterranean Homesick Blues" [...] and [...] "when you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose" [...] from [...] "Like a Rolling Stone".|$|E
500|$|Until the {{connection}} to the Queens Boulevard Line opened, this station shared the characteristic of a two side platformed terminal station with Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line. This is an inefficient terminal setup, requiring passengers <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> track the next train will depart from {{before going to the}} platform level. As a terminal from 1989 to 2001, the station had tail tracks that continued eastward as far as 29th Street, ending at bumper blocks. Also, this station has [...] "punch boxes", with buttons to indicate route selection to the train dispatcher; a control tower on the west end of Manhattan-bound platform, which can be used if necessary; and a diamond crossover switch to the west which was used to turn trains.|$|E

My only official recommendations are US Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton's Salt, and the C.R. Lawrence fine two inch style oscillating knife blade." [...] That line was written by Schur, and the scene used in the episode was Nick Offerman's first take, with no mistakes made with the complicated dialogue. Immediately after [...] "The Fight" [...] first aired, a [...] "Producer's Cut" [...] version was made available on the official NBC.com website. It included an additional four minutes of material, that include a previously-unaired cold open in which Ron sternly demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> employee has broken the parks department's coffee machine; this prompts a fight as the staff make accusations against each other. Ron secretly reveals to the camera that he broke the machine himself, but questioned the other employees anyway to deliberately start the arguments.|$|E
500|$|The South Korean {{report said}} that five former Air Force pilots told U.S. interrogators {{that they were}} {{directed}} to strafe civilians during this period, and 17 veterans of the 7th Cavalry testified that they believed there were orders to shoot the No Gun Ri refugees. The Koreans noted {{that two of the}} veterans were battalion communications specialists (Levine and Crume) and, as such, were in an especially good position <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> orders had been relayed. Citing the Eighth Army order of July 26 to stop refugees, the Korean report concluded that the 7th Cavalry was [...] "likely to have used all possible means to stop the approaching refugees." [...] Said South Korea's national security director, Oh Young-ho, [...] "We believe there was an order to fire." [...] A joint U.S.-Korean [...] "Statement of Mutual Understandings" [...] issued with the reports did not repeat the U.S. report's flat assertion that no orders to shoot were issued at No Gun Ri.|$|E
500|$|Relations {{between the}} Assembly and Parliament were already deteriorating in 1644, when Parliament ignored the Assembly's request that [...] "grossly ignorant and {{notoriously}} profane" [...] individuals {{be barred from}} communion. While members of Parliament agreed that the sacrament should be kept pure, many of them disagreed with the presbyterian majority in the Assembly over who had the final power of excommunication, taking the Erastian view {{that it was the}} state. Also, by 1646, Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had won the war on behalf of Parliament. Cromwell, along with a majority of the army, was strongly in favour of religious toleration for all sorts of Christians even if the national church was to be presbyterian. His rise to power {{as a result of his}} military victories made the idea of a strictly presbyterian settlement without freedom of worship for others very unlikely. Parliament at least wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>which</b> sins in particular were grave enough to trigger excommunication by the church; the Assembly was reticent to provide such information, as the majority considered the power of the church in this area to be absolute.|$|E
