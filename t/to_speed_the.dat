5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer {{reported}} that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut {{down one of the}} trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also {{reported that}} around 1895, cuts had been made to tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>the</b> process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E
5|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>the</b> {{dismantling}} of the third-class forts, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) that the guns and ammunition removed from the dismantled forts {{should be kept in}} storage. Fort Corcoran was chosen as one of the storage locations and thus avoided the immediate demise of the other third-class fortifications. By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Corcoran stored the cannon of the dismantled forts located south of the Potomac River.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite risings, a movement to restore Stuart King James II of England to the throne, the British government enacted a series of laws that attempted <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>the</b> process of the destruction of the clan system. Measures included a ban on the bearing of arms, the wearing of tartan and limitations on the activities of the Episcopalian Church. Most of the legislation was repealed {{by the end of the}} eighteenth century as the Jacobite threat subsided.|$|E

The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>the</b> Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E

5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>the</b> {{handling}} of heavy loads. One winch was operated {{at each of}} the ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E
5|$|There was {{friction}} between the new owners and the Commissioners of Sewers. The railway company proposed {{the creation of a}} railway between Highbridge and Glastonbury in 1850, and the Somerset Central Railway was authorised by Parliament on 17 June 1852. The canal was transferred to the new company, and was used <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>the</b> construction of the railway, earning £312 in the year ending September 1853. The line followed the route of the canal closely, with much of it built on the towpath. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854.|$|E

5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up <b>to</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>The</b> drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E
5|$|In most Scottish burghs, in {{contrast}} to English towns where churches and parishes tended to proliferate, there was usually only one parish church, As the doctrine of Purgatory gained importance in the period, the number of chapelries, priests and masses for the dead within them, designed <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>the</b> passage of souls to Heaven, grew rapidly. The number of altars dedicated to saints, who could intercede in this process, also grew dramatically, with St. Mary's in Dundee having perhaps 48 and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50. The number of saints celebrated in Scotland also proliferated, with about 90 being added to the missal used in St Nicholas church in Aberdeen. New cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century, including the Five Wounds, the Holy Blood and the Holy Name of Jesus. There were also new religious feasts, including celebrations of the Presentation, the Visitation and Mary of the Snows.|$|E
5|$|Operation Fustian was an {{airborne}} forces operation undertaken during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 in the Second World War. The operation {{was carried out}} by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury's 1st Parachute Brigade, part of the British 1st Airborne Division. Their objective was the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto River. The intention was for the brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land {{on both sides of the}} river. They would then capture the bridge and secure the surrounding area until relieved by the advance of British XIII Corps, which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously. Because the bridge was the only crossing on the river and would give the British Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, its capture was expected <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>the</b> advance and lead to the defeat of the Axis forces in Sicily.|$|E

5|$|Wien Air Alaska, {{which had}} its {{headquarters}} in Fairbanks, was the state's largest private employer until it declared bankruptcy in 1983. The resulting shutdown cost hundreds of jobs in Fairbanks. This was a foretaste of more problems to come. In 1986, Saudi Arabia boosted oil production and oil prices plummeted. Alaska banks failed, construction came to a halt, and bankruptcies and foreclosures were common. A common practice in Fairbanks was for workers to drop their house keys off at local banks before catching a flight out of Alaska, the better <b>to</b> <b>speed</b> <b>the</b> foreclosure process. Although an expansion of Fort Wainwright helped the construction industry during this time, Fairbanks lost about 3,000 jobs between 1986 and 1989. The U.S. Army's 6th Infantry Division was stationed at Fort Wainwright in late 1987, but it {{was reduced to a}} single brigade and renamed in 1993.|$|E
