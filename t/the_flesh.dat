5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red.

5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.holopus. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a pinkish color, but has no reaction with <b>the</b> <b>flesh.</b> A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) has no reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction or a brownish reaction with <b>the</b> <b>flesh.</b> Application of iron (II) sulphate solution does not have a reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction to slightly olive coloration on <b>the</b> <b>flesh.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps.

5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on <b>the</b> <b>flesh,</b> and brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey color with both <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> and the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E

The first step was focused on <b>the</b> preparation of <b>fleshing</b> powder. <b>The</b> second step was <b>the</b> application of <b>fleshing</b> powder as protein substitute of broiler feed. The results showed that <b>the</b> quality of <b>fleshing</b> powder prepared by pressurize steaming at 2 atm for 15 min was better than by unpressurized method.

5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. <b>The</b> <b>flesh</b> in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. <b>The</b> <b>flesh</b> in the gills is basically the same as <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. <b>The</b> <b>flesh</b> of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem).

5|$|Fruit {{bodies are}} {{commonly}} parasitized by the ascomycete Hypomyces lactifluorum, transforming {{them into an}} edible known as a lobster mushroom.

5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} stipes, often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. <b>The</b> <b>flesh</b> has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones in <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> reflect differences in growth {{during periods of}} low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth.

Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, or dark brown in age.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety.

They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. <b>The</b> <b>flesh</b> is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms.
