Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees would be up onstage prior to the announcement of the award. In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience. In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while look <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of plexiglass on the stage floor. Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage or random film clips during several commercial breaks. A gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes spiraling upward was placed at center stage.|$|E
5|$|Once Chrono Trigger was completed, {{the team}} resumed discussions for Final Fantasy VII in 1995. The team {{reviewed}} {{the option of}} continuing the 2D strategy, {{which would have been}} the safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry shift <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of 3D gaming, and the radical new development models that these 3D consoles would require. The team decided to take the riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware, but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 or the CD-ROM based PlayStation from Sony Computer Entertainment. The team also considered Sega's new Saturn console and the Microsoft Windows personal computer (PC). Their decision was influenced by two things: a tech demo based on Final Fantasy VI created using the new Softimage 3D software that impressed both staff and external developers, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, which was limiting Square's audience. Tests were made for a Nintendo 64 version of the game, which would use the planned 64DD peripheral, {{even in the face of}} a lack of 64DD development kits and the prototype device's changing hardware specifications. This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster put too much of a strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame rate. It was later estimated that it would have required thirty 64DD discs to run Final Fantasy VII properly with the data compression methods of the day. Faced with both technical and economic issues on Nintendo's current hardware, and favorably impressed by the increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of Final Fantasy VII in addition to all other planned game projects, onto Sony's PlayStation.|$|E

50|$|Once inputs are {{explored}} for {{impact and}} application, participants create {{a science fiction}} story (Science Fiction Prototyping) based ten years in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> to add context around human activity. Science Fiction Prototyping consists of a future story about {{a person in a}} place doing a thing. The threatcasting process results in creation of many potential futures scenarios - some futures are desirable while others are not. Identifying both types of futures (desirable and undesirable) will help the participant recognize which future to aim toward, and which to avoid. Utilizing the scenarios, participants plot actions necessary in the present and at various intervals working <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ten year <b>future</b> scenario.

Carl was already sending demos to New York record companies, who kept rejecting him, sometimes explaining that this strange new style of country with a pronounced rhythm fit no current commercial trend. That would change in 1955 after recording the song 'Blue Suede Shoes' (recorded 19 December 1955). Later made more famous by Elvis Presley, Perkins' original version was an early rock 'n' roll standard.|$|E

2500|$|Being-toward-death {{is not an}} {{orientation}} that brings Dasein closer to its end, in terms of clinical death, but is rather a way of being. Being-toward-death refers to a process of growing through the world where a certain foresight guides the Dasein towards gaining an authentic perspective. It is provided by dread or death. In the analysis of time, it is revealed as a threefold condition of Being. Time, {{the present and the}} notion of the [...] "eternal", are modes of temporality. Temporality is the way we see time. For Heidegger, it {{is very different from the}} mistaken view of time as being a linear series of past, present and future. Instead he sees it as being an ecstasy, an outside-of-itself, of futural projections (possibilities) and one's place in history as a part of one's generation. Possibilities, then, are integral to our understanding of time; our projects, or thrown projection in-the-world, are what absorb and direct us. Futurity, as a direction <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> that always contains the past—the has-been—is a primary mode of Daseins temporality.|$|E

2500|$|Kovel {{focuses on}} working-class {{involvement}} {{in the formation of}} eco-socialist parties or their increased involvement in existing Green Parties; however, he believes that, unlike many other forms of socialist analysis, [...] "there is no privileged agent" [...] or revolutionary class, and that there is potential for agency in numerous autonomous, grassroots individuals and groups who can build [...] "prefigurative" [...] projects for non-violent radical social change. He defines [...] "prefiguration" [...] as [...] "the potential for the given to contain the lineaments of what is to be", meaning that [...] "a moment <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> exists embedded in every point of the social organism where a need arises". If [...] "everything has prefigurative potential", Kovel notes that forms of potential ecological production will be [...] "scattered", and thus suggests that [...] "the task is to free them and connect them". While all [...] "human ecosystems" [...] have [...] "ecosocialist potential", Kovel points out that ones such as the World Bank have low potential, whereas internally democratic anti-globalization [...] "affinity groups" [...] have a high potential through a dialectic that involves the [...] "active bringing and holding together of negations", such as the group acting as an alternative institution ("production of an ecological/socialist alternative") and trying to shut down a G8 summit meeting ("resistance to capital").

6000|$|Some months before, {{this letter}} from Hans would have divided Deronda's {{thoughts}} irritatingly: its romancing, about Mirah {{would have had}} an unpleasant edge, scarcely anointed with any commiseration for his friend's probable disappointment. But things had altered since March. Mirah was no longer so critically placed {{with regard to the}} Meyricks, and Deronda's own position had been undergoing a change which had just been crowned by the revelation of his birth. The new opening <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> though he would not trust in any definite visions, inevitably shed new lights, and influenced his mood toward past and present; hence, what Hans called his hope now seemed to Deronda, not a mischievous unreasonableness which roused his indignation, but an unusually persistent bird-dance of an extravagant fancy, and he would have felt quite able to pity any consequent suffering of his friend's, if he had believed in the suffering as probable. But some of the busy thought filling that long day, which passed without his receiving any new summons from his mother, was given to the argument that Hans Meyrick's nature was not one in which love could strike the deep roots that turn disappointment into sorrow: it was too restless, too readily excitable by novelty, too ready to turn itself into imaginative material, and wear its grief as a fantastic costume. [...] "Already he is beginning to play at love: he is taking the whole affair as a comedy," [...] said Deronda to himself; [...] "he knows very well that there is no chance for him. Just like him--never opening his eyes on any possible objection I could have to receive his outpourings about Mirah. Poor old Hans! If we were under a fiery hail together he would howl like a Greek, and if I did not howl too it would never occur to him that I was as badly off as he. And yet he is tender-hearted and affectionate in intention, and I can't say that he is not active in imagining what goes on in other people--but then he always imagines it to fit his own inclination." ...|$|E
