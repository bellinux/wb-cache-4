50|$|In a piston engine, it is {{the ratio}} between {{the volume of the}} {{cylinder}} and combustion chamber when the piston is at the bottom <b>of</b> its <b>stroke,</b> and the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{compression}} ratio affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine. It is the ratio between {{the volume of}} the cylinder, when the piston is at the bottom <b>of</b> its <b>stroke,</b> and the volume when the piston is at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber formed with the sleeve at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke</b> {{is ideal for}} complete, detonation-free, combustion of the charge, as {{it does not have}} to contend with compromised chamber shape and hot exhaust (poppet) valves.|$|R

50|$|The {{temperature}} at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke</b> depends on many factors, particularly the compression {{ratio of the}} cylinder and the starting temperature of the inducted air. When the engine is cold, {{the temperature of the}} inducted air is low and it receives little heat from the engine cylinder walls. In addition, as the air is compressed and becomes heated, some of this heat is lost to the cold cylinder walls, further reducing the {{temperature at}} the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke.</b> The glow plug solves this.|$|R
2500|$|Laverda three-cylinder engines up to 1982 [...] {{featured}} a 180-degree crankshaft arrangement, {{in which the}} center piston is at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke</b> when the [...] two outer pistons are at the bottom. This purposefully out-of-phase design gave the 1,000cc Laverdas a distinctive character. [...] The engine evolved into a smoother, rubber mounted 120degree configuration in 1982.|$|R

5000|$|The {{single-acting}} uniflow {{steam engine}} configuration closely {{resembles that of}} a two-stroke internal combustion engine, {{and it is possible}} to convert a two-stroke engine to a uniflow steam engine by feeding the cylinder with steam via a [...] "bash valve" [...] fitted in place of the spark plug. As the rising piston nears the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke,</b> it knocks open the bash valve to admit a pulse of steam. The valve closes automatically as the piston descends, and the steam is exhausted through the existing cylinder porting. The inertia of the flywheel then carries the piston back to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke</b> against the compression, as it does in the original form of the engine. Also like the original, the conversion is not self-starting and must be turned over by an external power source to start. An example of such a conversion is the steam-powered moped, which is started by pedalling.|$|R
50|$|For example, a {{cylinder}} and its combustion chamber with the piston {{at the bottom}} <b>of</b> its <b>stroke</b> may contain 1000 cc of air (900 cc in the cylinder plus 100 cc in the combustion chamber). When the piston has moved up to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke</b> inside the cylinder, and the remaining volume inside the head or combustion chamber {{has been reduced to}} 100 cc, then the compression ratio would be proportionally described as 1000:100, or with fractional reduction, a 10:1 compression ratio.|$|R
5000|$|To start a cycle, the CNC {{controller}} {{commands the}} drives {{to move the}} table along the X and the Y axis to a desired position. Once in position, the control initiates the punching sequence and pushes the ram from top dead center (TDC) to bottom dead center (BDC) through the material plane. (The terms BDC and TDC go back to older presses with pneumatic or hydraulic clutches. On today's machines BDC/TDC do not actually exist but are still used for the bottom and <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a <b>stroke.)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|When activated, the Jacobs Engine Brake {{opens the}} exhaust valves near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the {{compression}} <b>stroke,</b> releasing the highly compressed air through the exhaust system. Little energy {{is returned to}} the piston, and as the cycle repeats, {{the energy of the}} trucks forward motion is dissipated, causing the truck to slow down.|$|R
50|$|Conventionally, a {{four-stroke}} (petrol or gasoline) Otto {{cycle engine}} {{is fueled by}} drawing a mixture of air and fuel into the combustion chamber during the intake stroke. This produces a homogeneous charge: a homogeneous mixture of air and fuel, which is ignited by a spark plug at a predetermined moment near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There is {{individual}} and stylistic variation {{in many of}} the letters. For example, the <b>top</b> circle <b>of</b> ზ (zeni) and the <b>top</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> რ (rae) may go in the other direction than shown in the chart (that is, counter-clockwise starting at 3 o'clock, and upwards - see the external-link section for videos of people writing). Other common variants: ...|$|R
50|$|The 16 Valve engine {{features}} individual 'coil over plug' ignition where {{the timing of}} the ignition is controlled directly by the Bosch engine management system, with each coil firing two spark plugs simultaneously. On the earlier CF1 and CF2 16 valve engines each coil fired the plug below it and (via a short plug lead) a plug in the other cylinder that was 360° crankshaft rotation out of phase (i.e. one coil would fire a spark plug in the cylinder nearing the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke,</b> and also the a spark plug in the cylinder nearing the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the exhaust <b>stroke</b> (in a 4-cylinder 4-stroke engine with a 180° crank pistons 1 & 4 and pistons 2 & 3 rise and fall as pairs). So in this configuration each coil services two spark plugs and each cylinder is serviced by two coils. In case of a coil failure one of two plugs would still work.|$|R
5000|$|The piston is {{momentarily}} at rest at TDC. During this instant, {{which is}} known as the ignition phase, the air/fuel mixture remains in a small volume at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke.</b> Heat is added to the working fluid by the combustion of the injected fuel, with the volume essentially being held constant. The pressure rises and the ratio [...] is called the [...] "explosion ratio".|$|R
50|$|The two cams rotate {{and raise}} the piston with a scissor-like action to the bearings. Once at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> the air-fuel mixture is fired. This is the power stroke during which the maximum {{mechanical}} advantage is reached after the piston has moved approximately 5% of its travel from top dead centre (approx. 10° ATDC), which makes better use of the high cylinder pressures {{at this point in}} the cycle. In comparison, a conventional engine reaches its maximum mechanical advantage after the piston has moved approximately 40% of its travel from TDC (approx. 60° ATDC). A side effect of this is a CCE can idle at much lower RPM.|$|R
5000|$|A {{compression}} release brake (also {{known as a}} Jacobs brake or [...] "jake brake"), {{is the type of}} brake most commonly confused with real engine braking; it is used mainly in large diesel trucks and works by opening the exhaust valves at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke,</b> so the large amount of energy stored in that compressed air is not returned to the crankshaft, but is released into the atmosphere.|$|R
5000|$|Named for the {{movement}} of the transfer mechanism, tri-axis transfer mechanisms motion is defined by the three (3) axes of movement made by the part manipulators each press stroke. On the press downstroke the automation which will likely be holding the work piece will lower the work piece to the tool and retract to leave the part on the tool. At the bottom <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> the automation mechanism in the retracted state will cycle backward one pitch to position itself adjacent to the next workpiece. As the press cycles upward the part manipulators will index inward to pick up the next work piece, continuing upward following the press ram, then indexing forward to next station. As the press reaches the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke,</b> the process repeats. The three axes of motion are up-down, in-out, and forward-back.|$|R

On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the multiplayer <b>Stroke</b> Play, Match Play and Balloon Pop games {{that came with the}} first game, two new multiplayer games were added to the party mode. The game has largely remained the same beyond these changes, the addition of new courses, and various cosmetic tweaks.|$|R
5000|$|The Motronic {{units have}} 2 {{injection}} outputs, and the injectors {{are arranged in}} 2 [...] "banks" [...] which fire once every two engine revolutions. In an example 4-cylinder engine, one output controls the injectors for cylinders 1 and 3, and the other controls 2 and 4. The system uses a [...] "cylinder ID" [...] sensor mounted to the cam-shaft to detect which cylinders are approaching the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> their <b>stroke,</b> therefore which injector bank should be fired. During start-up (below 600 RPM), or {{if there is no}} signal from the cylinder ID sensor, all injectors are fired simultaneously once per engine revolution. In BMW vehicles, this Motronic version did not have a cylinder ID and as a result, both banks of injectors fired at once.|$|R
50|$|Contrast a petrol engine, {{where the}} {{mechanics}} are different {{and a special}} valve is not necessary for engine braking to occur when the driver releases the accelerator. In a gasoline engine, when the accelerator is released, the throttle prevents {{the free flow of}} air into the cylinders, so there is little pressure to release at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke.</b> The closed throttle provides engine braking by forcing the engine to generate a vacuum between the throttle and the cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|No 5 {{was once}} {{referred}} to as 'The Snuggery.' The property was known as [...] "No 20, Colpetty" [...] in the 1900s, it stretched from Galle Road, with its lawn stretching eastwards {{right down to the}} Beira Lake. No 5 was twice its size when it was first built, with kitchens, servants quarters and stables stretching along the Northern perimeter, forming the <b>top</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> the T-shaped layout of the house.|$|R
5000|$|There {{will always}} be some {{compressed}} gas remaining in the cylinder and cylinder head spaces at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke.</b> The gas in this [...] "dead space" [...] will expand during the next induction stroke, and only after it has dropped below the supply gas pressure, more supply gas will flow into the cylinder. The ratio {{of the volume of}} the cylinder space with the piston fully withdrawn, to the dead space, is the [...] "compression ratio" [...] of the booster, also termed [...] "boost ratio" [...] in this context. Efficiency of the booster is related to the compression ratio, and gas will only be transferred while the pressure ratio between supply and discharge gas is less than the boost ratio, and delivery rate will drop as the inlet to delivery pressure ratio increases.|$|R
25|$|Flipper {{solenoids}} contain two {{coil windings}} in one package; a short, heavy gage 'power' winding {{to give the}} flipper its initial thrust up, and a long, light gage 'hold' winding that uses lower power (and creates far less heat) and essentially just holds the flipper up allowing the player to capture {{the ball in the}} inlane for more precise aiming. As the flipper nears the end of its upward travel, a switch under the flipper disconnects the power-winding and leaves only the second sustain winding to hold the flipper up in place. If this switch fails 'open' the flipper will be too weak to be usable, since only the weak winding is available. If it fails 'closed' the coil will overheat and destroy itself, since both windings will hold the flipper at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b>|$|R
50|$|Typical normal-service engine valve-train {{components}} {{may be too}} lightweight {{for operating}} at high revolutions per minute (RPM), leading to valve float. This occurs when {{the action of the}} valve no longer completely opens or closes, such as when the valve spring force is insufficient to close the valve (it does not fully rest on its seat even though the cam would allow the valve to close) causing a loss of control of the valvetrain, as well as a drop in power output. Valve float will damage the valvetrain over time, and could cause the valve to be damaged as it is still partially open while the piston comes to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b> Upgrading to high pressure valve springs could allow higher valvetrain speeds, but this would also overload the valvetrain components and cause excessive and costly wear.|$|R
5000|$|Excepting {{commemorative}} varieties, {{there have}} been a number of varieties of regular issue coins identified by collectors, of both the obverse and reverse. The first of these seen is a highly prized variety of the 1966 issue, with a [...] "wave" [...] on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the bottom <b>stroke</b> <b>of</b> the 2 in [...] "20". These coins are now sold for over $200, depending on condition. Other varieties sited of the obverse generally revolve around the length and number of the claws of the platypus. These are prone to changing if incorrect stamping pressure is used in creation of dies for the coins. Consequentially, these are often seen in coins produced at foreign mints.|$|R

He abandoned that in 1891 for a Star bicycle, which had the larger wheel at the back and was propelled by pedals to be pushed up and down. A further novelty was that both pedals could {{be brought to the}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the pedaling <b>stroke</b> at the same time, which the makers claimed gave better acceleration. He won the League of American Wheelmen national half-mile championship, setting a world record of 29.5 seconds for the last 440 yards.|$|R
50|$|Petrol/gasoline {{engines are}} limited in the variety {{and quality of the}} fuels they can burn. Older petrol engines fitted with a {{carburetor}} required a volatile fuel that would vaporise easily to create the necessary air-fuel ratio for combustion. Because both air and fuel are admitted to the cylinder, if the compression ratio of the engine is too high or the fuel too volatile (with too low an octane rating), the fuel will ignite under compression, as in a diesel engine, before the piston reaches the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its <b>stroke.</b> This pre-ignition causes a power loss and over time major damage to the piston and cylinder. The need for a fuel that is volatile enough to vaporise but not too volatile (to avoid pre-ignition) means that petrol engines will only run on a narrow range of fuels. There has been some success at dual-fuel engines that use petrol and ethanol, petrol and propane, and petrol and methane.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the ideal}} Otto cycle engine, the vacuum engine {{relies on a}} {{constant}} heat source provided by burning fuel. As mentioned above, a valve allows an intake of heat into the piston chamber. Estimating the heat in or Qin is constant in the controlled volume space, the ideal gas equation PV = nRT implies {{an increase in the}} pressure of the piston chamber. After the valve closes, the piston undergoes an adiabatic process during the downward stroke. Once the piston reaches the bottom <b>of</b> its <b>stroke,</b> the chamber is cooled either by the surrounding air or water, and the resulting Qout forces the pressure in the piston to decrease. The system then undergoes another adiabatic compression of the gas in the chamber, which is subsequently released by the valve at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cylinder's <b>stroke,</b> while simultaneously allowing new heated gas to enter the chamber.|$|R
2500|$|The {{solution}} to draining deep mines {{was found by}} Thomas Newcomen who developed an [...] "atmospheric" [...] engine that also worked on the vacuum principle. It employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to {{one end of a}} rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end. At the bottom <b>of</b> each <b>stroke,</b> steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston. As the piston rose within the cylinder, drawn upward by a counterbalance, it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure. At the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> the steam valve was closed, and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam. This water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston. The atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder, thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder. The piston, attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the [...] "rocking beam", pulled down the end of the beam, lifting {{the opposite end of the}} beam. Hence, the pump deep in the mine attached to opposite end of the beam via ropes and chains was driven. The pump pushed, rather than pulled the column of water upward, hence it could lift water any distance. Once the piston was at the bottom, the cycle repeated.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel system}} is a very simple design. A {{mechanical}} or electric fuel lift pump feeds a Stanadyne Rotary Distributor Injection pump at low pressure. The distributor injection pump controls both metering, via an internal centrifugal governor, and high pressure fuel delivery to the fuel injectors via internal precision hydraulic pumps. Near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the compression <b>stroke</b> fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel prechamber in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors. This is called Indirect injection. GM used fully mechanical DB2 series injection pumps on all military HMMWVs and 1982-1993 6.2's and 6.5's. From 1994 till end of production GM used the electronically controlled Stanadyne DS4 series of injection pumps in their light trucks. A mechanical DB4 series injection pump {{can be found on}} some 6.5L marine engines.|$|R
