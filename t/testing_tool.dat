40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis has been about {{automated}} testing in practice. Using <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> is quite common phenomenon in software companies. A questionnaire {{about the use of}} <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> in software quality assurance to investigate Norwegian software companies has been made. The questionnaire has been sent out to a number of Norwegian IT/software and non-IT/software companies to get feedback on their use of <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> for projects and product development. Four interviews have been conducted {{to find out more about}} the real life practice of using <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> in different companies. Quantitative Analysis has been used on the responses from the questionnaire and each response from the questionnaire have been statistically analyzed. The statistical analysis of the responses shows the percentage of how many people are using <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> and why, who are still solely dependent on manual testing and why and how the software quality assurance testings is done. The main objective is to find out facts related to the research questions; the less practice of using <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> in real life despite of its popularity in literature reviews and how the companies are following agile method and debugging at the same time...|$|R

50|$|Banking {{and large}} E-Commerce {{corporations}} {{have been the}} very early adopter customer profile for these types of tools. It is commonly held within these firms that both Black Box testing and White Box <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> are needed {{in the pursuit of}} application security. Typically sited, Black Box testing (meaning Penetration <b>Testing</b> <b>tools)</b> are ethical hacking tools used to attack the application surface to expose vulnerabilities suspended within the source code hierarchy. Penetration <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> are executed on the already deployed application. White Box testing (meaning Source Code Analysis tools) are used by either the application security groups or application development groups. Typically introduced into a company through the application security organization, the White Box tools complement the Black Box <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> in that they give specific visibility into the specific root vulnerabilities within the source code in advance of the source code being deployed. Vulnerabilities identified with White Box testing and Black Box testing are typically in accordance with the OWASP taxonomy for software coding errors. White Box testing vendors have recently introduced dynamic versions of their source code analysis methods; which operates on deployed applications. Given that the White Box <b>testing</b> <b>tools</b> have dynamic versions similar to the Black Box <b>testing</b> <b>tools,</b> both tools can be correlated in the same software error detection paradigm ensuring full application protection to the client company.|$|R
