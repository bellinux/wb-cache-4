Teachers who make voluminous corrections give a [...] "true" [...] sense {{of the extent to which}} students require remediation, but such feedback can be overwhelming. If students take such feedback to heart, they may see their performance as a failure, thus injuring their self-image and confidence. Students might then negate such feedback and dismiss it as overly critical, or they might fear that the teacher is biased against them personally. In contrast, teachers who make sparse corrections may better enable their students to focus on improving in one or a few key areas, but the omission of other helpful corrections may be detrimental to their students' progress in the long run. Specifically, students who make certain errors might be led to perceive that they are not making errors at all, or that those errors aren't significant enough to warrant the effort required to re-learn the concepts involved and avoid similar errors in the future.|$|E

Methods: This cross-sectional observational study included 20 patients, after undergoing <b>total</b> <b>correction</b> procedure for ToF diagnosed with mild/moderate pulmonary regurgitation and 30 age-matched healthy children. In the postoperative period, patients were invited to hospital for evaluation of the ventricular functions by 2 D, M-mode, Doppler (DE) echocardiography and TDE and exercise testing to evaluate the effort capacity. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests, and Pearson correlation analysis. Results: Compared with the controls; the mitral annular peak systolic flow velocity (Sm) value was significantly lower, while isovolumic contraction time (IVCT), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and myocardial performance index (MPI) values obtained at the tricuspid and mitral (MV) valves were significantly higher (p< 0. 05 for all) in patients after ToF repair. There was a negative correlation between the exercise period and the <b>total</b> <b>correction</b> age (r=- 0. 20, p= 0. 015) and the same negative correlation existed between the exercise period and METS (r=- 0. 25, p= 0. 010).

40|$|Effects {{associated}} with hyperfine mass splitting between pseudoscalar and vector mesons may induce surprisingly large 1 /m 2 Q corrections {{in the heavy}} quark expansion. We demonstrate this in a relativistic quark model by calculating to all orders in 1 /mQ, with and without hyperfine effects, and comparing to the first order results. <b>Total</b> <b>corrections</b> of 30 % or more are quite possible in the decay rates for B → Dlν and B → D∗lν near zero recoil. The subject of semileptonic weak decays of mesons containing a heavy quark has recently attracted much attention. In the limit in which the heavy quark mass mQ becomes infinite the theoretical treatment of these decays is greatly simplified,[1] potentially reducing the uncertainty in the extraction of the Kobayashi-Maskawa elements. But more insight into {{the magnitude of the}} corrections to this limit is required. We present here a relativistic quark model which provides a representation of the decay amplitudes to all orders in 1 /mQ. In [2] we show that the model correctly incorporates all heavy quark symmetry relations at zeroth and first order in the 1 /mQ expansion. We will use the model to study a source of corrections to the heavy quark limit which has not yet been seriously considered. This is the spin symmetry breaking effects due to gluon exchange between the heavy and light quarks. These hyperfine effects split the vector and pseudoscalar masses, but they will also cause a distortion of the light quark wave function in a way which depends on the spin of the heavy quark...|$|E
40|$|Background/PurposeThe optimal {{management}} of interrupted aortic arch (IAA) with ventricular septal defect is controversial. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate our 12 years of experience of surgical outcomes of one-stage and rapid two-stage <b>total</b> <b>corrections</b> of IAA with ventricular septal defect and to delineate the {{management of}} postoperative complications. MethodsWe reviewed the medical charts of all patients from 1996 to 2007. Neonates with inherent complex anatomy were excluded. There were 26 patients in our series, with 11 type A and 15 type B IAA. Nineteen patients received one-stage repair and seven patients received rapid two-stage total correction. Rapid two-stage total correction was defined as two operations performed within 1 week. ResultsThe 1 -month postoperative survival rate was 81 % (21 / 26), with 79 % (15 / 19) in the one-stage group, and 86 % (6 / 7) in the rapid two-stage group. The rapid two-stage group had a shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time (160. 1 ± 58. 4 vs. 216. 8 ± 73. 7 minutes, p = 0. 054) and aortic cross clamp (AXC) time (65. 6 ± 24. 4 vs. 91. 8 ± 22. 4 minutes, p = 0. 022) than the one-stage group. Postoperative left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) and aortic arch restenosis were common in survivors, with frequencies of 48 % (10 / 21) and 71 % (15 / 21) respectively. Within the postoperative arch stenosis subgroup, nine out of 15 patients received balloon angioplasties, which proved effective after only one treatment. The overall late survival rate was 73 % (19 / 26), with 68 % (13 / 19) in the one-stage group, and 86 % (6 / 7) in the rapid two-stage group. ConclusionThe outcome of rapid two-stage repair is comparable to that of one-stage repair. Rapid two-stage repair has the advantages of significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass duration and AXC time, and avoids deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. LVOTO remains an unresolved issue, and postoperative aortic arch restenosis can be dilated effectively by percutaneous balloon angioplasty...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives：Recently, {{the result}} of <b>total</b> <b>correction</b> in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is {{improved}} dramatically. But, residual anatomical changes of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and pulmonary artery junctional stenosis result in bad prognosis. Therefore we sought to analyze risk factors for pulmonary artery junctional stenosis after correction of TOF. Methods：From 1991 to 1998, 146 patients underwent the follow-up catheterizations after <b>total</b> <b>correction</b> of TOF in our institution and were analysed risk factors for pulmonary artery junctional stenosis. Of this patients group [age at operation 20. 1 ± 19. 8 months, follow-up duration after operation 13. 9 ± 5. 0 months, male (64 %) ], 20 cases (13. 7 %) had a PDA and 26 cases (17. 8 %) had a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt operation before <b>total</b> <b>correction</b> of TOF. Results： 1) Residual PS is correlated significantly with post-operative RVP/LVP (r＝ 0. 776, p< 0. 01) and post-operative RVEDP (r＝ 0. 196, p< 0. 05). 2) Post-operative RVP/LVP and residual PS increased significantly in grade II of residual PI than grade III-IV. 3) The left pulmonary artery junctional stenosis (LPAJS) was observed in 31 cases, and this group decreased signi-ficantly in pre-operative LPA diameter (p< 0. 01), increased in post-operative RVP/LVP (p< 0. 01), increased in post-operative RPA diameter (p< 0. 01), and decreased in post-operative LPA diameter (p< 0. 01) and was more severe in post-operative PI (p< 0. 01) than the other group respectively. 4) Of the patients group which wen...|$|R
