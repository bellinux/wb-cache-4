5|$|After {{the first}} year of development, Gas Powered Games found that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also {{spent a lot of time}} changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day, ten-man Northamptonshire capitulated. They lost their first wicket without a run being added, and {{never really got}} going, being 115 for 7 at close on the third day, and being {{dismissed}} for 175 and setting a target of 129 on the fourth. It was clear <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win, and Yorkshire gave them no chances, winning by 10 wickets.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the big}} {{problems}} the Astros had in the late 1970s {{was that they were}} unable to compete in the free agent market. Ford Motor Credit Company was still in control of the team and was looking to sell the Astros, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> spend money on better players. Most of the talent was either farm grown or bought on the cheap.|$|E

Two-thirds of a sample of 1,200 Rwandan genocide widows tested positive for HIV, and the infection rates in rural areas more than doubled after the genocide. There is no data {{on the number of}} victims who died from AIDS after 1994 who had contracted the disease from having been raped during the genocide.|$|E
25|$|During Series 1 to 4 (2002–2005), {{there was}} no precise nature or {{specific}} theme to Creamy Muck Muck, except for its ending. It has seen simple pie throwing in earlier series, various sport based themes, a murder mystery, and also many episodes where the presenters have pretended that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be throwing muck muck. For the end of Series 3, there was a surprise This Is Your Muck Muck sketch (a spoof of This Is Your Life), which involved many of Dick and Dom's family and friends, In Series 4 a Creamy Muck Muck bingo game was hosted by Dancing Brian (Ian Kirkby).|$|E
25|$|The British {{women and}} {{children}} were ordered {{to come out of the}} assembly rooms, but they refused to do so and clung to each other. They barricaded themselves in, tying the door handles with clothing. At first, around twenty rebel soldiers opened fire from the outside of the Bibighar, firing through holes in the boarded windows. The soldiers of the squad that was supposed to fire the next round were disturbed by the scene, and discharged their shots into the air. Soon after, upon hearing the screams and groans inside, the rebel soldiers declared that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill any more women & children.|$|E

25|$|The {{band played}} {{sporadic}} shows {{to support the}} album, which was well-reviewed in UK, but EMI Australia did little to assist them. Without such backing, it was clear {{by the end of}} 1971 that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> achieve the success they had dreamt of. Although Keays' recollections are more positive, Wheatley's own account of the album sessions is that they were an unhappy experience for him. He had a bad LSD trip the night before they went into the studio and began the recording in a negative frame of mind. Tensions mounted steadily during the recording and Wheatley did not play on some of the tracks, with his parts covered by Ford. According to Keays, Wheatley had been working part-time at a management agency over the previous few months and had insufficient time to rehearse because of his day job.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{came into}} Week 15 of the NFL season still undefeated, and this week's game {{featured}} the Colts playing the San Diego Chargers at home. San Diego started {{the game with}} 4 scores in the first 3 quarters of the game, before the Colts could even score. By the time the Colts finally put some points on the scoreboard, they were down 16–0 to the Chargers. Marty Schottenheimer and the Chargers {{were in the middle}} of a playoff hunt, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go down easy. But after San Diego jumped out to a 16-point lead, the Colts came back in the third quarter with three scores of their own, to put them up by one point at the beginning of the fourth quarter, 17–16. However, they were not able to score the rest of the game, and the Chargers scored twice in the fourth quarter, once on a field goal and another on an 83-yard touchdown run by RB Michael Turner. The loss to the Chargers was the first loss of the season for the Colts, but the last team to go 13–0, the 1998 Denver Broncos, lost their 14th and 15th games, before winning their last game of the season, and they went on to win Super Bowl XXXIII. The Colts had history in their favor, but Peyton Manning did not want to lose any more games during the 2005 season.|$|E

After sending the finished album to London Records, the label told Sleep that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> release the album in its current format. London Records had David Sardy remix the album but the label were still confused as to {{what to do with the}} album. Sleep refused to have the album released in any edited form which led to a deadlock between London and the band. The members of Sleep have mixed feelings whether the album should have been released in general. Cisneros felt it should not have been released while Pike was content with its release, saying [...] "We did all the work so why leave it sitting around?" ...|$|E

500|$|Entering {{the final}} round of matches, Somerset led the group, having won all three of their matches. They faced Worcestershire, while Glamorgan had to play a side {{representing}} the Minor Counties. The Somerset players, led by their captain, Brian Rose, worked out that despite their place {{at the top of the}} table, they could still miss out on qualification for the quarter-finals. Aware of their previous problems with run rate in the 1976 and 1978 John Player League tournaments, they knew that if they lost heavily to Worcestershire, and Glamorgan beat the weak Minor Counties side by a large enough margin, all three teams would be level on points, and Worcestershire and Glamorgan could qualify by having superior bowling strike rates. After their near misses over the previous years, the Somerset players were determined that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> miss out again; one of the players, Vic Marks, later described how they wanted to [...] "atone for the acute disappointments of the 1978 season." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{called the}} battle {{sequence}} [...] "remarkable", {{even though the}} series had already included several space battles. Moore felt <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> top the previous ones, but the visual effects team were able {{to pull it off}} as [...] "the best battle sequence we've ever done." [...] A scene cut from the teaser's battle sequence showed Samuel Anders aiming his Viper's guns at Diana Seelix's ship after discovering his Cylon nature. Another Anders cut scene focused on cutting the cast off his leg, due to the absence of his leg injury sustained from [...] "The Son Also Rises". With Baltar's storyline, the writers refer to the rooms used by his cult as [...] "Baltar's lair". Also, as the writers were aware that Baltar himself was visually similar to Jesus, Moore points out that he is not Jesus, though he admitted that the visual similarities help to [...] "drive some things home".|$|E
500|$|On December 9, 2011, IndyCar {{decided that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> return to Las Vegas for the 2012 season. Randy Bernard {{expressed}} reluctance {{to return to}} the speedway following Wheldon's death, despite the insistence of Speedway Motorsports, Inc. president Bruton Smith (who owns the track in Las Vegas as well as three other tracks used by the IndyCar series) for the series to honor its three-year contract with the track. As of that date, the investigation into the accident was still ongoing. IndyCar was holding back on the release of its 2012 schedule until the investigation concluded. [...] The IndyCar series also conducted an investigation into whether or not the series should continue racing on high-banked ovals such as Las Vegas and Texas Motor Speedway in Denton, Texas. Texas {{had been one of the}} staples of the IndyCar series since 1997 and had yet to be confirmed for 2012 prior to the Las Vegas race in 2011. Indycar's future at high-banked ovals was in jeopardy pending the results of the investigation. Texas was eventually placed on the 2012 schedule.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Greg Calloway was {{approached}} by producers to produce a soundtrack for the film. He presented the idea to Atlantic Records chairman Craig Kallman, {{and one of the}} company's artists, T.I., got an acting role in the film. However, the deal did not go further because Universal Pictures owned the rights to the film; [...] "It was a Universal film and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give the soundtrack to WMG" [...] (Atlantic's parent company). Thus Scott brought back Marc Streitenfeld, who had worked with him in A Good Year. The composer stated that [...] "the overall tone needed to be something bigger and darker" [...] given the characters' strong personalities, and while not being the original intention, he added shades of blues and soul music to fit the 1970s setting. The musical score for American Gangster was recorded between April and May 2007 by Streitenfeld, with the help of orchestrator Bruce Fowler and conductor Mike Nowak, using an 80-piece orchestra recorded in sections as well as acoustic pre-records, performed by Streitenfeld himself. Additional score material was composed and recorded by Hank Shocklee.|$|E
500|$|While Petre Dumitriu is {{motivated}} by his pursuit of discipline, his wife preserves her sophistication, reading the works of Marcel Proust, playing the harpsichord, employing a nanny to educate her children, and comparing the surrounding landscape with Japan's Mount Fuji. Variety calls her [...] "sensitive-yet-flamboyant in the mold of Zelda Fitzgerald". To her husband's assurance that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> spend long in Southern Dobruja, she replies: [...] "I like it here." [...] In pursuing this path, she only manages to widen the gap between her and most other characters. This rift is made apparent {{by a number of}} omens: unknown attackers throw rocks into the Dumitrius' house, while the vegetables she planted in the garden prove unpalatable. Confronted with these signs, Von Debretsy still attempts {{to make the best of}} the situation; online film critic James Berardinelli notes: [...] " [...] does her best to make a happy home for her family, despite stray bullets that shatter mirrors." [...] Bulgarian locals, taken as hostages by the military, are made to work on the garden. Their labor brings immediate improvement to the crop, and, upset by their condition, Marie-Thérèse decides to pay them out of her own pocket, serves them tea and eventually befriends them. In a scene that provided the original title for Petru Dumitriu's book chapter ("The Salad"), she invites Ipsilanti and other officers to dinner, and they are all shown to be enjoying the salad provided by Bulgarian labor. However, the episode also renews tensions between Ipsilanti and his Hungarian host, when she expresses her appreciation of her servants' work and attempts to intervene on their behalf.|$|E
