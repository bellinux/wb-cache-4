40|$|Last year, PRB {{made the}} {{strategic}} decision <b>to</b> make <b>our</b> <b>websites</b> {{a focal point}} of our communications effort. We added significant new content <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>websites</b> <b>to</b> meet increasing demands in the United States and overseas for demographic information and analysis. We expanded our programs and staff working on electronic communications and reallocated resources to fund these new initiatives. This website expansion effort is clearly the most successful communications project that PRB has ever launched. In a typical month, more than 70, 000 distinct hosts {{from around the world}} log on to a PRB website. By contrast, a best-selling PRB print publication distributed in the United States will reach, on average, only a few thousand readers per year. As part of our strategic plan, we have decided to cease publication of Population Today and to reallocate the resources used to publish Population Today <b>to</b> increase <b>our</b> online coverage of important U. S. and international population issues. This decision was not an easy one, given that we have been publishing Population Today since 1975. But over the past several years, the costs of producing and printing this newsletter have increased dramatically. We had many discussions about raising membership dues, but we would have had to raise dues substantially to adequately fund Population Today and our Internet initiative. While the November/December issue will be the last, as a PRB member you will continue to receive your other publications—the Population Bulletin, the World Population Data Sheet, and PRB Reports on America. From time to time we will also send you selected publications on important population issues, thanks to funding from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, th...|$|R
