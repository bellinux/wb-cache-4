500|$|Betsy Wallace of Common Sense Media {{observed}} that Mulan [...] "doesn't fit the princess mold, and most moviegoers {{had never heard}} of her." [...] Conclusively, Wallace wrote, [...] "it's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> in the end she still needs to be married off to a 'Prince Charming' who saves the day." [...] In contribution to the book Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works, Lan Dong wrote, [...] "Even though Mulan achieves success after she resumes her female self... it is compromised by Mulan and Li Shang's potential engagement {{at the end of the}} film." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} {{of the use of}} the orchestra. Helen Sloan, writing for Crackerjack (Bristol Evening Post) found that the orchestra rendered [...] "the whole thing a bit bland and movie-soundtrack", and Birchmeier found it to be [...] "a bit overwhelming" [...] {{by the end of the}} album. Further, he was critical of the inclusion of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] and [...] "Ave Maria", considering them to be overly predictable song choices. Though he was pleasantly surprised by some of the inclusions (such as [...] "River of Light" [...] and [...] "The Way Old Friends Do"), he concluded that [...] "t's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> [...] isn't given more creative material to sing. One hopes her next album is more adventurous." ...|$|E

500|$|Using a five- to eight-note range, Orbison's voice rises as {{he wakes}} up to find his lover gone. The song trips; the music stops and a staccato tattoo replaces it, as he cries when remembering she has left him. The climax is a {{powerful}} crescendo as he cries [...] "It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> all these things / Can only happen in my dreams", and the resolution follows his voice from falsetto to the final note an octave below as he sings [...] "Only in dreams / In beautiful dreams", as all the instruments and singers conclude with him abruptly. The song never repeats a section. In two minutes and forty-eight seconds, it goes through seven movements with distinct melodies and chord progressions. The first two sections are sixteen bars each; the rest are only eight bars. In comparison to the standard form of pop songs in AABA — where A represents a standard verse, and B represents a variation, usually {{referred to as the}} bridge — [...] "In Dreams", with each variation, can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F.|$|E
500|$|Critically, {{the album}} {{received}} mainly positive reviews. Metal Hammer stated that [...] "the sleazy, downtrodden blues hard rock [...] breaks new ground." [...] AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Slash's contributions [...] "quite amazing", though criticised the song-writing, stating [...] "it's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> {{nobody in the}} band bothered to write any songs." [...] Devon Jackson of Entertainment Weekly described the album as [...] "relaxed headbanging and Southern-tinged blues-rock" [...] while Classic Rock reviewer Malcolm Dome stated [...] "musically, it's a loose-limbed record {{that has a lot}} of heavy guitar-led punk-style pop-rock." [...] Slash's Snakepit toured in support of the album, with bassist James LoMenzo and drummer Brian Tichy, of Pride and Glory, replacing Inez and Sorum, who had opted out of touring, with Sorum returning to Guns N' Roses. They toured the US, Europe, Japan and Australia with Slash stating that [...] "for the first time in years, touring was easy, [...] band mates were loads of fun and low on drama, and every gig was about playing rock and roll." [...] While booking another leg of the tour, Slash was informed by Geffen that Rose was ready to begin work on the new Guns N' Roses album and that he was to return to Los Angeles. Geffen pulled financial support for the band's tour with Slash's Snakepit disbanding soon after.|$|E

In {{response}} to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent. Around this time, an article in The New York Times stated, [...] "It is <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

2500|$|On the {{negative}} side, Kyle Smith of the New York Post called the film [...] "more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself {{to stick with}} any story thread for too long." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times, while generally positive, found [...] "it falls apart a bit near the end." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap said the film [...] "will doubtless tickle young fans of the toys. It's just <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> a movie that encourages you to think for yourself doesn't follow its own advice." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the controversy, Benga {{was allowed}} to roam {{the grounds of the}} zoo. In {{response}} to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent. Around this time, Rev. Dr. R.

Benga committed suicide in 1916 at the age of 32.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Mike Hale for The New York Times commented: [...] "The {{ideas in}} V, about alien {{encounters}} and mass delusion and media manipulation, are enticing. It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> they're floating {{around in a}} show that at this early stage, is so slapdash and formulaic in its storytelling." [...] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com commented that plot points such as the Visitors attempting to create worldwide instability by printing fake IDs were unbelievable, and that talk of launching a resistance movement was [...] "tiresome and pointless". She posed the question: [...] "Isn't there {{a new way to}} handle the alien invasion story? Isn't there something a little more subtle and hauntingly evil out there than sneaky reptiles with really good publicists?" [...] David Hinckley for the Daily News called the episode [...] "an elaborately costumed popcorn flick", opining that whilst the original series [...] "probed the subtleties of human psychology in the face of ominous uncertainty that threatened to become mortal danger", the reimagining is [...] "about as subtle as a Donald Trump boardroom firing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Interviews {{conducted}} by Martin Middlebrook for his book, Argentine Fight For The Falklands, indicated that Argentine naval officers understood {{the intent of}} the message was to indicate that any ships operating near the exclusion zone could be attacked. Argentine Rear Admiral Allara, {{who was in charge of}} the task force of which General Belgrano was part, said, [...] "After that message of 23 April, the entire South Atlantic was an operational theatre for both sides. We, as professionals, said it was just <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> we lost the Belgrano". Captain Bonzo also told Middlebrook that he was not angry about the attack on his ship and [...] "The limit [...] did not exclude danger or risks; it was all the same in or out. I would like to be quite precise that, as far as I was concerned, the 200-mile limit was valid until 1 May, that is while diplomatic negotiations were taking place and/or until a real act of war took place, and that had happened on 1 May".|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{received}} his harshest criticism after first round playoff exits, including {{a string of}} four in five years from 1998 to 2002, and several coaching changes. After Terry Murray was fired following the team's sweep in the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals (some suggested that Murray lost the players' respect by describing the 6-1 loss in game three as a [...] "choking situation"), five more coaching changes {{were made in the}} next five years. Wayne Cashman, Murray's replacement, was replaced three-quarters of the way through the 1997-98, by Roger Neilson due to inconsistent team play. Some suggested Clarke's handling of Neilson, who took a medical leave in February 2000 to undergo cancer treatment and was replaced by Craig Ramsay, was disrespectful. Clarke explained [...] "The Neilson situation - Roger got cancer - that wasn't our fault. We didn't tell him to go get cancer. It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> he did. We feel sorry for him, but then he went goofy on us." [...] Ramsay guided the team to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2000, but he was fired after a subpar start in 2000-01, being replaced by Clarke's former linemate Bill Barber. Barber was named coach of the year for 2000-01, however under his watch the Flyers suffered two consecutive first round eliminations, as their 2001 playoffs ended with an 8-0 defeat to Buffalo in Game Six, and their offense was held to just two goals by Ottawa during the 2002 playoffs, and this led to calls for Clarke's dismissal after he fired Barber. Clarke hired Ken Hitchcock as head coach for the 2002-03 season and Hitchcock remained until Clarke's resignation four years later, guiding the team to the 2004 conference finals.|$|E
2500|$|When Jackson {{left the}} role in 1999, a recast was opposed by viewers and costars. When Jackson's {{departure}} {{had previously been}} rumored in 1996, Anthony Geary (Luke) told TV Guide that he [...] "went to (the GH powers) and said, 'If we lose him, then let's kill Lucky.' Jonathan is too {{much a part of}} us to replace him." [...] Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999. When a recast was rumored in early 2000, Jackson stated: [...] "When all the actors {{who are going to be}} working with the character don't want it, it's kind of <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> they still do it. But I don't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do." [...] The role was recast with Jacob Young, and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000, the character had been off-screen for almost a year, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson's popularity. Young was able to become accepted by fans; in 2001, Candace Havens wrote in The Free Lance–Star: [...] "His hard work has paid off and many fans can't even remember there was ever someone else in the role." [...] Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by People magazine in 2001. In 2002, Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. Greg Vaughan, who took over the role from 2003 to 2009, was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award. However, Vaughan did have a fan following. He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar, featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas. At the start of 2008, Zap2it named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list, stating: [...] "The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well. Thank goodness we're getting to see it." [...] During Vaughan's tenure, Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) that was popular with fans. Zap2it named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth (Herbst) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), stating: [...] " [...] conceived out of a revenge plot, yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry. Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009?" [...] When Vaughan left in 2009, he reflected on his reception: [...] "I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me, whether they liked me or not. It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time." [...] Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character. In April 2008, Allison Waldman of The Huffington Post named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on General Hospital, stating: [...] "He's still the real Lucky to many people, even though two other actors have subsequently played the part." ...|$|E
5000|$|IGN stated it wasn't <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> and <b>that</b> it is [...] "simple {{and easy}} to follow"; {{reviewer}} Jack Devries's final opinion was that [...] "If your school offers an SAT prep course, I would definitely recommend that over this title, but if you didn't plan on studying at all, then My SAT Coach is probably better than nothing."
