Named Seagull by the U.S. Navy, and Seamew by the Royal Navy, the SO3C developed a disastrous reputation in service, and was retired before the SOC biplane which it was intended to replace.|$|E

Part of this was related to its closed-box design.

5|$|Continued work {{displayed}} {{a number of}} minor problems, and {{the decision was made}} to introduce a redesigned unit with significant improvements in packaging, insulation, and other practical changes. This would become the AI Mk. V, which began to arrive from Pye in late February and immediately demonstrated a host of problems. By this time the microwave units were being designed, and the Mk. V was almost cancelled. A contract for over 1,000 units was allowed to continue in case of delays in the new units. By May the issues with the Pye design were ironed out, and the FIU's testing revealed it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> to the Mk. IV, especially in terms of maintenance.

As there was little funding to be had from the CIA budget, McDonnell developed the aircraft using its own funds, although technical support gleaned from Oxcart was supplied by the CIA. The McDonnell Isenglass/Rheinberry proposal's shape remains classified, although it has been described as being similar to the Space Shuttle, albeit much reduced in size. A 1/3 cross-sectional model of the aircraft was constructed to illustrate the principles used in its construction.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord, {{previously}} {{also known}} as Ardennais du Nord or Ardennais de type Nord, is a breed of heavy draft horse developed and bred {{in the area of}} Hainaut in western Belgium and in northeastern France. Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes, it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903. Developed in the fertile Flemish grasslands, it was bred for size and pulling power for agricultural work. By 1855, the horses bred near Hainaut were considered by some veterinarians <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> to other Flemish draft breeds. The Trait du Nord was used extensively in mining from the late 19th century through 1920, with lesser use continuing through the 1960s.|$|E

Karim subsequently lived quietly near Agra, on the estate that Victoria had arranged for him, until his death at the age of 46.|$|E

Ted DiBiase, meanwhile, takes his name from his father, (Ted DiBiase) who wrestled before him along with both his grandparents (adoptive grandfather, Mike DiBiase and grandmother Helen Hild). Cody Rhodes followed {{in the footsteps of}} his father (Dusty Rhodes) and his two uncles (Jerry Sags and Fred Ottman), who preceded him in the business.
