25|$|Movement of the Delta IVs {{among the}} various {{facilities}} at the pad is facilitated by Elevating Platform Transporters (EPTs). These rubber-tired vehicles can be powered by either diesel engines or electric power. Diesel EPTs are used for moving the vehicles from the HIF <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad,</b> while electric EPTs {{are used in the}} HIF, where precision of movement is important.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex {{offers an}} {{educational}} {{look at the}} accomplishments of America's space program. The Observation Gantry near Launch Complex 39 offers {{a view of the}} Space Shuttle launch pads (first built for the Apollo missions), the Vehicle Assembly Building, and the crawlerway over which rockets are taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad.</b> The Apollo/Saturn V Center displays an example of the largest rocket ever launched.|$|E

25|$|Delta IV CBCs are {{assembled}} at ULA's {{factory in}} Decatur, Alabama. They are then loaded onto the M/V Delta Mariner, a roll-on/roll-off cargo vessel, {{and shipped to}} either launch pad. There, they are offloaded and rolled into a Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF), where they are mated with the second stages, which were shipped separately <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> on the Delta Mariner. Also, in the HIF, the three CBCs of Heavy variant are mated to each other.|$|E
25|$|The Command and Service Module, a Block I model, {{similar to}} that flown on three {{previous}} unmanned tests, arrived September 29 and was stacked December 10. It was actually a hybrid of two production spacecraft, consisting of CM-020 and SM-014, since SM-020 had been destroyed in a tank explosion and CM-014 had been dismantled to support {{the investigation into the}} Apollo 1 fire. After two months of testing and repairs, the rocket was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> on February 6, 1968.|$|E
25|$|The Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) is {{situated}} {{some distance from}} the pad. It is a large building that allows the Delta IV CBCs and second stages to be mated and tested before they are moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad.</b> The horizontal rocket assembly of the Delta IV are similar to the ones with the assembly of Soyuz launch vehicles; they are also assembled horizontally, unlike the Space Shuttles, the past Saturn launch vehicles and the upcoming Space Launch System, where they are assembled and rolled out to the launch pad entirely vertically.|$|E

50|$|Build-Up Models: {{these type}} of models are more {{expensive}} and detailed than clay models. they are made by building up pieces of foam on a metal skeleton it to create a body, and then either brushing on several layers of liquid latex on top, or casting soft rubbery skins and attaching then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>padded</b> armature.|$|R
25|$|Under {{the vehicle}} is a Launch Table, with six Tail Service Masts (TSMs), two for each CBC. The Launch Table {{supports}} the vehicle on the pad, and the TSMs provide further support and fueling functions for the CBCs. The vehicle is mounted to the Launch Table by a Launch Mate Unit (LMU), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle by bolts that sever at launch. Behind the Launch Table is a Fixed Pad Erector (FPE), which uses two long-stroke hydraulic pistons to raise the vehicle to the vertical position after being rolled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> from the Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF). Beneath the Launch Table is a flame duct, which deflects the rocket's exhaust away from the rocket or facilities.|$|E
500|$|Powered by {{the same}} {{hardware}} used in the Sega Genesis, the physical shape of the Pico was designed to appear similar to a laptop. Included in the Pico are a stylus called the [...] "Magic Pen" [...] and a pad to draw on. Controlling the games for the system is accomplished either by using the Magic Pen like a mouse or by pressing the directional buttons on the console. The Pico does not include its own screen or RF output, and instead must be connected to a monitor through a VCR {{in order to be}} played. Touching the pen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> would either allow drawing or animate a character on the screen.|$|E

2500|$|Abdullah Abdullah {{also brought}} forth {{evidence}} to support his allegations of widespread vote-rigging. He showed sealed ballot forms that he similarly claimed were votes for him that were never counted; a vote ledger sheet from a polling station that listed only a few names, yet had a ballot tally {{on the bottom of}} 1,600; video showing ballot-stuffing that he said was recorded on August 22 – two days after the polls had closed on August 20 and ballot boxes were supposed to have been sealed; video of an individual directing voters to cast their ballot for Karzai; a photograph allegedly showing Karzai people looking over the shoulders of voters filling their ballot sheets behind the cardboard voting screens; a thick tablet of ballot sheets still affixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad,</b> with every single ballot apparently pre-marked for Karzai with the same pen and by what seemed to be the same hand. Abdullah said the tablet had been turned over to them in southern Afghanistan and was just one of hundreds. He said: [...] "This amount of fraud ... Even I did not anticipate it.

2500|$|Playing {{the cello}} is done while seated with the {{instrument}} {{supported on the}} floor by the endpin. The left hand fingertips stop the strings on the fingerboard, determining the pitch of the fingered note. The right hand plucks or bows the strings to sound the notes. The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in [...] higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the neck positions (which use just {{less than half of the}} fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in thumb position (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.|$|E

As you have often heard me say, I was passionately fond of big-game shooting, and I had had many narrow escapes {{in the course of}} my life, but I never had so narrow a one as {{happened}} to me on that occasion. We had wounded a tiger and had lost him. We had spent a couple of hours in beating the jungle, but without success, and had agreed that the brute could not have been hit as hard as we had believed, but must have made off altogether. We were within fifty yards of the edge of the jungle, when there was a sudden roar, and before I could use my rifle the tiger sprang. I was not in a howdah, but on a pad; and the tiger struck one of its forepaws on my knee. With the other he clung for a moment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pad,</b> and then we went down together. The brute seized me by the shoulder and sprang into the jungle again, carried me a dozen yards or so, and then lay down, still holding me by the shoulder.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper {{and is in}} Closed Access. The {{definitive}} published version is available at: [URL] packaging with Anisotropic Conductive Adhesives (ACAs) has been successfully implemented in flat screen assembly and smart cards {{for more than two}} decades, but novel processes are required to enable any significant further increases in interconnection density. This paper will report work to further develop two promising methods which can potentially extend the application of the types of conductor particles used in ACAs to enable ultra-fine pitch interconnections by selectively depositing these metal-coated polymer particles onto targeted bond pads. These two methods are electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and magnetic deposition (MD). <b>To</b> allow EPD <b>the</b> particles were positively charged by being immersed in a HCl solution, and then were selectively deposited onto the bumps on a silicon test chip. However the HCl immersion results in etching of the nickel layer, which is believed <b>to</b> significantly impact <b>the</b> conductivity and reliability of the interconnections formed, even though a connection forms between <b>the</b> particles and <b>pads</b> which is quite strong. In the MD process <b>the</b> Ti/Ni/Au bond <b>pads</b> on <b>the</b> test chips were permanently magnetized so that the particles were attracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pads,</b> and <b>the</b> results proved that a sufficient density of the Ni/Au coated polymer particles became adhered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pads</b> providing a simple, low cost, and ultra-fine pitch method...|$|R
