5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in <b>the</b> <b>LOT,</b> this leaves him open to the question of why <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (<b>the</b> <b>LOT)</b> in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for <b>the</b> <b>LOT,</b> then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|R
