5|$|Göring {{had never}} {{believed}} in Sea Lion, while Hitler had never believed Adler could achieve victory without Sea Lion. Both went their own ways. Hitler needed someone <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pressure on Britain, and Göring {{was willing to}} do it. On 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports, but those under assembly were to continue. But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness was becoming a strain. The invasion forces were broken up and moved East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice.|$|E
5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of the blockade, Indiana fired at the cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo {{as they left the}} harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable {{to keep up with the}} Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} three days the Ottomans {{continued}} to launch incessant and ultimately unsuccessful counterattacks in an effort to recapture the ground they had lost. In total three regiments were dispatched. The Australians also brought up reinforcements, moving up men from two battalions from the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades—the 7th and 12th Battalions—to hold the 1st Brigade's gains. Throughout 7 August, the fighting devolved into a series of hand grenade duels. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> supply, Australians put about 50 soldiers to work at Anzac Cove manufacturing makeshift grenades out of empty jam tins: over 1,000 were sent up to the 1st Infantry Brigade late on 7 August. The fighting continued throughout the night of 7/8 August as the 47th Regiment, launched a determined counterattack; suffering heavy casualties, including the regimental commander, Tewfik Bey, the attack was unsuccessful in retaking the main front-line trenches, but succeeded in regaining some of the ground in the north and also pushed the Australians back a little way from The Cup.|$|E
5|$|Argyle {{salvaged}} a late point against Preston North End at {{the start}} of March, but remained in serious trouble at the bottom end of the table, seven points adrift of safety with 13 matches remaining. A 2–0 defeat followed at Queens Park Rangers, with Adel Taarabt playing a part in both of the home sides goals. Draws at Home Park were proving to be an Achilles' heel for Argyle, but they secured a creditable 1–1 draw at play-off chasing Coventry City, having taken the lead through a glancing header from Árnason. Three days later, a 20-yard strike from captain Fletcher earned Argyle their fifth home win of the season in a 3–2 thriller against Bristol City. They had taken a 2–0 lead through Chris Clark and an overhead kick from Bradley Wright-Phillips, his first for the club. However, the visitors responded in the second-half with two goals from Nicky Maynard before former Welsh international Fletcher scored with seconds to spare. Argyle travelled to play Scunthorpe United looking <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> momentum, but threw away a lead to be defeated by a deflected effort from Martyn Woolford.|$|E

25|$|In tourist towns, such as Queenstown in the South Island, some {{exemptions}} {{are granted}} by the district council for selected shops to open on Good Friday.

However, liquor sale is restricted for some of that day (not usually a problem because shops are usually closed on that day).|$|E

He continued, by telling the court that AUF Oslo was contacted on a yearly basis by the central leadership of the Labour Party, if the Labour Party leadership felt the membership was to low AUF was told to shape up.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{was one of}} extreme difficulty, for the mutiny which had paralysed the fleet at the Nore broke out also amongst the crews under Duncan, and kept him for some weeks in enforced inactivity. Duncan's personal influence and some happy displays of his vast personal strength held the crew of Venerable to their duty; but with one other exception, that of Adamant, the ships refused to quit their anchorage at Yarmouth, leaving Venerable and Adamant alone <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pretence of the blockade.|$|E

25|$|Iaido is for {{the most}} part {{performed}} solo as an issue of kata, executing changed strategies against single or various fanciful rivals. Every kata starts and finishes with the sword sheathed. Notwithstanding sword method, it obliges creative ability and fixation <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> inclination of a genuine battle and to keep the kata new. Iaidoka are regularly prescribed to practice kendo to safeguard that battling feel; it is normal for high positioning kendoka to hold high rank in iaido and the other way around.|$|E
25|$|Former AUF leader, Anniken Huitfeldt, also {{admitted}} that membership numbers were too high. She {{told the court}} that the reason why AUF decided <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> practice of during her leadership, was to protect {{former members of the}} organisation who had contributed to this inflation. She also {{admitted that}} she was taught how to 'advance' money for membership fees when she first joined the organisation.

Even a fall scrap drive donated two thirds of its income to the canteen. Even the priest of the local Roman Catholic church, after donating twelve turkeys and hearing that they were consumed, personally transported his turkey over to the canteen. Expenses for the canteen averaged about two hundred and twenty five dollars a week.|$|E

He then bribes the crew to mutiny and make course for Liverpool. Against hurricane winds and going on full steam, the boat runs out of fuel after a few days.

25|$|In December 1921, {{with the}} help of an uncle and with a loan from two parents of girls at the school, Willis bought The Cloisters, Cold Ash, Berkshire, with sixty acres, for £11,976. The Cloisters had been {{designed}} by the architect James MacLaren Ross and was built during the First World War for a religious order called 'The School of Silence', but the order had been unable <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> payments on its mortgage. Willis was able to move her school there just four months after the purchase, in April 1922. For the Summer term of 1922, the school had eighty-three girls, and by 1925 there were 118. Downe House had arrived as a leading girls' school.|$|E
