40|$|ABSTRACT. Characteristics of {{fracture}} toughness of polycrystalline ceramics are investigated by numerical simulations and indentation fracture <b>test</b> <b>for</b> polycrystalline <b>alumina</b> ceramics. Generally ceramics fracture from a defect. A crack propagates from the defect stably under monotone increasing load before catastrophic fracture. This stable crack propagation determines {{the characteristics of}} {{fracture toughness}} of ceramics. In this study we perform crack propagation simulations by using boundary element method. The relationship between the micro crack extension resistance and the macro fracture toughness in polycrystalline ceramics is investigated. According to the results, the crack extension area is wide and the standard deviation of the macro fracture toughness is large, so that the standard deviation of the micro crack extension resistance is large. It is worth noticing that the aforementioned results obtained in the present paper might be useful also when stable crack propagation due to fatigue loading is investigated...|$|R

This study helps for {{the choice of the}} appropriate preparation route <b>for</b> <b>alumina</b> precursor synthesis. As-synthesized boehmite and AACH precursors were then calcined between 500 °C and 1000 °C. The textural properties of the corresponding aluminas were characterized.

Moreover, AACH-derived alumina exhibited a high surface area. However, a more accurate analysis revealed that this high specific surface area (407 m 2. g- 1) is mostly due to microporosity formation during the calcination step.
