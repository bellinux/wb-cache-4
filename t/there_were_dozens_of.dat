Sixty-six Apaches were killed while the Americans suffered only five casualties. The army then built Fort Bowie to protect the trail that led through the pass.|$|E
25|$|The homophile {{movement}} lobbied {{to establish}} a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability.

A 1962 gay march held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, according to some historians, {{marked the beginning of}} the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the LGBT youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality, and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April–July 1966, followed by the August 1966 Compton's riot, where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of Tenderloin rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, Gene Compton's Cafeteria.|$|E

Thus the SS Great Britain was moored in the Floating Harbour until December 1844, before proceeding into Cumberland Basin after coping stones and lock gate platforms were removed from the Junction Lock.

500|$|Radiohead {{released}} {{their third}} album, OK Computer, in June 1997. The album found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating ambient, avant garde and electronic influences, prompting Rolling Stone {{to call the}} album a [...] "stunning art-rock tour de force". Radiohead denied {{being part of the}} progressive rock genre, but critics began to compare their work to Pink Floyd, a band whose early 1970s work influenced Greenwood's guitar parts at the time. Some compared OK Computer thematically to Floyd's bestseller The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), although Yorke said the album's lyrics had been inspired by observing the [...] "speed" [...] of the world in the 1990s. Yorke's lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called [...] "end-of-the-millennium blues" [...] in contrast to the more personal songs of The Bends. According to journalist Alex Ross, the band had become [...] "the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation—as the Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before." [...] OK Computer met with critical acclaim. Yorke said he was [...] "amazed it got the reaction it did. None of us fucking knew any more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create."OK Computer was the band's first number-one UK chart debut, propelling them to commercial success around the world. Despite peaking at number 21 in the US charts, the album eventually met with mainstream recognition there, earning Radiohead their first Grammy Awards recognition, winning Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year. [...] "Paranoid Android", [...] "Karma Police" [...] and [...] "No Surprises" [...] were released as singles from the album, of which [...] "Karma Police" [...] was most successful internationally.

2500|$|Eastern Finnmark {{is located}} {{close to the}} then Norway–Soviet Union border, with large {{military}} activity on both sides. The Cold War forced secrecy regarding military installations [...] for instance the ranges of military radar systems [...] which caused certain details to not be revealed in the commission's report.

Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, although being one of the higher-priced competitors, though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air. The competitive pricing of MacBooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks, as this contradicted the established [...] "elitist aura" [...] perception that Apple products cost more but were higher quality, which made these most expensive Ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were.|$|E
