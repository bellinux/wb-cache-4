40|$|Abstract — Command Processing Logic is command {{execution}} in spacecraft. <b>The</b> <b>commands</b> and <b>the</b> clock extracted from incoming signal {{are sent to}} <b>the</b> <b>command</b> processing logic. <b>The</b> <b>commands</b> are transmitted with redundancy and with encoding. Each command is transmitted four times. To detect error in commands encoding is used. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> processing logic should take care of redundancy and also should extract <b>the</b> correct <b>command</b> bit from <b>the</b> incoming bit stream. Ones correct <b>command</b> is detected <b>the</b> <b>command</b> processing logic produce an authentic pulse. With the rising edge of the authentic pulse, <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> are stored in an auxiliary register. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> processing logic also contains the logic to produce pulse commands. <b>Command</b> Decoding Logic <b>the</b> <b>command</b> decoder extracts <b>the</b> <b>command</b> information, <b>the</b> message bits and stores it in auxiliary resister which can be read using CPU. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> decoder then checks for <b>the</b> <b>command</b> bits and produce <b>the</b> pulse <b>commands...</b>|$|R

5|$|In March 1939, Travis {{went to the}} 72d Bombardment Squadron at Hickam Field, Hawaii, {{to serve}} as {{operations}} officer and a flight commander. In July 1939, he became its commanding officer. He then became materiel officer of the 5th Bombardment Group in September 1940, and was promoted to major on 31 January 1941. In May 1941, {{he returned to the}} United States, where he was assigned to the 29th Bombardment Group at MacDill Field, Florida, as <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> officer of the 43d Bombardment Squadron. He was subsequently elevated to Executive Officer and then commander of the 29th Bombardment Group, with the rank of lieutenant colonel from 5 January 1942, and colonel from 1 March 1942. He moved with the 29th Bombardment Group in June 1942, when it was relocated to Gowen Field in Boise, Idaho. In September 1942, he became <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> officer of the 15th Bombardment Training Wing at Gowen Field. He moved with it to Sioux City Army Air Base in Iowa, in February 1943.

50|$|The {{radio-frequency}} {{signal that}} {{is transmitted from}} the ground is received by <b>the</b> <b>command</b> receiver and is amplified and demodulated. Amplification is necessary because the signal is very weak after traveling the long distance. Next in <b>the</b> <b>command</b> system is <b>the</b> <b>command</b> decoder. This device examines the subcarrier signal and detects <b>the</b> <b>command</b> message that it is carrying. The output for the decoder is normally non-return-to-zero data. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> decoder also provides clock information to <b>the</b> <b>command</b> logic and this tells <b>the</b> <b>command</b> logic when a bit is valid on the serial data line. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> bit stream that is sent to <b>the</b> <b>command</b> processor has a unique feature for spacecraft. Among {{the different types of}} bits sent, the first are spacecraft address bits. These carry a specific identification code for a particular spacecraft and prevent <b>the</b> intended <b>command</b> from being performed by another spacecraft. This is necessary because there are many satellites using the same frequency and modulation type.|$|R
5000|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> {{in modern}} drill are {{separated}} into two distinct parts; <b>the</b> Preparatory <b>Command,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Command</b> of Execution. <b>The</b> preparatory <b>command</b> indicates to <b>the</b> person performing {{the movement that}} a command of execution is soon to follow - and which action to perform.. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> of execution indicates the movement to be performed. An {{example of this is}} <b>the</b> <b>command</b> [...] "Present ARMS", which is utilized to command a group of soldiers to render a salute. In this <b>command,</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "Present" [...] is <b>the</b> preparatory <b>command,</b> whereas <b>the</b> following word, [...] "ARMS" [...] is <b>the</b> <b>command</b> of execution. <b>The</b> movement is performed immediately upon reception of <b>the</b> execution <b>command.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, salutes at a halt {{are given}} on <b>the</b> <b>command</b> [...] "Hand Salute". They are lowered {{in the same}} amount of time elapsed between the two words. <b>The</b> <b>command</b> [...] "present arms" [...] will cause <b>the</b> <b>command</b> to salute if <b>the</b> <b>command</b> is not given rifles for the ceremony, but the salute will be held until they are ordered to lower it with <b>the</b> <b>command</b> [...] "order arms".|$|R

50|$|In {{this case}} before {{executing}} a <b>command</b> <b>the</b> program counter is at some position (state before <b>the</b> <b>command</b> is executed).Executing <b>the</b> <b>command</b> moves <b>the</b> program {{counter to the}} next command.Since the program counter is the whole state, it follows that executing <b>the</b> <b>command</b> changed <b>the</b> state.So <b>the</b> <b>command</b> itself corresponds to a transition between the two states.|$|R

5|$|The {{first to}} realise the mistake was General Dembiński, <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> {{officer of the}} Reserve Corps tasked with {{defending}} the western sector. He immediately asked for reinforcements, but was denied by General Krukowiecki. Forced to fight alone, Dembiński did not reinforce the first line with his reserve 3rd Infantry Division and instead sent forward only a token force: half a battalion to man Fort 58 and support Fort 57. To make things worse for the Poles, General Umiński, <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> officer of the southern sector, focused entirely on the skirmishes around Królikarnia and did not notice {{what was happening in}} Wola. Around 7:00 he reinforced Królikarnia with almost six battalions of infantry (ca. 2,800 men) and three guns. Forts 54 and 55 received no reinforcements.|$|E

50|$|The {{automatic}} imitation comes {{very fast}} when a stimulus {{is given to}} replicate. The imitation can match <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> with <b>the</b> visual stimulus (compatible) or it cannot match <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> with <b>the</b> visual stimulus (incompatible). For example: 'Simon Says', a game played with children where they are told to follow <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> given by <b>the</b> adult. In this game, the adult gives <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> and shows <b>the</b> actions; <b>the</b> <b>commands</b> given can either match the action to be done or it will not match the action. The children who imitate the adult who has given <b>the</b> <b>command</b> with <b>the</b> correct action will stay in the game. The children who imitate <b>the</b> <b>command</b> with <b>the</b> wrong action will {{go out of the}} game, and this is where the child's automatic imitation comes into play. Psychologically, the visual stimulus being looked upon by the child is being imitated faster than the imitation of <b>the</b> <b>command.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> response times were faster in compatible scenarios than in incompatible scenarios.|$|R

5|$|The {{police have}} little success with street-level arrests or with {{securing}} informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes {{the direction of}} electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, <b>the</b> <b>commanding</b> officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation to wrap up the case. Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response {{from the rest of}} the department.
