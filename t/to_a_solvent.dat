50|$|Boiling-point {{elevation}} {{describes the}} phenomenon that {{the boiling point}} of <b>a</b> liquid (<b>a</b> <b>solvent)</b> will be higher when another compound is added, meaning that a solution has a higher boiling point than <b>a</b> pure <b>solvent.</b> This happens whenever a non-volatile solute, such as a salt, is added <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pure <b>solvent,</b> such as water.

50|$|The {{accessible}} {{surface area}} (ASA) or solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is {{the surface area}} of a biomolecule that is accessible <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>solvent.</b> Measurement of ASA is usually described in units of square Ångstroms (a standard unit of measurement in molecular biology). ASA was first described by Lee & Richards in 1971 and is sometimes called the Lee-Richards molecular surface. ASA is typically calculated using the 'rolling ball' algorithm developed by Shrake & Rupley in 1973. This algorithm uses a sphere (of solvent) of a particular radius to 'probe' {{the surface of the}} molecule.|$|E

A 'Resolution Cor- poration' would watch all financial firms which have made intense promises to households, and intervene when the {{net worth of}} the firm is near zero (but not yet negative).

50|$|Freezing-point {{depression}} {{is the process}} in which adding a solute <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> decreases the freezing point of the solvent. Examples include salt in water, alcohol in water, or the mixing of two solids such as impurities in a finely powdered drug. In the last case, the added compound is the solute, and the original solid is {{thought of as the}} solvent. The resulting solution or solid-solid mixture has a lower freezing point than the pure solvent or solid. This phenomenon is what causes sea water, (a mixture of salt other things in water) to remain liquid at temperatures below 0 C, the freezing point of pure water.|$|E
50|$|Baricity is {{one factor}} that determines the spread of a spinal {{anaesthetic}} but {{the effect of adding}} a solute <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>solvent,</b> i.e. solvation or dissolution, also has an effect on the spread of the spinal anaesthetic. In tetracaine spinal anaesthesia, it was discovered that the rate of onset of analgesia was faster and the maximum level of analgesia was higher with a 10% glucose solution than with a 5% glucose spinal anaesthetic solution. Also, the amount of ephedrine required was less in the patients who received the 5% glucose solution. In another study this time with 0.5% bupivacaine the mean maximum extent of sensory block was significantly higher with 8% glucose (T3.6) than with 0.83% glucose (T7.2) or 0.33% glucose (T9.5). Also the rate of onset of sensory block to T12 was fastest with solutions containing 8% glucose.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with other}} red wines, {{a number of}} health effects are claimed. Among other wines, it has a {{relatively}} low level of sugar and a low alcohol level. This means it can be drunk by diabetics, and the calorie content is low by comparison with most other wines. Some examples of health claims for red wine include reduced cardiovascular risks; favourable effect on digestion; promotes metabolism; can prevent insomnia and strengthens the blood stream. Regular consumption has been claimed to prevent heart attacks. Several studies have concluded that regular consumption of red wine such as Cviček (1 to 2 glasses per day) improves the antioxidant activity of the blood and prevents the aggregation of blood platelets, thus reducing the risk for a stroke or heart attack. In that sense, ethyl alcohol in the wine acts similarly <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>solvent.</b> [...] Scientists examining cancer occurrence and development have found also many anti-tumour substances in red wine.|$|E

50|$|To {{produce this}} form of yellowcake, crushed ore is mixed with hot water to a 58% solids slurry. The solids slurry is then {{processed}} {{through a series of}} tanks, where sulfuric acid, sodium chlorate, and steam are used to extract the uranium from the solids slurry. The average leaching efficiency for this process is 98.5%. The uranium-bearing solution is then decanted and directed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> extraction (SX) process for further purification. In this extraction step, the dissolved uranium is transferred from the feed solution into the organic solvent. Next a stripping step recovers the uranium into a sodium chloride aqueous phase after which the barren solvent is recycled. The average efficiency of the SX circuit is 99.9%. The high-grade “pregnant” strip solution from SX goes to the next stage where magnesia slurry is added to precipitate magnesium diuranate. The yellow cake precipitate is then thickened, dried, re-crushed and packed into industry standard 220 litre steel drums for shipment to customers.|$|E
