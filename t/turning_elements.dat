5000|$|Charles Darling Parks (August 5, 1869 in New Brunswick, New Jersey [...] - [...] September 14, 1929 in Danbury, Connecticut) was a Hatting manufacturer. He {{was the son}} of Frederick Hiram and Louise (Price) Parks. Parks was {{orphaned}} at {{an early}} age, and lived with relatives in Brooklyn, New York, Rochelle, Illinois and Danbury, Connecticut, acquiring his early education in various schools.He began his business career in 1888 as a dealer of hides and tallows in Danbury, Conneccticut, and two years later, in association with Edward Solomon Parks, his brother, and John Norris, organized the Danbury Fertilizer Co. for the manufacture of fertilizer. Early in 1894 he purchased from his partners the hide and tallow division of this company. The fat and bones he rendered into tallow, thus <b>turning</b> <b>elements</b> previously regarded as quite valueless into sources of large profits. In this departure he laid the foundation of his life success. Around 1896, with his brother Edward, he inaugurated the enterprise of recovering shellac from stiff hat roundings, which until this time had been regarded as worthless by-products of the hat factories. This business proved successful from its inception, especially after he had learned to treat the fur product after removal of the shellac, so that with other furs it could be utilized in the manufacture of felt hats. In January 1901 he formed a partnership with Joseph P. McGovern of New York, then the senior partner in the firm of J.P. McGovern & Bro., brokers in hatter's furs, in order to further expand the business of the manufacture of hatter's furs. This business, incorporated as American Hatters and Furriers Corp., with a capital of $50,000, was increasingly successful year by year, and in 1906 was reorganized as the American Hatters and Furriers Co., Inc., with a capital of $500,000. Mr. Parks was president and manager of this company, with Mr. McGovern acting as treasurer and vice president. After Mr. McGovern's death in 1912, the business continued with Mr. Mercier as treasurer. When Mr. Parks died, the capital was $1,250,000. In 1903 Mr. Parks organized the Connecticut Glue Co., of which he was President and Mr. McGovern treasurer. This company was organized {{to make use of the}} by-product from the cutting of rabbit skins, the pelt being used to good advantage in the manufacture of [...] "Pure Rabbit Skin Glue." [...] Like his other ventures, this undertaking proved a great success. Mr. Parks was also president of Star Oil Co., Sunfast Hats, Inc., and Irving Trust Co. As a controlling stockholder in Parks-Mercier, Inc., and as president of the C. D. Parks Co., he was interested in large realty holdings. On his extensive country estate in Danbury, [...] "Tarrywile", he maintained a large dairy establishment stocked with the finest breeds of cattle and the most modern equipment. In the management of this enterprise he also applied his high natural talent for business, so effective in other fields, and made it a profit-yielding undertaking as well as a source of relaxation and keen enjoyment. Mr. Parks was vice president of the Danbury Agricultural Society, which conducts the Danbury Fair; vice president of the Danbury Chamber of Commerce; a member of the Danbury board of finance; and a trustee of the Wooster School, Danbury. For his extraordinary record in selling Libery Loan bonds during World War I, he received a special testimonial from the United States government. His clubs were the Bridgewood Country and the Danbury clubs of Danbury; the Norwalk Country Club; the Algonquin Club of Bridgeport; the Chemists Club of New York City and the Metabetchuan Club of Canada. Mr. Parks was a man of impressing presence, of excellent qualities of character and friendly manner. Although determined resourceful and calculating in the business deliberate in forming his opinions, cautious in his judgements, and adamant in his convictions, he was able to relinquish cares and the join in the lighter enjoyments of life. A man of cultivated tastes and keen intellect, he was a lover of nature and of good literature and music. He was married on December 4, 1889 to Eleanor Sophia, the daughter of Wallace Bruce Parks, of Moreau, New York. They had two daughters: Irene, wife of Louis Chadwick Rathmell; and Jeanette Darling, wife of Donald Alexander Davis. Mr. Parks died at Danbury, Connecticut on September 14, 1929.|$|E

Tests, conducted on a 1 / 15 scale model of a triple-slotted EBF system, indicate that a significant reduction (of up to 10 to 15 db for no forward speed case and of up to 5 to 10 db for forward speed case) is possible in the low frequency (around 63 Hz) region of the noise spectrum of the full scale device for small nozzle/flap separation distances. The overall acoustic performance, measured in PNdb, does not exhibit significant reductions. The analysis of the EBF noise is carried out for two limiting airfoil in a free jet.

40|$|The ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) {{model is}} a finite-element {{hydrodynamic}} model based on the generalized wave continuity equation (GWCE). The model assumed fixed land boundaries until a wetting and drying algorithm was implemented by Luettich and Westerink in 1995 [1, 2]. The algorithm uses an element-based approach, effectively <b>turning</b> <b>elements</b> on and off based on water depths and a water level gradient. While robust in some simulations, the algo-rithm can be subject to instabilities in the solution during highly nonlinear events. Thus, a rigor-ous assessment of the algorithm’s stability, accuracy, mass balance properties, and parameter sensitivity {{under a variety of}} conditions is needed. Herein, we examine these issues using a one-dimensional implementation of the wetting and drying algorithm for basins with a linear slope; future studies will examine a wider variety of real and idealized basins. We believe the results of this work will benefit similar studies in two- or three-dimensions, for users and developers of both ADCIRC and other finite element models. 1.

40|$|Subsea jumpers are {{steel pipe}} {{sections}} that connect hardware components on the seafloor (e. g. trees, manifolds, and sleds) and typically operate in multi-phase flow. They {{are designed with}} bends to accommodate limited expansion due to variations in temperature and pressure. Under certain conditions significant fluctuating forces can be induced in flow-turning elements like bends and tees. These fluctuating forces may cause severe piping vibrations and weld fatigue damage. This paper presents a flow-induced vibration screening procedure based on the 3 -D numerical simulation of unsteady internal multi-phase flow in subsea well jumpers, the prediction of associated flow-induced forces in flow-turning elements, and the prediction of structural response, including fatigue life estimates. We consider a 6 inch (nominal) diameter well jumper with six <b>turning</b> <b>elements</b> (i. e. six blind Tees), having 70 feet of suspended span, and perform simulations for two different flow conditions representative of early- and mid-life production. We find that the dominant frequencies of flow-induced vibration are those associated with modes 1 through 4 and that stresses are highest in mid-life flow conditions when the gas volumetric void fraction is 55 %.

40|$|Abstract—Significant {{opportunities}} {{exist for}} optical interconnections at the board, module, and chip level if compact, low-loss, high-data-rate optical interconnections {{can be integrated}} into these electrical interconnection systems. To create such an integrated optoelectronic/electronic microsystem, mask-based alignment of the optical interconnection waveguide, optoelectronic active devices, and interface circuits is attractive from a packaging alignment standpoint. This paper describes an integration process for creating optical interconnections which can be integrated in a postprocessing format onto standard boards, modules, and integrated circuits. These optical interconnections utilize active thin-film optoelectronic components embedded in the waveguide/interconnection substrate, thus {{eliminating the need for}} optical beam <b>turning</b> <b>elements</b> and their alignment, and providing an electrical output on the substrate from an optical interconnection. These embedded optical interconnections are reported herein using BCB polymer optical waveguides with embedded InGaAs-based thin-film inverted metal–semiconductor–metal (I-MSM) photodetectors on an Si substrate. These interconnections have been fabricated and tested, and the coupled optical signal from the waveguide to the embedded photodetector was theoretically modeled at 56. 4 %, which was supported by an experimental estimate of 47. 8 %. The measured full-width at half maximum of the electrical pulse from the MSM photodetector embedded in the waveguide was 16. 73 ps for an input 500 -fs optical laser pulse.
