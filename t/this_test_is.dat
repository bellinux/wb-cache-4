5|$|In the rideability test, {{the horse}} is {{evaluated}} {{by a member of}} the studbook evaluation committee by being ridden at a walk, trot and canter. The horse's movement, balance and disposition are evaluated and given 4 to 10 points. The horse should express cooperation, gentleness, attentiveness, sensitivity to cues, and active effort. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> required for riding-type horses, and optional for pony-sized horses in lieu of the driveability test.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> rarely performed.|$|E
5|$|Early diamond {{identification}} tests {{included a}} scratch test {{relying on the}} superior hardness of diamond. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>are</b> robust to {{heteroscedasticity}} and autocorrelation.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} by Lucien Brouha {{and his associates}} in 1943.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{invented by}} the German Chemist, Georg Ludwig Carius (1829 - 1875).|$|R
25|$|Further, <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{very easy}} to {{communicate}} without involved statistics.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{performed}} routinely in most medical {{laboratories and}} can be measured {{by a variety of}} methods.|$|E
25|$|For {{significance}} testing, {{the degrees}} of freedom for <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> 2n−2 where n {{is the number of}} participants in each group.|$|E

50|$|Operation Teapot: <b>This</b> <b>test</b> {{took place}} in Nevada in mid-April during 1955. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} to obtain data on the substitution ratio of U-233 for “supergrade” plutonium.|$|R
25|$|Chromatography {{can be used}} to {{separate}} and identify undigested sugars present in faeces. Although lactose may be detected in the faeces of people with lactose intolerance, <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not considered reliable enough to conclusively diagnose or exclude lactose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} {{for the assessment of}} sexual dysfunctions in psychiatric patients and people with health problems (men and women). It particularly evaluates modifications and alterations of sexual functions in relation to the intake of medicines or psychotropic substances.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{made up of}} two {{questionnaires}} (i.e. a {{male and}} a female questionnaire) with 24 pairs of items each. They measure the dominance and willingness within the couple. Its validity has been improved thanks to a revision by Scott-Heyes (1982) whose title is RSMPT - Ryle/Scott-Heyes Marital Patterns Questionnaire.|$|E
5000|$|As the tracers {{used for}} <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>are</b> carcinogenic, {{frequent}} use of these tests carries a small risk of cancer.|$|R
50|$|An example {{application}} of <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> to spatial clustering of leukaemias and lymphomas {{among young people}} in New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|The Zefiro 23 {{second stage}} engine was first fired on 26 June 2006 at Salto di Quirra. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> successful.|$|R
25|$|The {{second test}} {{consists}} of the driver driving on a route set by a government supervisor, who also supervises the driver himself. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> considered especially difficult in the larger cities and the failure statistics show similar results. This test demands perfection as the driver {{is not allowed to}} make any mistakes at all.|$|E
25|$|This test {{requires}} the intravenous administration of edrophonium chloride or neostigmine, drugs that block {{the breakdown of}} acetylcholine by cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> no longer typically performed, as its use can lead to life-threatening bradycardia (slow heart rate) which requires immediate emergency attention. Production of edrophonium was discontinued in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{shear test}} : ASTM D3080. The {{direct shear test}} determines the consolidated, drained {{strength}} properties of a sample. A constant strain rate is applied to a single shear plane under a normal load, and the load response is measured. If <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> performed with different normal loads, the common shear strength parameters can be determined.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of <b>this</b> <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> to obtain torque tension {{data for the}} use of Super Koropon Primer Base which was proposed for use on the Orion project. This compound is a corrosion inhibitor/sealer used on threaded fasteners and inserts as specified per NASA/JSC PRC- 4004, Sealing of Joints and Faying Surfaces. Some secondary objectives of <b>this</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>were</b> to identify the effect on torque coefficient of several variables. This document contains the outcome of the testing...|$|R
25|$|If <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} after 1965 when {{improvements in}} device design were realized, a 100-fold reduction in radiation release is considered feasible.|$|R
30|$|And {{so people}} come out and ask that <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>be</b> {{abolished}} because in their opinion {{that it does not}} reflect the examinee.|$|R
25|$|The {{prothrombin}} time (PT) test measures {{the time required}} for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid {{and put in a}} fibrometer; delayed clot formation indicates a deficiency. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the concentration of prothrombin in the blood has declined by at least 50%.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to measure selective attention, cognitive flexibility and processing speed, {{and it is}} used as a tool in the evaluation of executive functions. An increased interference effect is found in disorders such as brain damage, dementias and other neurodegenerative diseases, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or a variety of mental disorders such as schizophrenia, addictions, and depression.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnostic}} test, when used, {{is similar}} to that used to diagnose lactose intolerance. It is called a hydrogen breath test and is the method currently used for a clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, some authors argue <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not an appropriate diagnostic tool, because a negative result does not exclude a positive response to fructose restriction, implying a lack of sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|In 1953 <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to easily}} {{identify}} that the 'Piltdown Man' was forged, almost 50 {{years after it}} was originally 'unearthed'.|$|R

50|$|Measuring emotional, motivational and {{interpersonal}} characteristics {{is the purpose}} of personality tests. The results of <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>are</b> compared to those of a reference-population.|$|R
25|$|The most applied {{diagnostic}} test is the straight leg raise to produce Lasègue's sign, {{which is considered}} positive if pain {{in the distribution of}} the sciatic nerve is reproduced with passive flexion of the straight leg between 30 and 70 degrees. While <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive in about 90% of people with sciatica, approximately 75% of people with a positive test do not have sciatica.|$|E
25|$|If the {{triangle}}s are coplanar, <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{not entirely}} successful. One can add some extra planes, for instance, planes that are normal to triangle edges, {{to fix the}} problem entirely. In other cases, objects that meet at a flat face must necessarily also meet at an angle elsewhere, hence the overall collision detection will be able to find the collision.|$|E
25|$|The rouge test is {{a version}} of the mirror test used with children. Using rouge makeup, an {{experimenter}} surreptitiously places a dot {{on the face of the}} child. The child is then placed in front of a mirror and their reactions are monitored; depending on the child's development, distinct categories of responses are demonstrated. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> widely cited as the primary measure for mirror self-recognition in human children.|$|E
