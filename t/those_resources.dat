5|$|The fifth batch, again {{named after}} cities, {{comprised}} four locomotives, Nos. 6245–6248. These engines were built during 1943 {{and the average}} cost was held to £10,908 due to the incorporation of recycled boilers. During the Second World War, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs for steel between civilian departments and the War Department when allocating <b>those</b> <b>resources.</b> Despite these constraints, the entire batch was still outshopped in streamlined form.|$|E
5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not <b>those</b> <b>resources</b> are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into <b>those</b> <b>resources.</b> This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

If the DNS resolution receives multiple IP address mappings (A resource records) from a DNS server, and some of the records have IP addresses from networks to which the computer is directly connected, the resolver places <b>those</b> <b>resource</b> records first.

5|$|Russia {{is one of}} the world's largest {{producers}} of energy, most of which it obtains from oil, natural gas and coal. The country's focus on <b>those</b> <b>resources</b> for production and export, which constitute 80% of foreign trade earnings, means it has paid little attention to renewable energy. Out of the 203GW of electric generation capacity that Russia has, 44GW comes from hydroelectricity, 307MW from geothermal, 15MW from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources. In 2009, the Russian energy industry generated a total 992TWh of electricity, 176TWh of which was produced by hydroelectric power stations. Some of Russia's hydroelectric power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment, as shown by the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Vinícius Segalla from UOL said {{tax credits}} and BNDES {{resources}} are public money and that the concession of <b>those</b> <b>resources</b> to Corinthians are unclear. The federal government dismissed the notion, saying that tax credits are intended to encourage economical growth and work opportunities for the areas surrounding the stadia. The city government said tax credits are not subsidies and the stadium will {{be a boon to}} the city, especially the east zone. They also said subsidies given to the Brazilian Grand Prix and Carnaval among others also bring benefits to the city. Public Prosecutor Marcelo Milani contested the validity of tax credits issued by the city and sued then-mayor Gilberto Kassab for R$1.74billion; the judges said Milani's case was without merit and dismissed it.|$|E

40|$|An over-booking based dynamic {{spectrum}} management (DSM) scheme is conceived {{for improving the}} attainable spectral efficiency. All secondary users (SU) will be categorized into different classes and they borrow spectral resources from the primary users (PU) before data transmission. Under the risk-based policy model, the effects of both booking cancellations and ’no-show’ reservations are analyzed. Assuming that the booking demands obey an inhomogeneous Poisson process, we derive the optimal number of excess reservations, while minimizing the total compensation costs. Algorithms are developed for determining the capacity allocation dedicated to each SU class, whilst denying <b>those</b> <b>resource</b> allocations, which would lead to congested bookings...|$|R

25|$|While Acemoglu and Robinson {{attribute}} {{economic growth}} to institutions, {{there are other}} possible explanations, including geography, culture, and the ignorance of leaders. The alternative theories below are alternatives for the general framework posed by the book, rather than for {{either of the two}} theories above. Though these theories all try to claim a major factor that drives economic development, they are not mutually exclusive. For example, geography does shape the natural resources available to a country. For example, a country given rich resources has the potential to become rich. On the other side, institutions determine how <b>those</b> <b>resources</b> are distributed and create incentives for different groups to be motivated to participate in economic development.|$|E
