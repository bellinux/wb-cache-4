5000|$|Stepan O'Fetchit... At {{the other}} extreme, modern-dress movies like Tony Luraschi's The Outsider.. purport {{to present a}} real, {{contemporary}} Ireland while effectively reducing it to a <b>traffic</b> <b>snarl-up</b> of faceless ideologues wielding guns, balaclavas, and gritty one-liners.|$|E

When vehicles are fully stopped for periods of time, this is colloquially known as a traffic jam or <b>traffic</b> <b>snarl-up.</b> Traffic congestion can lead to drivers becoming frustrated and engaging in road rage.|$|E
50|$|Daria's {{experiences}} with Bromwell don't exactly fill her with confidence, mainly because she experiences first-hand just how well-connected the Sloanes {{are to the}} university when she accompanies Tom and his mother on a weekend college tour. Tom's interview goes smoothly as he relates anecdotes about Bromwell that he got from his relatives, but Daria's self-consciousness almost sabotages her interview. They then encounter a professor who's {{a friend of the}} family and agree to meet him for breakfast the next morning, despite the fact that they'll have little time to spare to get to Boston. A late start, a <b>traffic</b> <b>snarl-up,</b> and a rainstorm all conspire to get them to Raft College too late for Daria's interview, which doesn't please her at all. At home, Daria relates her frustrations to Helen (who tries to help but can't) and Jake (who's pushing her to apply to Middleton College but mistakenly thinks she's going to military school); shortly thereafter, she receives an acceptance package from Raft, and a letter from Bromwell stating that she's been put on a waiting list. Daria relays this news to Tom, who tells her that he got into Bromwell. Fuming over what she believes to be upper-class privilege winning out over academic ability, she gets into an argument with Tom, who says precisely the wrong thing, causing Daria to grow annoyed and hang up on him. After a suitable amount of grovelling and apologizing, Tom offers to have his parents write Bromwell a letter of recommendation for Daria, which she refuses... at first.|$|E
