5|$|In 1971, {{with support}} from UNESCO, Syria appealed to the {{international}} community to participate in the efforts to salvage as many archaeological remains as possible before the area would disappear under the rising water of Lake Assad. To stimulate foreign participation, the Syrian antiquities law was modified so that foreign missions had the right to claim a part of the artefacts that were found during excavation. As a result, between 1971 and 1974, numerous excavations were carried out in the Lake Assad area by Syrian as well as foreign missions. Syrian archaeologists worked at the sites of <b>Tell</b> al-'Abd, 'Anab al-Safinah, <b>Tell</b> Sheikh Hassan, Qal'at Ja'bar, Dibsi Faraj and <b>Tell</b> Fray. There were missions from the United States on Dibsi Faraj, <b>Tell</b> Fray and Shams ed-Din-Tannira; from France on Mureybet and Emar; from Italy on <b>Tell</b> Fray; from the Netherlands on <b>Tell</b> Ta'as, Hadidi, Jebel 'Aruda and Selenkahiye; from Switzerland on <b>Tell</b> al-Hajj; from Great Britain on Abu Hureyra and <b>Tell</b> es-Sweyhat; and from Japan on <b>Tell</b> Roumeila. In addition, the minarets of Mureybet and Meskene were moved to higher locations, and Qal'at Ja'bar was further reinforced and restored. Many finds from the excavations are now on display in the National Museum of Aleppo, where a special permanent exhibition is devoted to the finds from the Lake Assad region.|$|E

5|$|Settlement in {{the region}} of Gaza dates back to <b>Tell</b> es-Sakan, an Ancient Egyptian {{fortress}} built in Canaanite territory to the south of present-day Gaza. The site went into decline throughout the Early Bronze Age II as its trade with Egypt sharply decreased. Another urban center known as <b>Tell</b> al-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle Bronze Age, a revived <b>Tell</b> es-Sakan became the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort. In 1650 BCE, when the Canaanite Hyksos occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first <b>Tell</b> as-Sakan. However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BCE, {{at the end of the}} Bronze Age.|$|E

5|$|Different peoples {{inhabited}} the city, including the Halafians, Semites and the Hurrians. <b>Tell</b> Brak was a religious center from its earliest periods; its famous Eye Temple {{is unique in}} the Fertile Crescent, and its main deity, Belet-Nagar, was revered in the entire Khabur region, making the city a pilgrimage site. The culture of <b>Tell</b> Brak was defined by the different civilizations that inhabited it, and it was famous for its glyptic style, equids and glass. When independent, the city was ruled by a local assembly or by a monarch. <b>Tell</b> Brak was a trade center due to its location between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. It was excavated by Max Mallowan in 1937, then regularly by different teams between 1979 and 2011, when the work stopped due to the Syrian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|During period Q, <b>Tell</b> Brak was an {{important}} trade city in the Mitanni state. A two-story palace was built c. 1500 BC in the northern section of the <b>tell,</b> {{in addition to an}} associated temple. However, the rest of the <b>tell</b> was not occupied, and a lower town extended to the north but is now all but destroyed through modern agriculture. Two Mitannian legal documents, bearing the names of kings Artashumara and Tushratta, were recovered from the city, which was destroyed between c.1300 and 1275 BC, in two waves, first {{at the hands of the}} Assyrian king Adad-Nirari I, then by his successor Shalmaneser I.|$|E

5|$|Gaza enjoyed {{demographic}} {{and economic growth}} again when the local Canaanite population began to resettle <b>Tell</b> as-Sakan around 2500, but in 2250, the area experienced a total collapse of civilization {{and all of the}} cities in the Gaza region were abandoned by the 23rd century BCE. In its place emerged semi-nomadic cultures with pastoral camps made up of rustic family dwellings which continued to exist throughout the Early Bronze Age IV. An urban center known as <b>Tell</b> al-Ajjul began to arise inland along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle Bronze Age, <b>Tell</b> as-Sakan was the southernmost locality in Canaanite territory, serving as a fort, and by 1650 BCE, while Egypt was occupied by the Canaanite Hyksos, a second city developed on the ruins of the first <b>Tell</b> as-Sakan.
