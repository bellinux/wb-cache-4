40|$|Background: Tobacco {{use among}} {{military}} personnel {{is of concern}} given its substantial burden on military health care and combat readiness. Objective: This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of tobacco use and interest in tobacco cessation among active duty soldiers assigned to Fort Riley. Methods: Participants completed tobacco use questionnaires {{as part of a}} Soldier readiness process. SPSS v. 16. 0 was used to calculate mean percent and multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 6, 181 active duty soldiers participated in the study (91. 2 % male, mean age 26. 8 years (SD = 6. 8 years; range 17 - 56 years). Forty-nine percent reported using some form of <b>tobacco</b> (<b>smoked</b> <b>tobacco</b> or smokeless <b>tobacco).</b> <b>Smoked</b> <b>tobacco</b> use was 39 %. Smokeless tobacco use was over 19 %. Thirty-six percent of tobacco users reported interest in cessation. Conclusion: Results suggest that active duty soldiers serving at Fort Riley Army Post represent a high-risk population for tobacco use and there may be unique factors contributing to greater tobacco use and low interest in tobacco cessation. The observed increased use in the time period around deployment provides important information for local health care providers {{that can be used to}} tailor current prevention and cessation programs...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of tuberculosis in adult men in India is 2 – 4 {{times higher than}} in women. Tobacco smoking is prevalent almost exclusively among men, so {{it is possible that}} tobacco smoking may be a risk factor for developing pulmonary tuberculosis. A nested case control study was carried out to study the association between tobacco smoking and pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: A tuberculosis disease survey was carried out in two Panchayat unions in the Tiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu in India. Eighty five men aged 20 – 50 years with bacteriological tuberculosis (smear and/or culture positive) were selected as cases and 459 age matched men without tuberculosis were selected randomly as controls. Information on smoking status, type of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoked,</b> quantity of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoked,</b> and duration of tobacco smoking was collected from cases and controls using a questionnaire.

50|$|Smoke is {{produced}} by incomplete combustion of tobacco during which at least three kinds of chemical reactions occur: pyrolysis breaks down organic molecules into simpler ones, pyrosynthesis recombines these newly formed fragments into chemicals not originally present, and distillation moves compounds such as nicotine from the <b>tobacco</b> into the <b>smoke.</b> For every gram of <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoked,</b> a cigar emits about 120-140 mg of carbon dioxide, 40-60 mg of carbon monoxide, 3-4 mg of isoprene, 1 mg each of hydrogen cyanide and acetaldehyde, and smaller quantities of a large spectrum of volatile N-nitrosamines and volatile organic compounds, with the detailed composition unknown.|$|R

5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline.

5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke,</b> thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E

40|$|Acute {{exposure}} to passive smoking adversely affects vascular function by promoting oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. However, {{it is not}} known whether <b>tobacco</b> sidestream (SS) <b>smoke</b> has a greater deleterious effect on the endothelium than non-tobacco SS smoke and whether these effects are related to nicotinic endothelial stimulation. To test these hypotheses, endothelial-dependent relaxation and superoxide anion production were assessed in isolated rat aortas incubated with <b>tobacco</b> SS <b>smoke,</b> non-tobacco SS smoke, or pure nicotine. <b>Tobacco</b> SS <b>smoke</b> decreased the maximal relaxation to acetylcholine (Ach) from 79 +/- 6 % to 57 +/- 7. 3 % (% inhibition of phenylephrine-induced plateau, P < 0. 001) and increased superoxide anion production from 31 +/- 9. 7 to 116 +/- 24 count/ 10 sec/mg (P < 0. 01, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence technique). The non-tobacco SS smoke extract had no significant effect on the response to Ach but increased superoxide anion production in the aortic wall to 133 +/- 2 count/ 10 sec/mg (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, concentration-response curves to Ach and superoxide production remained unaltered with nicotine (0. 001, 0. 01, or 0. 1 mM). In conclusion, despite similar increases in vascular wall superoxide production with tobacco and non-tobacco SS <b>smoke,</b> only the <b>tobacco</b> SS <b>smoke</b> extracts affected endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. Nicotine alone does not reproduce the effects seen with <b>tobacco</b> SS <b>smoke,</b> suggesting that the acute endothelial toxicity of passive smoking cannot simply be ascribed to a nicotine-dependent mechanism.

5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel is essential to plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in <b>tobacco</b> <b>smoke</b> and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
