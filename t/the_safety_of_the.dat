The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Barbaros Hayreddin, Turgut Reis, and Mesudiye took several hits during the battle, though only Barbaros Hayreddin was significantly damaged. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles.

40|$|AbstractIt's {{important}} for <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical industrial park to calculate <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park as chemical industrial parks developed fast {{in recent decades}} in our country.
