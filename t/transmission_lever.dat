50|$|Projector headlamp, Electronic Power Steering and dual airbags are {{standard}} across the range. The standard trim gets steel rims with caps, and other variants get alloy rims and Foglamps. The Automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> is now relocated to the dashboard area like the Perodua Alza. An integrated 2-DIN 6-inch Touch Screen DVD Navigation system with Maps powered by Telekom Malaysia {{is available in}} the 1.3L Elegance and all 1.5L variants. The 1.3L Elegance and 1.5L Extreme variants also get chrome door handles and a different bodykit.|$|E
50|$|The {{front and}} rear of the body had minor restyling, with new front grille, {{headlights}} and taillights. The interior has been significantly upgraded. Interior upgrade includes a new instrument panel, centre console and steering wheel and new design <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> and handbrake. There is also a new mobile phone power outlet under the centre console. The new instrument cluster features a large multi-function digital display (single or triple-window, depending on model), which displays information such as radio station display, PRND321 gear selected indicator, trip computer with stopwatch function, service reminders and a help facility.|$|E

50|$|Compatibility {{problems}} have been experienced when mounting lenses with aperture <b>transmission</b> <b>levers</b> (e.g., SMC Takumars) on older bodies such as Zenit-E or Mamiya DTL. The aperture lug or a pin can interlock with the screwheads affixing the mount, which then impedes lens removal.|$|R
25|$|The direct-shift gearbox uses a {{floor-mounted}} <b>transmission</b> shift <b>lever,</b> {{very similar}} to that of a conventional automatic <b>transmission.</b> The <b>lever</b> is operated in a straight 'fore and aft' plane (without any 'dog-leg' offset movements), and uses an additional button to help prevent an inadvertent selection of an inappropriate shift lever position.|$|R
50|$|The Airflytes also {{featured}} fully reclining seats {{that could turn}} the car into a vehicle capable of sleeping three adults, however this would also earn the dubious {{distinction of being the}} make-out automobile of choice for teenagers coming of age in the 1950s. The 1950 Ambassador became the first non-General Motors automobiles to be equipped with GM's Hydramatic automatic transmissions (cars with the automatic transmission has Selecto-lift starting, where the diver pulled the <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> on the column toward themselves to engage the starter). 1949 was the first year for a one-piece curved windshield, and front door wing windows featured curved glass as well.|$|E
5000|$|The first-generation Hydramatic (not the {{controlled}} coupling version that succeeded it in 1956) {{did not have}} a separate park position as found in modern automatic transmissions. The driver had to shut off the engine and then place the transmission in reverse in order to lock the driveline to prevent the car from moving. Also, the original Hydramatic required periodic band adjustments as a routine maintenance item that later versions did not. Early 1940 model Oldsmobiles with Hydra-Matic Drive could be started with the transmission selector lever in any position. The car would then start to move, unless the <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> had been left in N, neutral.|$|E
5000|$|The four speed automatic, six speed ETG and {{six-speed}} {{automatic transmissions}} have two shifting options chosen by a column mounted mode selector: either the paddle shifted manual mode or the fully automated/automatic mode with manual override with Formula One styled paddles. The ETG/automatic gearbox also {{brings with it}} an optional air conditioned storage compartment (fridge) including can holders, between the drivers and the front passengers seat, where the manual <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> would usually be. The two litre , 1.6 litre e HDi/BlueHDi, and post 2015 petrol engines feature a start-stop system based on the Valeo i-StARS reversible starter/alternator, and termed e-HDi for diesel models and e-VTi for petrol models. Two [...] "ultracapacitors" [...] are charged during braking, and the energy stored in them is used to turn the i StARS when engine restart is required.|$|E

50|$|The 6.2 diesel {{was first}} {{available}} and stacked 4-headlights introduced, {{along with a}} revised grille. Base models continued with 2 headlights. All van models now have square headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission because the steering column was retilted {{to be similar to}} the C/K trucks and all manual <b>transmission</b> <b>levers</b> are now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission introduced.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976 the grille saw {{a new and}} finer crosshatching pattern. Cornering lamps got new {{horizontal}} {{chrome trim}} while tail lamps gained a new bold look. Eight different color accent stripes were available. Vinyl tops were now integral padded Elk grain material. New trims included sporty plaids, plush velours, knits and 11 distinctive genuine leathers. Coupe de Villes had a new vinyl roof whose top molding served as {{a continuation of the}} door [...] "belt" [...] molding. A Controlled (limited-slip) Differential was included for extra traction. An optional illuminated entry and theft deterrence system was optional. A new battery, called the Freedom battery, never needed water added. New turbine veined and wire wheel covers were offered. A new option locked the doors when the <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> was shifted to [...] "Drive". Cadillac also offered Track Master, a computerized skid prevention system that automatically pumped the back brakes in an emergency to shorten stopping distance. New options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio, loose pillow style seats for d'Elegance packages, plus power passenger and manual driver seatback recliners for 50/50 front seats. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year. New standard features included map light, Soft-Ray tinted glass, spare tire cover, washer fluid level indicator, and steel belted radial whitewall tires.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2004, VR {{models were}} discontinued, leaving the VR-X 2WD as the sporty {{model in the}} Magna range. A new VR-X AWD model was also {{announced}} at this time, going on sale 1 August (with the update for both models labelled MY04) but only offering 16-inch wheels {{as opposed to the}} 17-inch version fitted to the 2WD. VR-Xs were now distinguished by body coloured headlight bezels, a body coloured upper grille, silver mesh lower grille, a platinum coloured rear bumper insert (except for Platinum coloured cars, which received a Sable insert), and an extended chrome exhaust outlet. Mitsubishi also revised badging, with the [...] "AWD" [...] badge no longer on the front fender, and the [...] "Magna" [...] badge removed from the rear decklid. A [...] "VR-X" [...] badge is located on the right-hand side of the decklid, with an [...] "AWD" [...] badge situated on the left-hand side on AWD models. A [...] "QuadTec" [...] badge is located immediately underneath the [...] "AWD" [...] decklid badge, and an [...] "AWD" [...] decal is located on the lower rear doors of the all-wheel drive variants. Inside, a revised black cloth upholstery is standard, with black leather trim now extending to the steering wheel, <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> and handbrake. Colours were revised for the MY04 VR-Xs, with the release of Platinum metallic (replacing Pewter), Zen pearlescent (replacing Pacific Blue), and Fusion.|$|E

New options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year. The Series 75 remained the only American-built vehicle that was designed and built strictly as a limousine. Big 75s had two separate automatic climate control systems. Interior choices were Medici crushed velour fabric in black or dark blue, or Magnan Knit in light gray. Full-width folding seats held three extra passengers. Passengers could use the control panel to raise/lower windows, turn on reading lamps, operate radio, or (in limousines) raise/lower the central partition. There were large fixed quarter windows behind the rear doors. Electronic fuel injection was optional on the 500 cuin L OHV V8. A cross-grain padded vinyl roof was optional. Series 75 also had new graphite-treated rear brake linings, reinforced shoes, and Hydro-Boost power-brake booster. They also boasted four cigarette lighters rather than the usual two.|$|E

5000|$|Some light tanks {{such as the}} PT-76 are amphibious, {{typically}} being propelled in {{the water}} by hydrojets or by their tracks. In 1969, the U.S. Army rushed the new M551 Sheridan to Vietnam. This 17 ton light tank was built with an aluminium hull, steel turret and gun (although the 152 mm gun was called a [...] "launcher" [...] at the time), and could swim across bodies of water. The M551 upon arrival in Vietnam began replacing the M48A3 Patton in all cavalry squadrons, leaving only the M48A3 in the U.S. Army's three armored battalions in Vietnam, the 1/77th, 1/69th, and the 2/34th Armor. The Sheridan needed no modifications for river crossings, crewmen simply raised the cloth sides that were tucked inside rubber tubes along the hull's upper edges, raised the driver's front shield which had an acrylic glass window, the driver turned on his bilge pumps, shifted his <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> to water operations and the Sheridan entered the water. For newly arrived Sheridans, this might work as engineered. For [...] "war weary" [...] M551s, the driver's window was often [...] "yellowed" [...] and/or cracked as to obscure his vision, and the rubber tubes that contained the rolled up side sleeves were often cracked and/or frozen into place. The Sheridan could still cross a body of water, but like its swimming cousin, the M113 APC (Armoured Personnel Carrier, also built of aluminium) the river had to be narrow, less than 100 yd. In all cases, the bilge pumps had to be working properly, and even then {{by the time the}} Sheridan or the APC reached the other side, water would often fill the insides up to their armoured roofs, spilling through the hatches' cracks and emptying onto the earth once safely ashore. Often a fold down trim vane is erected to stop water washing over the bow of the tank and thus reducing the risk of the vehicle being swamped via the driver's hatch.|$|E
40|$|Dissertation "The Origins of the Mass Consumption Society in Czechoslovakia 1945 - 1970. Trade, Consumption and Advertising" {{deals with}} the process of {{establishing}} consumption as a new category of human life in the communist dictatorship in Czechoslovakia. Through the analysis of the discourse the author shows how a network of specialized institutions and professionals producing thinking about consumption emerged in the milieu of the Ministry of Internal Trade. This network manifested itself in the planning of the trade infrastructure and in the adoption of a more subtle approach to the problem of consumption in an effort to maintain the legitimacy of the communist rule. The commerce as a sphere of economy was in the communist discourse initially reduced to the <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> between production and the consumer. This perception was accompanied by the pursuit of the social justice through the transformation of the consumer's experience, underpinned by a strong moral appeal. The key tools used in this process were the democratization of the access to the goods, the attempts to adapt the services to broad sections of the society, the chance given to the consumers to raise their own demands and also the "new language" of the trade practices. Political thaw after Stalin's death led to the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{functional}} approach to optimal dimensioning of automotive transmission shafts. In particular, the paper summarizes {{the results of a}} research activity developed on automotive transmission shafts to reduce the unpleasant movement of the <b>transmission</b> <b>lever</b> known as “shift lever movement”. The design problem was faced by focusing the axial clearances of the wheels assembled on the transmission shaft. First, the functional approach to optimal dimensioning proceeds from the study of different working conditions of the automotive manual transmission and focuses on corresponding geometrical constraints and design parameters. Then, it uses simplified schemes, each of them related to a different working condition, to set a series of functional dimensioning loops for the transmission shaft. Subsequently, the approach introduces an appropriate index to evaluate the Information Content for each dimensioning scheme and it addresses the optimal dimensioning scheme, related to the minimization of the Information Content. After this, the approach foresees worst-case to check the axial clearances of the wheels assembled on the shaft. In a such way the effect of the dimensioning are directly evaluated in terms of performances of the transmission. In fact, the reduction of axial clearances for the wheels assembled on the shaft causes a direct reduction of the “shift lever movement”. The functional approach to optimal dimensioning is applied to an automotive transmission set and the proposed dimensioning schema of the shaft is compared with different dimensioning schemes including one currently used in an international automotive company. A final discussion of the results, in terms of reduction of axial clearances of the parts assembled on the shaft, is provided...|$|E

50|$|A {{parking pawl}} is a device fitted to a motor vehicle's {{automatic}} transmission {{in order for}} it to lock up the transmission. It is engaged when the <b>transmission</b> shift <b>lever</b> selector {{is placed in the}} Park position, which is always the first position (topmost on a column shift, frontmost on a floor shift) in all cars sold in the United States since 1965 (when the order was standardised by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)) through SAE J915, and in most other vehicles worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Electrohydraulic manual {{transmission}} {{is a type}} of semi-automatic transmission system, which uses an automated clutch unlike conventional {{manual transmission}}s where the driver operates the clutch. The clutch is controlled by electronic computers and hydraulics. To change gears, the driver selects the desired gear with the <b>transmission</b> shift <b>lever,</b> and the system automatically operates the clutch and throttle to match revs and engage the clutch again. Also, many such transmissions operate in sequential mode where the driver can only upshift or downshift by one gear at a time.|$|R
5000|$|A {{driving mode}} {{selector}} knob has been installed as standard equipment on all models, situated below the <b>transmission</b> gear <b>lever</b> {{and between the}} heated and ventilated front seat controls, providing four selections labeled [...] "Standard", [...] "Sport", [...] "Eco", and [...] "Snow", allowing the 7-speed transmission, engine and various systems to optimize driving based on varying conditions. To minimize exhaust noise intrusion into the passenger compartment from the engine at low rpms, [...] "Active Noise Control" [...] has been installed. Double-piston shock absorbers, developed by Kayaba Industry Company, have replaced the ones previously supplied by Hitachi.|$|R
50|$|The VTM-4 Lock mode can be {{activated}} only at speeds less than 18 mph in 1st, 2nd, or Reverse Gear positions. Note, when the <b>transmission</b> shift <b>lever</b> {{is placed in}} 2nd gear, it forces the vehicle into a 2nd gear start condition. This is only desirable on slippery surfaces such as ice or packed snow. To apply the maximum torque to the wheels for climbing a grade or to become un-stuck, you should always use the 1st gear position. Lugging the engine with the transmission in 2nd gear from a stop, may overheat the transmission and limit your ability to climb a steep hill or overcome a difficult traction condition.|$|R

5|$|Toyota Australia {{planned to}} sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the {{majority}} of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance mufflers, 19-inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric bolsters and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse parking sensors, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded <b>transmission</b> selection <b>lever,</b> and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium rear bumper reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices supercharger.

5000|$|In a Simpson gearset, {{common to}} many automatics, this {{happens on the}} 1-2 shift, and reverses on the 2-1 downshift. The 2-3 shift is done by {{engaging}} a single clutch, and nothing is released. Some newer electronically controlled transmissions make [...] "clutch to clutch" [...] shifts, without any sprags. This {{can also be used}} exclusively in first gear (<b>transmission</b> shift <b>lever</b> in D, but auto valve body or management selecting 1st) on some autos. That way it will automatically provide forward drive, but will not provide any engine braking. This is done not so much to avoid engine braking per se, but rather to allow a low throttle opening 2-1 downshift as a car decelerates, to avoid a loud (and potentially abrupt) and unnerving jolt {{as a result of the}} downshift. On transmissions so equipped, manual selection of 1st gear typically engages an additional band that grips the same section as the one way clutch would engage, and thus allows for engine braking.|$|R
