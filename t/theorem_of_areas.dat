Additionally, we give a generalized version <b>of</b> an adiabatic <b>theorem</b> <b>of</b> higher order due to Nenciu. In all these adiabatic theorems the considered spectral values need not lie on the imaginary axis and in the adiabatic theorems with spectral gap condition and the adiabatic <b>theorem</b> <b>of</b> higher order compact subsets of the spectrum are sufficient (in particular, these subsets need not consist of eigenvalues). We explore {{the strength of the}} presented adiabatic theorems in numerous examples.

The term `dark energy' {{is meant to}} cover {{a wide range of}} field theory models, as well as perfect fluids with various equations of state, including cosmological dark energy. Various accretion models are analyzed in terms of the simplest test field approximation or by allowing back reaction on the black-hole metric. The behavior of various types of dark energy in the vicinity of Schwarzschild and electrically charged black holes is examined. Nontrivial effects due to the presence of dark energy in the black hole vicinity are discussed.
