25|$|A stepstone was {{the kitchen}} {{designed}} in Frankfurt by Margarethe Schütte-Lihotzky. Working class women frequently worked in factories {{to ensure the}} family's survival, as the men's wages often did not suffice. Social housing projects led to the next milestone: the Frankfurt Kitchen. Developed in 1926, <b>this</b> <b>kitchen</b> measured 1.9m by 3.4m (approximately 6ft 2in by 11ft 2in, with a standard layout). It was built for two purposes: to optimize kitchen work to reduce cooking time and {{lower the cost of}} building decently equipped kitchens. The design, created by Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, was the result of detailed time-motion studies and interviews with future tenants to identify what they needed from their kitchens. Schütte-Lihotzky's fitted kitchen was built in some 10,000 apartments in the housing projects erected in Frankfurt in the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Despite her largely demure {{public persona}} as a {{traditional}} wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, [...] "I think we've had enough of <b>this</b> <b>kitchen</b> thing, don't you?" [...] Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that [...] "women can {{play a vital role}} in world affairs" [...] while still retaining a [...] "feminine manner." [...] Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them, though, one student told the press that [...] "she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised." [...] Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.|$|E
500|$|Yusef is {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef {{is introduced}} to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood [...] "explodes" [...] with anger at the sight of him, recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: [...] "we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it {{from his point of view}} that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I know is that I went back to get her and she had been locked in <b>this</b> <b>kitchen</b> and it was on fire'." [...] Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would [...] "see from there". He made his first appearance on 23November2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play." ...|$|E

Beginning with In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs, the Childs' home kitchen in Cambridge was fully transformed into a functional set, with TV-quality lighting, three cameras positioned to catch all angles in the room, and a massive center island with a gas stovetop on one side and an electric stovetop on the other, but leaving the rest of the Childs' appliances alone, including [...] "my wall oven with its squeaking door."
