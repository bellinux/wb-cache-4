25|$|Powell {{decided to}} return to Surratt's {{boarding}} house to seek help. His clothes were somewhat bloody from the attack at Seward's home, and he'd dropped his hat at the Seward home. During much of the Victorian era, it was considered unseemly for any man (even a menial laborer) to be seen in public without a hat, and Powell would have been viewed with suspicion had he tried to enter the city without one. Ripping the sleeve from his undershirt, Powell placed the sleeve on his head in the hope that people would <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> stocking cap. To complete his disguise as a common laborer, he then stole a pickaxe from a farmyard. Powell then headed for Surratt's.|$|E

500|$|The band {{decided to}} forgo working with Butch Vig, who had {{produced}} the group's previous albums, and selected Flood and Alan Moulder as co-producers.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} called Red Dragon, like the novel. Michael Mann, who called the new title [...] "inferior", said that producer Dino De Laurentiis made the change after Michael Cimino's film Year of the Dragon, produced by De Laurentiis, bombed at the box office in 1985. William Petersen has commented that another reason for the change was to avoid any suggestion that it might be a karate movie. [...] "At the time, Bruce Lee was knocking out Dragon movies, and Dino, in his wisdom, decided people would <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kung-fu movie", he later recalled. Brian Cox, who played jailed killer Hannibal Lecktor, has also expressed disdain for the film's title, calling it [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "cheesy".|$|E
500|$|The band Them {{was signed}} by Phil Solomon, who {{contracted}} producer Bert Berns {{to work with the}} group, and Phil Coulter came on as a musical arranger and lyricist. The group became popular with songs including [...] "Baby Please Don't Go", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Here Comes the Night". Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> joke. Then we were on it ourselves. It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that sort of thing.

500|$|... "A Quiet Night In" [...] was {{submitted}} to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), but was not nominated for a 2015 BAFTA award. In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I did <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> shame that it's not been recognised.

500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask {{scared the hell out of}} me only because I thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E
500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked.

[...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that.

500|$|The {{end of the}} storyline was criticised by gay advocates after Charlie {{was seen}} having sex with Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) and Joey left Summer Bay alone.

Anderson later acknowledged she had feared that the story would see her typecast as [...] "the lesbian cop." [...] Anderson reflected on the storyline during an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying [...] "The Charlie/Joey (lesbian) storyline was the first time you got to see Charlie's vulnerable side.

[...] Bottas took a different viewpoint, saying: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> racing incident.

500|$|The {{captured}} militants {{were initially}} {{taken to a}} jail in Prizren, and later transported to a military prison in Niš. On January 8, 1999, the KLA ambushed a convoy carrying rations to VJ personnel in Kosovska Mitrovica, taking eight Yugoslav soldiers hostage. U.S. officials negotiated the soldiers' release five days later. In return, on January 23, Yugoslav authorities freed the nine militants. Almost simultaneously, the KLA released five elderly Serb civilians that it had taken hostage two days earlier. Yugoslav officials insisted that the two events were not linked. The KLA's taking of civilian hostages drew condemnation from Western diplomats, including {{the head of the}} KVM, William Walker, who told reporters: [...] "...I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very unwise and uncivilized thing for them to do to kidnap civilians."

500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The List" [...] premiered on the Fox {{network in}} the United States on October 20, 1995.

It was watched {{by a total of}} 16.72 million viewers, and was later nominated for several International Monitor Awards, including nominations for best director, best editing, and best color correction. [...] "The List" [...] later won the award for best director. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode, [...] "I think this is a vastly underrated episode. I also <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very brave and different show to do and that it will weather the test of time very well. I think it was brave because {{there is not a single}} likable character - nobody you can root for.

It's a difficult song. You need a really big voice to be able to perform that song. I was like, 'Whoa!' She obviously has an amazing voice, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really interesting exercise for her and for me." [...] Guetta further explained that when he collaborates with artists, he likes to [...] "take them out of their boxes", and creating a dance record with Hudson was [...] "really exciting" [...] for him.
