5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|Their ratting {{talent and}} unique bond was seized {{upon by the}} city's press. Martin's saloon was a {{favorite}} haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, with the dogs a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the Californian, Daily Alta California, Daily Morning Call, and Daily Evening Bulletin, the editors vying {{with each other in}} their attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. Bummer was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the mongrel, was cast {{in the role of the}} sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When Bummer was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: Bummer was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> the sting of ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when Bummer recovered only added to the excitement.|$|E
500|$|After {{about three}} days, he seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> better; his blood work became normal and his {{diarrhea}} cleared up, {{but he still}} had low-grade fevers. Against the odds, his hoof X-rays came back showing no separation of the laminae, and no rotation or sinking of the coffin bone in any of his feet. [...] Although the cryotherapy had not prevented laminitis, it might have kept it from becoming worse. On September 21, the casts were removed from his legs. [...] The laminitis treatment was successful and his feet were returning to normal, raising hopes that he could race again some day.|$|E

In {{order to get a}} shot of Pam and Jim looking into the camera, Greg Daniels restaged the scene four years after [...] "Niagara" [...] had been filmed. Daniels noted, [...] "To get Jim and Pam's eye line right for the camera, I stepped in as the minister [...] so they were both looking at me with the full actor-power of all the emotions they were supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> at their own wedding, just blasting in my face.

500|$|In November 2007, the {{character}} {{was diagnosed with}} Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although he had been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> sickly in the show for some time, he was wary of being tested. Even when forced into it by friend and colleague Maddy Young, he initially refused to so much as look at his results. Chambers explained: [...] "It's serious, but Sam's playing it down. Of course he's scared but he deals with it by just wanting to laugh it off and make jokes about it". He speculated that the experience would force Sam {{to grow up and}} appreciate life more, as well as seriously consider the future of his daughter, Grace, and cease his philandering way with female staff. Chambers has also spoken extensively about the research he did before beginning the cancer storyline: ...|$|E
500|$|Besides Morrison, {{there is}} {{conflicting}} information about {{who participated in}} the session. In addition to the group's original members (guitarist Billy Harrison, bassist Alan Henderson, drummer Ronnie Millings, and keyboard player Eric Wrixon), others have been suggested: Pat McAuley on keyboards, Bobby Graham on a second drum kit, Jimmy Page on second guitar, and Peter Bardens on keyboards. As Page biographer George Case notes, [...] "There is a dispute over whether it is Page's piercing blues line that defines the song, if he only played a run Harrison had already devised, or if Page only backed up Harrison himself". Morrison has acknowledged Page's participation in the early sessions: [...] "He played rhythm guitar on one thing and doubled a bass riff on the other" [...] and Morrison biographer Johnny Rogan notes that Page [...] "doubled the distinctive riff already worked out by Billy Harrison". Music critic Greil Marcus comments that during the song's quieter middle passage [...] "the guitarist, session player Jimmy Page or not, seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> his way into another song, flipping half-riffs, high, random, distracted metal shavings". Them's blues-rock arrangement is [...] "now regarded justly as definitive", with [...] "much of its appeal emanat from the tingling lead guitar section", according to music writer Adam Clayson.|$|E

2500|$|Virtually all {{actors who}} worked with Ozu—including Chishu Ryu, who collaborated with the {{director}} on almost all his films—agree {{that he was an}} extremely demanding taskmaster. He would direct very simple actions by the performer [...] "to the centimeter." [...] As opposed to those of both Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ozu's characters, according to Sato, are [...] "usually calm... they not only move at the same pace but also speak at the same measured rate." [...] He insisted that his actors express emotions through action, even rote action, rather than by directly expressing their innermost feelings. Once, when the distinguished character actress Haruko Sugimura asked the director what her character was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>feeling</b> at a given moment, Ozu responded, “You are not supposed to feel, you are supposed to do.” ...|$|E
