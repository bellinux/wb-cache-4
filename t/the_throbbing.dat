500|$|Starky's {{received}} a generally positive reception and was most {{known for its}} Bloody Marys, brunch, and outdoor seating.

Word on the street is that they make a killer Bloody Mary and have a yummy brunch menu. They're old school and have been in Portland since 1984. Check it out {{if you want to get}} away from <b>the</b> <b>throbbing,</b> meat-market discos." [...] In 2014, GoLocalPDX contributor Byron Beck included Starky's in his list of the [...] "Top 12 Gay Clubs in Portland", writing: [...] "Starky's is for those who remember that brunch is best served on Sunday with a Bloody Mary. This true original is more restaurant than bar but that doesn't stop people from coming here for some of the stiffest drinks in town." [...] In 2015, Willamette Week contributors included Starky's in their list of favorite Portland gay bars.|$|E
500|$|The band {{received}} acclaim for {{the quality}} of their songwriting. Fred Thomas of AllMusic complimented them for disposing of the introspective material which appeared on prior albums and choosing to [...] "accentuate all <b>the</b> <b>throbbing</b> rhythms, metallic guitars and bilious disgust that defined the band's best work." [...] He went on to suggest that Born Villain could pave the way for future releases. Reviewing for Classic Rock, Mick Farren – who was cynical of the hype the album was receiving – said [...] "to my delight as a closet fan, Born Villain turns out to be little short of excellent", praising its emphasis on [...] "bone-crunching rhythm". A review for Blabbermouth said that several tracks were likely to be considered classics among the band's discography. The Ottawa Sun complimented the album's lyrical themes, saying that it saw Manson [...] " [...] like the slasher-flick antihero he deserves to be." [...] Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy praised the album for being more fun than previous work, while Gary Graff from Billboard applauded it for containing a wide variety of moods and styles.|$|E

500|$|Noé {{initially}} {{asked the}} Daft Punk member Thomas Bangalter, who had composed {{the music for}} Irréversible, to create an original soundtrack for Enter the Void. Bangalter was occupied with work on [...] and had to decline. As a compromise, he provided Noé with an arrangement of ambient sounds and samples from existing experimental music, from which Noé compiled what he envisioned as [...] "a maelstrom of sounds." [...] Bangalter is billed in the credits as sound effects director, and the film features his track [...] "Désaccords" [...] originally composed for Irréversible. One {{of the sources of}} inspiration for the soundtrack was [...] "Revolution 9" [...] by The Beatles, a sound collage which Noé describes as a work [...] "where you catch the beginning of a note, or of a melody and then it's already somewhere else." [...] The two main musical themes of the film are [...] "Freak" [...] by the British electro artist LFO, which is played during the opening credits, and a recording by Delia Derbyshire of Johann Sebastian Bach's [...] "Air on the G String", which serves as the theme for Oscar's childhood and his relationship with Linda. The beginning of [...] "ANS" [...] by the British band Coil is heard during Oscar's first DMT trip. <b>The</b> <b>Throbbing</b> Gristle song [...] "Hamburger Lady" [...] plays as Oscar tries to deliver drugs to Victor at the bar. The soundtrack notably includes excerpts from nearly every part of Jean-Claude Éloy's two compositions, Shânti and Gaku-no-Michi. Other songs on the soundtrack include Toshiya Tsunoda's [...] "Music for Baby", Alvin Lucier's [...] "Music for Gamelan Instruments, Microphones, Amplifiers and Loudspeakers", and works by Denis Smalley, Lullatone, and Zbigniew Karkowski.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{who believed that}} it would have been a stronger choice as the lead single from MDNA. In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from Attitude magazine praised the track, writing: [...] "It may sound trite but there's urgency in its simplicity. It transforms into the album's most pounding moment, reaching a climax that threatens to blow the speakers." [...] Todd added that although some listeners might find the track [...] "generic", the song has characteristic elements of a Madonna release, and would be embraced by fans as a [...] "dancefloor filler that will shake the clubs and would happily find a slot on the next series of Glee." [...] Mitchell called it [...] "a big, anthemic dance-pop wonder with glittery synths and fun lyrics." [...] He also referred to the song as [...] "the best thing [...] done since 'Hung Up'", and the most [...] "mass accessible" [...] track on MDNA. Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice shared Mitchell's sentiments, adding that although it has cliche lyric, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] was comparable to Madonna's work during her Ray of Light era (1998), and had Daft Punk influenced bits in it. Enio Chiola from PopMatters found the song to be [...] "complimenting" [...] the darker and edgier tracks on MDNA, but concluded that such tracks were few on the album. Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot found the song to be the one excelling in the first half of MDNA. According to Melinda Newman of HitFix, the song is a [...] "sweet, Bangles-like, slab of ear pop candy that recalls [...] earliest singles, 'Holiday' and 'Borderline'." [...] Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald called it a [...] "compelling piece of hands-in-the-air dance" [...] song, but wished Madonna would have included more of such tracks in MDNA. Michael Cragg from The Guardian appreciated the opening composition of the song, describing it as [...] "a timely breather from <b>the</b> <b>throbbing</b> bass and feels more carefree and instinctive than what has gone before".|$|E
2500|$|A similar {{performance}} {{was done at}} Brixton Academy; Madonna wore a different T-shirt, with her son Rocco and daughter Lourdes' names printed on it. Jennifer Vineyard from Rolling Stone felt that [...] "She seemed too happy to harp on anything, grinning madly as she shimmied and shook her hips to <b>the</b> <b>throbbing</b> bass and pounding beats", while Miranda Sawyer from The Guardian {{thought that it was}} the best performance from the concert. Around 3,000fans attended the concert in London, which was streamed over the internet. More than nine million people watched the concert according to Nicky Price, a representative for Microsoft's MSN, the webcast's producer. It became the most-viewed webcast of all time, beating Paul McCartney's performance of [...] "50s rock and roll classics" [...] at Liverpool's The Cavern Club in December 1999, which was viewed by an audience of about three million.|$|E

2500|$|... "The [...] DJ {{was central}} to the ritual of 1970's dance culture, but the dancing crowd was no less important, {{and it was the}} {{combination}} of these two elements that created the conditions for the dance floor dynamic." [...] In disco parties and clubs, a [...] "...good DJ didn't only lead dancers... but would also feel the mood of the dance floor and select records according to this energy (which could be communicated by the vigor of the dancing, or level of the crowd's screams, or sign language of dancers directed towards the booth)." [...] Disco-era DJs would often remix (re-edit) existing songs using reel-to-reel tape machines, and add in percussion breaks, new sections, and new sounds. DJs would select songs and grooves according to what the dancers wanted, transitioning from one song to another with a DJ mixer and using a microphone to introduce songs and speak to the audiences. Other equipment was added to the basic DJ setup, providing unique sound manipulations, such as reverb, equalization, and echo effects unit. Using this equipment, a DJ could do effects such as cutting out all but <b>the</b> <b>throbbing</b> bassline of a song, and then slowly mixing in the beginning of another song using the DJ mixer's crossfader.|$|E
