5|$|Substance Dualism is {{a common}} feature of several {{orthodox}} Hindu schools including the Sāṅkhya, Nyāya, Yoga and Dvaita Vedanta. In <b>these</b> <b>schools</b> a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal and undergoes samsara, a cycle of death and rebirth. The Nyāya school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self, the atman. Many of <b>these</b> <b>schools</b> see their spiritual goal as moksha, liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} {{that the government should}} not be held accountable for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. <b>These</b> <b>schools</b> were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because <b>these</b> <b>schools</b> were not created {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007.

5|$|Four {{other species}} of hammerhead sharks overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and bonnethead, and the large-sized {{scalloped}} hammerhead and great hammerhead. Little competition occurs between these species because of their differing habitats and dietary preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits the utility of vision (hence its smaller eyes). Adult males and juveniles of both sexes form schools of uniform body size; <b>these</b> <b>schools</b> {{do not appear to}} relate to reproduction or migration. Adult females are apparently solitary.|$|E

5|$|In the Roman Republic of the 1st century, gladiatorial {{games were}} one of the more popular forms of entertainment.

In 73 BC, a group of some 200 gladiators in the Capuan school owned by Lentulus Batiatus plotted an escape.

5|$|Off Enewetak, grey reef sharks exhibit {{different}} social behaviors on {{different parts of}} the reef. Sharks tend to be solitary on shallower reefs and pinnacles. Near reef drop-offs, loose aggregations of five to 20 sharks form in the morning and grow in number throughout the day before dispersing at night. In level areas, sharks form polarized schools (all swimming in the same direction) of around 30 individuals near the sea bottom, arranging themselves parallel to each other or slowly swimming in circles. Most individuals within polarized schools are females, and the formation of <b>these</b> <b>schools</b> has been theorized to relate to mating or pupping.|$|E
