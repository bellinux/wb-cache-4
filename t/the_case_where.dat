5|$|The {{break-up}} {{velocity of}} a star is an expression {{that is used to}} describe <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> the centrifugal force at the equator is equal to the gravitational force. For a star to be stable the rotational velocity must be below this value.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends {{only of the}} distance of the point from S.

60|$|Generalizing the result, we may {{say that}} if A occurs in a larger {{proportion}} of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>where</b> B is than of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>where</b> B is not, then will B also occur in {{a larger proportion of}} <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>where</b> A is than of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>where</b> A is not; and there is some connection, through causation, between A and B. If we could ascend to the causes of the two phenomena, we should find, at some stage, either proximate or remote, some cause or causes common to both; and if we could ascertain what these are, we could frame a generalization which would be true without restriction of place or time; but until we can do so, the fact of a connection between the two phenomena remains an empirical law.|$|R

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on {{the formation energy of}} mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E
5|$|Noisy {{binary search}} {{algorithms}} solve <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> the algorithm cannot reliably compare {{elements of the}} array. For each pair of elements, {{there is a certain}} probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{establish}} {{the existence of}} conservative dilations for various types of dissipative non-commutative N-dimensional (N-D) systems. As a corollary, a criterion of existence of conservative dilations for corresponding dissipative commutative N-D systems is obtained.

5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity.

The duration of the 50fsw stop is 15 minutes for the Revision 6 tables. The chamber is then decompressed to 40fsw (12msw) for {{the next stage of}} up to 4 periods on oxygen. A stop may also be done at 30fsw (9msw), for further periods on oxygen according to the schedule. Air breaks of 5 minutes are taken {{at the end of each}} 30 minutes of oxygen breathing.|$|E
