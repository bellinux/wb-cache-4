5|$|A nearby {{mountain}} {{was named}} Jabal ad-Dik ("Mount of the Rooster") {{because of a}} traditional story.

5|$|Euchambersia is a genus of therocephalian therapsid <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> {{during the}} Late Permian, {{approximately}} 255 million years ago, {{in what is}} now South Africa. The genus contains a single species, E. mirabilis, named by paleontologist Robert Broom in 1931 from a skull missing the lower jaws; a second skull, belonging to an immature individual, was later described. It {{is a member of the}} family Akidnognathidae, which historically has also been referred by as the synonymous Euchambersiidae (named after Euchambersia).|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} and bred by zoos, {{but they are not}} a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet {{there is at least one}} example of a fisher kept in captivity <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E

50|$|The term aquatic can {{in theory}} {{be applied to}} animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in either fresh water (fresh water animals) or salt water (marine animals).

50|$|Different organisms {{have devised}} {{different}} strategies {{in order to}} control what goes {{in and out of the}} cell. Bacteria and eukaryotic cells contain phospholipid bilayers containing ester linkages, while archaea contain ether linkages. While these mechanisms work very well for organisms <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in mesophilic environments, they do not work for extremophiles. Mesophiles are organisms <b>that</b> <b>live</b> within relatively moderate temperatures (20-45 °C). They are organisms <b>that</b> <b>live</b> around sea level and can survive around the same temperatures as humans.|$|R

5|$|Nesomys narindaensis is an extinct rodent <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> {{in northwestern}} Madagascar.

The presence of N.narindaensis, a rare element in the local rodent fauna, suggests that the region was previously more humid.|$|E
5|$|Numbered Treaties {{were signed}} {{in the late}} 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> in the area.

The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given; this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims, many of which are still ongoing.|$|E
