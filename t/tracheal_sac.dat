40|$|KEY WORDS ears; scolopale; sound reception; chordotonal organ; tympanum; {{directional}} hearing ABSTRACT This paper {{provides an}} overview of insect peripheral auditory systems focusing on tympanate ears (pressure detectors) and emphasizing research during the last 15 years. The theme throughout is the evolution of hearing in insects. Ears have appeared independently no fewer than 19 times in the class Insecta and are located on various thoracic and abdominal body segments, on legs, on wings, and on mouth parts. All have fundamentally similar structures—a tympanum backed by a <b>tracheal</b> <b>sac</b> and a tympanal chordotonal organ—though they vary widely in size, ancillary structures, and number of chordotonal sensilla. Novel ears have recently been discovered in praying mantids, two families of beetles, and two families of flies. The tachinid flies are especially notable because they use a previously unknown mechanism for sound localization. Developmental and comparative studies have identified the evolutionary precursors of the tympanal chordotonal organs in several insects; they are uniformly chordotonal proprioceptors. Tympanate species fall into clusters determined by which of the embryologi-cally defined chordotonal organ groups in each body segment served as precursor for the tympanal organ. This suggests that the many appearances of hearing could arise from changes in a small number of developmental modules. The nature of those developmental changes that lead to...|$|E
25|$|The major tracheae are {{thickened}} spirally like {{a flexible}} vacuum hose {{to prevent them}} from collapsing and often swell into air sacs. Larger insects can augment the flow of air through their tracheal system, with body movement and rhythmic flattening of the <b>tracheal</b> air <b>sacs.</b> Spiracles are closed and opened by means of valves and can remain partly or completely closed for extended periods in some insects, which minimises water loss.|$|R
500|$|The {{abdominal}} <b>tracheal</b> air <b>sacs</b> {{surround the}} sound muscles and extend into the abdomen, acting as resonant chambers to amplify sound. The floury baker rapidly extends or raises its abdomen, thus modulating {{the influence of}} the air sacs on the sound to change its volume, pitch or tune during the introduction to the free song. This can be heard when a cicada is undisturbed in its natural environment, while male cicadas use these calls to attract females. The species is one of Australia's loudest cicadas and has been termed [...] "the best musician of them all".|$|R
40|$|Branching {{morphogenesis}} of the Drosophila tracheal system {{relies on}} the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathway. The Drosophila FGF ligand Branchless (Bnl) and the FGFR Breathless (Btl/FGFR) are required for cell migration during {{the establishment of the}} interconnected network of tracheal tubes. However, due to an important maternal contribution of members of the FGFR pathway in the oocyte, a thorough genetic dissection of the role of components of the FGFR signaling cascade in tracheal cell migration is impossible in the embryo. To bypass this shortcoming, we studied tracheal cell migration in the dorsal air sac primordium, a structure that forms during late larval development. Using a mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) clone approach in mosaic animals, combined with an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) -mutagenesis screen of the left arm of the second chromosome, we identified novel genes implicated in cell migration. We screened 1123 mutagenized lines and identified 47 lines displaying tracheal cell migration defects in the air sac primordium. Using complementation analyses based on lethality, mutations in 20 of these lines were genetically mapped to specific genomic areas. Three of the mutants were mapped to either the Mhc or the stam complementation groups. Further experiments confirmed that these genes are required for cell migration in the <b>tracheal</b> air <b>sac</b> primordium...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chitin and cuticle {{coatings}} {{are important}} to the environmental and immune defense of honey bees and insect pollinators. Pesticides or environmental effects may target the biochemistry of insect chitin and cuticle coating. Denaturing of chitin involves a combination of deacetylation, intercalation, oxidation, Schweiger-peeling, and the formation of amine hydrochloride salt. The term "denatured chitin" calls attention to structural and property changes to the internal membranes and external carapace of organisms so that some properties affecting biological activities are diminished. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A case study was performed on honey bees using silver staining and microscopic computer-tomographic x-ray radiography (micro-CT). Silver nitrate formed counter-ion complexes with labile ammonium cations and reacted with amine hydrochloride. Silver was concentrated in the peritrophic membrane, on the abdomen, in the glossa, at intersegmental joints (tarsi), at wing attachments, and in <b>tracheal</b> air <b>sacs.</b> Imaged mono-esters and fatty acids from cuticle coating on external surfaces were apparently reduced by an alcohol pretreatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The technique provides 3 -dimensional and sectional images of individual honey bees consistent with the chemistries of silver reaction and complex formation with denatured chitin. Environmental exposures and influences such as gaseous nitric oxide intercalant, trace oxidants such as ozone gas, oligosachharide salt conversion, exposure to acid rain, and chemical or biochemical denaturing by pesticides may be studied using this technique. Peritrophic membranes, which protect against food abrasion, microorganisms, and permit efficient digestion, were imaged. Apparent surface damage to the corneal lenses of compound eyes by dilute acid exposure consistent with chitin amine hydrochloride formation was imaged. The technique can contribute to existing insect pathology research, and may provide an additional tool for research on CCD...|$|R
40|$|The labial glands of saturniid moths are two {{exceedingly}} convoluted tubules, 100 - 150 mm. {{long and}} only 150 - 200 fi in diameter, {{located in the}} ventral part of the thorax (Edwards, 1964; Kafatos & Williams, 1964). The proximal ends of the two glands unite {{and open to the}} surface through a pore {{in the middle of the}} labium. Through this opening the insect releases a voluminous liquid at a precise time during ecdysis of the adult moth. In Antheraea pernyi and A. polyphemus the fluid not only serves as a solvent for the cocoon-opening enzyme, cocoonase, but also maintains an optimal pH for this enzyme's attack on the cocoon (Kafatos & Williams, 1964; Kafatos, Tartakoff & Law, 1967). Since the total amount of fluid greatly exceeds the volume of the glands, it must be swiftly elaborated from the haemolymph. The morphology of the labial glands (Kafatos, 1968; Kafatos & Feder, 1968) suggests that elaboration of the fluid is an active process. The wall of each tubule consists of approximately 1000 giant polyploid cells, all of the same type, arranged in a single cylindrical layer. The cells show a striking resemblance with those encountered in the renal tubules and salt glands of vertebrates and in other actively transporting tissues; they are characterized by extensive cellular plications, which greatly increase surface area and bring abundant mitochondria into intimate proximity to the plasma membrane (Sjostrand & Rhodin, 1953; Copeland, 1964; Anderson & Harvey, 1966). The gland as a whole is deeply enmeshed in a complex of tracheae and <b>tracheal</b> air <b>sacs,</b> each cell being provided with an unusually dense network of tracheolar ramifications. The present report provides physiological evidence that the labial gland is, in fact, engaged in an active process of salt secretion, possibly centred around the active accumulation of blood potassium through an exchange of potassium and hydrogen ions...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the de novo formation of a <b>tracheal</b> structure, air <b>sac</b> primordium (ASP), in the second thoracic tracheal metamere (Tr 2) during the 3 rd instar larval stage (L 3), challenged {{the assumption that the}} tracheal system established during embryogenesis would remain more or less unchanged until the onset of metamorphosis. ASP formation has since provided a novel system for studying cell behaviors such as cell migration. For ASP to form properly, it was then discovered, a process called “repopulation”, during which the composition of Tr 2 changes dramatically, from the initial 20 or so cells containing bigger nuclei at early L 3 to about 500 cells containing smaller nuclei at late L 3, had to take place. Two models were proposed to explain how repopulation could happen. In the “replacement” model, larval tracheal cells, presumed to be terminally differentiated, endo-replicated, and incapable of dividing, would get replaced by a distinct population of mitotically active cells, the so-called “tracheoblasts”. In the “de-differentiation” model, these presumably polyploid larval tracheal cells would somehow manage to re-enter mitosis, reduce their ploidy, and produce mitotically active offspring. Using ASP morphogenesis as a model system, we performed a clonal screen to find genes important for FGF-mediated cell migration. This screen identified two major groups of genes. One group is important for cell migration, such as myosin heavy chain (mhc) and signal transducing adaptor molecule (stam); the other group is necessary for cell division. To uncover the origin of mitotic cells repopulating Tr 2 during L 3, we designed an in vivo clonal analysis for cell-tracking. It turned out that the “de-differentiation” model contained more grains of truth. Tr 2 larval cells, possibly arrested in cell cycle prior to L 3, resume cell cycle progression during L 3 and give rise to mitotically competent progenies. To understand how mitotic behaviors of Tr 2 cells are regulated during L 3, a clonal analysis using flip-out clones was performed, which resulted in a descriptive report of the mitotic behaviors of Tr 2 tracheal cells during L 3. Although signals releasing Tr 2 cells from cell cycle arrest and/or maintaining their proliferative state remain currently elusive, our analysis provides an assay for testing candidates likely involved. Some other interesting findings have also been revealed by this analysis, such as the existence of “regionalization” between different Tr 2 branches and “cell replenishment” during ASP growth. It has gradually become clear that Drosophila tracheal system, an old model for studying tubulogenesis, proves to be a new tool for generating insights into fundamental questions such as how hox genes function, how cell cycles are developmentally controlled, how signaling pathways can be functionally dissected, and how variegated behaviors cells employ for the purpose of constructing a functional organ. ...|$|R
