25|$|If so, {{then we must}} plan our eugenic policy {{along some}} such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, {{allegedly}} less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods must be taught them; they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest {{the removal of the}} last check on natural selection should make it <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> children to be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, much of our eugenic programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.|$|E
25|$|On September 6, 2006, News Feed was announced, {{which appears}} on every user's {{homepage}} and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends. This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays {{to attract attention}} to their profile or cause. Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users). In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users {{have been able to}} control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.|$|E

25|$|Multiplayer {{is present}} in Bloodborne as well, though it {{functions}} differently from its counterparts in the Souls series. By activating a non-consumable item {{at the cost of}} one Insight point, players can summon other players into their world to help with boss battles or large groups of enemies, and progress through areas of the game cooperatively. This leaves the player vulnerable to invasions, in which another player may invade the victim's game world and attempt to kill them, unless the player can find and defeat a specific enemy before an enemy player invades. Multiplayer summons are limited by proximity; players can only be summoned within a specific distance of each other to prevent players being summoned too far away to be of any assistance. Players can only summon other players that are around the same level as them to prevent the game from being too difficult, or <b>too</b> <b>easy,</b> <b>for</b> one of the players. What Covenant a player is a part of affects multiplayer as well. Players can summon an NPC to help them in addition to getting help from other players. The NPC serves as an AI companion to the player, that helps defeat enemies. Players can only summon specific NPCs that they have met throughout their journey. Another way players may interact with each other is by leaving notes. A player may leave a tip for defeating a boss, tell the reader where to go, fool the reader by purposely providing incorrect information, or just leave a meaningless message to others. Players may rate a message as 'Fine' or 'Foul', which will indicate to future readers whether the note is useful or untrustworthy.|$|E
500|$|The game is {{intended}} to make the player feel [...] "small" [...] and {{to give them a}} sense of awe about their surroundings. The basic idea for the game, as designed by Chen, was to create a game that moved beyond the [...] "typical defeat/kill/win mentality" [...] of most video games. The team initially created a prototype named Dragon that involved players trying to draw away a large monster from other players, but eventually discarded it after finding it was <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> players to ignore each other in favor of their own objectives.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{are divided}} over the game's {{difficulty}} level and target audience. Some found the game <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> adult players. Nintendo World Report's Lasse Pallesen stated Over the Hedge is not engaging to adults or children due to [...] "the repetitive collect-a-thon {{nature of the}} game and the one-dimensional gameplay". GameZone's Louis Bedigian had similar reservations, [...] "Players young and old will be turned off by the lack of excitement". Other reviewers felt the game was suitable for children and adults. Cheat Code Central's Cole Smith stated [...] "It's not just for kids. It's loaded with variety and will engage your mind, not just your reflexes". Deeko's Pete Sellers found the game [...] "a well designed adventure that requires patience and planning".|$|E

Shea also included it on his list of the worst Virtual Console games, finding it difficult to imagine any reason why anyone would want to buy it. GameSpot's Frank Provo found that it became boring quickly, also criticizing the mathematics problems for being either <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> young children or too boring for older ones. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead commented that it gave him an [...] "ironic smile" [...] as a reminder of the NES era, though he could not justify paying five dollars for it.|$|E
500|$|For the episode, Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{was written}} off {{as a member of}} The X-Files office, since the next season would mark the creation of the [...] "new" [...] X-Files with Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish taking over for Duchovny and Anderson. Because of this change, Spotnitz called [...] "Alone" [...] the last of the [...] "old" [...] X-Files stand-alone episodes. As with many other episodes, Duchovny did not want his character to have all the answers, giving the reason that it looked <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> him. Duchovny and Spotnitz later had a long discussion on how to remove the scenes or tweak them. Unfortunately, because the episode was the last stand-alone episode to feature the character of Fox Mulder, Duchovny did not care as much as [...] "usual" [...] about creating a [...] "mystery" [...] for the episode.|$|E
500|$|A reclusive gifted {{musician}} and writer, Daniel changed his surname from Pinter to Brand, the maiden {{name of his}} maternal grandmother, before Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved; while according to Fraser, his father couldn't understand it, {{she says that she}} could: [...] "Pinter is such a distinctive name that he must have got tired of being asked, 'Any relation?

500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> him to escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario {{to see what would happen}} if the Doctor and the TARDIS got to talk together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} quarter alone, Strupper scored four touchdowns on runs of 20, 10, 60, and 45 yards. [...] Strupper chose to allow others {{to share in the}} scoring. With a 42–0 lead midway through {{the first quarter}}, Strupper broke clear and could have scored easily, but he {{intentionally}} grounded the ball at the one-yard line to allow Georgia Tech tackle J. Cantey Alexander to score the first touchdown of his career. [...] A teammate later recalled the play as follows:"Strupper swapped positions with Alexander... The team didn't want to make it <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> Cantey, though. The other boys wouldn't [...] block for him or help in any way. As soon as the ball was snapped, they ran away from the line and out of the play completely. Leaving poor Cantey to go it alone. Finally, on fourth down, a bruised and weary Alexander managed to get the ball across while his teammates howled with laughter." ...|$|E
500|$|A common {{point of}} {{criticism}} was the inventory system, which Sanchez called [...] "a pain". He frowned upon the player's need to retrieve objects from item boxes, and Mac Donald criticized {{the system for}} being unrealistic, as the boxes are [...] "" [...] interconnected and all items take {{the same amount of}} space when being carried, regardless of their size. Furthermore, Mallinson and Mac Donald disapproved of certain puzzles, which they believed were out of place in a police station setting. Sanchez thought that the puzzles were paced better than in the first game, but also found them less interesting and <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> experienced players. Sackenheim noted the game's brevity in his review, and remarked that the individual scenarios are not different enough to hold the interest of casual players {{until the end of the}} game. He found the controls to be [...] "easy to pick up and play", while Sanchez thought that aiming weapons was difficult. Certain reviewers panned the voice acting, calling it [...] "cheesy", [...] "terrible" [...] and [...] "barbaric".|$|E

500|$|New York Dolls {{was mixed}} {{in less than}} half a day. Rundgren felt the band seemed distracted and disinterested at that point, so he tried unsuccessfully to ban them from the mixing session. For the final mix, he {{minimized}} the sound of Nolan's drumming. In retrospect, Rundgren said the quality of the mix was poor because the band had hurried and questioned him while mixing the record: [...] "It's <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> it to become a free-for-all, with every musician only hearing their own part and not the whole. They all had other places to be, so rather than split, they rushed the thing and if that wasn't enough they took it to the crappy mastering lab that Mercury had put them in." [...] Thunders famously complained to a journalist that Rundgren [...] "fucked up the mix" [...] on New York Dolls, adding to stories that the two had clashed during the album's recording. Both Johansen and Scoppa later said they did not see any conflict between the two and that Thunders' typically foolish behavior was misinterpreted. Johansen later praised Rundgren for how he enhanced and equalized each instrument, giving listeners the impression that [...] " [...] in a room and there's a band playing", while Sylvain said his mix accurately captured how the band sounded live.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the game's Sega Saturn version, Kim Randell of Computer & Video Games noted its [...] "inferior graphics" [...] that do {{not have}} [...] "the sheen and {{glossiness}} of its PlayStation counterpart". Randell believed that it was a [...] "haphazard conversion" [...] that was made [...] "much too late". Erik Reppen of Game Informer wrote that it [...] "doesn't seem fair to compare" [...] the Nintendo 64 release to the PlayStation version, and he complained that car damage does not hinder performance. He said that it would more accurately be described as [...] "Destruction Derby Arcade". He found that the game was far <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> [...] "experienced racers and big fans of the franchise" [...] to enjoy, and finished, [...] "It was fun, but I wouldn't buy it." [...] Aaron Boulding of IGN believed that Destruction Derby 64 came too long after the original version, and that it was [...] "a shadow of the outdated PSX game". He complained about the [...] "bland backgrounds and flat textures" [...] and noted that the graphics are [...] "grainy" [...] and suffer from slowdown; but he enjoyed the car damage visuals. Boulding liked the split-screen multiplayer and called the new capture the flag mode the game's best aspect, but he concluded that [...] "even [...] may not make it worth a rental".|$|E
500|$|Among {{the many}} {{prominent}} biologists who began research on coevolution, Hermann Müller was {{particularly interested in}} the evolutionary sequence in which insects and flowers became adapted to each other. Like Darwin, he began with the premise that flowers were adapted to ensure cross-fertilisation, and added his own premise that most insects were not [...] "limited by hereditary instinct to particular flowers". On this basis, he developed the view that specialisation develops from the need for flowers to attract pollinating insects (without making access <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> non-pollinators), and from the evolution of pollinators to adapt to changes in the location of rewards such as nectar. He found that Alpine flowers tended to be visited by bees at lower altitudes, and by butterflies at higher altitudes, beginning research on the idea that plants at different altitudes were specialised for different pollinators. By comparing related plant species that he thought had diverged in form from a common ancestor, and testing whether they were visited by butterflies or bees, {{he was the first to}} use a combination of morphological and ecological approaches to understand patterns in the evolution of interactions and specialisation. His brother Fritz Müller used similar methods when studying mimicry in Brazil. The early development of ideas on specialisation and coevolution became increasingly focused on the problem of mimicry; Henry Walter Bates had initially raised this issue in a paper read to the Linnean Society of London in December 1861 in Darwin's presence, and published in November 1862.|$|E

25|$|Several size rollers {{have been}} used in the history of cricket, from light rollers that were used in the days of {{uncovered}} pitches and at some stages during the 1950s to make batting less easy, to the modern “heavy roller” universally used in top-class cricket today. Regulations permit a pitch only to be rolled at the commencement of each innings or day’s play, but this has still had a massive influence on the game by eliminating the shooters that were ubiquitous on all but light soils before heavy rollers were used. Heavy rollers have sometimes been criticised <b>for</b> making batting <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> and <b>for</b> reducing the rate at which pitches dry out after rain in the cool English climate.|$|R
500|$|The game's {{gameplay}} {{was positively}} reviewed, with Buchholtz describing {{it as one}} of the game's standout points It was described it as [...] "fun", [...] "excellent" [...] "exhilarating", [...] "enjoyable" [...] and [...] "quick", though Ogilvie, Paras and Dean Takahashi from VentureBeat considered it <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> players and become repetitive. Takahashi noted that the variety of time manipulation powers offered to players could be overwhelming, but as they progress, the experienced offered is satisfying. Loveridge further added that these powers were addictive. Tom Orry from VideoGamer.com applauded these powers for being [...] "cool" [...] to use, and Ben Reeves from Game Informer praised them for adding variety to the game. As powers can be combined to form a chain of attacks, the game was praised for giving players freedom to explore and experiment with them. Houghton complained that as most powers were available early on in the game, the development team missed the opportunity to fully [...] "evolve" [...] them. The cover system received negative opinions from critics, who complained that they sometimes got stuck in the cover during combat. Brown and Stephen Totilo from Kotaku thought that the gunplay system was not as refined as the powers, and that the weapons featured were [...] "generic". Many critics lamented that the final boss character is too hard to defeat, leading to players' frustration. The platforming section received mixed reviews. Orry and Arthur Gies from Polygon praised them for being [...] "cool" [...] to use and diluting the game's action, while Brown and Jeff Gerstmann from Giant Bomb described them as clumsy and ill-conceived due to the game's loose movement system.|$|E
