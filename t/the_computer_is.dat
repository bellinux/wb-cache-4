5|$|Furthermore, scans are {{no longer}} {{scheduled}} through the Windows Task Scheduler, but through the Symantec's proprietary one, which performs tasks while <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> idle (i.e., when the user is away from the computer).|$|E
5|$|Sleep-and-charge USB ports {{can be used}} {{to charge}} {{electronic}} devices even when <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> switched off. Normally, when a computer is powered off the USB ports are powered down, preventing phones and other devices from charging. Sleep-and-charge USB ports remain powered even when <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> off. On laptops, charging devices from the USB port when it is not being powered from AC drains the laptop battery faster; most laptops have a facility to stop charging if their own battery charge level gets too low. This feature has also been implemented on some laptop docking stations allowing device charging even when no laptop is present.|$|E

CFAS works in close collaboration with IT Schools Africa and <b>the</b> <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> refurbished by ITSA using volunteers who make sure that <b>the</b> <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> checked, parts are replaced if necessary and hard drives are wiped to UK Ministry of Defence standards. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> refurbished by prisoners in a range of prisons throughout England as part of rehabilitation training. Once in Africa, through agreement with Microsoft, Windows operating system and Office is installed.|$|R
50|$|Player {{perception}} {{can also}} affect {{the appearance of}} fairness. Sid Meier stated that he omitted multiplayer alliances in Civilization because he found that <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> {{almost as good as}} humans in exploiting them, which caused players to think that <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> cheating.|$|R
5|$|In PowerPC-based Macintoshes, {{the boot}} process {{starts with the}} {{activation}} of BootROM, the basic Macintosh ROM, which performs a Power On Self Test to test hardware essential to startup. On the passing of this test, the startup chime is played and control of <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> passed to OpenFirmware. OpenFirmware initializes the Random Access Memory, Memory Management Unit and hardware necessary for the ROM's operation. The OpenFirmware then checks settings, stored in NVRAM, and builds {{a list of all}} devices on a device tree by gathering their stored FCode information.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee—when the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E

25|$|In such analysis, a {{model of}} the {{computer}} for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> deterministic (given the computer's present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and sequential (it performs actions one after the other).|$|E
25|$|Arguably, {{there are}} many USB-based decorations {{embedded}} in existing productskeyboards with impractical backlighting (such as ones that only turn on while pressing a key, and ones that flash {{to the beat of}} a song), mice that (when <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> turned off) turn on/off their light to a pre-programmed beat, or printers that show random quotations on LCD screens when not in use.|$|E

25|$|Real-time protection, on-access scanning, {{background}} guard, resident shield, autoprotect, {{and other}} synonyms {{refer to the}} automatic protection provided by most antivirus, anti-spyware, and other anti-malware programs. This monitors computer systems for suspicious activity such as computer viruses, spyware, adware, and other malicious objects in 'real-time', in other words while data loaded into the computer's active memory: when inserting a CD, opening an email, or browsing the web, or when a file already on <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> opened or executed.|$|E
25|$|For {{computers}} {{set up to}} be bootable from a USB drive, it {{is possible}} to use a flash drive containing a bootable portable operating system to access the files of the computer, even if <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> password protected. The password can then be changed, or {{it may be possible to}} crack the password with a password cracking program and gain full control over the computer. Encrypting files provides considerable protection against this type of attack.|$|E

In practice, participating computers also donate some supporting amount of disk storage space, RAM, and network bandwidth, in addition to raw CPU power.|$|E
25|$|A for Andromeda is a British {{television}} {{science fiction}} drama serial first made and broadcast by the BBC in seven parts in 1961. Written by cosmologist Fred Hoyle, {{in conjunction with}} author and television producer John Elliot, it concerns {{a group of scientists}} who detect a radio signal from another galaxy that contains instructions for the design of an advanced computer. When <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> built, it gives the scientists instructions {{for the creation of a}} living organism named Andromeda, but one of the scientists, John Fleming, fears that Andromeda's purpose is to subjugate humanity.|$|E
25|$|The team at Thorness {{is joined}} by the {{biologist}} Madeline Dawnay (Mary Morris). <b>The</b> <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> outputting instructions {{for the creation of}} living cells. Fleming becomes nervous, worried that whatever life-form they are creating may not have humanity's best interests at heart. Dawney proceeds with the experiment, however, synthesising a primitive protoplasmic life-form. In the meantime, Bridger's leaking of Thorness' secrets has been discovered. Bridger is confronted by Ministry of Defence agent Judy Adamson (Patricia Kneale); fleeing he tumbles over a cliff to his death.|$|E
50|$|A severe {{problem with}} this setup was that the monitor could not be {{switched}} off completely while <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> powered on. <b>The</b> screen could be switched black but the cathode heater always remained on. This led to extreme screen dimming after some years of use, especially when <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> not turned off overnight as in a server setup or in a busy software lab.|$|R
