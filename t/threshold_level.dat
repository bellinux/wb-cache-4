40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} container inspec-tion at a port-of-entry. Containers are inspected through a specific sequence to detect the presence of nuclear materials, biological and chemical agents, and other illegal shipments. The <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> of sensors at inspection stations of the port-of-entry affect the prob-abilities of incorrectly accepting or rejecting a container. In this paper, we present several optimization approaches for determining the optimum sensor <b>threshold</b> <b>levels,</b> while considering misclassi-fication errors, total cost of inspection, and budget constraints. In contrast to previous work which determines <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> and sequence separately, we consider an integrated system and deter-mine them simultaneously. Examples applying the approaches in different sensor arrangements are demonstrated. Note to Practitioners—Increased emphasis on container inspec-tion at ports-of-entry prompted researchers to investigate method-ologies that help practitioners in operating such inspection sys-tems {{in order to reduce}} both the risk of accepting “undesired con-tainers ” as well as the cost of inspection. The <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> of the sensors can be adjusted by changing, for example, the power level of the X-ray machine or the count level of the sensors in order to make appropriate decisions. This paper provides methodolo-gies for determining the optimum <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> of sensors and order of inspection that minimize the overall cost of the system.

25|$|The formal psychometric {{measurement}} of creativity, {{from the standpoint}} of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association, which helped popularize the topic and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It {{should be noted that the}} London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination, but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a <b>threshold</b> <b>level</b> of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} even the US is still {{struggling}} to attain the income level necessary to prioritize certain environmental pollutants such as carbon emissions, which have yet to follow the EKC. With other pollutants however, like sulfur dioxide, production seems to coincide with a country's economic development and at a certain <b>threshold</b> <b>level</b> of income a mitigation of environmental damage occurs. This could be related rather than causal, because economic growth without institutional reform does not accomplish this environmental improvement. It appears that with GDP growth, government policies are strengthened and populations experience a rise in their demand for improved environmental quality. It may be the case, however, that regulation in relatively wealthy countries simply shifts the production and pollution to less-regulated, poorer countries; if this were true, the total size of the negative externalities of production remains the same or is larger, though in the wealthier country an EKC {{appears to have been}} obtained.|$|E
25|$|The OPO {{consists}} essentially of {{an optical}} resonator and a nonlinear optical crystal. The optical resonator serves to resonate {{at least one}} of signal and idler waves. In the nonlinear optical crystal, the pump, signal and idler waves overlap. The interaction between these three waves leads to amplitude gain for signal and idler waves (parametric amplification) and a corresponding deamplification of the pump wave. The gain allows the resonating wave(s) (signal or idler or both) to oscillate in the resonator, compensating the loss that the resonating wave(s) experience(s) at each round-trip. This loss includes the loss due to outcoupling by one of the resonator mirrors, which provides the desired output wave. Since the (relative) loss is independent of the pump power, but the gain is dependent on pump power, at low pump power there is insufficient gain to support oscillation. Only when the pump power reaches a particular <b>threshold</b> <b>level,</b> oscillation occurs. Above threshold, the gain depends also on the amplitude of the resonated wave. Thus, in steady-state operation, the amplitude of the resonated wave is determined by the condition that this gain equals the (constant) loss. The circulating amplitude increases with increasing pump power, and so does the output power.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{wastewater}} treatment {{in some cities}} and towns discharging wastewater into sensitive areas is another matter of concern. In January 2008 the European Commission sent France a final warning alerting it {{that it will be}} taken to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for the second time and possibly face fines unless it quickly brings its waste water treatment up to EU standards. France is not complying with the 1991 EU directive on urban waste water treatment. The deadline for treating all wastewater covered by the directive was 31 December 2000. In 2004 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) condemned France for failing to designate eleven areas as sensitive and for inadequate treatment facilities in a number of settlements which discharge their waste waters into these areas. The ECJ also found that 121 settlements breached the directive by discharging their waste waters into previously designated sensitive areas. In 2006 France designated the eleven areas as sensitive. However, 140 settlements – including the city of Paris – continue to discharge into these sensitive areas. With regard to the 121 settlements discharging into the previously designated sensitive areas France proceeded to rearrange them into 164 settlements, resulting in some settlements no longer meeting the <b>threshold</b> <b>level</b> of 10,000 residents at which the directive applies. The Commission considers such rearranging of settlements to avoid compliance with the directive unacceptable. In November 2009 it referred the matter to the ECJ.|$|E
25|$|In {{multicellular}} animals {{the same}} principle has been put {{in the service of}} gene cascades that control body-shape. Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of morphogen gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and diffuses through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain <b>threshold</b> <b>level.</b> These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other morphogens that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling controls embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through feedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make structural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the criticisms {{levelled}} against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting {{a wide range of}} social reforms during its time in office. Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, Neville Wran, John Dawkins, Bill Hayden and Paul Keating made a number of speeches throughout the 1980s arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist government, drawing attention to Hawke's achievements as Prime Minister during his first five years in office. As well as the reintroduction of Medibank, under the new name Medicare, these included the doubling of the number of childcare places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised homecare services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension, {{the development of a new}} youth support program, the reintroduction of six-monthly indexation of single-person unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions. As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government. In 1989, the Hawke Labor Government gradually re-introducing fees for university study. It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS), which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University, Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins (see Dawkins Revolution). Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a <b>threshold</b> <b>level.</b> As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means.

Subjects with levels of pathogens above these thresholds received initial periodontal treatment including systemic antibiotics when indicated. At baseline, 49. 5 % of periodontally healthy subjects harboured one or more marker pathogens above <b>threshold</b> <b>levels.</b> Periodontal treatment reduced the pathogen <b>levels</b> below <b>threshold</b> values in 78. 3 % of these initially colonized subjects.

At 1 yr after loading, periodontal pathogens were present above <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> in 74. 1 % of all subjects. It is concluded that in almost half of periodontal healthy individuals the subgingival biofilm harbours periodontal pathogens above threshold values. Long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of the selected marker pathogens appeared limited in our patient population, making pre-implant reduction unpredictive for post-implant levels of these pathogens. Thus, considering the applied microbiological criteria, generalized pre-implant microbiological testing is not contributory in periodontally healthy subjects...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} several models that help improve the {{operation}} of distribution systems. In these systems, transportation requests arrive at the systems randomly and will be satisfied by transporting from their origins to their destinations by a vehicle of capacity Q. In each system, the administrator needs to make two kinds of decision: admission decision and dispatching decision. When {{there is a new}} arrival, the administrator should decide whether to admit it or not based on the associated reward of admitting and the penalty cost of rejecting the arrival as well as the state of the system. When the vehicle is available, the administrator should decide when and where to dispatch the vehicle to balance the transportation cost and the customers' waiting cost. Our objective is to find the admission and dispatching control policies that maximize the total discounted profit of operating the systems. Three different systems are investigated in this thesis: the one-terminal system, the two-terminal system, and the one-hub-two-spoke system. We begin with the one-terminal system, which can be regarded as a bulk service queue. The optimal control policy is shown to be of threshold type. The optimal admission <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> are non-increasing functions of the remaining service times. We also investigate the dependence of these <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> on the system parameters and propose some approximations of the <b>threshold</b> <b>levels.</b> The interaction between terminals makes the two-terminal system complex and interesting. The optimal decision at one terminal is highly dependent {{on the state of the}} other terminal and the vehicle location. We fully characterize the optimal control threshold policy and show that both admission and dispatching <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> will decrease when there are more customers waiting at the other terminal. An approximation of the <b>threshold</b> <b>levels</b> is developed as well. We finally study the one-hub-two-spoke system. Two sub-systems, the system with one-way transportation demand and the system with two-way transportation demand, are discussed. For both sub-systems, we show that the optimal policies are of threshold type. We also partially characterize the properties of the optimal <b>threshold</b> <b>levels.</b> A number of directions for future research are discussed, especially on how to find efficient heuristic policies for hub-and-spoke systems...|$|R
