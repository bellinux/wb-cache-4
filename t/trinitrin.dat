5000|$|Following the {{discovery}} that amyl nitrite helped alleviate chest pain, Dr. William Murrell experimented {{with the use of}} nitroglycerin to alleviate angina pectoris and to reduce the blood pressure. He began treating his patients with small diluted doses of nitroglycerin in 1878, and this treatment was soon adopted into widespread use after Murrell published his results in the journal The Lancet in 1879. A few months before his death in 1896, Alfred Nobel was prescribed nitroglycerine for this heart condition, writing to a friend: [...] "Isn't it the irony of fate that I have been prescribed nitro-glycerin, to be taken internally! They call it <b>Trinitrin,</b> so as not to scare the chemist and the public." [...] The medical establishment also used the name [...] "glyceryl trinitrate" [...] for the same reason.|$|E
5000|$|Virginie {{introduces}} Poirot {{into the}} household and he begins interviewing the servants about the meal served {{on the night of}} M. Déroulard's death. He suspects poison, but all ate from common serving dishes. In the study where the death occurred, Poirot spots an open but full and untouched box of chocolates. M. Déroulard ate some chocolates every night after dinner, finishing a box on the night of his death. The servant retrieves the empty box. Poirot notices that the lids of the two boxes, one blue and one pink, are switched. As only Déroulard ate the chocolates, the new box should not have been opened yet. His doctor says Saint Alard and Déroulard had argued strenuously that evening, justifying the cause of death. Poirot finds the local chemist who made eye drops for the aged Madame Déroulard, for her cataracts. He finds the [...] "English chemist" [...] who had made up the prescription of <b>trinitrin</b> for John Wilson, small tablets in chocolate to lower blood pressure. Too many tablets at once would prove fatal. This development bothers Poirot. Wilson had the opportunity but not the motive whereas the position is reversed for M. de Saint Alard. Virginie gives Poirot the address of Saint Alard in the Ardennes. In the disguise of a plumber, Poirot breaks into the house and discovers an empty pill bottle from Wilson in the bathroom cupboard. Poirot thinks he has solved the case.|$|E
40|$|In 11 {{patients}} with severe angina pectoris a new beta-blocking drug, atenolol (Tenormin; I. C. I. 66082), {{was found in}} a double-blind randomized trial to reduce significantly the frequency of anginal attacks (P less than 0 - 001) and the amount of <b>trinitrin</b> consumed (P less than 0 - 03) in comparison with practolol and placebo. There was no significant improvement in the patients' ability to exercise on the bicycle ergometer...|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{double-blind study}} of verapamil in 16 anginal patients used two dose levels— 40 mg. t. d. s. and 120 mg. t. d. s. —and was compared with propranolol 100 mg. t. d. s. At the higher dosage verapamil produced {{a significant improvement}} in frequency of angina, <b>trinitrin</b> consumption, and exercise tolerance, and had a favourable and {{significant effect on the}} amount and duration of ischaemic S–T depression occurring in the electrocardiogram during exercise. In the lower dose verapamil produced significant subjective improvement but no objective benefit in the electrocardiogram. No {{significant differences were found between}} the favourable results with the higher dosage of verapamil and propranolol...|$|E
40|$|In a {{double-blind}} variable multidose trial ofpropranolol in angina pectoris, {{the maximum}} benefit {{in terms of}} reduced anginal pain, reduced <b>trinitrin</b> consumption, reduction in total duration of pain, increase in pain-free days, improvement of ST segment changes associated with ischaemia, and acute exercise tolerance, was obtained with the maximum dose of propranolol (av. dose 417 mg, range 80 I- 280). Progressively less benefit was seen with hal this dose, one-quarter, and one-eighth dose, though even one-eighth dose was signuficantly superior to placebo. As dosage was increased there was a progressive reduction in pulse rate. In 6 hypertensive patients in the trial blood pressure fell as dose was increased up to halffull strength, {{but there was no}} further fall on doubling to full dose. Since early trials demonstrating benefit from propranolol in angina pectoris whether given intravenously (Hamer et al., I 964) or orally (Keelan, I 965; Gillam and Prichard, I 965), there have been numerous confirmatory studies...|$|E
40|$|Forty-two {{patients}} with angina pectoris have completed a randomized, double-blind trial comparing tolamolol 100 mg and 200 mg with propranolol 80 mg, practolol 100 mg, and placebo, all given {{three times a}} day. Tolamolol 200 mg thrice daily {{was found to be}} equivalent to propranolol 80 mg thrice daily in anti-anginal efficacy. Anginal attack rates and <b>trinitrin</b> consumption were significantly reduced by all active treatments as compared with the placebo but tolamolol and propranolol were the most effective. Tolamolol 200 mg thrice daily was most effective in reducing blood pressure, while propranolol was most effective in reducing the resting heart rate. All treatments except the placebo significantly increased the amount of exercise which could be performed before angina appeared (exercise work), while tolamolol 200 mg thrice daily significantly reduced Robinson's index when compared with all other active agents. The degree of S-T segment depression induced by exercise was significantly lessened by both tolamolol and propranolol but not by practolol or placebo. There was no difference in patient preference between tolamolol and propranolol but tolamolol at both dose levels was preferred to practolol. Both tolamolol and propranolol are potent adrenergic beta-receptor antagonists and equal in anti-anginal efficacy but tolamolol has the advantage of being cardioselective. It is superior to practolol...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the antianginal efficacy of one conventional and three long acting beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents in a randomised manner in 12 patients with stable angina pectoris. An exercise test was performed initially {{and in the}} 24 th hour after a single daily dose of 160 mg of each beta-blocker {{at the end of}} a two week treatment period. In addition, glyceryl trinitrate consumption, anginal attack rate, and activity scores were recorded. No titration studies to an equivalent degree of beta-blockade were undertaken; a fixed dose was used even though these drugs are not equipotent. Conventional propranolol in a single daily dose of 160 mg was as effective in controlling the frequency of anginal attacks as long acting propranolol and sustained release oxprenolol. Exercise tolerance was less with sustained release oxprenolol than with conventional propranolol, long acting propranolol, and nadolol. Nadolol produced a significantly greater reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia than did long acting propranolol, sustained release oxprenolol, and conventional propranolol, and also the lowest anginal attack rate, the lowest <b>trinitrin</b> consumption, and significantly less ST segment depression than the other three. These findings suggest that nadolol is more potent than long acting propranolol, sustained release oxprenolol, and conventional propranolol, and the antianginal benefit at the 24 th hour relates to the degree of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) {{is a small}} gaseous {{molecule}} with an {{odd number}} of electrons and is rather soluble in hydrophobic phases. It was once known for its toxicity in the environment and for its applications in meat curing. After 1980 its importance was discovered in many physiological fields such as vascular regulation, neuronal communication, cytotoxic action by macrophages in bacterial infections etc. On the other side NO is involved in toxic shock, DNA damage and many pathological conditions. In 1992 the journal Science designated it as “molecule of the year ” {{and in the last}} years there has been an explosion of publications on the subject. The publications are concerned with the spectroscopic characterisation of NO derivatives, with the reactivity of NO with Myoglobin, Cytochrome and Hemoglobin and in particular with the chemical activities and biological applications of nitric oxide donors and nitric oxide scavengers. All such researches have produced until now many patents. The most famous products are Viagra and nitroglycerine (<b>Trinitrin).</b> Particular attention is given to the applications of NO to cardiovascular and hematological disorders. To this aim the authors examine the physiologic activities of NO and the mechanism of its antiplatelet, vasodilatory and antiproliferative action. Studies in animals and humans are also reported. Another section examines the drugs that increase the endogenous production of NO and modulate its activities. The last part is dedicated to the novel antithrombotic agent Nitroaspirin. Methods for NO detection will also be examined...|$|E
40|$|Ten male {{patients}} with chronic stable angina pectoris completed a randomized, double-blind cross-over study, with matched placebo run-in period (P), to compare {{the effects of a}} long-acting preparation of propranolol (LA, 160 mg once a day) with that of conventional propranolol (CP, 40 mg four times a day) each given for 14 days. Response was assessed by symptom-limited bicycle ergometry, degree of ST segment depression, daily anginal attack rate and glyceryl <b>trinitrin</b> consumption (GTN). Heart rate and ventricular extra-systolic frequency (VES) were recorded by 24 h Holter monitor. Bicycle ergometry was performed and a trough blood sample taken for propranolol estimation on day 14 prior to the morning dose. Both formulations increased total work capacity (P 3412, LA 4095, CP 3697 kpm/min), reduced rate-pressure product (P 21896, LA 16011, CP 15609 mm Hg beats/min), and degree of ST segment depression (P 4. 53, LA 2. 48, CP 2. 43), but without differences between the formulations. Daily anginal attack rate was reduced from 30 (placebo) to 7. 5 (CP) and 14. 5 (LA) (P less than 0. 05 between treatment groups). There was a reduction in daily GTN consumption by both treatments. The heart rate and total number of VESs during 24 h was similar in the two treatment groups and was reduced in comparison with placebo. Both formulations were well tolerated. Long-acting propranolol is an effective and well-tolerated alternative to conventional propranolol in the treatment of chronic stable and stress-induced angina, and in reducing VES frequency...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 10 {{patients}} with mixed angina {{were entered into}} a study to compare the anti-ischaemic efficacy of atenolol and amiodarone. The study was divided into three parts: (a) placebo for 2 weeks; (b) 100 mg atenolol given for 8 weeks; and (c) amiodarone given for 8 weeks, divided into week 1, 200 mg three times daily; week 2, 200 mg twice daily; weeks 3 and 4, 200 mg once daily; weeks 5 - 8, 200 mg once daily for 5 days a week. Clinical examination, basal and multi-stage effort electrocardiograms were performed {{at the end of}} each treatment. The number of anginal attacks and the amount of <b>trinitrin</b> taken by the patients were significantly reduced by both drugs with no significant difference between them. Compared with placebo, both drugs induced a significant increase in work capacity and in the time to decrease the ST-segment by 1 mm. At rest, atenolol reduced systolic blood pressure, heart rate and the systolic blood pressure [...] heart rate product compared with placebo. Systolic blood pressure was also reduced significantly compared with patients given amiodarone. Amiodarone did not influence these parameters. At maximum effort, amiodarone reduced heart rate and the systolic blood pressure [...] heart rate product compared with placebo. This reduction was greater for atenolol. The ST-segment depression was comparable between patients given either test drug. Amiodarone, therefore, exerts an anti-ischaemic effect similar to that shown by atenolol with different haemodynamics: atenolol reducing myocardial oxygen demand, amiodarone having an additive increase of coronary flow. Such an effect was obtained with a lower dose of amiodarone than is commonly used...|$|E
40|$|How can {{we define}} the {{validity}} of measures of outcome? Do doctors and patients define, and therefore choose, them in different ways? How do process measures (e. g. ESR), intermediate measures (e. g. radiology) and long-term measures (e. g. disability) interrelate? What are the implica-tions of various measures of disease outcome in terms of cost, feasibility, trial design and analysis and the toxicity of the trial itself? Can we measure 'quality of life'? THERE is a growing interest in what happens to patients with various diseases, and whether {{the course of their}} illness can be influenced by treatment. We have been measuring things like pain and morning stiffness for many years but we have so far failed to measure the number of patients from a cohort who will require surgery, develop deformities, need social security or the help of others, go into remission or die. Measurement has special problems in rheumatology. Rheumatologists may envy cardiologists for the technology at their dis-posal for they have advanced beyond the stage of counting <b>trinitrin</b> tablets as a measure of anginal pain. They may envy chest physicians measuring tuberculosis who know the bacillus which causes the problem. The cause of the rheumatoid disease process is unknown and it cannot therefore be measured. But rheumatologists have made great strides in the assessment of symptoms like pain and stiffness; they would surely reject a measurement like peak flow rate in asthma demanding also a measure of breathlessness. One special problem for the rheumatologist is the variability of his disease. One patient has serious disease in his hands and cannot write while another has serious disease in his knees and cannot walk. Few would deny the desirability of documenting these disabilities or the difficulties involved. TYPES OF OUTCOME There are two major subdivisions of outcome relating first to the disease and second to the patient. Measures of the disease include ESR and tests for rheumatoid factor and may reflect either active inflammation or damage to joints. The relative proportions of these aspects tend to change at different stages in the disease. Measures relating to the patient include his handicaps and disabilities and other measures of quality of life...|$|E
