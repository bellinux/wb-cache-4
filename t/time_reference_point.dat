30|$|The {{baseline}} configuration {{consists of a}} fixed position SDR transmitter and a rotating transmitter. The rotating node emits a pure sine wave continuously, thus it can be implemented using a simple, low-cost device, such as a WSN. The fixed position transmitter transmits a pure sine wave at a close frequency. Since multiple receivers need to make synchronized measurements, a time synchronization approach is necessary. Instead of implementing a time synchronization protocol on the SDR platform, we embed timing information in the transmitted signal itself. The SDR transmitter periodically emits a windowed chirp signal before a pure sine wave segment. That chirp can be accurately decoded on the receiver side {{and it makes a}} common <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> for all receivers. The range of this short frequency sweep does not overlap with the frequencies of the pure sinusoids.|$|E

The plantaris muscle was removed and a portion frozen as quickly as possible to establish a zero <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point.</b> The remaining portion of the plantaris was exposed to room atmosphere for a specific time interval, either 1. 00, 4. 00, 5. 00, 6. 00, 10. 00, 15. 00 minutes, after which they were immediately frozen. he glycogen and lactate values for the timed intervals were subtracted from the zero or initial value. In this way the results could be reported as the net increase or decrease per time interval. The muscle glycogen analysis indicated no difference in the timed intervals (P< 0. 05) 1. 00, 2. 00, 4. 00, 5. 00, 6. 00, but at the ten and fifteen minute intervals, significant differences were noted for a net decrease of 9. 94 and 10. 18 μmoles/g, respectively. In muscle lactate analysis, no significant differences were noted for any of the time intervals. The rate of utilization of glycogen was calculated as 0. 523 μmoles/g/min., and lactate formation as 0. 214 μmoles/g/min.

40|$|Abstract—Much of {{the current}} {{pharmacological}} therapy for chronic heart failure targets neurohormonal activation. In spite of recent advances in drug therapy, the mortality rate for chronic heart failure remains high. Activation of the carotid baroreceptor (BR) reduces sympathetic outflow and augments vagal tone. We investigated the effect of chronic activation of the carotid BR on hemodynamic and neurohormonal parameters and on mortality in dogs with chronic heart failure. Fifteen dogs were instrumented to record hemodynamics. Electrodes were applied around the carotid sinuses to allow for activation of the BR. After 2 weeks of pacing (250 bpm), electrical carotid BR activation was initiated in 7 dogs and continued {{for the remainder of}} the study. The start of BR activation was used as a <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> for the remaining 8 control dogs that did not receive BR activation. Survival was significantly greater for dogs undergoing carotid BR activation compared with control dogs (68. 17. 4 versus 37. 33. 2 days, respectively; P 0. 01), although arterial pressure, resting heart rate, and left ventricular pressure were not different over time in BR-activated versus control dogs. Plasma norepinephrine was lower in dogs receiving BR activation therapy 31 days after the start of BR activation (401. 9151. 5 versus 1121. 9389. 1 pg/mL in dogs not receiving activation therapy; P 0. 05). Plasma angiotensin II increased less in dogs receiving activation therapy (plasma angiotensin II increased by 157. 458. 6 pg/mL in control dogs versus 10. 114. 0 pg/mL in dogs receiving activation therapy; P 0. 02). We conclude that chronic activation of the carotid BR improves survival and suppresses neurohormonal activation in chronic heart failure...|$|E

Banking Union is one of the four foundations for a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. The paper’s purpose is to analyze the Banking Union structure, based on three pillars: (i) The Single Supervisory Mechanism - the transfer of the main responsibility regarding banking supervision from national to European level, (ii) The Single Resolution Mechanism - introduction of common provisions to ensure legal support required to manage bank failures problem, (iii) The Deposit Guarantee Schemes - harmonization of deposit guarantee rules. These measures were adopted at European Union level to ensure the stability of the European banking system and to prevent future crises. Because countries that {{are not part of the}} euro area are not required to join the Banking Union, the dilemma of these countries lies in the decision to join the Banking Union quickly or to wait. It is the case of Romania, also, so, this paper analyze the opportunity of Romania's accession to the Banking Union before adopting the euro. There are analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of Romania's participation in the Banking Union, showing that, in the context of single currency introduction, Romania's participation is required.
