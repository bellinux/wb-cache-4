5000|$|Robe-weaving {{competitions}} {{to weave}} special yellow monk robes called matho <b>thingan</b> (...) are also held throughout the country, {{most notably in}} Yangon's Shwedagon Pagoda. During these competitions, held for two consecutive nights (the night preceding and {{the night of the}} full moon), contestants work nonstop from night until dawn to weave these garments. The tradition commemorates a widely known story of the Buddha's life. Seeing that the Buddha would soon renunciate, the Buddha's mother, Maya, who had been reborn in the Tavatimsa heaven, spent the entire night weaving yellow monk robes for him. Her sister Gotami (Buddha's aunt) continued this tradition and offered new robes annually.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Images==by gokungnoobThe pagoda houses five small gilded {{images of}} Buddha, {{which have been}} covered in gold leaf {{to the point that}} their {{original}} forms cannot be seen. The gold-leaf application to such excess is relatively recent. Old photographs hanging on the monastery walls show some of the images in a more pristine form. It is reported that some gold has been removed on occasion to reduce its mass. Although the monastery is open to all for veneration, only men are permitted to place gold leaf on the images. Another part of the ritual for pilgrims is to place a small robe or <b>thingan</b> around the images, and to take the robe back to their houses and place it on their own altar as a token of respect for the Buddha and his teachings.|$|E

Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) has great potential in LED-based applications becasue {{of its ability to}} emit in the short-wavelength region, from near-UV to green. The emitting region is deposited as a quasi- 2 D quantum-well (QW) heterostructure composed of InGaN and gallium nitride. The past decade has seen tremendous progress in both epitaxial (or crystaline-layer) growth and InGaN LED design. We recently demonstrated a wall-plug efficiency (i. e., the con-version of electrical to optical power as measured from the line source to the resulting emission) of about 60 % for a blue <b>ThinGaN</b> R © LED. 1 The chip-level light-extraction efficiency of such devices has reached values in excess of 80 %. However, the internal quantum efficiency for light generation by electron-hol...|$|E

Its new <b>ThinGaN</b> technology, based on Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) will promote applications such as use of LEDs in vehicle headlights. Series production is due to start in 2004. Standard substrate material for blue LEDs based on InGaN is SiC, with a typical substrate thickness of 250 mm. Chemically and mechanically stable, this cannot be removed without a wet chemical or dry chemical plasma process without destroying the InGaN epitaxial layer. Sapphire properties cause distortion and defect during InGaN growth reducing luminous efficacy. Osram has tailored the epi procedure to this material, developing a way to remove the substrate using a production scale laser lift-off plant. Light from a pulsed laser splits the material into its components {{and it can be}} cleanly separated from the substrate. Prototypes of 5 mm radial LEDs achieve brightness values of up to 16 mW for blue products (460 nm) at an operating current of 20 mA. This is a short news story only.
