25|$|During initial episodes from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, {{director}} Mitsuo Fukuda did {{not want}} to talk <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Shinn's character. However, he defined him as Kira's opposite in regards to their personalities when comparing the two lead characters. Shinn is defined as a civilian whose character could already go through a large development in contrast to Kira who was forced to become a soldier in the prequel Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. In comparison with Kira, Shinn was stated to be character harder to predict his role in the TV series. As with Kira in Gundam SEED, Fukuda mentioned Shinn's character would also change across the series. Kenichi Suzumura was especially hired to work as Shinn's Japanese voice actor with Fukuda stating he was not a character difficult to play. Fukuda also anticipated Suzumura's work as Shinn's voice actor in an optimistic way. Before the series' premiere, staff member Kabashima Yousuke gave hints about Shinn's character, telling that the Gundam SEED Destinys protagonist would be a character not seen in the prequel, and he would have a thin appearance.|$|E

25|$|On April 17 in Mexico City, {{the police}} raided one of Constanzo's {{properties}} in Atizapán. They discovered piles of homosexual pornography and a hidden ritual chamber with an altar. This prompted {{the police to}} question people in Mexico City's homosexual community {{to see if they}} had any leads on Constanzo's whereabouts. The Mexican police stated that no evidence was found at the scene to link Constanzo or his men to any murders committed there. They said they saw altars and other ritualistic belongings, but did not find any traces of blood. No men were arrested at the scene, but the police managed to arrest a lady called María Teresa Quintana Rodríguez, sister of one of Constanzo's lovers and henchmen. The police also discovered that Aldrete's purse and other belongings were left behind, which prompted them to conclude that Constanzo probably murdered her because she knew <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the inner workings of his cult group. The police stated that they did not see Aldrete with the group when they arrived in Mexico City. They thought that Constanzo might have buried her somewhere in the city. U.S. authorities, however, believed that Aldrete purposely left her belongings behind to confuse investigators and make it appear that she was dead. On April 24, the police arrested Víctor Manuel Antúnez Flores and Salvador Antonio Villaluz, who were hiding in one of Constanzo's properties in Juárez neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale was introduced. It {{was made}} for three {{different}} age groups. The AMAS takes into account age-related situations that affect an individual's anxiety. The divisions include one scale for adults (AMA-A), one scale for college students (AMAS-C), {{and the other for}} the elderly population (AMAS-E). Each scale is geared towards examining situations specific to that age group. For example, the AMAS-C has items pertaining specifically to college students, such as questions about anxiety of the future. The AMAS-A is geared more toward mid-life issues, and the AMAS-E has specific anxieties the older population deals with, such as fear of aging and dying. The AMAS-A contains 36 items. It has 14 questions relating to worry/oversensitivity, 9 questions about physiological anxiety, 7 questions about social concerns/stress, and 6 questions about lies. An example of an age appropriate item for this scale is, “I am worried about my job performance”. The AMAS-C contains 49 items about the same topics, but incorporates 15 items related specifically to test anxiety. Questions relating to the items on this scale include, “I worry <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> tests and exams”. This scale is similar in structure to the CMAS discussed above. The AMAS-E contains 44 items related to worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety, lying, and the fear of aging. Twenty- three of the questions on the AMAS-E are related to worry/oversensitivity, but The Fear of Aging category of this scale includes items such as, “I worry about becoming senile”. Similar to the TMAS, the AMAS can be given in a group or individual setting, and the person responds either yes or no to each item listed according to if it pertains to themselves or not. The more items that are answered yes, suggest a higher level of anxiety. The scale has been said to be easy to complete and practical, because it takes only about 10 minutes to complete and just a couple minutes to score.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna talk <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it.

There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E

Josh Weinstein said Homer's reactions are exactly like someone talking to Albert Brooks. In all, his recordings amounted to over two hours in length.

As a result, Ohba did not give Mello a [...] "large role" [...] at the conclusion of Death Note and instead had Mello negatively affect Light [...] "indirectly". Ohba gave Mello a [...] "very plain" [...] death, depicted in only one panel; he felt that if Mello had perished [...] "dramatically" [...] it would reveal the truth behind his death.|$|E

Norton dismissed this, [...] "Our healthy process , which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted {{to such a degree that}} it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen.
