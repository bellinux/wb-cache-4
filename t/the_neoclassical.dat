5|$|In 1992, the {{economist}} Harry Saunders dubbed {{the hypothesis that}} improvements in energy efficiency work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate, and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical growth theory (the mainstream economic theory of capital accumulation, technological progress and long-run economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in <b>the</b> <b>neoclassical</b> growth model under {{a wide range of}} assumptions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson) {{attempted}} to interpret and formalise Keynes's writings {{in terms of}} formal mathematical models. In what had become known as <b>the</b> <b>neoclassical</b> synthesis, they combined Keynesian analysis with neoclassical economics to produce neo-Keynesian economics, which came to dominate mainstream macroeconomic thought for the next 40 years.|$|E
5|$|New {{classical}} economics {{had pointed}} out the inherent contradiction of <b>the</b> <b>neoclassical</b> synthesis: Walrasian microeconomics with market clearing and general equilibrium could not lead to Keynesian macroeconomics where markets failed to clear.

5|$|Around 1770 <b>the</b> <b>neoclassical</b> {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge {{spanning the}} Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge, {{is one of the}} very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play of light and shadow is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, <b>the</b> <b>neoclassical</b> French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{finds himself}} in a bedroom {{appointed}} in <b>the</b> <b>neoclassical</b> style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed in reaction to <b>the</b> <b>neoclassical</b> approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it {{was among the first}} English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to cover all of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|E

5|$|Economists {{incorporated}} the theoretical {{work from the}} synthesis into large-scale macroeconometric models that combined individual equations for factors such as consumption, investment, and money demand with empirically observed data. This line of research reached its height with the MIT-Penn-Social Science Research Council (MPS) model developed by Modigliani and his collaborators. MPS combined IS/LM with {{other aspects of the}} synthesis including <b>the</b> <b>neoclassical</b> growth model and the Phillips curve relation between inflation and output. Both large-scale models and the Phillips curve became targets for critics of the synthesis.|$|E
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of <b>the</b> <b>neoclassical</b> style that followed Palladianism.|$|E

5|$|The inner baroque façade, {{which is}} part of the 1734 church built by the Jesuits, is {{decorated}} with pilasters, capitals, blind niches and volutes. It is patterned after the San Ignacio Church in Intramuros, with two levels, a triangular pediment, and two narrow octagonal bell towers on each side. <b>The</b> <b>neoclassical</b> portico houses niches for Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Along the pediment is a wooden bas-relief on galvanized iron of the papal tiara over crossed keys (the symbol of Saint Peter) on the center and medallions carrying the icons of the Augustinians and Saint Peter on both ends.|$|E
5|$|The north range {{houses the}} library and senior common rooms; {{designed}} in <b>the</b> <b>Neoclassical</b> style by James Wyatt, it was built between 1788 and 1796 to accommodate the books bequested by Edward, Baron Leigh, formerly High Steward of the University and an Orielensis, whose gift had doubled {{the size of the}} library. The two-storey building has rusticated arches on the ground floor and a row of Ionic columns above, dividing the façade into seven bays — the ground floor contains the first purpose built senior common rooms in Oxford, above is the library.|$|E
5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of <b>the</b> <b>Neoclassical,</b> however the naturalism of light and shadow, {{the authenticity of the}} desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
