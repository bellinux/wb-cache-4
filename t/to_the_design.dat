5|$|The Circus {{is seen as}} the {{pinnacle}} of Wood's work.

5|$|The third {{stages of}} the {{flanking}} towers were both built in the Perpendicular style of the late 14th century, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of William Wynford; that on the north-west was not begun until about 1425.

5|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> {{of the heat}} sinks that collect the moisture in air wells: high mass, radiative and active. Early in the twentieth century, there was interest in high-mass air wells, but despite much experimentation including the construction of massive structures, this approach {{proved to be a}} failure.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Chichagov, {{named for}} Admiral Vasily Chichagov, was ordered on 4 June 1865 from the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying {{was not until}} 20 November 1866. Construction was delayed by changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 1,177,500 rubles.|$|E

5|$|Approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries {{can require}} more sophistication than {{the design of}} a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool. The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz. Executives at Virgin Records {{thought that this was}} important to attract the target audience, who they believed no longer spent much time in record shops. They felt that similarities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of the first album, including Meat Loaf's name in Gothic typography, would entice consumers of the 1977 album to purchase this.The section from this episode about the marketing of Bat Out of Hell II, and the filming of this music video, has been reshown as part of BBC Learning Zone's media studies strand.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design.</b> He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E

5|$|Between 1275 and 1310 the undercroft and {{chapter house}} were built by unknown architects, the undercroft in the Early English and the chapter {{house in the}} Geometric style of Decorated Gothic architecture. In about 1310 work {{commenced}} on the Lady Chapel, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of Thomas Witney, who also built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in the Decorated Gothic style. The tower was later braced internally with arches by William Joy. Concurrent with this work, in 1329–45 Joy made alterations and extensions to the choir, joining it to the Lady Chapel with the retrochoir, the latter in the Flowing Decorated style.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{cars were}} also widely used by other teams, {{and not just}} in Formula One. Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac called the company they set up in 1961 to design and build formula racing cars to {{customer}} teams Motor Racing Developments (MRD), and this company had a large portfolio of other activities. Initially, Brabham and Tauranac each held 50percent of the shares. Tauranac was responsible for design and running the business, while Brabham was the test driver and arranged corporate deals like the Repco engine supply {{and the use of the}} MIRA wind tunnel. He also contributed ideas <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> process and often machined parts and helped build the cars.|$|E
5|$|Cdr Katô Hirohasu {{pushed for}} the {{adoption}} of a new /45 calibre gun that was currently under development. After trials of the new gun, which were witnessed by both the Japanese Navy and Royal Navy, the Japanese made the decision on 29 Nov 1911 to use the new gun despite the keel having already been laid down on 17 January 1911, and the resulting need to quickly make a large number of alternations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design,</b> so as to not prolong the construction.|$|E

These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, {{it is the first}} truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.|$|E
5|$|Cram {{designed}} the chapel {{with the assistance}} of Alexander Hoyle, a member of his firm. Albert M.
