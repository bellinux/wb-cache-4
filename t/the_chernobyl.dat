5|$|Caesium-137, with a {{half-life}} of 30.17years, {{is one of}} the {{two principal}} medium-lived fission products, along with strontium-90, which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> accident. Caesium-137 undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium-137. It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation. Caesium-137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay. Caesium-137 {{has been used as a}} tracer in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of tritium. Small amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Goiânia accident and <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> nuclear power plant. Its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts, and is taken up by the body, which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2010 President Yanukovych {{appointed}} Viktor Baloha (United Centre) Minister of Emergencies and Minister of the Protection of the Population from <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster.

Early 2010 United Centre had rejected any possibility of joining a parliamentary coalition with the Communist Party of Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with nuclear materials have also featured prominently in Australian anti-nuclear campaigns. This {{has been the case}} worldwide because of accidents like <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster, but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over the health effects of nuclear testing in Australia and the South Pacific, and the emergence of prominent anti-nuclear campaigners Helen Caldicott and Tilman Ruff, who are medical practitioners.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, {{berkelium}} {{is mostly}} concentrated in certain areas, which {{were used for}} the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1980, {{as well as at the}} sites of nuclear incidents, such as <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster, Three Mile Island accident and 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E

50|$|CRDP ensured {{the shift}} of {{national}} strategy on Chernobyl and improvement of national programmes for <b>the</b> mitigation of <b>Chernobyl</b> catastrophe consequences via advisory support on national policy and regional cooperation issues provided to the Government of Ukraine, hosting of various round tables and providing support for studies on Chernobyl-specific policy issues, organizing conferences, facilitating participation of CRDP’s national and international partners in the dialogue. As result the New National Programme on Chernobyl for 2006-2010 adopted by the Parliament of Ukraine incorporates key recovery-oriented recommendations. At <b>the</b> 20th <b>Chernobyl</b> Anniversary commemorative conferences, <b>the</b> UN/UNDP <b>Chernobyl</b> strategy was largely based on CRDP’s experiences.|$|R

5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|Radioisotopes of caesium {{require special}} precautions: the {{improper}} handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources {{can lead to}} release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health. Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.|$|E

5|$|In October 1985, Mézières was {{contacted}} by the German director Peter Fleischmann who proposed to adapt Russians Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's 1964 novel Hard to Be a God into a film. This {{was to be the}} first major German-Soviet co-production. Mézières travelled to Moscow to join the production team and also to Uzbekistan where it was proposed to shoot the film. Travelling from there to Munich, he produced several concept drawings and paintings over a three-month period before the project was suspended due to funding difficulties. At this point Mézières left the production and returned to France. Filming was eventually scheduled to begin in April 1986 in Kiev and Mézières re-joined the production, creating storyboards for some scenes. However, at this time <b>the</b> <b>Chernobyl</b> disaster occurred only 100km from Kiev and production was again halted. The film was eventually finished in 1989, but Mézières' concepts were barely used. Again, many of Mézières' designs were later published in Les Extras de Mézières.|$|E
