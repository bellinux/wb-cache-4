40|$|C. <b>The</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>shall</b> inspect {{commercial}} land-based aquaculture systems {{facilities at}} least every six months, and open-water grow-out operations, floating aquaculture operations, remote setting operations and nursery systems at least annually. <b>The</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>shall</b> at a minimum: 1) inspect operator records to verify that appropriate permits {{are up to date}} and operational plans are being adhered to, and 2) determine if seed from restricted or prohibited waters are being cultured and if appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure such seed are purged for an appropriate period of time before harvest. Public Health Significance: The term “aquaculture systems ” is undefined. The Model Ordinance only requires the inspection of “floating aquaculture and land-based aquaculture facilities. ” Bottom culture aquaculture operations do not appear to require inspections at all. The Model Ordinance does not describe what an inspector should examine when inspecting aquaculture systems. For open water and floating aquaculture grow-out operations in open and conditionally approved waters, an annual inspection should be adequate to ensure that appropriate permits are in place and operational plans are being adhered to. Additional inspections do not ensure a higher level of public health protection. Land-based molluscan aquaculture includes hatcheries (exempt), larval-setting operations (that should also be exempt), and nursery systems for very small seed. Grow-out systems do not currently exist because pumping costs are prohibitive, however should economics change to make such systems affordable, these systems will be functionally similar to wet storage systems and will justify more extensive (twice annual) monitoring Cost Information (if available) : Since the current Model Ordinance does not describe what an inspection of an aquaculture system entails, {{it is difficult to determine}} the cost impact of this change...|$|R
