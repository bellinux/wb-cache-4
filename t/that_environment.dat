5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|E
5|$|Maurice's natural {{goodness}} never wavers in the story. Unlike Shelley's Frankenstein, {{which suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>environment</b> determines a person's morality, Maurice assumes {{that people can}} be innately good. Maurice even forgives Dame Smithson, who stole him from his nurse. The story aims to generate sympathy in its readers. In contrast with other children's stories of its day, it lacks didacticism and draws no clear distinctions between virtue and vice.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in <b>that</b> <b>environment,</b> but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E

5000|$|One common complication, however, is <b>that</b> <b>environments</b> <b>that</b> support {{programmable}} snippets {{often have}} to make distinctions between what counts as [...] "plain text" [...] and what counts as [...] "programming instructions". Further complicating this distinction {{is the fact that}} applications that support programmable snippets almost always include support for recognition of multiple programming languages, either through basic syntax highlighting or execution of embedded commands.|$|R
5|$|The {{ability of}} {{children}} to extract information from their environment rests on understandings of attentional behaviors such as pointing. Episodes of joint attention provide children {{with a great deal}} of information about objects by establishing reference and intention. Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in <b>that</b> <b>environment</b> provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance. Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.|$|E
5|$|Isopods {{belong to}} the larger group Peracarida, which are united by the {{presence}} of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 species are found in marine environments, mostly on the sea floor. About 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5,000 species are the terrestrial woodlice, which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large adaptive radiation in <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> The largest isopod is in the genus Bathynomus and some large species are fished commercially for human food in Mexico, Japan and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E

30|$|By now, it is {{well known}} <b>that</b> {{periodic}} <b>environment</b> does not enhance populations governed by the Beverton-Holt model with constant growth rate and periodic capacity [21, 22, 25, 26]. This suggests <b>that</b> periodic <b>environment</b> has a negative impact on the maximum harvesting level. Indeed, we have the following result.|$|R
30|$|In {{architecture}} and design, Hildebrand (1991, 1999) expanded the standard definition of prospect-refuge theory to include four additional spatio-cognitive elements: mystery, complexity, enticement and illumination. Most of {{these can be}} traced to Kaplan and Kaplan’s (1989) information theory framework which suggests <b>that</b> <b>environments</b> <b>that</b> provide increased opportunities for gathering or discovering information allow for improved living conditions including heightened safety. Thus various spatio-cognitive properties associated with exploration potential (including complexity and mystery) also have an impact on environmental preference.|$|R

25|$|Molecular biology allows {{scientists}} {{to understand a}} gene’s function using microbial culturing and mutagenesis. Searching for similar genes in other organisms and in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data allows us to understand what processes could be relevant and important in a given ecosystem, providing insight into the biogeochemical cycles in <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

Collecting rock salt or any mineral (from a mine {{or from the}} Earth) and making a pile of the produce. This can only occur {{in the place where}} the gathering should take place.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the compound forms for completed past actions, Portuguese also retains a synthetic pluperfect: so, ele tinha falado and ele havia falado ("he had spoken") can also be expressed as ele falara. However, the simple (one-word) pluperfect is losing ground to the compound forms. While pluperfect forms like falara are generally understood, their use is limited mostly to some regions of Portugal and to written language. In Brazilian Portuguese they are used nearly exclusively in the printed language, though even in <b>that</b> <b>environment</b> the -ra synthetic pluperfect has been losing ground to the compound form using tinha in the last decades.|$|E
50|$|Gibson {{believed}} <b>that</b> the <b>environment</b> {{and animals}} are not separable items. He stated <b>that</b> without the <b>environment</b> animals cannot survive and without animals {{there is no}} environment. The environment is what we perceive at any given moment.

This {{is why we are}} unable to perceive things in the <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> are too small to see, such as an atom.|$|R
40|$|In {{everyday}} life we accomplish tasks {{that require the}} storage and access of mental representations of different <b>environments</b> <b>that</b> we are not currently perceiving. Past research has suggested <b>that</b> <b>environments</b> are encoded {{by a series of}} independent representations that are organized in memory. Three experiments tested this idea further by asking whether multiple representations of environ-ments can be accessed simultaneously. Using a cued task-set switching paradigm, subjects judged spatial relationships between target locations in two familiar environments. Response times were longer when successive trials probed different environments, an effect not due to switching between semantic categories or semantic priming, suggesting <b>that</b> representations of <b>environments</b> are accessed sequentially.

Research has indicated that the way neighborhoods are created can affect both the physical activity and mental health of the communities’ residents. Studies have shown <b>that</b> built <b>environments</b> <b>that</b> were expressly designed to improve physical activity are linked to higher rates of physical activity, which in turn, positively affects health.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of these chemicals in crude oil {{is a result of}} the inclusion of biological material in the oil; these chemicals are released by kerogen during the production of hydrocarbon oils, as these are chemicals highly resistant to degradation and plausible chemical paths have been studied. Abiotic defenders state that biomarkers get into oil during its way up as it gets in touch with ancient fossils. However a more plausible explanation is that biomarkers are traces of biological molecules from bacteria (archaea) that feed on primordial hydrocarbons and die in <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> For example, hopanoids are just parts of the bacterial cell wall present in oil as contaminant.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the best}} {{explanation}} for the stripes is that they serve a social function. Individual zebras can apparently recognise each other by their striping patterns. The stripes may also serve as visual cues for grooming. In addition, they could serve to help zebra groups stay together when they are fleeing. A 2012 study suggests that stripes may have developed to discourage biting flies. Experiments have demonstrated that the stripes polarize light {{in such a way}} that it discourages tabanids (biting flies) in a manner not shown with other coat patterns. Another study from 2015 determined <b>that</b> <b>environment</b> temperature is a strong predictor for zebra striping patterns and proposed that the stripes may be related to thermoregulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} (1) covariance between environment and competition, and (2) species-specific {{response to the}} environment decouple the strongest intraspecific and interspecific competition experienced by a species. Intraspecific competition is strongest when a species is favored by the environment, whereas interspecific competition is strongest when its rivals are favored. After this decoupling, buffered population growth limits the impact of interspecific competition when a species is not favored by the environment. As a consequence, the impact of intraspecific competition on the species favored by a particular environment exceeds that of the interspecific competition on species less favored by <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> We see that the fundamental requirement for species coexistence is fulfilled and thus storage effect is able to maintain stable coexistence {{in a community of}} competing species.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted <b>that</b> the <b>environment</b> {{is an essential}} compound of multiagent systems (MASs). Yet the environment is typically assigned limited responsibilities, or even neglected entirely, overlooking a rich potential for the paradigm of MASs. Opportunities <b>that</b> <b>environments</b> offer, have mostly been researched {{in the domain of}} situated MASs. However, the complex principles behind the concepts and responsibilities of the environment and the interplay between agents and environment are not yet fully clarified. In this paper, we first give an overview of the state-of-the-art on environments in MASs. The survey discusses relevant research tracks on <b>environments</b> <b>that</b> have been explored so far. Each track is illustrated with a number of representative contributions by the research community. Based on this study and the results of our own research, we identify a set of core concerns for <b>environments</b> <b>that</b> can be divided in two classes: concerns related to the structure of the environment, and concerns related to the activity in the environment. To conclude, we list a number of research challenges that, in our opinion, are important for further research on environments for MAS...|$|R

25|$|Two common {{environments that}} tend to favor neoteny are high-altitude and cool environments because neotenous {{individuals}} have a higher fitness than those that metamorphose into the adult form. This is because the energy required for metamorphosis is too costly for the individual’s fitness, also the conditions favor neoteny due {{to the ability of}} neotenous individuals to utilize the available resources more easily. This trend {{can be seen in the}} comparison of salamander species of lower and higher altitudes. The neotenous individuals have higher survivorship as well as higher fecundity than the salamanders that had gone to the adult form in the higher altitude and cooler environment. Insects in cooler environments tend to show neoteny in flight because wings have a high surface area and lose heat quickly, thus it is not advantageous for insects in <b>that</b> <b>environment</b> to metamorphose into adults.|$|E
25|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, {{it has been}} hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes. The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions. Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that are demonstrated in humans. This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something unique about the environment of ancestral humans, which {{gave rise to the}} need for executive functions as adaptations to <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, tool construction and use, and effective communication.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequent}} {{critique of}} the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now. While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert {{that it is not}} impossible. Part of the {{critique of the}} scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environments of Evolutionary Adaptation. Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which Homo sapiens evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to <b>that</b> <b>environment</b> becomes highly speculative. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc.|$|E
