500|$|Lacking in numbers, Eugene {{could not}} seriously disrupt Tallard's march but the French Marshal's {{progress}} was proving pitifully slow. Tallard's force had suffered {{considerably more than}} Marlborough's troops on their march – many of his cavalry horses were suffering from glanders and the mountain passes were proving tough for the 2,000 wagons of provisions. Local German peasants, angry at French plundering, compounded Tallard's problems, leading Mérode-Westerloo to bemoan – [...] "the enraged peasantry killed several thousand of our men before the army was clear of the Black Forest."

500|$|William Astor, {{motivated}} {{in part by}} {{a dispute}} with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, built the [...] Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street. His father had been the millionaire developer, William Waldorf Astor. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, an elite boutique hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louise Kehrer Boldt. The original plans for the Waldorf were for a hotel with 11 stories. [...] Boldt's wife, Louise, believed that 13 was a lucky number. [...] She persuaded her husband to add two floors to the construction. William Astor's construction of a hotel next to his aunt's house worsened his feud with her, but, with Boldt's assistance, John Astor persuaded his mother to move uptown. The Waldorf Hotel, named after <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Walldorf, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, the Astors’ ancestral home, was opened for business March 13, 1893.|$|E

2500|$|After 1831, Mexican rancho {{owners would}} logically erect their {{dwellings}} on or very near creeks. Locally, Juan Prado’s adobe was near Adobe Creek & Juanita Briones’ adobe was near Barron Creek. Because they were permanent {{features of the}} landscape, creeks were often used as Rancho boundaries. This was true locally, where the Mexican diseño show Adobe Creek as the boundary between Rancho San Antonio and Rancho La Purisima Concepcion. When Americans took over in 1850, speculators bought much of this land. Much of it initially became large self-contained ranches---typically running cattle & growing crops like wheat, barley & oats that required little or no irrigation. That changed in a few decades when {{it was discovered that}} orchards and vineyards could thrive here. Such agriculture of course used more water. Local land was cut progressively [...] into smaller holdings, until most of it [...] was subdivided as the population increased. This meant more and more wells, including large ones dug along Adobe Creek by early water companies to serve <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>town</b> <b>of</b> Los Altos. The water table inevitably shrank as a result, and alarms about this development appeared, at least as early as the 1920s. In the early 1930s, the Los Altos News reported that the water table, which stood at 120 feet in 1898, was now down to 335 feet.|$|E
