5|$|According to {{the account}} of Onofrio Panvinio, Cardinal John of Toledo {{suggested}} that the roof be removed ("Let us uncover the Room, else the Holy Ghost will never get at us"—the first recorded reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the Holy Spirit should guide cardinal electors), which the two magistrates readily obliged.

5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E

5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling the words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.|$|E
5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties {{and their}} {{subjects}} have at times been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland with Elizabeth Granowska being far from unheard of in medieval Europe. However, as dynasties approached absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king back down to the level of those he ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to end or prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> it was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with their subjects and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't {{seem to be working}} in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't {{be able to make it}} work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E

25|$|Most Ashkenazim {{have the}} custom {{to fill a}} fifth cup at this point. This relates to a Talmudic {{discussion}} that concerns the number of cups {{that are supposed to}} be drunk. Given that the four cups are in reference to the four expressions of redemption in Exodus 6:6-7, some rabbis felt {{that it was important to}} include a fifth cup for the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. All agreed that five cups should be poured but the question as to whether or not the fifth should be drunk, given that the fifth expression of redemption concerned being brought into the Land of Israel, which - by this stage - was no longer possessed of an autonomous Jewish community, remained insoluble. The rabbis determined that the matter should be left until Elijah (in reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Elijah's arrival would precipitate the coming of the Messiah, at which time all halakhic questions will be resolved) and the fifth cup came to be known as the Kos shel Eliyahu ("Cup of Elijah"). Over time, people came to relate this cup <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Elijah will visit each home on Seder night as a foreshadowing of his future arrival at the end of the days, when he will come to announce the coming of the Jewish Messiah.|$|E
25|$|The {{provisions}} of the Jencks Act have been substantially incorporated into Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> provisions which are purely procedural in nature should appear in the Rules, rather than in Title 18 of the United States Code. Rule 26.2 extends the {{provisions of}} the Jencks Act by providing that statements subject to production at trial are not only those of prosecution witnesses, but those of any witness other than the defendant. The Rule does not alter the Jencks Act schedule for production of statements, nor does it relieve a defendant seeking production of Jencks material from the necessity of making a request for production at the trial stage of the proceeding.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of modern company law {{came when the}} two pieces of legislation were codified under the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 {{at the behest of}} the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr Robert Lowe. That legislation shortly gave way to the railway boom, and from there the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode and fall into insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses. The last significant development in the history of companies was the decision of the House of Lords in Salomon v. Salomon & Co. where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.|$|E

25|$|The Nambassa festivals {{were not}} only music and {{entertainment}} events but included educational components which sought to instruct people on lifestyle aids it felt important enough to promote within the then conservative society of New Zealand's 1970s. Many {{of those involved in}} Nambassa aspired <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> throughout the evolution of western civilisation, many valuable ancient survival, healing and spiritual techniques, had been lost over 1700 years of a philosophically and culturally dominating Roman Christianity. Nambassa advocates that many past civilisations supporting religious and political institutions, have historically sought to alienate, and too often violently eliminate, many worthwhile belief systems which did not conform to its then strict conservative doctrines on culture and religion. Adherents of Nambassa promote the ideology which suggests that, to deny what was once integral to survival in ancient history, is essentially to deny one's personal spiritual development. Through its wide variety of workshop subjects, the festivals attempted to nurture a better understanding of culture and spirituality with the goal of fostering a more tolerant and better informed society.|$|E
25|$|Criticism from {{reformer}} Martin Luther on the Fugger business {{methods and}} novelistic portrayal from early research have led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Jakob Fugger exercised considerable power over Maximilian I {{the king and}} emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, while more recent research shows that this was only partially true. Close {{to the end of}} his life Maximilian was so heavily indebted to Jakob Fugger that he had no choice but to continue his support for the emperor to still be able reclaim his outstanding debits. When Maximilians grandson Charles V stood for election to become the next Emperor Jakob Fugger raised a sum of more than 500.000 guilders, a significant portion of his wealth and of the total amount raised in his support, to ensure the seven Prince-electors would choose him. Thereby he helped prevent the election of Francis I of France which would have endangered his claims and investments gravely, although it also made him highly dependent on the House of Habsurg. Much later the Fugger family lost a large portion of their wealth following three Spanish state bankruptcies(1557, 1560, 1575) under the reign of Philip II of Spain.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, {{a belief}} arose that some extra {{protection}} of human rights above and beyond parliamentary scrutiny was necessary. Doubts grew about the capacity of parliamentary controls, partly because of scepticism about Parliament's will to control the growing executive and the control by political parties of their MPs which allowed weak governments to avoid effective challenges. This scepticism went {{hand in hand with}} criticisms of the United Kingdom's political system and whether it is sufficiently representative of the range of opinion in the country. The doubts intensified with the experiences with terrorism in the 1970s and accession to the European Community in 1973 where Britain was exposed to other legal systems which did not share the same concept of parliamentary sovereignty and which gave stronger protection to human rights. In particular, European entry led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the Parliament of the United Kingdom could be subject to the decisions of a higher legal order {{in the form of the}} European Court of Justice. This was highlighted in the Factortame litigation where the House of Lords was required to 'disapply' provisions of an Act of Parliament which were contrary to European Community law, effectively ruling them invalid. In addition, increasingly influenced by international human rights law, comparative constitutional law and European law, English courts became more sympathetic towards the concept of popular sovereignty and fundamental rights and liberties.|$|E
