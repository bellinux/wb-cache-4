500|$|Regarding her {{approach}} to acting, Moore {{said in a}} 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: [...] "I {{want to have a}} sense of who a character is, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to get there and have it happen to me on camera." [...] The aim, she said, is to [...] "try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [...] to you, that you don't bring the emotion to it... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cain continued, “Knowing who is {{the head}} of some of these small {{insignificant}} states around the world, I don’t think that is something that is critical to focusing on national security and getting this economy going. When I get ready to go visit that country, I’ll know who it is, but until <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to focus on the big issues that we need to solve.” ...|$|E
2500|$|How To Live: A Search For Wisdom From Old People (While They Are Still On This Earth) {{documents}} Alford's {{journey to}} find and define the hard-won wisdom of the elderly. Early in the book, Alford describes the motivation behind his efforts: [...] "If people are repositories of knowledge -- {{the death of an}} old person, an African saying runs, is like the burning of a library -- <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> a library card. I want borrowing privileges {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
5000|$|My {{band was}} more rock or hard rock-oriented. To define that, you’d {{have to say}} Duane Eddy was ‘hard rock’ back <b>then...</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do surf music, because—well, {{actually}} it wasn’t called surf music yet. I liked the instrumental vein...” ...|$|R
5000|$|Altman {{said in an}} interview, [...] "I {{just wanted}} to change the {{elements}} {{of these kinds of}} stories as much as <b>I</b> could and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to stay out of the}} courtroom." [...] Altman changed the setting to Savannah, Georgia, and added the threat of a hurricane throughout the movie.|$|R
5000|$|Years later, he {{was quoted}} in an {{interview}} as saying: [...] "I was very sensitive about the position of black people in the town... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to know how you}} explain this great difference. How is it that we were in such low circumstances as compared to the whites? And when they answered 'slavery' as the explanation, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to know where we came from." ...|$|R
2500|$|Former bass guitarist Nick Oliveri, who {{was fired}} by Josh Homme in 2004, {{provided}} backing vocals on [...] "If I Had a Tail", and upon hearing that drummer Dave Grohl was returning to Queens of the Stone Age {{to assist in the}} recording process, Oliveri asked Homme if he too could return on bass guitar. Oliveri noted: [...] "I actually put in a request with Josh. I heard Dave was playing on the record, and I was like, 'Dude! I wanna play bass on it!' I'd be a fool not to ask. If Dave Grohl was playing drums, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> in. He's an amazing drummer. I never had a better time in my life than when Dave was in the band." [...] Homme ultimately chose current bassist Michael Shuman, who joined the band in 2007 upon Era Vulgaris release.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her speech}} to the Academy, she took as her topic [...] "The Chinese Novel." [...] She explained, [...] "I am an American by birth and by ancestry", but [...] "my {{earliest}} knowledge of story, of how to tell and write stories, {{came to me in}} China." [...] After an extensive discussion of classic Chinese novels, especially Romance of the Three Kingdoms, All Men Are Brothers, and Dream of the Red Chamber, she concluded that in China [...] "the novelist did not have the task of creating art but of speaking to the people." [...] Her own ambition, she continued, had not been trained toward [...] "the beauty of letters or the grace of art." [...] In China, the task of the novelist differed from the Western artist: [...] "To farmers he must talk of their land, and to old men he must speak of peace, and to old women he must tell of their children, and to young men and women he must speak of each other." [...] And like the Chinese novelist, she concluded, [...] "I have been taught to want to write for these people. If they are reading their magazines by the million, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ebert and Roeper {{gave the}} film a [...] "Two Thumbs Up" [...] rating. Roger Ebert, {{in his review}} for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, commenting that it is [...] "made of dubious but {{energetic}} special effects, breathless velocity, much imagination, some sly verbal wit and a little political satire". [...] "The movie plays like a critique of contemporary society", he observed, also stating that in this way it was like Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Peter Hartlaub in the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "a triumph", comparing its writing to the best Star Trek episodes, while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described it as a modest but superior science fiction film. Science fiction author Orson Scott Card called Serenity [...] "the best science fiction film ever", further stating [...] "If Ender's Game can't be this kind of movie, and this good a movie, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it never to be made. I'd rather just watch Serenity again." [...] USA Today film critic Claudia Puig wrote that [...] "the characters are generally uninteresting and one-dimensional, and the futuristic Western-style plot grows tedious" [...] while Variety declared that the film [...] "bounces around to sometimes memorable effect but rarely soars".|$|E
5000|$|Sutton {{developed}} {{an interest in}} acting, playing his first role at age nine and also starring in the drama club at East Nashville High School, where he graduated in 1941. He later said, [...] "The first time I walked out on a stage, I had a warm feeling. <b>I</b> knew <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be an actor." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'So I could!' said Phyllis, as if a {{new light}} had broken in upon her. 'But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to be out of}} sight of pussy, for I could not think a bit, while the kitten was at play so prettily, and I kicked my heels to keep from hearing the voices in the garden, for it does make me so unhappy!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I brought him, sir, because I {{found he}} {{recognised}} me {{even in this}} dress, and it was wise to make a friend of him. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> a guide, and I was well assured he knew the way, if any man did.

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to go {{away and}} hide behind a thicket and kick myself, but what I {{actually}} did was to give Pups part of my meat.
