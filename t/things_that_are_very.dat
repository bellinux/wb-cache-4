500|$|Rumors persisted that Clark {{was forced}} out due to his {{contentious}} relationship with some in Washington, D.C.; however, he has dismissed such rumors, calling it a [...] "routine personnel action". The Department of Defense said it was merely a [...] "general rotation of American senior ranks". However, a NATO ambassador told the International Herald Tribune that Clark's dismissal {{seemed to be a}} [...] "political thing from the United States". General Hugh Shelton would say of Clark during his 2004 campaign that [...] "the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> near and dear to my heart. I'm not going to say whether I'm a Republican or a Democrat. I'll just say Wes won't get my vote." [...] Shelton never elaborated further on what these issues were.|$|E

5000|$|When told Henry Kissinger {{had once}} {{described}} him as [...] "always wrong", Lewis replied: [...] "Probably because I wrote in a very uncomplimentary way about him. I didn’t like him. He did <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> damaging to human beings." ...|$|R

6000|$|... [Second Caution to Weak Christians.]--As I cannot but {{condemn the}} actions of such Christians as have been touched before, so I would caution weak Christians not to be {{offended}} with true religion for the miscarriages of their fellows. There are two <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> apt to be an occasion of offence to the weak: one is, when the cross attends religion; the other is, when others that profess religion do suffer for evil-doing. To both these I would say this:-- ...|$|E

5000|$|While some journalists {{named the}} {{political}} figures {{discussed in the}} film, other prominent news organizations, such as The Washington Post, CNN, and NPR, did not report names. Dick questioned this reluctance, saying, [...] "The press often reports on <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> painful to the subjects they are writing about. gay politicians are public officials; this is reporting on hypocrisy, {{and there is an}} obligation on the press to write about it." ...|$|E

Shelton created a minor controversy for 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, a subordinate to Shelton during the 1999 Kosovo military actions, when he stated: [...] "I {{will tell you the}} reason Clark came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> near and dear to my heart. … I'll just say Wes won't get my vote," [...] casting doubt upon the presidential contender's legitimacy.|$|E

One <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{clear about the}} global {{business}} environment <b>is</b> <b>that</b> everyone works {{in one or more}} teams, either on a virtual basis or face-to-face. A large body of work has emerged to support this teamwork (Larson & LaFasto 1989;LaFasto & Larson 2001;Ray & Bronstein 1995;Parker 1994).

5000|$|Jung {{held that}} if the dreamer walked about and acted like a person awake, we would have the {{clinical}} picture of schizophrenia. Hobson [...] concluded that dreams are more like delirium than schizophrenia. Both Jung and Hobson focus on how dreams are defective forms of normal waking life, but in dreams, our minds are in some ways able to function better than in waking life. Interobjects show {{the ability of the}} dreaming mind to notice how <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> different nevertheless have features in common. The mind then creates a new category, which we might never have noticed in our waking life. The woman who dreamed of a [...] "cellphone-baby" [...] was creating a new category: small objects that are held close to the body and that make noise at surprising and embarrassing times.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recent years}} there {{has seen a}} surge of popular dystopian young adult {{literature}} and blockbuster films. Theo James, actor in Divergent, notes that [...] "young people in particular have such a fascination {{with this kind of}} story", saying [...] "It's becoming part of the consciousness. You grow up in a world where it's part of the conversation all the time - the statistics of our planet warming up. The environment is changing. The weather is different. There are <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future and how we will survive. It's {{so much a part of}} everyday life that young people inevitably — consciously or not — are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do.

50|$|In a 1995 interview, Lien {{said the}} {{following}} about these conventions: The conventions are something within themselves, a unique world. It’s {{a very different}} experience in that I can talk to other {{people involved in the}} world of Star Trek, like authors and actors from other Star Trek shows. I also get to meet people from other SF shows, because they tend to have guests from other series at the conventions I attend. The fans love the conventions, love meeting the people involved in their favorite shows. That makes you want to give them everything you can. I try to tell them what’s going on, share my laughter and tell them about the wonderful experience I've been having on Voyager. The feedback is just so positive. The fans seem to really like the show, and that's good. If they have any negative feedback, they give it to me, too, which is fine. They're usually pretty respectful, and they come up with <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> interesting - positive and negative - and I get sucked into it.|$|E
5000|$|Julián Castro {{was born}} in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Maria [...] "Rosie" [...] Castro and Jessie Guzman. He is the {{identical}} twin brother of current United States Representative Joaquín Castro; Julián is one minute older than Joaquín, being born at 2:40AM and 2:41AM respectively. His mother was a Chicana political activist who helped establish the Chicano political party La Raza Unida, and who ran unsuccessfully for the San Antonio City Council in 1971. Castro once stated, [...] "My mother is probably the biggest reason that my brother and I are in public service. Growing up, she would take us {{to a lot of}} rallies and organizational meetings and other <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> boring for an 8-, 9-, 10-year-old". [...] His father, Jessie Guzman, is a retired mathematics teacher and political activist. Never married, Rosie and Jessie separated when Castro and his brother were eight years old. Castro's Texan roots trace back to 1920, when his grandmother, Victoria Castro, joined extended family members there as a six-year-old orphan from northern Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Her villa, La Mimoseraie, was {{the design}} {{laboratory}} {{in which she}} elevated simplicity to an art form. In 1910, wrote Richardson, [...] "she already stood out for the unconventional sparseness of her rooms, for her disdain of poufs and potted palms and too much passementerie.... She appreciated <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> fine and simple, above all, things made of linen, cotton, deal, or stone, whose quality improved with laundering or fading, scrubbing or polishing. She attended to the smallest detail in her house". For her, Elegance means elimination. Errazuriz hung curtains of unlined linen, and whitewashed the walls like a peasant's home - a shocking decorating approach in 1914. I love my house as it looks very clean and very poor! she boasted.|$|R

5000|$|Co-producer Richard Russell stated: [...] "It's {{definitely}} a different sound to anything he's had before. He's <b>been</b> <b>very</b> conceptual {{for the past}} few records he's done whereas this is one is just a personal record that's about him. He worked very hard to express <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> personal but to do it in an interesting way. That's what makes the record him. He brought me in to create a particular atmosphere and particular mood, so it's quite an atmospheric record with a certain palate of sounds and a certain rhythmic feel and very personal stuff." [...] "Heavy Seas of Love", with Brian Eno and The Leytonstone City Mission Choir, was played live by Albarn at a YouTube event, however the original studio version also leaked online.

5000|$|Phoebe and Ash later reunited, while Kyle and Ash {{decided to}} set [...] "aside their differences" [...] and support Phoebe. During an ultrasound, Phoebe learns {{that she had}} been {{pregnant}} with twins, but one had died. She was then informed that the surviving baby had a congenital heart defect and would be unlikely to live long past birth. Phoebe is advised to have an abortion, and Giovinazzo said that it was [...] "a hard decision for her to make". Phoebe opted not to terminate her pregnancy, but shortly after, she suffered a miscarriage. Giovinazzo described the pregnancy storyline as [...] "tumultuous". She also thought that Phoebe's personality had been affected by everything she endured, stating [...] "This question of family has changed her. She has grown a lot as a character and started to consider <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> new to her." [...] Giovinazzo added that Phoebe was prepared to care for another person, which was a big change. Phoebe eventually ended her relationship with Ash. When he wakes with no recollection of the night before and a strange woman in his flat, he admits to Billie that he thinks he cheated on Phoebe. The woman eventually returned to speak with him and he became convinced that he had cheated, so he told Phoebe, who walked away from him.|$|E
5000|$|Mowshowitz {{believes}} in a problem-based learning {{approach to teaching}} biology, emphasizing applying deeper principles over rote memorization of pathways and structures. She has stated that she assigns students advanced problems based on famous historical experiments in her introductory classes {{in order to encourage}} them to synthesize knowledge to solve problems. Some of the problems she has set on exams ask students to make the critical deductions in experiments which earned their original authors the Nobel Prize. She describes her approach to the course as intended to [...] "teach <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> fundamental, which have been known for a long time, along with whatever the latest developments are. And ... to relate it all to the lives of students". Asked about the difficulty of her class, Mowshowitz commented:A surprising number of people have the misconception that I'm teaching this advanced, super theoretical stuff. It's true that I cover a little bit of graduate-level bio, but only insofar as it helps my students understand the undergrad material. And because there are undergrads taking my class who finished college biology in high school, or are currently doing graduate-level research, and I want to keep them interested too. But regardless, most of what my class covers is the same as what you'd get {{in the first two years}} of biology anywhere else; I just try to go a little faster, and a little deeper.Her introductory biology course has been described as [...] "the most theoretically rigorous intro bio course in the United States" [...] and is available as a widely used massive open online course. In 1999, she received the Presidential Outstanding Teaching Award.|$|E

5000|$|Another <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> makes canon {{a little}} confusing. Gene R. himself {{had a habit}} of decanonizing things.

And - okay, I'm really going to scare you with this one - after he got TNG going, he... well... he sort of decided that some of The Original Series wasn't canon either.

So... the photography was creating a climate <b>that</b> <b>was</b> demanding <b>that</b> policy stay right with the photography. Now keep in mind, we were on two twelve hour shifts, but the policy-makers were only working eight to ten hours a day. So Lundahl raised the issue, maybe the policy-maker ought to be going into twelve hour shifts and then stay right with us at the centre as {{we were looking at}} the photography. Now that never occurred, but Lundahl raised the issue and later that would come up several times in crises in the future in which people did move into the centre." ...|$|R
