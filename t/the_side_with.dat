5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E

5|$|The coin was {{probably}} struck at Canterbury {{in the late}} 6th century, most likely between 578 and 589. Although {{it could have been}} used as a coin, it was more likely made as a medallion to proclaim the wearer's conversion to Christianity. The coin is the oldest surviving example of Anglo-Saxon coinage. The design of the figured side has some affinities with Merovingian and Visigothic coins, but <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> the cross has few known predecessors in coinage, and is the first northern European depiction of a patriarchal cross in any medium.|$|E

5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. <b>The</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|Dickov debuted for Blackburn Rovers as a half-time {{substitute}} against West Bromwich Albion on 14 August 2004. He scored {{his first}} {{goal for the}} club in the following match, a 3–2 defeat to Southampton. Dickov {{was involved in the}} majority of matches in the 2004–05 season, until a knee injury caused him to miss the last few weeks of the season. He finished the season with ten league goals. In 2005–06, Dickov found it hard to retain a regular place in <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>with</b> manager Mark Hughes having signed forwards Craig Bellamy and Shefki Kuqi during the summer. A red card against West Ham United caused him to miss most of the first month of the season. He had a run of first team games in the autumn but starting appearances became fewer as the season progressed. He left the club in the summer of 2006 following the expiry of his contract.|$|E
5|$|Former Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake became {{manager in}} 1952 and {{proceeded}} to modernise the club. He removed the club's Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League and the FA Chelsea were persuaded {{to withdraw from the}} competition before it started. Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.|$|E

5|$|On the October 11, 2004 {{edition of}} Raw, La Résistance {{had to defend}} the World Tag Team Championship in a match with Eugene and William Regal. Regal hit Sylvain Grenier {{with a pair of}} brass {{knuckles}} and pinned him to win the World Tag Team title. Eric Bischoff, however, restarted the match. The match resulted in La Résistance retaining the title, after Robért Conway jabbed Regal in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> a flagpole. Bischoff informed La Résistance that at Taboo Tuesday they were scheduled to defend the World Tag Team title against the two individuals who were not chosen to face Triple H for the World title. Shawn Michaels won the fans choice, which gave Edge and Chris Benoit a World Tag Team title match. Edge, however, abandoned Benoit during the match, which forced Benoit to wrestle both members of La Résistance by himself. Despite this, Benoit managed to force Conway to submit to the Crippler Crossface to win the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>with</b> the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{suffered}} {{a slow start}} to his 1883 campaign, failing to pass 10 runs in his first five innings. His improvements improved in his next three matches, highlighted by a half-century against Gloucestershire, scored during a 135 run partnership with Edward Sainsbury. His batting average for the season was almost half that of the previous year, and despite playing two additional innings he scored two less half-centuries than in 1882. In his first match for Somerset in 1884, Newton claimed his only wickets in first-class cricket. Bowling with a style that is not recorded on CricketArchive or Cricinfo, he claimed the wickets of Hampshire's Arthur Richards and HH Armstrong, both batsmen being caught off his bowling. Newton utilised himself as a bowler only after using every other member of <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of wicket-keeper Francis Terry. In his next match, Newton avoided a pair against Lancashire by top-scoring in Somerset's second innings with 62. That score {{was to be the}} last half-century of Newton's season, and his last in first-class cricket for Somerset. He added two further scores above 30 against Kent, scoring 46 and 31, He played three less innings than in the previous season, but surpassed his total runs from that season, and improved his average to 24.22. In his three years of first-class cricket for Somerset, he scored no centuries, five half-centuries, and averaged 24.56 with the bat, higher than he finished with any other first-class cricket side.|$|E
