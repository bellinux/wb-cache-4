25|$|Thus, {{it can be}} said that, {{the amount}} of good X1 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> consumes will {{increase}}, with an increase in the income of the consumer. Thus, the income–consumption curve for the perfect substitutes X1 and X2 will be the horizontal axis.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that consumers use information obtained from advertising {{not only to}} assess the single brand advertised, but also to infer the possible existence of brands <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> has, heretofore, not observed, {{as well as to}} infer consumer satisfaction with brands similar to the advertised brand.|$|E
30|$|I {{have been}} {{focusing}} {{on the relationship between}} the certification standard and the producer’s ideal, but the graph on the right (Fig.  4 b), which shows the zone when <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> has an ideal quality equal to 0.5, demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer’s</b> ideal is also important. When <b>the</b> <b>consumer’s</b> ideal quality falls, the top border of the zone of certification also falls. <b>The</b> reason is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer’s</b> trust in <b>the</b> certification standard convinces her <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> standard is near 1, the good is likely to have many more credence qualities than <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> prefers (<b>the</b> mean of V(Q) is 0.5). This mismatch of beliefs and preferences reduces <b>the</b> <b>consumer’s</b> willingness to pay for the good, decreases the certified price premium, and makes certification in the case of high standards less desirable for the producer.|$|R

25|$|The {{dry white}} wine is a wine without sugar (the sugar ratio is {{generally}} less than 4 grams per litre). It is a wine very difficult to develop because {{the balance of the}} wine is based on only two parameters: acidity and alcohol. This is the wine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> refers to when he speaks of white wine without giving further details.|$|E
25|$|At present, a retiree's {{benefit is}} {{annually}} {{adjusted for inflation}} to reflect changes in the consumer price index. Some economists argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> price index overestimates price increases {{in the economy and}} therefore is not a suitable metric for adjusting benefits, while others argue that the CPI underestimates the effect of inflation on what retired people actually need to buy to live.|$|E

30|$|Proposition 3 {{indicates}} <b>that</b> as <b>the</b> {{risk coefficient}} g for gains becomes higher, <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> raises his/her reservation value of low-value product and reduces his/her reservation value of high-value product. This implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer’s</b> purchase threshold for low-value product will be increased with {{the coefficient of}} risk attitude for gains, and <b>the</b> <b>consumer’s</b> purchase threshold for high-value product will be decreased with the coefficient of risk attitude for gains.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> {{probability}} <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> buy Prosecco CDO positively {{depends on}} several explanatory variables, for instance <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> belong to “post families”; are aged between 35 – 45, earn a high income {{and live in}} a small (two people) household. In addition, <b>the</b> probability <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> buy Prosecco CDO is positively affected by the purchase of the product at a hypermarket. On the contrary, <b>the</b> probability <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> buy Prosecco CDO, negatively depends on <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>consumers</b> belong to maturing families and/or older couples; are aged between 45 – 54; belong to a segment of low income earners and live in households composed of three members or more. If the purchase of the product is done at a discount market and the product price increases the probability of purchasing Prosecco CDO decreases.|$|R
25|$|Some {{economists who}} have studied {{proposals}} for universal healthcare worry <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> driven healthcare movement will reduce the social redistributive effects of insurance that pools high-risk and low-risk people together. This concern {{was one of the}} driving factors behind a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, informally known as Obamacare, which limited the types of purchases which could be made with HSA funds. For example, as of January 1, 2011, these funds can no longer be used to buy over-the-counter drugs without a medical prescription.|$|E
25|$|In economics, many {{problems}} involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods {{is determined by}} the process of maximization of the utilities derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> is faced with.|$|E
500|$|In economics, a consumer's {{preferences}} are defined over all [...] "baskets" [...] of goods. Each basket is {{represented as a}} non-negative vector, whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods. On this set of baskets, an indifference curve is defined for each consumer; a consumer's indifference curve contains all the baskets of commodities <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> regards as equivalent: That is, for every pair of baskets on the same indifference curve, the consumer does not prefer one basket over another. Through each basket of commodities passes one indifference curve. A consumer's preference set (relative to an indifference curve) is the union of the indifference curve and all the commodity baskets <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> prefers over the indifference curve. A consumer's {{preferences are}} convex if all such preference sets are convex.|$|E
5000|$|A reverse {{walkthrough}} is {{a process}} in which <b>the</b> reader or <b>consumer</b> of a technical product takes the author through it.

30|$|There are {{two types}} of events: consumer’s and {{internal}} to the FSM events. <b>The</b> <b>consumer’s</b> events are <b>the</b> commands (launch, application commands, reboot, stop and terminate) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumers</b> issues to operate his instance; likewise, internal events are events that occur independently from <b>the</b> <b>consumer’s</b> commands, namely, t i m e r[*]=[*] 60 m i n and failure.

500|$|The use of {{consumer}} slogans as song lyrics was also commented on by various sources. Critic Perry Gettelman interpreted them as meaning to [...] "signify {{the emptiness of}} modern, godless life". Kieran Keohane of York University stated that the slogans in [...] "Zooropa" [...] were to express an alienating form of interpellation, while J.D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun referred to the slogans as a parody of the economic hype used to pass the Maastricht Treaty, through the promising of impossibilities, such as [...] "Be a winner" [...] and [...] "Eat to get slimmer". English professor Kurt Koenigsberger of Case Western Reserve University stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> advertisements constitute Zooropa as a [...] "sardonically dystopic" [...] location. In the book Reading Rock and Roll, Robyn Brothers said that the song conveys a [...] "sense of confusion {{in the wake of}} a technology speeding beyond our control", while referencing the lyrics [...] "I hear voices, ridiculous voices / I'm in the slipstream". [...] Brothers also compared the song to [...] "Acrobat", stating both songs reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation.|$|E
2500|$|Society today {{revolves}} around technology {{and by the}} constant need for the newest and most high-tech products we are contributing to mass amount of e-waste. Since {{the invention of the}} iPhone, cell phones have become the top source of e-waste products because they are not made to last more than two years. Electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials. Up to 60 elements can be found in complex electronics. As of [...] 2013, Apple has sold over 796 million iDevices (iPod, iPhone, iPad). Cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> will purchase new phones. Companies give these products such short life spans because they know <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> will want a new product and will buy it if they make it. In the United States, an estimated 70% of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics.|$|E
2500|$|In 1725, {{the spread}} of {{vineyards}} throughout Bordeaux was so vast that it was divided into specific areas so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> could tell exactly where each wine was from. The collection of districts {{was known as the}} Vignoble de Bordeaux, and bottles were labeled with both the region and the area from which they originated. During this period, Nicolas-Alexandre, marquis de Ségur rose to prominence as the [...] "Prince of Vignes" [...] due to his ownership of some of Bordeaux's most prestigious estates and Pierre de Rauzan laid the foundation for Château Rauzan-Ségla, Château Rauzan-Gassies, Château Pichon Longueville Baron, and Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande.|$|E

2500|$|Large assortments offer {{consumers}} many benefits, notably increased {{choice and}} the possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> {{will be able to}} locate the ideal product. However, for the retailer, larger assortments incur costs in terms of record-keeping, managing inventory, pricing and risks associated with wastage due to spoiled, shopworn or unsold stock. Carrying more stock also exposes the retailer to higher risks in terms of slow-moving stock and lower sales per square foot of store space. [...] On the other hand, reducing the number of product lines can generate cost savings through increased stock turnover by eliminating slow-moving lines, fewer stockouts, increased bargaining power with suppliers, reduced costs associated with wastage and carrying inventory, and higher sales per square foot which means more efficient space utilisation.|$|E
2500|$|Consumer choice {{theory is}} based on the {{assumption}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> fully understands his or her own preferences, allowing for a simple but accurate comparison between any two bundles of good presented. That is to say, it is assumed that if a consumer is presented with two consumption bundles A and B each containing different combinations of n goods, the consumer can unambiguously decide if (s)he prefers A to B, B to A, or is indifferent to both. The few scenarios where it is possible to imagine that decision-making would be very difficult are thus placed [...] "outside the domain of economic analysis". However, discoveries in behavioral economics has found that actual decision making is affected by various factors, such as whether choices are presented together or separately through the distinction bias.|$|E
50|$|Revealed {{preference}} theory {{tries to}} understand the preferences of a consumer among bundles of goods, given their budget constraint.
