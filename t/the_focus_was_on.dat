5|$|In general, {{the show}} {{began to take}} on a more serious tone as a seriocomic (or dramedy) series, in which <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the {{character}} rather than the character type, and moved away from its status as a situation comedy.|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s onwards, {{stories about}} Brown were often {{included}} in local {{histories of the}} southeast of South Australia. Examples include Elma Smith's History of Kingston published in 1950, and Kingston Flashback written by local historian Verne McLaren and published in 1970. In Smith's version, the original crime was not discussed, and <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the horse ride to Adelaide, and McLaren's account split the legend into two, one about a poisoning by Brown, and another in which Brown and an accomplice cornered Aboriginal people in the Papineau caves, smoked them out and shot them. The second of McLaren's stories ended with Brown's famous ride to Adelaide {{to report to the}} police. Another account was included in Barry Durman's A History of the Baker's Range Settlement, published in 1978. Durman reproduced a newspaper article about the investigation into Brown's involvement in the murders, passed over the manner by which the murders were carried out and stated that the case was not proven, and then told of a wonderful feat of horsemanship by Brown.|$|E
5|$|Like most 2nd AIF units, the 2/4th drew its cadre {{staff of}} {{officers}} and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) from volunteers from local Militia units. These were augmented by partially trained Other Ranks (ORs) {{from the three}} local recruit training depots; the first batch of these, numbering 394 men, arrived at Northam on 27 November and a further 262 marched in on 4 December. As the battalion was brought up to its authorised strength of around 800 men, personnel were formed into four machine gun companies, 'A' to 'D', under a headquarters company consisting of several specialist platoons—including signals and anti-aircraft platoons—and battalion headquarters. There were no platoon commanders until a contingent arrived from the regional Officer Training Units. Initially training was hampered {{by a lack of}} equipment—only 12 of 48 Vickers machine guns assigned to the battalion were available—so at the start <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> individual rather than collective training. As more stores arrived, training accelerated with the help of experienced Militia NCOs and First World War veterans, who were brought in to share their experiences with the new troops. Just before Christmas and New Year's leave, the battalion received its distinctive Unit Colour Patch: a black and gold triangle.|$|E

50|$|This {{is unlike}} Student-centered learning, where <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{needs of the}} student, and also unlike Standards-based {{assessment}} where <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> institution achieving a specific level of learner proficiency.

Findings indicate that weak ties <b>are</b> vital when <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> explicit knowledge while strong ties <b>are</b> vital when <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> tacit knowledge.

25|$|In 2007, {{aripiprazole}} {{was approved}} by the FDA for the treatment of unipolar depression when used adjunctively with an antidepressant medication. That same year, BMS settled a case with the U.S. government in which it paid $515 million; the case covered several drugs but <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> BMS's off-label marketing of aripiprazole for children and older people with dementia.|$|E
25|$|Dhyana is contemplating, {{reflecting}} on whatever Dharana has focused on. If {{in the sixth}} limb of yoga one focused on a personal deity, Dhyana is its contemplation. If the concentration was on one object, Dhyana is non-judgmental, non-presumptuous observation of that object. If <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> a concept/idea, Dhyana is contemplating that concept/idea in all its aspects, forms and consequences. Dhyana is uninterrupted train of thought, current of cognition, flow of awareness.|$|E

25|$|A new theme tune {{marked the}} arrival of series 16 in September 2001, with a {{distinct}} change to the opening titles. For the first time, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the characters, who were presented posing to the camera against a blurred dark background. The only 'medical' references were the glimpses of an ambulance and a heart rate graphic in the opening seconds of the titles. The same logo introduced in 1997 remains at the end.|$|E

In the following 500mTT competition, she finished eighth, Australian Anna Meares winning this event.|$|E
25|$|Physics-oriented defense {{research}} {{started in}} Sweden during World War II, and drew many outstanding Swedish physicists to the Military Institute of Physics (MFI) founded in 1941. Here <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> conventional weapons. In 1945, MFI merged {{with two other}} organizations to form the Swedish National Defence Research Institute (FOA) in compliance with a 1944 proposal to reorganize the Swedish defense research. Research at the FOA was focused on such things as jet engines, rocket technology, shaped charge systems, and radars.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Italian opera of the day, {{which was}} rapidly moving toward opera seria with its {{alternating}} recitative and da capo airs, in Lully's operas <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> drama, expressed {{by a variety}} of vocal forms: monologs, airs for two or three voices, rondeaux and French-style da capo airs where the chorus alternates with singers, sung dances, and vaudeville songs for a few secondary characters. In like manner the chorus performed in several combinations: the entire chorus, the chorus singing as duos, trios or quartets, the dramatic chorus, the dancing chorus.|$|E
25|$|When Megan Meier's {{story was}} first {{reported}} in the St. Charles Journal, readers {{were concerned about the}} unnamed adults implicated in the hoax. Later, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the decision by the St. Louis Suburban Journals decision not to print the names of the Drews. In an interview, the reporter said that names had been withheld to protect the minor child in the family. Webloggers learned and reported the names of Lori and Gary Drew, after they found the latter in minutes. Media eventually revealed Lori Drew's name and published her photograph.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, for {{the second}} year running, England’s Food Standards Agency devoted its annual Food Safety Week to – “The Chicken Challenge”. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the {{handling}} of raw chicken in the home and in catering facilities in a drive to reduce the worryingly high levels of food poisoning from the campylobacter bacterium. Anne Hardy argues that widespread public education of food hygiene can be useful, particularly through media (T.V cookery programmes) and advertisement. She points to the examples set by Scandinavian societies.|$|E

Administrative data, underpinned by a National Address Register (yet to be established), includes public sector data obtained from government departments (e.g. HMRC) and agencies, (such as the DVLA), local authorities, electoral registers, the Annual School Census, the Higher Education Student Statistics database, and from the NHS Central Patients Register. From the private sector e.g. utility companies, retail and financial sectors, credit reference agencies and customer information systems.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} early {{societies}} <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> astronomy {{in order to}} perfect the agricultural calendar, and other practical tasks, and not on establishing formal systems.The Chinese Board of Mathematics duties were confined to the annual preparation of an almanac, the dates and predictions in which it regulated. Ancient Chinese mathematicians did not develop an axiomatic approach, but made advances in algorithm development and algebra. The achievement of Chinese algebra reached its zenith in the 13th century, when Zhu Shijie invented method of four unknowns.|$|E
25|$|While {{still under}} reorganization, the Language Acquisition Department until September 2012 {{investigated}} processes of language acquisition and {{use in a}} broad perspective. The department combined attention to both first and second languages, researching production as well as comprehension of speakers of different ages and cultures, and the developmental relationship between language and cognition. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> morpho-syntax, semantics and discourse structure. Headed by Wolfgang Klein, Language Acquisition previously launched three institute projects, namely, Information Structure in Language Acquisition, Categories in Language and Cognition and Multimodal Interaction. The Language Acquisition Department has reopened in 2016 heading by Caroline Rowland.|$|E
