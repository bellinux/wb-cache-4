5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E

25|$|Tab collars are point collars {{with two}} strips of fabric {{extending}} {{from the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> joined behind the tie. These lift the tie, giving an arc effect similar to a pinned collar. The tabs can be closed with a metal snap, button or stud.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. Ruffs were {{discarded}} {{in favor}} of wired collars which were called rebatos in continental Europe and, later, wide, flat collars. By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by kerchiefs similar to the linen kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> kerchief were trimmed with matching lace.|$|E
25|$|The {{peripheral}} {{circulatory system}} has the following components: the two branchial vessels and their branches in the crown; the periesophageal vascular plexuses; the vessels of <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> lips; the vessels supplying the body wall, thoracic membrane, and parapodia. The single vessels in each radiole of the branchial crown, and the vessels of opercula, are all {{branches of the}} two branchial vessels.|$|E
50|$|The Guides wore scarlet facings on <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> <b>and</b> cuffs {{of their}} khaki uniforms from their {{establishment}} in 1846.

25|$|The third jerseys of the Ducks {{were created}} in 1995, 1997, 2003, 2010 and 2015. The 1995 jersey was jade green with purple and white stripes on <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> {{on the end of}} the sleeves. The logo was of team mascot Wildwing wearing a Mighty Ducks jersey while {{breaking}} through a sheet of ice. The jersey was short-lived; as severe criticism encouraged management to retire the jersey at the end of the 1995–96 season.|$|E
25|$|The Governor-General is {{entitled}} to a special court uniform, consisting of a dark navy wool double-breasted coatee with silver oak leaf and fern embroidery on <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> cuffs trimmed with silver buttons embossed with the Royal Arms and with bullion edged epaulettes on the shoulders, dark navy trousers with a wide band of silver oak-leaf braid down the outside seam, silver sword belt with ceremonial sword, bicorne cocked hat with plume of ostrich feathers, black patent leather Wellington boots with spurs, etc., that is worn on ceremonial occasions. There is also a tropical version made of white tropical wool cut in a typical military fashion worn with a plumed helmet.|$|E
25|$|The {{picture on}} the right was {{published}} in Zurich in 1563, in Conrad Gesner's Thierbuch (a compendium of animals) with the captions: 'Englischen Blüthund' and 'Canis Sagax Sanguinarius apud Anglos' (English scent hound with associations of blood). It was drawn by, or under the supervision of, John Caius, and sent to Gesner with other drawings to illustrate his descriptions of British dogs for European readers. It is thus the earliest known picture published specifically to demonstrate {{the appearance of the}} Bloodhound. We are told it was done from life, and detail such as the soft hang of the ear indicates it was carefully observed. Fully accurate or not, it suggests changes between the Bloodhound of then and today. <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> long coiled rope reflect the Bloodhound’s typical functions as a limer or leashed man-trailer in that period.|$|E

25|$|In colonial times, a {{judge in}} Singapore dressed {{in a manner similar}} to some of his {{counterparts}} in the United Kingdom. He wore a long scarlet robe with a grey cape or mantle and a black scarf around his shoulders, a white wing-collared shirt, and bands (a linen collar made of two rectangular pieces tied at the throat). Subsequently, the ordinary and ceremonial dress worn by judges was adapted from two of the various forms of court dress of English courts. On 9 January 1993, at the Opening of the Legal Year, the Chief Justice announced that judges would henceforth wear a lightweight black robe over an ordinary white shirt with a turn-down collar and a tie. The difficulty of obtaining shirts with wing collars and the growing sense that the traditional gown was inappropriate for the judiciary of an independent republic were cited as reasons for this change. On ceremonial occasions such as the Opening of the Legal Year, Supreme Court judges wear red robes with a black strip around <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> extending down the front of the robe. The black strip on the Chief Justice's robe is edged with gold.|$|E
25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E

500|$|On October 28, 1880, popular Tombstone town marshal Fred White {{attempted}} {{to break up}} a group of five late-night, drunken revelers shooting at the moon on Allen Street in Tombstone. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt was in Owens Saloon a block away, though unarmed. When he heard the shooting, he ran to the scene, borrowed a pistol from Fred Dodge, and went to assist White. He saw White attempt to disarm Curly Bill Brocius and the gun discharged, striking White in the groin. Wyatt pistol-whipped Brocius, knocking him to the ground. Then he grabbed Brocius by <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> told him to get up. Brocius protested, asking, [...] "What have I done?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are short}} and roughly trapezoidal in shape. Two spineless dorsal fins are placed far {{back on the}} body, the first originating {{just ahead of the}} pelvic fins and the second located just behind. The second dorsal fin is slightly larger than the first, and the pelvic fins are larger than either. The anal fin is absent. The caudal fin is broad, with the lower lobe almost as large as the upper, which has a prominent ventral notch. The dermal denticles are squarish and flattened, with a slight central concavity and raised corners. The cookiecutter shark is chocolate brown in color, becoming subtly lighter below, and there is a dark [...] "collar" [...] that wraps around the gill region. The fins have translucent margins, except for the caudal fin, which has a darker margin. Complex, light-producing organs called photophores densely cover the entire underside, except for <b>the</b> <b>collar,</b> <b>and</b> produce a vivid green glow.

500|$|Patton {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} the same day, accompanied {{by a number of}} medical officers, as part of his tour of the U.S. II Corps troops. He spoke to some patients in the hospital, commending the physically wounded. He then approached Kuhl, who {{did not appear to be}} physically injured. Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt, Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was [...] "nervous" [...] rather than wounded, adding, [...] "I guess I can't take it." [...] Patton [...] "immediately flared up," [...] slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>and</b> dragged him to the tent entrance. He shoved him out of the tent with a kick to his backside.
