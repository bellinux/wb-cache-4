5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.|$|E

5|$|The Air Gates play a {{vital role}} in the Red Bull Air Race, but must also fulfill complex and {{contradictory}} demands.

The early cylindrical pylons fulfilled the first criterion but proved to be too unstable in the wind.|$|E

He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk.

Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E

Danny wakes from his mental explorations if he falls off the level or too high of a surface, is <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> a monster, or fails to stop a timer, but the C.R.U.S.H. device reinserts him at the start of the level or the last checkpoint Danny passed.|$|E
5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E

5|$|Laís Bodanzky {{read the}} biographical book Canto dos Malditos by Austregésilo Carrano Bueno {{for the first}} time in 1996, when she was signed to assist with the {{direction}} of a documentary on the subject. She found the book after entering a discussion and research group on mental health in Brazil. Impressed by its narrative, she asked Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it, as she knew he had a similar worldview and would have the respect necessary to work on the subject. Bolognesi was reluctant as he considered it a complicated subject; he was close to giving up until he read and was <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> Paulo Leminski's presentation of the book.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E

5|$|The demonologist Pierre de Lancre (1553–1631) {{boasted that}} even dead French monarchs could heal; it was, indeed, still {{believed}} in the 16th century that the healing power was retained by Saint Louis IX's arm, preserved in Poblet Monastery in Catalonia. In order to be <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the French king, people traveled from as far off as the present-day Italy and Spain already in the 13th century. The foreigners were ranked in a specific order, with the Spanish taking precedence over all others and the king's own subjects coming last.|$|E
5|$|The {{magistrate}} {{also made}} {{a survey of the}} spared parts of town from which it appears that 8,749former residents of the parts <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> fire had found new lodgings. It is estimated that as many as 15,000 had become homeless. This is about 20% of the population, which is estimated at 70,000. However the number of dead and wounded is unknown. It is possible to deduce some information from parish registers and other sources, but the number remains uncertain. It is probably low in comparison with the extent of the fire, though.|$|E
