50|$|ID <b>Trackback</b> is a <b>trackback</b> {{not for a}} {{specific}} blog entry but for the specific user. If a user links to another Hatena Diary in their own Hatena Diary, a <b>trackback</b> is added automatically. ID <b>Trackback</b> is used to inform other users about what a user mentions on their Hatena Diary, and is designed to accelerate interaction between users of the service.|$|R
40|$|The <b>TrackBack</b> protocol, {{conceived}} {{as a way to}} automatically link together web sites which reference one another, has become a new vector for spammers wishing to divert web surfers to their sites. A site which supports <b>TrackBack</b> allows any entity to inject arbitrary HTML code, plus the URL of the sender, into its pages; an attacker need only follow the <b>TrackBack</b> protocol to exploit the system and leverage such a site in a link farm. Current approaches to combating <b>TrackBack</b> spam are limited to content-based filters (of the sort currently used against email and weblog comment spam). In this paper, we propose a way to identify <b>TrackBack</b> spam by considering the relationship between the sender’s URL and the site under attack. In particular, we observe that, for spam <b>TrackBacks,</b> the page at the given URL does not link to the page to which the <b>TrackBack</b> was sent. We have developed software for weblog authors that rejects <b>TrackBacks</b> from sources lacking this reciprocal link. Data collected from our users demonstrates that this test is 100 % accurate at identifying and separating spam from legitimate <b>TrackBacks.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary blogs receive {{comments}} and <b>TrackBacks,</b> which result in cross-references between blogs. We conducted {{a longitudinal study}} of <b>TrackBack</b> spam, collecting and analyzing almost 10 million samples from a massive spam campaign over a one-year period. Unlike common delivery of email spam, the spammers did not use bots, but took advantage of an official Chinese site as a relay. Based on our analysis of <b>TrackBack</b> misuse found in the wild, we propose an authenticated <b>TrackBack</b> mechanism that defends against <b>TrackBack</b> spam even if attackers use {{a very large number}} of different source addresses and generate unique URLs for each Track-Back blog. 1...|$|R
50|$|Any of {{the four}} terms—Linkback, <b>Trackback,</b> Pingback, or (rarely) Refback—might also refer colloquially to items within a section upon the linked page that display the {{received}} notifications, usually along with a reciprocal link; <b>Trackback</b> is used most often for this purpose. Also, the word <b>Trackback</b> is often used colloquially to mean any kind of Linkback.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>TrackBack</b> {{specification}} {{was created}} by Six Apart, which first implemented it in its Movable Type blogging software in August 2002. The <b>TrackBack</b> has since been implemented in most other blogging tools. Six Apart started a working group in February 2006 to improve the <b>Trackback</b> protocol with the goal to eventually have it approved as an Internet standard by the IETF. One notable blogging service that does not support <b>trackback</b> is Blogger. Instead, Blogger provides [...] "backlinks", which allow users to employ Google's search infrastructure to show links between blog entries.|$|R
50|$|Some {{individuals}} or companies have abused the <b>TrackBack</b> feature to insert spam links on some blogs. This {{is similar to}} comment spam but avoids some of the safeguards designed to stop the latter practice. As a result, <b>TrackBack</b> spam filters similar to those implemented against comment spam now exist in many weblog publishing systems. Many blogs have stopped using <b>trackbacks</b> because dealing with spam became {{too much of a}} burden.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trackback</b> Submitter {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular link {{building}} tools used by spammers and users of black hat SEO. It abuses the feature called <b>Trackback</b> which allow bloggers to request notification when somebody links to one of their documents. Developed by an unknown spammer from Europe in September 2006, <b>Trackback</b> Submitter became very popular because of its ability to bypass comment spam protection used on popular blogging systems like WordPress.|$|R
50|$|Once <b>Trackback</b> Submitter {{was covered}} on Search Engine Journal and other popular SEO blogs, its {{popularity}} increased dramatically and some blog owners {{were forced to}} disable <b>trackback</b> feature or moderate each comment to prevent this software from hacking their spam protection plugins like Spam Karma and others.|$|R
50|$|A <b>trackback</b> is an {{acknowledgment}}. This acknowledgment is sent via {{a network}} signal (ping) from the originating site to the receiving site. The receptor often publishes a link {{back to the}} originator indicating its worthiness. <b>Trackback</b> requires both sites to be trackback-enabled {{in order to establish}} this communication.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Trackbacks</b> {{are used}} {{primarily}} to facilitate communication between blogs; if a blogger writes a new entry commenting on, or referring to, an entry found at another blog, and both blogging tools support the <b>TrackBack</b> protocol, then the commenting blogger can notify the other blog with a [...] "TrackBack ping"; the receiving blog will typically display summaries of, and links to, all the commenting entries below the original entry. This allows for conversations spanning several blogs that readers can easily follow.|$|R

5000|$|Sping {{is short}} for [...] "spam ping", and is related to pings from blogs using <b>trackbacks,</b> called <b>trackback</b> spam. Pings are {{messages}} sent from blog and publishing tools to a centralized network service (a ping server) providing notification of newly published posts or content. Spings, or ping spam, are pings that are sent from spam blogs, or are sometimes multiple pings in a short interval from a legitimate source, often tens or hundreds per minute, due to misconfigured software, or a wish to make the content coming from the source appear fresh.|$|R

40|$|We analyze a topological {{structure}} of networks formed {{according to the}} entries and <b>trackbacks</b> in the blogosphere, which {{is a collection of}} weblog articles. The analysis is performed based on community extraction, network visualization and keyword analysis. It is shown that the large-scale {{structure of}} the blogosphere has a globally sparse, but locally dense structure. The entries in a community yield a dense structure while the <b>trackbacks</b> that interconnect communities are sparse. The visualized results show sparkling-firework-like patterns. We then attempt to characterize the communities using a tf-idf technique. It is found that specific topics are discussed in each community. These results will help us to identify the communities in which certain specific topics discussed and to detect trends in the blogosphere.

50|$|A linkback is {{a method}} for Web authors to obtain {{notifications}} when other authors link {{to one of their}} documents. This enables authors to keep track of who is linking to, or referring to, their articles. The four methods (Refback, <b>Trackback,</b> Pingback and Webmention) differ in how they accomplish this task.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} of the booming {{blogosphere}} the term became important and useful to describe the emerging new content structures that were enabled by new technologies (like <b>trackbacks,</b> pings and increasingly RSS), new types of CMS-software and -interfaces (like blogs and wikis), and not least by new socio-cultural practices (people creating, bringing into circulation and re-using/re-mixing microchunks of content).|$|R

Social network analysis (SNA) is [...] "a discipline of social science that seeks to explain social phenomena through a structural interpretation of human interaction both as a theory and a methodology". There are certain links that occur in blogs, weblogs in this case, where they have different functions that portray different types of information such as Permalink, Blogrolls, Comments, and <b>Trackbacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed {{a variety of}} digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, <b>trackbacks,</b> and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during {{the first decade of}} the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.|$|R
50|$|Mullenweg left CNET in October 2005 {{to focus}} on WordPress and related {{activities}} full-time, announcing Akismet several days later. Akismet is a distributed effort to stop comment and <b>trackback</b> spam by using the collective input of everyone using the service. In December, he announced Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com and Akismet. Automattic employed people who had contributed to the WordPress project, including lead developer Ryan Boren and WordPress MU creator Donncha O Caoimh. An Akismet licensing deal and WordPress bundling was announced with Yahoo! Small Business web hosting about the same time.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>trackback</b> {{allows one}} website to notify another about an update. [...] It {{is one of}} four types of linkback methods for website authors to request {{notification}} when somebody links to one of their documents. This enables authors to keep track of who is linking to their articles. Some weblog software, such as SilverStripe, WordPress, Drupal, and Movable Type, supports automatic pingbacks where all the links in a published article can be pinged when the article is published. The term is used colloquially for any kind of linkback.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trackback</b> Submitter {{is based}} on the PHP {{programming}} language and works on Apache powered servers which have cURL and Zend Optimizer installed. The script uses unknown functions to find thousands of blogs which have comments posting enabled. Once the software finds a related blog, it generates random comments automatically (if not pre-defined by user) and submits these comments including one or more backlinks to the spammer's websites. Then the tool determines if the comment was accepted successfully and if so, the blog URL is added to a database for later use.|$|R
2500|$|Blogosphere: The {{collective}} {{community of}} all blogs and blog authors, particularly notable and widely read blogs, {{is known as}} the blogosphere. Since all blogs are on the internet by definition, they may be seen as interconnected and socially networked, through blogrolls, comments, linkbacks (refbacks, <b>trackbacks</b> or pingbacks), and backlinks. Discussions [...] "in the blogosphere" [...] are occasionally used by the media as a gauge of public opinion on various issues. Because new, untapped communities of bloggers and their readers can emerge {{in the space of a}} few years, Internet marketers pay close attention to [...] "trends in the blogosphere".|$|R
