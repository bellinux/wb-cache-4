A routing optimization model for multi-type containerships with time deadlines is established, and the target is to minimize the <b>total</b> <b>cost,</b> which consists of the <b>total</b> travelling <b>cost,</b> <b>total</b> service <b>cost</b> and <b>total</b> waiting <b>cost.</b> The model is set up through an improved genetic algorithm. The study data are from the Pearl River Delta region of China, which include 1 hub port and 29 feeder ports and have a population of 30 million. Result shows that when the iteration time reaches 190, the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> comes to 521 thousand yuan near the optimal value. There are 6 routes, including 3 containerships of 100 TEU, 2 containerships of 150 TEU and 1 containership of 200 TEU. At the same time, in the single-type containerships case, there are 7 routes, and when the iteration time reaches 120, the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> comes to 573 thousand yuan, which {{is close to the}} optimal value. Comparing the two cases, it shows that the model for multi-type containerships with time deadlines is reasonable, and the algorithm is practicable. In the last, three factors, which may affect the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> to carry out sensitivity analysis are chosen. It shows that time deadline, containership capacity and cargo handling capacity of each port have significant influence on the <b>total</b> <b>cost.</b> It is also shown that the <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> for multi-type containerships is always less than that for the single-type containerships...|$|R
