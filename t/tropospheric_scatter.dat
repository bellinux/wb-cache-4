40|$|With {{potential}} future {{deployment of}} high-density terrestrial communication sys-tems in metropolitan areas, it becomes necessary to estimate potential interference received at the Deep Space Network (DSN) Earth station from interfering sources {{distributed in the}} region. A fundamental parameter required for any realistic inter-ference analysis is the propagation loss from the transmitter to the receiver, which depends in a statistical way on the atmospheric conditions. This article introduces a method of constructing a map of propagation losses covering almost every possible location in the region, taking the terrain into account. The losses were computed with a high-resolution terrain map of the region as input, together with the heights of the transmitting and receiving antennas. The calculation includes three clear-air propagation mechanisms: diffraction, <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scattering,</b> and atmospheric ducting, {{in accordance with the}} algorithms given in the International Telecommu-nication Union Recommendation ITU-R P. 452. The resulting numerical database provides propagation-loss data necessary for interference calculations. To enhance visualization, these propagation-loss data are mapped in color. The color-coded propagation loss map provides a visible overview of the entire region of interest, indicating areas where emissions from the terrestrial sources would be effectively shielded by the terrain from reaching the DSN Earth stations, and where such emissions should be restricted for lack of terrain shielding.

40|$|The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) at UV, {{optical and}} NIR {{wavelengths}} {{consists of the}} integrated light of all unresolved galaxies {{along the line of}} sight plus any contributions by intergalactic matter including hypothetical decaying relic particles. The measurement of the EBL {{has turned out to be}} a tedious problem. This is because of the foreground components of the night sky brightness, much larger than the EBL itself: the Zodiacal Light (ZL), Integrated Starlight (ISL), Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL) and, for ground-based observations, the Airglow (AGL) and the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scattered</b> light. We have been developing a method for the EBL measurement which utilises the screening effect of a dark nebula on the EBL. A differential measurement in the direction of a high-latitude dark nebula and its surrounding area provides a signal that is due to two components only, i. e. the EBL and the diffusely scattered ISL from the cloud. We present a progress report of this method where we are now utilising intermediate resolution spectroscopy with ESO's VLT telescope. We detect and remove the scattered ISL component by using its characteristic Fraunhofer line spectral signature. In contrast to the ISL, in the EBL spectrum all spectral lines are washed out. We present a high quality spectrum representing the difference between an opaque position within our target cloud and several clear OFF positions around the cloud. We derive a preliminary EBL value at 400 nm and an upper limit to the EBL at 520 nm. These values are in the same range as the EBL lower limits derived from galaxy counts.

40|$|The {{impact of}} tropospheric {{aerosols}} on the retrieval of column ozone amounts using spaceborne measurements of {{backscattered ultraviolet radiation}} is examined. Using radiative transfer calculations, we show that uv-absorbing desert dust may introduce errors as large as 10 % in ozone column amount, depending on the aerosol layer height and optical depth. Smaller errors are produced by carbonaceous aerosols that result from biomass burning. Though the error is produced by complex interactions between ozone absorption (both stratospheric and <b>tropospheric),</b> aerosol <b>scattering,</b> and aerosol absorption, a surprisingly simple correction procedure reduces the error to about 1 %, {{for a variety of}} aerosols and {{for a wide range of}} aerosol loading.

40|$|In {{land mobile radio}} communications, it is {{well known}} that almost 95 % of the radio links between {{transmitter}} and receiver are non-line-of-sight. The propagation loss between transmitter and receiver is heavily dependent on the terrain features. Hence, this thesis examines and improves the CRC propagation loss prediction in two main aspects. [...] One is to create a higher resolution and more accurate digital terrain data base based on the CRC data base. The developed procedure is as follows. For a given area of interest first the complete quadratic two-dimensional interpolation for elevations and the weighted vote method for surface codes are applied to augment the CRC data base from 500 meters spacing to 100 meters spacing. If the contour from the augmented data base is not checked with the topographic map, then the data of missed critical terrain features are taken directly from the topographic map and are used to correct the augmented data base. In this step, the triangular interpolation scheme is introduced to modify the elevations, and the weighted vote method is used to modify the surface codes. There are eight surface codes which indicate tree, bare ground, fresh water, suburban, marsh, seawater, urban core and unknown type. As the result of the modified data base, the evaluations of diffraction, reflection, <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scattering,</b> urban, and season losses are more accurate. Thus, the total propagation loss prediction is greatly improved. [...] As another major work in this thesis, the modified diffraction loss prediction model is proposed. It involves: (a) for the implementation of the de Assis method, the radius of curvature of rounded obstacles' crest is determined by least-squares parabolic fitting; (b) the Deygout correction factor is first applied to deal with multiple rounded obstacles which are close to each other; (c) based on the availability of much more detailed information from the modified data base, all the defineable obstacles in a path profile are taken into account in the diffration loss prediction. [...] It is shown that our propagation loss prediction results are close to CRC results when the terrain is smooth; but in the irregular terrain, our results provide a substantial improvement...|$|R
40|$|The Monte Carlo cloud {{scattering}} {{forward model}} (McClouds_FM) {{has been developed}} to simulate limb radiative transfer {{in the presence of}} cirrus clouds, for the purposes of simulating cloud contaminated measurements made by an infrared limb sounding instrument, e. g. the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). A reverse method three-dimensional Monte Carlo transfer model is combined with a line-by-line model for radiative transfer through the non-cloudy atmosphere to explicitly account for the effects of multiple scattering by the clouds. The ice cloud microphysics are characterised by a size distribution of randomly oriented ice crystals, with the single scattering properties of the distribution determined by accurate calculations accounting for non-spherical habit. A comparison of McClouds_FM simulations and real MIPAS spectra of cirrus shows good agreement. Of particular interest are several noticeable spectral features (i. e. H 2 O absorption lines) in the data that are replicated in the simulations: these can only be explained by upwelling <b>tropospheric</b> radiation <b>scattered</b> into the line-of-sight by the cloud ice particles.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{emissions}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC) in the troposphere and their consecutive degradation in presence of nitrogen oxides, result {{in the production of}} secondary products like ozone, nitric oxide and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN). These pollutants seriously affect the environment and human health. In addition, certain VOCs contribute to the production of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), which also affect human health, act as substrates for heterogeneous chemical reactions, affect <b>tropospheric</b> chemistry and <b>scatter</b> solar radiation modifying atmospheric radiative forcing. A considerable percentage of these emissions, are due to the use of organic compounds as solvents i. e. compounds able to dissolve, suspend or extract other materials, without any chemical reactions to occur. This percentage in Europe is about 25 % of total anthropogenic {{emissions of}} non methane VOC. The understanding of the environmental changes due to the anthropogenic activities is facilitated by the study of the impact of solvent use emissions on tropospheric chemistry, both on local and global scales. In addition, because volatile compounds present different ability to produce pollutants, it is of particular interest to investigate if possible replacements of solvents in use with other new compounds, could lead in reduction of pollutant concentrations. Such global estimates are prohibited by the large number of species used as solvents today and hence, by the even greater number of chemical species that are involved in their atmospheric chemical degradation. To overpass these limitations for global models, a small number of compounds must be selected to represent in the model all solvents in use today. In addition a reduced degradation scheme has to be used, to maintain a limited number of chemical species suitable for consideration into a global model. The aim of the present study is the estimate of the impact of solvents in use and of their possible replacement with selected oxygenated compounds, on the oxidizing power of the atmosphere and particularly on ozone, nitric oxide, PAN and SOA levels. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{potentially}} harmful solar UV-B radiation is attenuated {{on its way}} through the atmosphere by absorption by stratospheric and <b>tropospheric</b> ozone and <b>scattering.</b> This study presents spectral measurements of solar UV-radiation, the development of the elaboration method and the atmospheric ozone amounts calculated therewith. Diurnal variations of UV-B spectra between 290 and 320 nanometers were measured in Bayreuth (50 N) in summer 1992 and 1993. In addition, on elected days with few clouds, direct radiation was occulted and relation between diffuse and global radiation in UV and visible bands was measured - on the one hand to gain the direct radiation for the model calculation, on the other hand to assess the influence of scattering by aerosol particles. Data were processed with computer programs (Schreiber 1993) which were improved and extended to subsequently correct errors like wavelength shifts of the monochromator and other reconstructable deviations, and to calculate spectra of direct radiation from the measurements. With a simple radiation model, the total ozone amount of the atmsophere at the measurement site was calculated from these spectra. The height of the atmospheric ozone column could be determined with a variation range mostly less than 1 %. The results coincided well with data from Hohenpeissenberg in southern Bavaria (Deutscher Wetterdienst 1992 + 1993 a). During most days with few clouds, an increase of total ozone of about 2 - 5 % could be observed. The diurnal variation of the total ozone shows on these days a similar curve as measurements of the surface ozone in Oberwarmensteinach, situated about 20 km from Bayreuth at 400 m higher level. The measured increase of total ozone during most days can only partly be explained by the photochemical formation of surface ozone - therefore the diurnal variation had to continue until several km height. Measurements close to Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Fraunhofer-Institut 1992), however, show that this diurnal variation decreases with increasing height. The spectral course of relation between diffuse and global radiation shows typical shapes for identical sun elevation angles. For solar elevations above 35 the total ozone could be determined exactly, even when measurements from different days with equal elevation angles were used. The relation between diffuse and direct radiation was higher on nearly all afternoons than before noon, which {{can be explained by the}} increase of aerosol particle amount because of convection processes starting during the day.
