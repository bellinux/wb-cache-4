25|$|Casino (1995), like The Age of Innocence before it, {{focused on}} a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is {{disrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Casino was a box office success, but the film received mixed notices from critics. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier Goodfellas, and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. Indeed, many of the tropes and <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. Sharon Stone was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.|$|E

25|$|While the Loch Ness monster {{is often}} {{reported}} as {{looking like a}} plesiosaur, it is also often described as looking completely different. A number of reasons have been presented for why a plesiosaurian identity is unlikely. These include {{the assumption that the}} water in the loch is too cold for a, for the sake of this argument, presumed cold-blooded reptile to be able to survive easily, the assumption that air-breathing animals would be easy to see whenever they appear at the surface to breathe, the fact that the loch is too small and contains insufficient food to be able to support a breeding colony of large animals, and finally the fact that the lake was only formed 10,000 years ago {{at the end of the}} last ice age, while the latest fossil appearance of plesiosaurs dates to over 66 million years ago. Frequent explanations for the sightings include waves, floating inanimate objects, <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light, swimming known animals, and practical jokes. Nevertheless, in the popular imagination, plesiosaurs have come to be identified with the Monster of Loch Ness. This has had the advantage of making the group better known to the general public, but the disadvantage that people have trouble taking the subject seriously, forcing paleontologists to explain time and again that plesiosaurs really did exist and are not creatures of myth or fantasy.|$|E

Billy Horner compared him with Malcolm Poskett, and stated the only quality missing in Houchen's game was aggression. Horner and his coaching team of George Smith and Willie Maddren taught Houchen how to protect himself from the highly physical centre-halves that dominated the division, and the youngster learned how to hold the ball up and bring other players into the attack.|$|E

In June, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Institute for selling over 100,000 copies which helped the band clear <b>the</b> £400,000 <b>of</b> debt (equivalent to £ in [...] ). they owed when Gabriel left.

From March to July 1976, Genesis performed across North America and Europe with <b>the</b> A <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail tour, to enthusiastic crowds. Collins adopted a more humorous rapport with the audience, unlike Gabriel's theatrical approach, which was successful.

2500|$|During bidding, a team may declare either Big Mo or Little Mo, {{meaning they}} intend {{to take the first}} several tricks.

[...] or some similar question to determine how many tricks the teammate can contribute to the Mo without revealing any details as to which tricks they'll take. [...] The only detail that can be discussed is which teammate will be leading the first trick but not how they will be leading. [...] If a team declares Little Mo, they must take the first 7 <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand. [...] Accomplishing the Little Mo earns the team 150 points. [...] If a team declares Big Mo, they must take the first 10 <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand. [...] Accomplishing the Big Mo earns the team 250 points. [...] Taking more consecutive tricks than needed does not earn the team more points. [...] For instance, taking the first 10 tricks when a Little Mo had been declared still only earns the team 150 points. [...] The team that declares either Mo is immune to bags for that hand and will lead the first trick, regardless of whose turn it was to lead. [...] Failure to accomplish the declared Mo (the opposing team took a trick before the goal was met) will cause the team to lose the points they would have earned had they been successful. [...] This is true regardless of how many tricks they took before or after the opposing team took a trick. [...] The other team bids and must match their bid, as usual. [...] It's not unusual for a team that could do a Big Mo to declare a Little Mo to play it safe and then take the extra tricks to try to set their opponents.|$|E
2500|$|After The Old Vic season ended, Burton's {{contract}} with Fox {{required him to}} do three more films. The first was Prince of Players (1955), where he was cast as the 19th-century Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth, who was John Wilkes Booth's brother. Maggie McNamara played Edwin's wife, Mary Devlin Booth. Philip thought the script was [...] "a disgrace" [...] to Burton's name. The film's director Philip Dunne observed, [...] "He hadn't mastered yet the <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great movie stars, such as Gary Cooper, who knew them all. The personal magnetism Richard had on the sound stage didn't come through the camera." [...] This was one aspect that troubled Richard throughout his career on celluloid.

2500|$|... "Tchaikovsky {{was made}} for ballet," [...] writes musicologist David Brown Before him, musicologist Francis Maes writes, ballet music was written by specialists, such as Ludwig Minkus and Cesare Pugni, [...] "who wrote nothing else and knew all the <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trade." [...] Brown {{explains}} that Tchaikovsky gifts for melody and orchestration, his ability to write memorable dance music with great fluency and his responsiveness to a theatrical atmosphere made him uniquely qualified in writing for the genre. Above all, Brown writes, he had [...] "an ability to create and sustain atmosphere: above all, a faculty for suggesting and supporting movement ... animated by an abundant inventiveness, above all rhythmic, within the individual phrase." [...] In comparing Tchaikovsky to French composer Léo Delibes, whose ballets Tchaikovsky adored, Brown writes that while the two composers shared similar talents, the Russian's passion places him in a higher league {{than that of the}} Frenchman. Where Delibes' music remains decorative, Tchaikovsky's touches the senses and achieves a deeper significance. Tchaikovsky's three ballets, Maes says, forced an aesthetic re-evaluation of music for that genre.|$|E

2500|$|There {{followed}} what Jenkins calls [...] "seven extremely lean years". Asquith {{set up a}} {{legal practice}} with two other junior barristers. With no personal contacts with solicitors, he received few briefs. Those that came his way he argued capably, {{but he was too}} fastidious to learn the wilier <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal trade: [...] "he was constitutionally incapable of making a discreet fog… nor could he prevail on himself to dispense the conventional patter". He did not allow his lack of money to stop him marrying. His bride, Helen Kelsall Melland (c.1855–1891), was the daughter of Frederick Melland, a physician in Manchester. She and Asquith had met through friends of his mother's. The two had been in love for several years, {{but it was not until}} 1877 that Asquith sought her father's consent to their marriage. Despite Asquith's limited income—practically nothing from the bar and a small stipend from his fellowship—Melland consented after making inquiries about the young man's potential. Helen had a private income of several hundred pounds a year, and the couple lived in modest comfort in Hampstead. They had five children: Raymond (1878–1916), Herbert (1881–1947), Arthur (1883–1939), Violet (1887–1969) and Cyril (1890–1954).|$|E
2500|$|Hobby players often add the {{following}} rule: 10s are lower in trick taking power than Queens and Kings, but still count as ten points. Sometimes, they only count one point.

Often, the players are allowed to check and exchange cards with the skat, or decline to do so and pass the skat on to the next player, doubling the score (German: Schieberamsch). Jacks are not allowed to be passed on in this variation. The two cards in the Skat are usually added to the <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player who takes the last trick. After all ten tricks are played, the player with the highest number of card points (or alternatively, every player) has their card points amount deducted from their score as negative game points.
