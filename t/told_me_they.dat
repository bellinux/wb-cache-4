500|$|The Blue Jays drafted Loup in {{the ninth}} round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything and then my phone rang and I got the call. It's exciting. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> would call {{me as soon as}} the draft was over and we would discuss details, so hopefully everything will shake out." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenneth {{references}} the 1987 thriller film Fatal Attraction after encouraging Liz to {{meet with}} her [...] "future husband" [...] and deeming it a romantic situation, saying [...] "Just like that movie I only saw the first 10 minutes of, Fatal Attraction!". The movie is about a married man who has a weekend affair {{with a woman who}} refuses to end the affair as she becomes obsessed with him. In addition, Jane Krakowski appeared in Fatal Attraction. Kenneth later has a dream that seems to be influenced by the movie The Shining, telling Jenna, [...] "Late at night these two little twin girls <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> wanted to play with me forever." [...] He also references the story of Lot and his daughters from the Bible, and a vignette from Saved by the Bell involving characters Samuel [...] "Screech" [...] Powers and Lisa Turtle.|$|E

They all said it--every one of them. But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do {{it no more}} --I won't, honest." ...|$|R

500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> weren't taking me out of the game, so I figured, what the heck, I might as well get the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
500|$|On {{the final}} cut privilege, Spielberg was {{dissatisfied}} with the film. Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. [...] "I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> needed this film out immediately," [...] Spielberg explained. [...] "Anyway, Close Encounters was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted {{to make my own}} director's cut. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the mothership so they could have something to hang a [...] campaign on. I never should have shown the inside of the mother ship." [...] In 1979, Columbia gave Spielberg $1.5million to produce what became the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by a total of ten minutes, so that the Special Edition was three minutes shorter than the original 1977 release. The Special Edition featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the SS Cotopaxi in the Gobi Desert, and a view of the inside of the mothership. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition was released in August 1980, making a further $15.7million, accumulating a final $303.7million box office gross. Roger Ebert [...] "thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. ... This new version ... is, quite simply, a better film ... Why didn't Spielberg make it this good the first time?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Christie {{has denied}} involvement, {{saying that his}} staff acted without his {{knowledge}} regarding to the planning for the lane closures. He said at an April 2014 town hall meeting: [...] "if anybody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> {{were going to do}} this, I would have stopped it".|$|E
2500|$|He {{also said}} [...] "the {{whole thing was}} about ... them setting their own minimum wage.

2500|$|Verna is the matriarch of the Sawyer family. According to Taylor, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to Leatherface {{was really}} {{talking with the}} directors. When they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> {{wanted to do something}} that was a cross between Terrence Malick, like Badlands, and The Virgin Suicides, I thought 'I'm there' because what I love is this stuff that's happening with people pushing a genre as far as they could push it and it's exciting to me." [...] Taylor chose to concentrate more on Verna's maternal instincts for her family than her murderous ways, with the character having a denial or compartmentalization about her motherhood and the murder. The film reunites Taylor with Stephen Dorff, who both starred in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol.|$|E
2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There was a {{guy named}} Dan Jones who was then about 60years old, who was a wino {{who lived in a}} fleabag in the bad part of town. Jones was well known to rescue. In June of '69 they got a call—man down—it was Jones. They put the paddles on him, he was in VF, started CPR, zapped him, he came back to sinus rhythm, brought him into ER and three days later he was out and walking around. In gratitude, about a week later, he came down to Station 1, which he had never done before, and he {{said he would like to}} talk to the man who saved his life. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> had never seen Dan Jones in a clean shirt and sober, both of which he was that day. He would {{periodically}} come to the fire house and just say hello and he seemed to be sober. In my talks in those days I said this was the new cure for alcoholism. That was our first true save." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the final}} day of the inquest held at the coroner’s court, Dacre and other Mail {{executives}} had lunch with Sir Paul Condon, then Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, [...] "who very eloquently <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were as guilty as sin". Four of the five suspects had never provided any alibi for their whereabouts on the night of Stephen Lawrence's murder and they invoked the privilege against self incrimination to avoid giving evidence and exposing themselves to cross examination. The police believed that the alibi of the fifth suspect was unconvincing. The newspaper on 14 February 1997, under its headline asserted: [...] "The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us". No claim was issued and the newspaper received significant acclaim and opprobrium as a result. Two of the men featured on the Mail front page were convicted of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012. Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian wrote of the development: [...] "He made an unlikely anti-racist campaigner, but there were few voices more critical in the demand for justice for Stephen Lawrence than Paul Dacre and the Daily Mail.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is an array of love songs, with songs such as [...] "My Boy" [...] and [...] "Girl" [...] portraying Duffy in a {{protective}} manner, with respect to her lover. On [...] "Breath Away", Duffy laments that her lover is [...] "taking her breath away." [...] "Hard for the Heart" [...] questions the difficulties involved with falling in love. Elsewhere, Duffy also took inspiration from her own life experiences. [...] "Too Hurt to Dance" [...] was subconsciously written about Duffy's friend who [...] "lost her mum aged ten". Duffy continued, [...] "she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> played [...] "Unchained Melody" [...] at her mum's funeral. I now realise my lyric comes from seeing my friend at the school disco, shaking, {{her face in her}} hands, while the other kids were smooching to this song". The following track, [...] "Keeping My Baby" [...] was written in a similar way, as Duffy only released the song is about the fact that [...] "one aunt told her she'd end up a single mother on benefits", as it is [...] "sung {{from the point of view}} of a pregnant girl".|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, artist Matt Haley and Twin Peaks {{producer}} Bob Engels {{began work}} on a graphic novel continuation of the series, {{to be included in}} the [...] "Complete Mystery" [...] DVD box set. Haley stated: [...] "Bob and I had a number of discussions about what the story would be, I was keen to use whatever notes they had for the proposed third season. I really wanted this to be a literal 'third season' of the show. Bob <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> really wanted to get away from the high school setting, so after the resolution of the Cooper-BOB-possession plot point, they would have cut to something like 'Ten Years Later', and then shown us a Twin Peaks where Cooper had quit the FBI and had become the town pharmacist, Sheriff Truman had become a recluse, etc. He also mentioned they were going to have Sheryl Lee come back, this time as a redhead, and probably have her character killed by BOB again. There were also some vague ideas about BOB and Mike being from a planet made of creamed corn, something about Truman driving Mike backwards through the portal into the Black Lodge (which I think would have been a really nice cinematic scene)." [...] Lynch vetoed the project, stating that he respected the effort but did not want to continue the story of Twin Peaks in any way.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether James Dean and Adams met before his {{service in the}} United States Coast Guard (1952–1955) and subsequent role in Rebel Without a Cause (1955). In his 1986 gossip book about gay Hollywood, Conversations with My Elders, Boze Hadleigh claimed actor Sal Mineo told him in 1972, [...] "I didn't hear it from Jimmy (James Dean), who was sort of awesome to me when we did Rebel. But Nick <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> had a big affair." [...] Journalist, screenwriter and author of books about Hollywood, John Gregory Dunne wrote that [...] "James Dean was bisexual, as were Nick Adams and Sal Mineo." [...] In his book Elvis (1981) Albert Goldman wrote, [...] "Nick Adams ingratiated himself with James Dean precisely as he would do {{a year or so}} later with Elvis. He offered himself to the shy, emotionally contorted and rebellious Dean, as a friend, a guide, a boon companion, a homosexual lover -- whatever role or service Dean required." [...] According to Eric Braun, [...] "Elvis was attracted by Adams' outgoing personality and the young actors caused quite a stir, cruising round Los Angeles with Natalie Wood, Russ Tamblyn and others on their Hondas." [...] In 2005, Byron Raphael and Presley biographer Alanna Nash wrote that Adams may have [...] "swung both ways" [...] like [...] "Adams' good pal (and Elvis' idol) James Dean. Tongues wagged that Elvis and Adams were getting it on." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} received media criticism {{due to her}} American accent {{upon her}} reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, [...] "I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart." [...] However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the Daily Mirror describing it as [...] "hilarious" [...] and branding the character [...] "Go Away Again Vicki". [...] He added, [...] "Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys." [...] Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: [...] "When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that {{for a few months}} and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent - but it was nothing to do with me. I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Love {{remembers that}} Capitol's working {{title for the}} album was Our Freaky Friends, and that the label planned the cover shoot at the zoo, with the animals {{representing}} the group's [...] "freaky friends". In May, the San Diego Union reported that the group [...] "came down from Hollywood to take a cover picture for their forthcoming album Our Freaky Friends.... Zoo officials were not keen about having their beloved beasts connected with {{the title of the}} album, but gave in when the Beach Boys explained that animals are an 'in' thing with teenagers. And that the Beach Boys were rushing to beat the rock and roll group called The Animals." [...] Asher remembered: [...] " [...] had some proofs of the pictures they'd done at the zoo, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were thinking of calling the album Pet Sounds. I thought it was a goofy name for an album – I thought it trivialized what we had accomplished." [...] Until arriving to the photo shoot, Jardine thought that [...] "pet" [...] referred to slang for making out ("petting"). Jardine also expressed disappointment with the chosen cover, believing it was [...] "crazy" [...] to go to the zoo, that [...] "the art department screwed up pretty badly on that one... wanted a more sensitive and enlightening cover." [...] Author Peter Doggett writes that the design was at odds with the increasingly sophisticated cover portraits used on releases by artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan over 1965–67. He highlights it as [...] "a warning of what could happen when music and image parted company: songs of high romanticism, an album cover of stark banality." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then I {{went to the}} heath and the wild, [...] To the thistles and thorns of the waste; [...] And <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how <b>they</b> were beguiled, [...] Driven out, and {{compelled}} to the chaste.|$|R
