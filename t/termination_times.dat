40|$|We {{consider}} the Hegselmann-Krause model for opinion dynamics {{and study the}} evolution of the system under various settings. We first analyze the <b>termination</b> <b>time</b> of the synchronous Hegselmann-Krause dynamics in arbitrary finite dimensions and show that the <b>termination</b> <b>time</b> in general only depends on the number of agents involved in the dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, that is the sharpest bound for the <b>termination</b> <b>time</b> of such dynamics that removes dependency of the <b>termination</b> <b>time</b> from the dimension of the ambient space. This answers an open question in [1] on how to obtain a tighter upper bound for the <b>termination</b> <b>time.</b> Furthermore, we study the asynchronous Hegselmann-Krause model from a novel game-theoretic approach and show that the evolution of an asynchronous Hegselmann-Krause model is equivalent to a sequence of best response updates in a well-designed potential game. We then provide a polynomial upper bound for the expected time and expected number of switching topologies until the dynamic reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of its equilibrium points, provided that the agents update uniformly at random. This is a step toward analysis of heterogeneous Hegselmann-Krause dynamics. Finally, we {{consider the}} heterogeneous Hegselmann-Krause dynamics and provide a necessary condition for the finite <b>termination</b> <b>time</b> of such dynamics. In particular, we sketch some future directions toward more detailed analysis of the heterogeneous Hegselmann-Krause model.

This paper presents a pedagogical derivation of a family of atomic broadcast protocols that are tolerant of increasingly general failure classes: omission failures, timing failures, and authentication-detectable Byzantine failures.

In this study, we examined whether the target prevalence effect occurs in a haptic search task by using artificial tactile maps.

Moreover, an increase in miss rates in the low-prevalence condition (10 %) was strongly correlated with a decrease in search <b>termination</b> <b>times</b> (target-absent reaction times). These {{results suggest that the}} prevalence effect on haptic search is caused by a decrease in the search termination time and a shift in decision criterion and a decrease in sensitivity...|$|E

This inference-based approach allows us to incorporate richer probabilistic models into the track-ing system.

We test our mechanism by eliciting beliefs about the <b>termination</b> <b>times</b> of a stochastic process in an experimental setting. We conduct two treatments, one with high and one with low volatility. Increasing the underlying volatility affects {{the location of the}} interval, yet it does not significantly affect its length. Consequently, individuals perform significantly better in the low volatility treatment than in the high volatility treatment. Next, we construct distributions by aggregating intervals across different individuals. Our results reveal that the predictive quality of the aggregated intervals (as measured by the Hellinger distance to the true distribution) increases by more than 30 % when increasing the aggregation level from two to eight individuals. This shows that aggregating individual intervals may be an attractive solution when market mechanisms are infeasible...|$|E
