Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war.

Some studies present the elasticity for a benchmark (average) observation, others an elasticity of <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> of <b>work</b> in the whole group for a uniform wage rate increase, some even present an average of the elasticities for all observations.

In this case, the analysis is restricted to those women who remain employed throughout the four quarters of each follow-up period. We estimate the treatment effect using the two-step Heckman selection model which allows us to correct the selection bias arising from female labor participation. This will be represented by the probability of women being employed during the whole monitoring period. To measure labor intensity, we calculate the change in the <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> per week normalized by the intertemporal average labor intensity of each woman. To carry out this methodology, we assume that there are certain women’s characteristics that affect both labor participation and intensity (age, education, region) while others are specific explanatory factors of the <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> or the probability of being employed.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{the sample}} covers all wage earners in private, public and state {{enterprises}} who report their wages {{and the number}} of hours worked in the week preceding the survey. As the minimum wage law in Thailand primarily determines the basic wage for regular working hours – hourly wages excluding other compensation such as bonuses, over-time, clothes or any other benefits – these are used. Hourly wages are calculated from basic wage divided by <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> for principal occupation. In several cases, the <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> may contain hours of over time work. Since employers are required by law to pay over-time at a rate that is at least 50 % higher than hourly wages during regular hours, I compare information on basic wage with over time payment adjusted by 1.5 in order to obtain the proportion of regular hours worked from the number of <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> <b>worked.</b> Although this procedure might overestimate the number of regular hours worked, it should provide a lower bound for the observed hourly wage.|$|E

40|$|Although demographics, cohort, {{and contextual}} factors are {{expected}} to influence physician supply at the intensive margin, {{much of the literature}} has examined the demographics and very limited cohort analysis is undertaken. This paper employs a cross-classified fixed-effects methodology to examine the importance of age, period and cohort, and contextual factors in explaining the declining <b>work</b> <b>hours</b> of Canadian family physicians. We define cohorts with five-year intervals according to year of graduation from medical school. Contrary to the previous literature, we find no evidence of reduced <b>hours</b> of <b>work</b> provided by the new cohorts of physicians. Compared to the 1995 - 99 cohort, older male cohorts perform similar <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> of <b>work</b> per week except those who graduated in the 1960 's while older female cohorts consistently perform fewer <b>total</b> <b>work</b> <b>hours</b> in the range of 3 - 10 Â h per week. Consistent with the literature, it is found that female and older physicians provide fewer <b>hours</b> of <b>work</b> compared to the male and younger counterparts, respectively. Although there has been a decline in <b>total</b> <b>hours</b> of <b>work</b> for all physicians in the range of 2 - 3 Â h per week in each period, we find a large decline in direct patient care hours (about 4 - 6 Â h) and a marginal increase in indirect patient care (about 2 - 4 Â h) over the period. Having children less than 6 years and children aged 6 - 15 years in the physician's family reduce the <b>work</b> <b>hours</b> of female family physicians by about 7 Â h and 3 Â h, respectively.
