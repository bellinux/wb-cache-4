40|$|Regulation (EC) No 178 / 2002 {{establishes}} a {{rapid alert system}} for food and feed, as a network managed by the Commission and involving the Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority. It is necessary to have a complete view of the “system”. Inside the reg. 178 / 2002 you can see articles: 35 (Rapid alert system); in Chapter IV (Rapid alert system, crisis management and emergencies) : Section I (Rapid alert system), articles 50 - 52; Section 2 (Emergencies), articles 53 - 54; Section 3 (Crisis management), articles 55 - 56. Therefore, this “system” should not be reduced only into the articles 50 - 52 of the Reg. 178 / 2002, involving regulations, procedures, conditions, providing into a complex interaction about different subjects public and private. From some, or specific aspects of the question other regulations take off again, for example: Regulations No 852 / 2004; 853 / 2004; 854 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004, laying down hygiene rules; Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073 / 2005 of 15 November 2005, on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs; Regulation No 183 / 2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 January 2005, laying down requirements for feed; Regulation No 1829 / 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003, on genetically modified food and feed. Article 29 of Regulation No 183 / 2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 January 2005, laying down requirements for feed hygiene extends {{the aim of the}} RASFF to serious risks to animal health and to the environment; and Commission Regulation (EU) No 16 / 2011 of 10 January 2011, laying down implementing measures for the Rapid alert system for food and feed, in accordance with Article 51 of Reg. 178 / 2002 requires the Commission to establish implementing measures for Article 50 of that Regulation, involving the member States and Food Safety Authority, managed by the Commission, in particular as regards the specific conditions and procedures enforceable to the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> and supplementary information...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring human-centric {{business}} processes requires human operators to manually notify to a BPMS when activities start or end. Even if nowadays smart devices, like smartphones and tablets, are adopted {{to make the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> these <b>notifications</b> easier, such devices usually hold a passive role, being a simple mediator between the BPMS and human operators. In this paper, we adopt the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm by envisioning an artifact-driven process monitoring where all the objects interacting with a business process instance can be coupled with a smart device to actively detect when process activities start or end. To support the artifact-driven monitoring, we propose an ontology-based approach to assess and improve the monitorability of a process model...|$|R
40|$|Most {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} nodes use a CPU to implement the main functionality in software. This provides flexibility compared with a pure ASIC implementation. However, due to the wakeup overhead and waiting periods the total energy consumption of periodic measurements and network listening is considerably increased. To tackle this problem novel reconfigurable peripheral blocks are introduced into the SoC. These autonomously handle simple sub-tasks of the periodic activities while the CPU stays in an inactive low power mode. The CPU is only activated if further processing is required (e. g. <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> a <b>notification</b> packet via the wireless network if the measurement value has changed). To maintains {{a high degree of}} flexibility for the implemented applications the introduced peripheral blocks are reconfigurable. 1...|$|R

40|$|The power {{consumption}} of different implementations of a sensor interface utilized for {{wireless sensor network}} nodes are investigated. Most sensor network nodes use a CPU to implement the main functionality in software. This maintains flexibility compared with a pure ASIC implementation. Unfortunately, to utilize the CPU for simple tasks as periodically controlling the data acquisition proved expensive in terms of energy consumption due to the wakeupoverhead and several waiting periods. As an alternative a special reconfigurable peripheral block is introduced into the WSN SoC. It is responsible for these measurements while the CPU stays in an inactive “sleep mode”. It is only activated if further processing is required (e. g. <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> a <b>notification</b> packet via the wireless network if the measurement value has changed). A huge reduction of {{power consumption}} {{by a factor of}} 30 was achieved. The objective is to reduce power consumption while maintaining a high degree of flexibility for the implemented applications. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{field study}} in ten homes was {{conducted}} to understand what influences users’ acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home environment. The key finding is that perceived message urgency is the primary indicator <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home—if people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> No effect <b>of</b> physical activity was found on acceptability. The results suggest that to improve the scheduling <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home, notification systems need a mechanism assessing both the message urgency and the mental activity load, whereas physical activity can be ignored. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to measure acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in a realistic setting, given the need to balance experimental control with realistic context. The present paper suggests a way to introduce controlled notifications and subjective measurements of acceptability in homes. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{globalization}} of food supply necessitates continued advances in regulatory control measures {{to ensure that}} citizens enjoy safe and adequate nutrition. The {{aim of this study}} was to extend previous reports on network analysis relating to food notifications by including an optional filter by type <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> and in cases of contamination, by type of contaminant in the notified foodstuff. Methodology/Principal Findings A filter function has been applied to enable processing <b>of</b> selected <b>notifications</b> by contaminant or type <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> to i) capture complexity, ii) analyze trends, and iii) identify patterns of reporting activities between countries. The program rapidly assesses nations' roles as transgressor and/or detector for each category of contaminant and for the key class of border rejection.

40|$|A {{seasonal}} rise in tuberculosis (TB) notifications {{has been}} confirmed in several studies. Here, we examined one hypothesis for its cause: increased <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> TB during wintertime due to crowding. Seasonality analysis was performed on actual and simulated <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> clustered TB cases, which {{are considered to be}} representative <b>of</b> recent <b>transmission,</b> diagnosed from 1993 to 2004 in the Netherlands (n = 4, 746). To test the hypothesis <b>of</b> winter crowding, <b>notifications</b> were simulated by adding patient delay and incubation period to an infection date randomly taken to be in winter in 80 % of cases. The incubation periods were derived from frequency distributions for different TB disease localizations drawn from the literature. Seasonality analysis was performed using autocorrelation function plots and spectral analysis. Actual notifications showed strong seasonality in clustered TB and clustered extrapulmonary TB cases but not in clustered pulmonary TB cases. Analysis <b>of</b> simulated <b>notifications</b> revealed barely significant seasonality only in extrapulmonary TB cases. Our results suggest that increased <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> TB during wintertime is unlikely to be the only cause of the seasonal peak in TB notifications. A factor closer to the notification date probably contributes to the seasonality observed in TB notifications...|$|R
