5|$|Fauré was a {{founding}} member of the Société Nationale de Musique, formed in February 1871 under the joint chairmanship of Romain Bussine and Saint-Saëns, to promote new French music. Other members included Georges Bizet, Emmanuel Chabrier, Vincent d'Indy, Henri Duparc, César Franck, Édouard Lalo and Jules Massenet. Fauré became secretary of <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> 1874. Many of his works were first presented at the society's concerts.|$|E
5|$|He wrote twenty-one {{books and}} was {{credited}} by <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1942 with {{the distribution of}} almost 400 million books and booklets. Despite significant decreases during the 1920s, overall membership increased more than sixfold {{by the end of}} Rutherford's 25 years as president.|$|E
50|$|It absorbed {{a number}} of other <b>societies</b> over <b>the</b> next fifty years, {{including}} <b>the</b> Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1782 (not to be confused with <b>the</b> modern Medico-Chirurgical <b>Society</b> of Edinburgh, founded in 1821), <b>the</b> American Physical <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1796 (not {{to be confused with the}} modern American Physical <b>Society,</b> founded <b>in</b> 1899), <b>the</b> Hibernian Medical <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1799, <b>the</b> Chemical <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1803, <b>the</b> Natural History <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1812 and <b>the</b> Didactic <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1813.|$|R

5|$|Hill {{called the}} {{attention}} of the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) to the site and, in 1924, joined representatives of <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> conducting further excavations, showing that a village of considerable size had existed there. In 1925, to ensure archaeological access to the site and to protect it from relic-hunting, he bought the two farms on whose land it lay. Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, the French society {{restricted}} registration to horses {{with both}} parents already registered with <b>the</b> <b>society.</b> <b>In</b> the early 20th century, the Percheron {{was one of}} the four major draft horse breeds, along with the Belgian, the Clydesdale and the Shire. Breeders could sell their horses for significant amounts of money, especially in the United States and Canada, where breeding stock brought a premium price.|$|E
5|$|Later in his career, Vonnegut {{published}} several autobiographical {{essays and}} short-story collections, including Fates Worse Than Death (1991), and A Man Without a Country (2005). After his death, he {{was hailed as}} a morbidly comical commentator on <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> which he lived, and {{as one of the}} most important contemporary writers. Vonnegut's son Mark published a compilation of his father's unpublished compositions, titled Armageddon in Retrospect. Numerous scholarly works have examined Vonnegut's writing and humor.|$|E

50|$|Gassiot {{was a close}} {{associate}} of William Sturgeon and Charles Vincent Walker and the three were instrumental in founding <b>the</b> London Electrical <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1837. <b>The</b> <b>society</b> was famous for the public electrical displays mounted by Gassiot. Gassiot was elected Fellow of <b>the</b> Royal <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1841 and was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society's</b> reform <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1840s. He was a founder of <b>the</b> Chemical <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1845, {{closely associated with the}} London Institution, and a Surrey magistrate.|$|R

5|$|Returning to Cambridge in the {{intervals}} of his studies in Germany, Stanford had resumed {{his work as}} conductor of CUMS. He found <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> good shape under his deputy, Eaton Faning, and able to tackle demanding new works. In 1876 the society presented {{one of the first}} performances in Britain of the Brahms Requiem. In 1877 CUMS came to national attention when it presented the first British performance of Brahms's First Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Taking up his {{part-time}} professorship at the Institute of Archaeology, {{he began}} to lecture to students almost every day. There, he found that he developed a relationship of mutual respect with the director, Childe, despite their strong personal and professional differences. In April 1949, after the retirement of Cyril Fox, Wheeler was nominated for the Presidency of the Society of Antiquaries, but lost to James Mann; many archaeologists, including Childe and O. G. S. Crawford, resigned from <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> protest, deeming Wheeler {{to have been a}} far more appropriate candidate for the position. Wheeler was nevertheless elected director of <b>the</b> <b>Society.</b> <b>In</b> 1950 he was awarded the Petrie Medal, and in 1952 was knighted. That same year he was invited to give the Norton lectures for the Archaeological Institute of America, and while in the United States was also awarded the Lucy Wharton Drexel medal at Pennsylvania. He nevertheless disliked the country, and in later life exhibited anti-Americanism.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{exists in}} the way of firsthand {{accounts}} of life within <b>the</b> <b>society.</b> <b>In</b> an effort to dispel some of the misconceptions and rumors about the society, Beilhart wrote extensively for newspapers to explain the workings of the group.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was elected}} a Fellow of <b>the</b> Geological <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1862, Fellow of <b>the</b> Royal <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1880 {{and was a}} {{president}} of <b>the</b> Asiatic <b>Society</b> of Bengal <b>in</b> 1884-85.|$|R
50|$|He {{was elected}} Fellow of <b>the</b> Royal Geographical <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1866, became Fellow of <b>the</b> Ethnological <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1869, and Fellow of <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Antiquaries <b>in</b> 1874.

5|$|While the {{controversy}} raged, American Presbyterians were also concerned with expanding their influence. In 1740, a New York Board of <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge was established. Four years later, David Brainerd was assigned as a missionary to the Native Americans. New Side Presbyterians {{were responsible for}} founding Princeton University (originally the College of New Jersey) primarily to train ministers in 1746.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart preached in Chicago and elsewhere, but was {{not known}} to proselytize strongly; however, {{although}} the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in the press. In 1904, numerous newspaper articles and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the Society. Those articles were often sensationalist and served to put <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> a bad light. The views and practices of the Society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well accepted in the small Ohio community. Thus, in 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago where they expected their progressive ideas might be better tolerated.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Greenup {{continued}} {{to practice law}} in Fayette County and pursued various other interests. He was {{a founding member of}} the Danville Political Club and in 1787, he joined the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge. Future Kentucky Governors Isaac Shelby and James Garrard, as well as future Supreme Court justice Thomas Todd were also members of <b>the</b> <b>Society.</b> <b>In</b> 1789, he helped organize the Kentucky Manufacturing Society. Later, he was appointed to the Kentucky River Company, a group dedicated to improving infrastructure on the Kentucky River.|$|E

50|$|Rudge was at {{an early}} period elected a fellow of <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Antiquaries, to <b>the</b> Linnean <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1802, and to <b>the</b> Royal <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1805. In 1829 he was {{appointed}} High Sheriff of Worcestershire.|$|R
5|$|Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited Thessaloniki to {{supervise}} the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, {{and that the only}} outstanding task was a final review by a competent person, who had already been assigned to the task. In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian. Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of Euboea, Grigor Gjirokastriti, an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens. Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine.|$|E
5|$|In 1849 Bennett {{became the}} {{founding}} {{president of the}} Bach Society in London, whose early members included Sir George Smart, John Pyke Hullah, William Horsley, Potter and Davison. Under his direction the Society gave the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion on 6 April 1854. Further performances of the Passion were given by <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1858 and 1862, the latter coinciding {{with the publication of}} Bennett's own edition of the work, with a translation of the text into English by his pupil Helen Johnston.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Rubinstein {{handed over}} the {{directorship}} of the Conservatory to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, {{to be replaced by}} Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to <b>the</b> <b>society.</b> <b>In</b> submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.|$|E
500|$|Elected a Fellow of <b>the</b> Royal <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1916, he was knighted in 1937 and {{received}} the Gold Medal of <b>the</b> Linnean <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1938.|$|R

5|$|In 1984, Bánáthy was co-founder {{with general}} {{evolution}} theorist Ervin László {{and others of}} the initially secret General Evolutionary Research Group, or General Evolutionary Research Group. A member of the Society of General Systems Research since the 1960s, he was Managing Director of <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> the early 1980s, and in 1985 he became its president. He then served on its Board of Trustees. During the 1980s, he served on the Executive Committee of the International Federation of Systems Research. In 1989, he retired from Far West Labs and returned {{to live on the}} Monterey Peninsula. He continued to serve as Professor Emeritus for the Saybrook Graduate School, counseling Ph.D. students. He also continued his work with the annual ISI international systems design conversations, and authored a number of articles and books about systems, design, and evolutionary research. He served two terms as president of the International Federation of Systems Research during 1994-98.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Durham University named Josephine Butler College after her, {{reflecting}} her and George's {{connection to}} the area and the university. The Women's Library, at the London School of Economics, holds a number of collections related to Josephine. They include papers from the Ladies' National Association; more than 2,500 letters in the Josephine Butler Letter Collection; and the Josephine Butler Society Library consisting of books and pamphlets collected by <b>the</b> <b>society.</b> <b>In</b> 2001 English Heritage placed a blue plaque on her former residence in Wimbledon; her former house in Cheltenham was demolished in the 1970s, but in 2002 the Cheltenham Civic Society placed a plaque on the building which now occupies the site.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell's time at King's was {{probably}} the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael Faraday. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} {{a fellow of}} <b>the</b> Royal <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1781; and he {{received}} the Copley Medal of <b>the</b> Royal <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> 1791, and <b>the</b> gold medal of <b>the</b> Royal <b>Society</b> of Literature <b>in</b> 1825.|$|R
