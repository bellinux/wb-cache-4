25|$|The {{interposition}} of {{editors and}} reviewers between authors and readers may enable the intermediators {{to act as}} gatekeepers. Some sociologists of science argue <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> review makes the ability to publish susceptible to control by elites and to personal jealousy.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> support reduces fear during {{stressful}} situations such as combat and domestic violence and may mitigate Posttraumatic stress disorder.

50|$|Campbell argues <b>that</b> what <b>peer</b> {{education}} {{ought to}} do is to promote the kind of critical consciousness theorised by Paulo Freire This means <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> use the peer education process to critically discuss their circumstances, especially the social factors impacting upon their health. Becoming critically aware of these forces is the first step to tackling them. So, for instance, if local norms regarding sexuality and gender put people's health at risk, this approach argues <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> should critically discuss those norms, so that they can then collectively seek to establish new more health-enhancing norms.|$|R
40|$|We examine {{changes in}} students’ rating {{behavior}} during a semester-long sequence of peer evaluation laboratory exercises in an introductory mechanics course. We perform a quantitative {{analysis of the}} ratings given by students to peers’ physics lab reports, and conduct interviews with students. We find <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> persistently assign higher ratings to lab reports than do experts, <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> begin the semester by giving high ratings most frequently and end the semester with frequent middle ratings, and <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> go through the semester without much change {{in the frequency of}} low ratings. We then use student interviews to develop a model for student engagement with peer assessment. This model is based on two competing influences which appear to shape peer evaluation behavior: a strong disinclination to give poor ratings with a complementary preference to give high ratings when in doubt, and an attempt to develop an expertlike criticality when assessing peers’ work...|$|R

25|$|In a 2011 {{meta-analysis}} of seven randomized trials that compared a peer support intervention to group cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients suffering from depression, peer support interventions {{were found to}} improve depression symptoms more than usual care alone and results may be {{comparable to those of}} group cognitive behavioral therapy. These findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> support interventions have the potential to be effective components of depression care, and they support the inclusion of peer support in recovery-oriented mental health treatment.|$|E
25|$|However, other {{researchers}} have contested {{the claims of the}} media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> effects {{are much more likely to}} cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized. It also argues that one must be careful about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.|$|E
25|$|A 1984 {{study on}} the impact of peer support and support groups for victims of {{domestic}} violence showed that 146 battered women found women's peer support groups the most helpful source of a range of available treatments.

A 1986 study on 70 adolescent mothers considered to be at risk for domestic violence showed <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> support improved cognitive problem-solving skills, self-reinforcement, and parenting competence.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design of}} a credit-based trading {{mechanism}} for peer-to-peer file sharing networks. We divide files into verifiable pieces; every peer interested in a file requests these pieces individually from the peers it is connected to. Our goal is to build a mechanism that supports fair large scale distribution in which downloads are fast, with low startup latency. We build a trading model in which peers use a pairwise currency to reconcile trading differences with each other and examine various trading strategies <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> can adopt. We show through analysis and simulation <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> who contribute to the network and take risks receive the most benefit in return. Our simulations demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> who set high upload rates receive high download rates in return, but free-riders download very slowly compared to peers who upload. Finally, we propose a default trading strategy that is good for both the network as a whole and the peer employing it: deviating from that strategy yields little or no advantage for the peer. ...|$|R
25|$|Reviewers {{tend to be}} {{especially}} critical of conclusions that contradict their own views, and lenient towards those that match them. At the same time, established scientists {{are more likely than}} others to be sought out as referees, particularly by high-prestige journals/publishers. There are also signs of gender bias, favouring men as authors. As a result, ideas that harmonize with the established experts' are more likely to see print and to appear in premier journals than are iconoclastic or revolutionary ones. This accords with Thomas Kuhn's well-known observations regarding scientific revolutions. A theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> review and over-competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly.|$|E
25|$|Behavioural {{research}} generally {{indicates that}} teenagers begin their smoking habits due to peer pressure, and cultural influence portrayed by friends. However, {{one study found}} that direct pressure to smoke cigarettes played a less significant part in adolescent smoking, with adolescents also reporting low levels of both normative and direct pressure to smoke cigarettes. Mere exposure to tobacco retailers may motivate smoking behaviour in adults. A similar study suggested that individuals may play {{a more active role in}} starting to smoke than has previously been thought and that social processes other than peer pressure also need to be taken into account. Another study's results indicated <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> pressure was significantly associated with smoking behavior across all age and gender cohorts, but that intrapersonal factors were significantly more important to the smoking behavior of 12- to 13-year-old girls than same-age boys. Within the 14- to 15-year-old age group, one peer pressure variable emerged as a significantly more important predictor of girls' than boys' smoking. It is debated whether peer pressure or self-selection is a greater cause of adolescent smoking.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the gang}} rape storyline was well-received, {{it was also}} criticized. Jennifer Hayward, in her {{literary}} analysis of the rape and its similarity to nineteenth century melodrama, stated that this storyline not only polarized [...] "the gap between rapists and the raped but also {{the figure of the}} rapist himself", and that insisting on [...] "the 'essential' goodness" [...] of Powell Lord implied <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> pressure [...] "could be an adequate (or even physiologically possible) excuse for rape". Scholar Mary Buhl Dutta, arguing that the storyline perpetuated rape myths, commented on how the series especially used Marty, who fulfilled the stereotype of [...] "the bad girl" [...] who was the rape victim. Dutta stated that [...] "Marty had once 'cried rape when the Rev. Andrew Carpenter [...] "rebuffed her romantic overtures, falsely accusing him of sexually abusing a boy he was counseling". [...] After she was actually raped, she falsely yet unintentionally accuses Kevin Buchanan, who was innocent. [...] Marty, according to Dutta, [...] "is a 'bad girl' because she had a one-night stand with Todd before the rape, bolstering his later claim she 'asked for it' in their second sexual encounter".|$|E

2500|$|Evasion of {{peer review}} before publicizing results (termed [...] "science by press conference"): Some proponents {{of ideas that}} {{contradict}} accepted scientific theories avoid subjecting their ideas to peer review, sometimes on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> review is biased towards established paradigms, and sometimes {{on the grounds that}} assertions cannot be evaluated adequately using standard scientific methods.

2500|$|Peer support {{can occur}} within, outside or around {{traditional}} {{mental health services}} and programs, between two people or in groups. Peer support is a key concept in the recovery approach and in consumer-operated services programs.

The role of peer workers in mental health services {{was the subject of a}} conference in London in April 2012, jointly organized by the Centre for Mental Health and the NHS Confederation. Research has shown that peer-run self-help groups yield improvement in psychiatric symptoms resulting in decreased hospitalization, larger social support networks and enhanced self-esteem and social functioning. There is considerable variety in the ways <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> support is defined and conceptualized as it relates to mental health services. [...] In some cases, clinicians, psychiatrists, and other staff who do not necessarily have their own experiences of receiving psychiatric treatment are being trained, often by psychiatric survivors, in peer support as an approach to building relationships that genuine, mutual, and non-coercive.|$|E
2500|$|A {{doctor was}} {{allegedly}} subject to multiple hearings {{for the same}} charges, and his rights to an expedited hearing were allegedly denied while a suspension was in place. On May 15, 2001, the California Medical Association filed an amicus curiae brief to emphasize legal protections meant to prevent physicians being arbitrarily excluded from access to healthcare facilities based on mechanisms such as summary suspension without a speedy hearing. [...] This case was decided on April 18, 2005. [...] The {{court ruled that the}} hearing officer in the case could indeed terminate the physician's peer review hearing based on grounds that the physician refused to cooperate on procedural and other matters necessary for the good conduct of the proceedings. [...] Thus, the physician lost his membership and privileges at the hospital. Ironically, the same physician was brought into a peer review hearing at another facility a short time later. [...] The hearing officer in that case also terminated the proceedings, this time due to the physician's failure to turn over certain evidence for use in the hearing. [...] The physician challenged the termination through the court system arguing, contrary to the Tenet appellate court ruling, that California's peer review statutes never intended the hearing officer in peer review hearings to have such powers of termination. [...] The California Supreme Court reviewed the case and agreed in April 2009. [...] The High Court ruled, among other things, <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> review hearing officers must defer the question of termination to the panel of physicians who sit in judgment of each peer review hearing.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of an explorative {{research}} to the capabilities of peer monitoring in the banking sector, to decrease the negative effects of moral hazard.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the role of}} peer effects in technology adoption using data from a randomized distribution of menstrual cups in Nepal. Using individual randomization, we estimate causal effects of peer exposure on adoption. We find strong evidence of peer effects: two months after distribution, one additional friend {{with access to the}} menstrual cup increases usage by 18. 6 percentage points. Using the fact that we observe both trial and usage of the product over time, we examine the mechanisms driving peer effects. Our results suggest that successful uses by peers are more important than peer unsuccessful usage attempts. In addition, we argue <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> matter because individuals learn how to use the technology from their friends, but <b>that</b> <b>peers</b> do not affect an individual’s desire to use or attempt to use. ...|$|R
2500|$|From {{the late}} 19th {{to the early}} 21st century, the Anglo-Cornish dialect {{declined}} somewhat due {{to the spread of}} long-distance travel, mass education and the mass media, and increased migration into Cornwall of people from, principally, the south-east of England. Universal elementary education had begun in England and Wales in the 1870s. Thirty years later Mark Guy Pearse wrote: [...] "The characteristics of Cornwall and the Cornish are rapidly passing away. More than a hundred years ago its language died. Now its dialect is dying. It is useless to deplore it, for it is inevitable." [...] Although the erosion of dialect is popularly blamed on the mass media, many academics assert the primacy of face-to-face linguistic contact in dialect levelling. It is further asserted by some <b>that</b> <b>peer</b> groups are the primary mechanism. It is unclear whether in the erosion of the Anglo-Cornish dialect, high levels of migration into Cornwall from outside in the 20th century, or deliberate efforts to suppress dialect forms (in an educational context) are the primary causative factor. Anglo-Cornish dialect speakers are more likely than Received Pronunciation speakers in Cornwall to experience social and economic disadvantages and poverty, including spiralling housing costs, in many, particularly coastal areas of Cornwall, and have at times been actively discouraged from using the dialect, particularly in the schools. In the 1910s the headmaster of a school in a Cornish fishing port received this answer when he suggested to the son of the local coastguard (a boy with rough and ready Cornish speech) that it was time he learned to speak properly: [...] "An what d'yer think me mates down to the quay 'ud think o' me if I did?" ...|$|E
