40|$|To column control, in {{contrast}} to column design, tray hold-up and dependencies of tray hold-up on the operating conditions play an important role. The essence {{of this article is}} the development of an improved model of tray hydraulics over a broad operating range and its experimental validation by means of batch distillation. First, the column dynamics are related to <b>tray</b> <b>column</b> design parameters and operating conditions. The model parameters are fitted by column residence time measurements. Two tray load regimes are distinguished: an aeration regime and an obstruction regime. At low column load a vapour increase will decrease the tray mass since the liquid is driven out by larger aeration. At high load the opposite is the case, since the liquid is driven up by stowage. The resulting dynamic behaviour is studied by linearising the rigorous tray model in an operating point. Especially the influence of the vapour flow on the column dynamics is investigated. For the influence of the tray composition change on the molar mass, a new composition-shift parameter κ is defined. The influence appeared to be small...|$|E

Using a tray reactive distillation column and a maximum temperature of 220 °C, the required reactor volume can be decreased with 93 %. Due to the less favourable mass transfer characteristics of the bubble column, in here the required reactor volume can only be decreased with 78 %. When a temperature of 220 °C is allowed in the column, the tray reactive distillation is the preferable process for the esterification of myristic acid isopropanol, based on the required reaction volumes.

50|$|Reflux {{refers to}} {{the portion of the}} {{condensed}} overhead product that is returned to the tower. The reflux flowing downwards provides the cooling required for condensing the vapours flowing upwards. The reflux ratio, which is the ratio of the (internal) reflux to the overhead product, is conversely related to the theoretical number of stages required for efficient separation of the distillation products.Fractional distillation towers or columns are designed to achieve the required separation efficiently. The design of fractionation columns is normally made in two steps; a process design, followed by a mechanical design. The purpose of the process design is to calculate the number of required theoretical stages and stream flows including the reflux ratio, heat reflux and other heat duties. The purpose of the mechanical design, on the other hand, is to select the tower internals, column diameter and height. In most cases, the mechanical design of fractionation towers is not straightforward. For the efficient selection of tower internals and the accurate calculation of column height and diameter, many factors must be taken into account. Some of the factors involved in design calculations include feed load size and properties and the type of distillation column used. The two major types of distillation <b>columns</b> used are <b>tray</b> and packing <b>columns.</b> Packing columns are normally used for smaller towers and loads that are corrosive or temperature sensitive or for vacuum service where pressure drop is important. <b>Tray</b> <b>columns,</b> on the other hand, are used for larger columns with high liquid loads. They first appeared on the scene in the 1820s. In most oil refinery operations, <b>tray</b> <b>columns</b> are mainly used for the separation of petroleum fractions at different stages of oil refining.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally the {{majority}} of fractionation columns in natural gas processing plants were equipped with trays. However an option to <b>trayed</b> <b>columns</b> is to use packing. Packed columns offer a larger surface area per unit volume for mass transfer and the continuous gas to liquid contact throughout the column rather than at specific levels (such as in <b>tray</b> <b>columns).</b> For process design purposes, {{it is essential to}} estimate the pressure drop for enabling the proper operation of packed columns. In this study, a simple generalized pressure drop correlation (GPDC) which is easier than existing approaches requiring more complicated and longer computations is developed for sizing randomly packed fractionation columns for pressure drops up to 150 mm water per meter of packing. This correlation can be used to estimate pressure drop for a given loading and column diameter. Alternatively, for a given pressure drop the diameter can be determined. The predictions from the proposed correlation have been compared with reported data and found good agreement with average absolute deviation hovering around 4. 9 %. The proposed predictive tool is superior owing to its accuracy and clear numerical background, wherein the relevant coefficients can be retuned quickly if new and more accurate data are available in the future. This proposed simple-to-use approach can be of immense practical value for the engineers and scientists to have a quick check on the pressure drop in packed columns for a given loading and column diameter. In particular, gas engineers would find the proposed approach can be used very friendly involving no complex expressions with transparent and easy-to-handle calculation steps...|$|R

This produces a completely diagonal T. F. M. between the sum and output composition changes and the circulating and product take-off flow rates. The T. F. M. is also presented for c= 1. 0 and although no longer diagonal at all frequencies, analysis and simulation show that the column behaviour is not greatly affected by changes in this parameter. Long packed columns are shown to produce novel nonminimum phase effects when twin product control is attempted, whereas, serious travelling-wave phenomena can limit controller performance in short columns. The possibility of zero separation-gain is also revealed. The computed shapes of inverse Nyquist loci are confirmed by analysis and by numerical time-domain simulation.

Using these models, a hole diameter of 0. 25 inches and a hole velocity of 1. 3 ft/sec or greater was selected to accomplish the required heat transfer while minimizing mass transferred to the geothermal fluid. Using the above information, a {{conceptual design}} for a sieve <b>tray</b> <b>column</b> was developed.

40|$|The (bulk) {{removal of}} carbon-dioxide (CO 2) from {{industrial}} gases, e. g. natural gas, is usually {{realized with a}} reactive absorption technique in which (non-) aqueous solutions of alkanolamines are used. From the absorption rate point of view, primary or secondary amines are preferred. However, in case the costs of regeneration are also taken into account, tertiary amines are much more attractive. In order to combine the specific properties of tertiary and primary/secondary alkanolamines respectively, mixtures of both types of compounds are used. A well known example is the activated methyl-di-ethanol-amine (MDEA) -process in which MDEA is mixed with (small amounts) of piperazine. In this paper mixtures of MDEA with several activators, being primary and secondary amines, are studied {{with respect to the}} performance of CO 2 removal from natural gas.

At the treatment of process water in sewage plants these demands are observed just by recycling ammonium, which is separated as salt or an aqueous ammonia solution from distillates or separation waters from sludge dewatering. Due to the new developed acid and alkaline vapor-washing it is possible to produce ammonium sulfate and carbon sources for biological denitrification in a compact column simultaneously. From vapors, loaded with ammonia and organic acids, i. e. caused by drying sewage sludge, the acid and alkaline compounds are separated in two independent washing cycles using this method. Ammonium is enriched in the acid washing liquid whereas the salts of the organic acids are concentrated in the alkaline solution.

Mass transfer was carried out theoretically by developing the mathematical model of mass transfer phenomena with chemical reaction in chemical absorption of H 2 S into Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 solution in a sieve trays column. The mass transfer process was described by film model, that yielding the second order differential equation solved numerically by orthogonal collocation to estimate enhancement factor. The mass balance model in sieve trays column consists of differential mass balance of H 2 S in gas phase and Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 in liquid phase giving system of non-linear first order differential equations that were solved numerically by Fourth order Runge-Kutta method under MATLAB Software.
