In practice, this means that the nurse should seek to engage with the person in care in a positive and collaborative way that will empower the patient to draw on his or her inner resources in addition to any other treatment they may be receiving.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the first}} march to Parliament, further riots {{occurred}} involving groups whose grievances were nationalistic, economic, or political, rather than religious. Aside from {{the issue of}} Catholic emancipation, {{it has also been}} suggested that the driving force of the riots was Britain's poor economic situation: the loss of trade during the war had led to falling wages, rising prices, and periodic unemployment. As Rudé noted, there was no general attack on the Catholic community, [...] "the victims of the riots" [...] being distinguished by the fact they were [...] "on <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>persons</b> of substance". Voting in parliamentary elections was restricted by a property threshold, so most Londoners were unable to vote and many hoped for reforms to make Parliament more representative of the people.|$|R

By faith, which is also the gift of God, we repent of our sins and freely adhere to the gospel, the good news of God's saving work for us in Christ. By our response of faith to Christ, we enter into the blessings promised by the gospel.

25|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} {{developed in}} the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology, in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis. The humanistic approach sought to glimpse <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>person,</b> not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions. Humanism focused on uniquely human issues, such as free will, personal growth, self-actualization, self-identity, death, aloneness, freedom, and meaning. It emphasized subjective meaning, rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy. Later, positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to scientific modes of exploration.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to use a {{participatory}} research methodology to develop a framework for understanding <b>the</b> concept of <b>whole</b> <b>person</b> orientation in primary care delivery. <b>Whole</b> <b>person</b> orientation {{is one of the}} seven Joint Principles of the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) authored by the American Academy of Family Physicians in partnership with several other physician organizations. Although the PCMH model of primary care has been touted as part of the solution to the U. S. healthcare system’s cost and quality issues, there are few tools available to evaluate implementation of the essential components and none at all address <b>whole</b> <b>person</b> orientation by name. As a first step in creating a self-evaluation tool for primary care practices undergoing PCMH transformation, concept mapping was used to elicit, organize, and prioritize stakeholder perspectives regarding <b>the</b> meaning of <b>whole</b> <b>person</b> orientation. Participants included primary care patients, physicians, research staff, administrative staff, quality improvement staff, and students. The concept mapping process generated 66 statements, which were divided into eight different domains. These results provide an initial dimensional structure and tailored constituent items for creating a measure of <b>whole</b> <b>person</b> orientation. PowerPoint slides only...|$|R

2500|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} {{was developed}} in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the person-centered therapy of Carl Rogers (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and existential psychology developed by Viktor Frankl and Rollo May. Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement—congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding. By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks {{to get a glimpse of}} <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>person</b> and not just the fragmented parts of the personality. This aspect of holism links up with another common aim of humanistic practice in clinical psychology, which is to seek an integration of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>person,</b> also called self-actualization. From 1980, Hans-Werner Gessmann integrated the ideas of humanistic psychology into group psychotherapy as humanistic psychodrama. [...] According to humanistic thinking, each individual person already has inbuilt potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.|$|E
