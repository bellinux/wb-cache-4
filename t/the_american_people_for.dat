25|$|In {{the hope}} of {{securing}} international recognition, Se√°n T. O'Kelly was sent as envoy to Paris to present the Irish case to the Peace Conference convened by the great powers {{at the end of}} World War I. When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the Irish Republic, to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the support of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>for</b> the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success. One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions. He met the young Harvard-educated leader from Puerto Rico, Pedro Albizu Campos, and forged a lasting and useful alliance with him.|$|E
