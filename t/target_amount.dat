40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} decentralized, {{scalable}} approach to designing a reconfigurable manufacturing {{system in which}} a swarm of robots assembles heterogeneous parts into <b>target</b> <b>amounts</b> of products. The sequence of part assemblies is determined by interactions between robots in a decentralized manner in real time. Our methodology is based on deriving a continuous abstraction of the system from chemical reaction models and formulating the strategy as a problem of selecting rates of assembly and disassembly. The rates are mapped onto probabilities that define stochastic control policies for individual robots, which then produce the desired aggregate performance. We illustrate our approach using a physics-based simulator with examples involving 15 robots and two types of final products. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} land conversion {{in the presence}} of voluntary and mandatory habitat conservation policies. Conversion decisions are taken under uncertainty about the value of environmental services by a multitude of landholders competing on the market for agricultural products. We show that land conversion can be delayed by compensating landholders providing environmental services and by limiting the individual extent of developable land. In contrast, we find that setting a ceiling on aggregate land conversion may lead to runs which rapidly exhaust the <b>targeted</b> <b>amount</b> of land. Finally, studying conversion dynamics under different policy scenarios, we show that uncertainty, even if inducing conversion postponement in the short-run, increases the average rate of deforestation and reduces the expected time for total conversion in the long run...|$|R

Our approach thus shows that redundancy implies robustness, and we show how to achieve some compromises in practice, by applying it to the attitude control of a 3 d rigid body...|$|R
