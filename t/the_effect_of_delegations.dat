30|$|In an experiment, we model two stylized {{facts about}} capital {{budgeting}} practice, budgetary slack creation and <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> decision-making authority. In our setting, under centralization, headquarters announces a budget, the division manager gives a cost report, and headquarters decides on the project.

We argue that the ability of headquarters to commit to a budget moderates <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation,</b> and we find evidence in favor of our argument as there is an interaction <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> and commitment to budgets. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> are particularly strong when budgets are non-binding as delegation serves {{as a substitute for}} commitment in this case.

40|$|In {{a context}} of {{vertical}} product differentiation we analyze <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> on quality.

The actual realization of this fixed cost is known, at no cost, to the firm or to the agent that undertakes the activities a [...] c;sociated with this fixed cost. By delegating a firm faces an asymmetry of information since the owner cannot observe the realization of the random variable, while his agent has ex ante full information concerning the actual state of nature. When one firm delegates and the other does not, we find two equilibria that mimic the full information situation, and two equilibria which display quality levels for the delegating firm lower than the full information ones. When the delegation decision is endogenous there are equilibria configurations with zero, one and two delegating firms. ...|$|R

Hyperinflation is common in a divided society, one in which special interest groups can pressure a weak central government to issue money to finance their own demands while neglecting the country’s overall welfare. A commitment device like dollarization or a currency board, which gives control of the divided country’s money supply to another country, can eliminate this inflation bias.

40|$|The present work {{analyses}} <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> on <b>the</b> market outcome when {{agents have}} private {{information about the}} firms' productivity. Two types of firms are considered: managerial firms (delegation) and entrepreneurial firms (no delegation). Due to the asymmetry of information managerial firms are less efficient (productive efficiency) because they must pay informational rents to their managers. The existence of delegating firms leads the market outcome further away from the competitive one. However the presence of non-delegating firms limits the agents' informational rents. We {{show that there is}} an improvement in terms of allocative efficiency in the market when one of the managerial firms is a non-profit maximizer. However this improvement has a negative counterpart in terms of productive efficiency: firstly, the welfare maximizing firm leads to an increase of the average cost of each unit of output, due to the large inequality between firms' production and to increasing marginal costs; secondly, the public firm bears a larger informational rent than private firms. The public firm is welfare improving mainly when the number of competing firms is small and/or the proportion of managerial firms is large. In certain cases the entrepreneurial firms substitute the role of the public firm as a regulation mechanism. ...|$|R

However, we know very little about what can explain how issue coverage evolves over time. Do certain issues receive constant attention over time, whereas others receive more or less coverage over time? By focusing on <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> to <b>the</b> EU-level institutions as an external influence, this paper aims to explain whether issue coverage is more or less impervious to change.

40|$|The paper proposes an {{analysis}} of liquid democracy (or, delegable proxy voting) {{from the perspective of}} binary aggregation and of binary diffusion models. We show how liquid democracy on binary issues can be embedded into the framework of binary aggregation with abstentions, enabling the transfer of known results about the latter [...] -such as impossibility theorems [...] -to the former. This embedding also sheds light on the relation between delegation cycles in liquid democracy and the probability of collective abstentions, as well as the issue of individual rationality in a delegable proxy voting setting. We then show how liquid democracy on binary issues can be modeled and analyzed also as a specific process of dynamics of binary opinions on networks. These processes [...] -called Boolean DeGroot processes [...] -are a special case of the DeGroot stochastic model of opinion diffusion. We establish the convergence conditions of such processes and show they provide some novel insights on how <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> cycles and individual rationality could be mitigated within liquid democracy.

40|$|AbstractEssays on Deception and Lying AversionByGlynis Margaret E. GawnDoctor of Philosophy in Agricultural and Resource EconomicsUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Jeffrey M. Perloff, ChairThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three experimental essays on deception and lying aversion. Chapter 2, “Do Lies Erode Trust?” studies the interaction between honesty and trust and trustworthiness. Specifically, the chapter investigates <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> being lied to or told the truth in a Gneezy (2005) deception game on behavior in a subsequent trust game with different players. Treatment effects are decomposed between the impacts of being “burned” by a low payoff in the deception game, mood change, and the specific experience of a lie. The specific experience of being lied to significantly erodes trust, trustworthiness, {{and the use of}} communication to promote trust. However, <b>the</b> experience <b>effect</b> on trustworthiness occurs only for subjects who are burned. 	Chapter 3, “Pure Lying Aversion”, studies several factors affecting the propensity to tell the truth when no one would be directly negatively impacted by the lie. Utilizing a simple experiment, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strength of the message one is using to convey information is examined, while the economic incentive to lie is also varied. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> being lied to in a prior interaction on one’s subsequent truthfulness is also studied in a separate set of experiments. The strength of the message has a strong effect on truthfulness regardless of the incentive to lie, while <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size of the economic gain from lying has a non-monotonic effect on truthfulness. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> knowledge about whether one has been lied to before interacts with the payoff outcome received in the prior interaction to reduce truthfulness in some cases and increase it in others. 	Chapter 4, “Lying Through Others”, considers the question of how agency relationships, ubiquitous in economic interactions, affect an individual’s willingness to lie for monetary advantage? Does individual lying aversion tend to decline if the lie (or truth) is sent through an agent, rather than sent directly by the individual? In three experiments that control for <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> on preferences over payoffs and probabilities of actions, it is found that delegation reduces – but does not eliminate – lying aversion...|$|R

Abstract: Delegation to independent agencies is often suggested as a remedy for politicallymotivated inefficiencies in government decision making. For example, irrevocable delegation to an independent central bank can mitigate the inflation bias created by political incentives to renege on policy commitments. In practice, however, the irrevocability <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> depends on the specific institutional details of political decision making. We develop a model of monetary policy that identifies, first, <b>the</b> independent <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> these institutions on inflation expectations and, second, <b>the</b> additional <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> to an independent central bank. We find empirical support for the model in tests of three predictions: the presence of an independent central bank should reduce inflation only in the presence of political checks and balances; political interference with the central bank should be more apparent when there are few checks and balances; and <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> checks and balances should be greater when political decision makers are more polarized...|$|R

40|$|Several {{papers in}} the recent {{marketing}} literature have suggested that delegation in distribution (e. g., the use of independent middlemen) helps manufacturers to precommit strategically to profit-enhancing competitive actions. Further, the literature suggests that the profitability of such actions depends on market structure. We challenge these conclusions here. This is done in two steps. First, we perform {{an analysis of the}} entire class of models which have been used in the literature. Using internally consistent assumptions about market structure and contracting, the only subgame perfect equilibrium is one in which all distribution channels have infinitely many levels <b>of</b> <b>delegation.</b> Obviously, this is not what we see in the real world. Next, we relax a key hidden assumption, namely that all intra-channel agreements are observable to competitors. Without this assumption, the usual results unravel. Unless channel members can offer credible guarantees that unobservable agreements do not exist, <b>the</b> strategic <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> disappear. Since these guarantees are virtually impossible to maintain credibly, we would expect to reject the hypothesis in the earlier literature relating channel structure to competition in an empirical study controlling for observability. We conclude that mechanisms other than strategic ones must be responsible for the existence of delegated channels, and make some suggestions about promising avenues for future theory research in channel structure. marketing, distribution...|$|R
