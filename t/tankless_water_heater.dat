50|$|Under current North American conditions, {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} configuration from an operating viewpoint often is to install a central (tank-type or <b>tankless)</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> {{for most of the}} house, and to install a POU <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> at any distant faucets or bathrooms. However, the most economic design may vary according to the relative electricity, gas and water prices in the locality, the layout of the building, and how much (and when) hot water is used. Only electric tankless water heaters were widely available for many years. and they are still used for low-initial-cost POU heaters, but natural gas and propane POU heaters have now become available for consideration.|$|E

50|$|A {{locational}} {{design decision}} {{may be made}} between point-of-use and centralized water heaters. Centralized water heaters are more traditional, and are still {{a good choice for}} small buildings. For larger buildings with intermittent or occasional hot water use, multiple POU water heaters may be a better choice, since they can reduce long waits for hot water to arrive from a remote heater. The decision where to locate the water heater(s) is only partially independent of the decision of a tanked vs. <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater,</b> or the choice of energy source for the heat.|$|E

50|$|The company {{produces}} its own branded <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> {{as well as}} rebranded units sold by manufacturers such as Bradford White and GE.|$|R
50|$|Point-of-use (POU) <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> {{are located}} {{immediately}} {{where the water}} is being used, so the water is almost instantly hot, which reduces <b>water</b> wastage. POU <b>tankless</b> <b>heaters</b> also can save more energy than centrally installed <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> because no hot water is left in lengthy supply pipes after the flow is shut off. However, POU <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> are often installed in combination with a central <b>water</b> <b>heater,</b> since the former type have usually been limited to under 6 litres/minute (1.5 US gallons/minute), which is sufficient for only light usage. In many situations, the initial expense of buying and installing a separate POU heater for every kitchen, laundry room, bathroom, and sink can outweigh the money saved in water and energy bills. In the US, POU <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> until recently were almost always electrical , and electricity is often substantially more expensive than natural gas or propane (when the latter fuels are available).|$|R

5000|$|Start-up delay: There may be {{a longer}} wait for hot water. A <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> only heats water on demand, so idle water in the piping starts at room temperature. Thus, there {{may be a}} more {{apparent}} [...] "flow delay" [...] for hot water to reach a distant faucet (in non-point-of-use systems). Many models sold in the UK have introduced a small heat store within the combination boiler to address this issue. This [...] "keep hot" [...] facility considerably improves the standard of hot water service, which some people otherwise find unacceptably poor with a combination boiler, but it uses considerably more fuel especially in summer.|$|E

50|$|Tankless heaters may be {{installed}} throughout a household {{at more than}} one point-of-use (POU), far from a central <b>water</b> <b>heater,</b> or larger centralized models may still be used to provide all the hot water requirements for an entire house. The main advantages of <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> are a plentiful continuous flow of hot water (as compared to a limited flow of continuously heated hot water from conventional tank <b>water</b> <b>heaters),</b> and potential energy savings under some conditions. The main disadvantage is their much higher initial costs, a US study in Minnesota study reported a 20- to 40-year payback for the <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters.</b> In a comparison to a less efficient natural gas fired hot water tank, on-demand natural gas will cost 30% more over its useful life.|$|R
5000|$|Less {{physical}} space: Most <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> can {{be mounted}} on a wall or internally in a building's structure. This means less physical space must be dedicated to heating water. Even systems that can't be mounted on walls take up less space than a tank-type <b>water</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Long term energy savings: Though a <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> {{typically}} {{costs more}} initially, it usually costs less to operate because of lower energy use—since it only heats water when required instead of continuously maintaining {{a tank of}} heated water. Even homes or buildings with high demand for hot water may realize some level of savings. If instant hot water at taps at limited hours is a priority, a recirculation system can be accommodated by using an aquastat and timer to decrease the added heat loss from the recirculation system. If the storage tank of an electric heater is highly insulated, so that the outer surface of the tank is only slightly warmer than the ambient air, the savings with a tankless heater is less.|$|E
5000|$|Recirculation systems: Since a <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> is {{inactive}} when {{hot water}} {{is not being}} used, they are incompatible with passive (convection-based) hot water recirculation systems. They may be incompatible with active hot water recirculation systems and certainly use more energy to constantly heat water within the piping, defeating one of a tankless water heater's primary advantages. On-demand recirculating pumps are often used to minimize hot water wait times from tankless water heaters and save water being wasted down the drain. On-demand recirculating pumps are activated by push-button or other sensor. A water contacting temperature probe installed at the hot water usage point signals the pump to stop. Single-cycle pumping events only occur when hot water is needed thereby preventing the energy waste associated with constantly heating water within piping.|$|E

5000|$|Achieving cooler temperatures: <b>Tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> {{often have}} minimum flow {{requirements}} before the heater is activated, {{and this can}} result in a gap between the cold water temperature, and the coolest warm water temperature that can be achieved with a hot and cold water mix.|$|R
5000|$|Safety: <b>Tankless</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Heaters</b> {{precisely}} control <b>water</b> temperature, {{which means}} dangerous temperature levels and spikes are less likely. An additional safety advantage stems from reduced exposure to dissolved toxic metals, {{which tend to}} occur at higher concentrations in hot water which has resided in a conventional <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> tank for significant periods of time.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> can {{be further}} divided into two {{categories}} according to their heating capability: [...] "full on/full off" [...] versus [...] "modulated". Full on/full off units {{do not have a}} variable power output level; the unit is either fully on or completely off. This can cause an annoying and possibly hazardous variation of hot water temperature as the flow of <b>water</b> through the <b>heater</b> varies. Modulated <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> change their heat output in response to the flow rate of water running through the unit. This is usually done by using a flow sensor, a modulating gas valve, an inlet water temperature sensor, and an outlet water temperature sensor-choke valve. A properly configured modulating heater can supply the same output temperature of water at differing water flow rates within their rated capacity, usually maintaining a close range of ±2 °C.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if it was feasible to collect information regarding energy use and hot <b>water</b> delivery from <b>tankless</b> gas <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> using the sensors and controls built into the <b>water</b> <b>heaters.</b> This could then be used to determine the <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> efficiency ? the ratio of energy out (hot water delivered) to energy in (energy in the gas) in actual residential installations. The goal was to be as unobtrusive as possible, and to avoid invalidating warranties or exposing researchers to liability issues. If feasible this approach would reduce the costs of instrumentation. This paper describes the limited field and laboratory investigations to determine if using the sensors and controls built into <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> is feasible for field monitoring. It was more complicated to use the existing gas flow, water and temperature sensors than was anticipated. To get the signals from the existing sensors and controls is difficult and may involve making changes that would invalidate manufacturer warrantees. The procedures and methods for using signals from the existing gas valves, water flow meters and temperature sensors will vary by model. To be able to monitor different models and brands would require detailed information about each model and brand. Based on these findings, we believe that for field monitoring projects it would be easier, quicker and safer to connect external meters to measure the same parameters rather than using the sensors and controls built into <b>tankless</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters...</b>|$|R
