Both sites have since barred their employees from participating in daily fantasy games. On October 14, 2015, the FBI launched an investigation of its own into the two services regarding the inside information scandal.|$|E
5|$|The {{case for}} Hess's defence was {{presented}} from 22–26 March by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl. He noted that while Hess accepted {{responsibility for the}} many decrees he had signed, he said these matters {{were part of the}} internal workings of a sovereign state and thus outside the purview of a war crimes trial. He called to the stand Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, the man who had been head of the NSDAP/AO, to testify on Hess's behalf. When Griffith-Jones presented questions about the organisation's spying in several countries, Bohle testified that any warlike activities such as espionage had been done without his permission or knowledge. Seidl called two other witnesses, former mayor of Stuttgart Karl Strölin and Hess's brother Alfred, both of whom refuted <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> the NSDAP/AO had been spying and fomenting war. Seidl presented a summation of the defence's case on 25 July, in which he attempted to refute the charge of conspiracy by pointing out that Hitler alone had made all the important decisions. He noted that Hess could not be held responsible for any events that took place after he left Germany in May 1941. Meanwhile, Hess mentally detached himself from what was happening, declining visits from his family and refusing to read the newspapers.|$|E

25|$|The {{controversial}} report received wide {{support among}} {{countries in the}} United Nations, while Western countries were split between supporters and opponents of the resolutions endorsing the report.

25|$|The last {{mention of}} Agnes {{as a living}} person comes from the Chronica Poloniae of Wincenty Kadłubek.

25|$|After Botvinnik won the 1944 and 1945 Soviet championships, most top Soviet players {{supported}} {{his desire for}} a World Championship match with Alekhine. However, <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> Alekhine had written anti-Semitic articles while in Nazi-occupied France {{made it difficult to}} host the match in the USSR.

25|$|Hemmer {{noted that}} the coal company, which had been quite {{punctual}} in its dealings with the media throughout the rescue attempt, had not given any information to corroborate <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> 12 miners had been rescued, and that the always-available Manchin {{was nowhere to be}} found, yet the cable news channels continued to report the story anyway until doctors in a hospital many miles away stated that they had had no contact with emergency service personnel about any of the miners except for McCloy.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the Holy See {{authorized}} {{the archbishop of}} Manfredonia to open an investigation to determine whether Padre Pio {{should be considered a}} saint. The investigation continued for seven years. In 1990 Padre Pio was declared a Servant of God, {{the first step in the}} process of canonization. The investigation however did not lead to any public factual clearance by the Church on his previous 'excommunication' or on <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> his stigmata were not of a supernatural kind. Moreover, Pio's stigmata were remarkably left out of the obligatory investigations for the canonization process, in order to avoid obstacles prohibiting a successful closure.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010, a Memorandum of Understanding {{was signed}} between Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and India's {{state-owned}} National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) where they designated {{to implement the}} coal-fired Rampal power station by 2016. The proposed project, on an area of over 1,834 acres of land, is situated 14 kilometres north of the Sundarbans. This project violates the environmental impact assessment guidelines for coal-based thermal power plants. Environmental activists contend that the proposed location of the Rampal Station would violate provisions of the Ramsar Convention. The government of Bangladesh rejected <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> the coal-based power plant would adversely affect the world's largest mangrove forest.|$|E

25|$|On 19 August 1998, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, {{chairman}} of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), stated that recently uncovered letters had implicated the British MI5, the American CIA, and then South African intelligence {{services in the}} crash. One TRC letter said that a bomb in the aircraft's wheel bay was set to detonate when the wheels came down for a landing. Tutu {{said that they were}} unable to investigate the truth of the letters or <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> South Africa or Western intelligence agencies {{played a role in the}} crash. The British Foreign Office suggested that they may have been created as Soviet misinformation or disinformation.|$|E
25|$|Other {{people who}} were {{associated}} with the Bahá'í Faith either had Bahá'í backgrounds or were not connected with the religion at all. For example, it was often rumoured that the Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveida was a Bahá'í. While Hoveida's father had been a Bahá'í, he had left the religion and Hoveida himself was not religious. Other people rumoured to be Bahá'ís included Mahnaz Afkhami, who was the Minister for Women's Affairs and the daughter of a Bahá'í mother, and Farrokhroo Parsa, a cabinet member who was not connected to the religion at all. Chehabi notes that <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> half of the Shah's cabinet were Bahá'ís are fanciful and, given the persecution the Bahá'ís have suffered, irresponsible exaggerations.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{under the}} Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) {{conducted}} {{an inquiry into}} <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> hundreds of murders of women and girls {{had taken place in}} the area of Ciudad Juarez since 1993 at the urging of several NGOs. In order for the inquiry to take place it was required that there was reliable evidence that showed that Mexico was in violation of rights established by CEDAW. The Committee analyzed the gender-based crimes occurring in Ciudad Juárez and found the two common forms were murder and disappearances. The Committee also analyzed the response of the government and found that their initial response was indifference and that the government exhibited tolerance of these crimes for years.|$|E

25|$|During {{this stage}} of his life, Florescu became close friends with Georges Bibesco, French-speaking son of Prince Gheorghe Bibescu (whom his father and uncles had deposed in 1848). He {{translated}} Bibesco's defensive biography of his father, which ran at over 1200 pages in the printed edition of 1893–1894. As he noted in a dedication to Bibesco, he considered him a friend through their shared Francophilia, but nonetheless a political adversary. Bibesco then enlisted Florescu's services in clearing Prince Gheorghe of <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> he intended to concede all of Wallachia's mining industry to Russian venture capitalists. Florescu also worked with Theodor Assan and A. Dobrovici on {{a history of the}} United Principalities, published as Unirea Română ("The Romanian Unification"), and translated Bibesco's tract on the history of Wallachia and Moldavia under Regulamentul Organic.|$|E
25|$|The {{province}} houses {{army and}} airforce bases for the Algerian military, and is strategically important {{due to its}} proximity to the Moroccan border, and its location at a four-country border crossing. From independence in 1956, the Kingdom of Morocco claimed the Tindouf area and western Algeria as part of Morocco. These claims are based on <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> until 1952, Tindouf was part of French Morocco and was administratively attached to Agadir, and promises made by parts of the Algerian underground during that country's war for independence. After Algeria's independence in 1962, Morocco's claim to Tindouf was not accepted by the new Algerian republic. This led to the 1963 Sand war, fought along the Moroccan-Algerian border in the Tindouf region, and also involving Béchar Province and Tlemcen Province, after Morocco claimed the area as its own following Algerian independence.|$|E
25|$|Besides the government, the Jan Lokpal {{movement}} was also criticised by some citizens as 'undemocratic' {{on the grounds}} that the ombudsman had powers over elected representatives. Arundhati Roy claimed that the {{movement was}} not a people's movement; instead, it was funded by foreigners to influence policy making in India. She pointed out that the Ford Foundation had funded the Emergent Leadership category of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and also donated $397,000 to Kejriwal's NGO Kabir. Both Kejriwal and Ford Foundation termed the allegations as baseless, stating that the donations were made to support the RTI campaigns. Besides, several other Indian organisations had also received grants from the Ford Foundation. Kejriwal also denied <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>that</b> the movement was a plot against the ruling Congress by the RSS, or that it was an upper-caste conspiracy against the Dalits.|$|E

5000|$|Kim vigorously disputed <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> <b>that</b> he {{had changed}} his stance on the law, and denied that his {{position}} was influenced by donations, including {{in a letter to}} the Times.

Reason reported Kim's assertion that the contributions reported by the Times included some from prior contributors not affiliated with the nail salon industry. Crain's concluded that reported contributions were a small fraction of Kim's aggregate fundraising.|$|R
