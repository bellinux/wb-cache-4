5|$|As {{the others}} plot {{to destroy the}} {{creature}} with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the creature in a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman's brain, the creature is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but the creature insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> bombs. The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature claims {{is the only way to}} truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E
5|$|Back at Mina, {{the pilgrims}} perform {{symbolic}} stoning {{of the devil}} (Ramy al-Jamarat) by throwing seven stones at only {{the largest of the}} three pillars, known as Jamrat al-Aqabah from sunrise to sunset. The remaining two pillars (jamarah) are not stoned on this day. These pillars are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they can <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> pebbles at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 the pillars were replaced by long walls, with catch basins below to collect the pebbles.|$|E

5|$|Many {{months before}} the coup, Đông had met Diệm's brother and adviser Ngô Đình Nhu, widely {{regarded}} as the brains of the regime, to ask for reform and de-politicisation of the army. Đông said that the meeting went well and was hopeful that Nhu would enact change. However, a few weeks later, Dong and his collaborators were transferred to different commands and physically separated. Fearing that Diệm and Nhu were trying to <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> plans off balance, they accelerated their planning work, and decided to move on October 6. However, they were then scheduled to go into battle against the communists near Kon Tum in the II Corps in the Central Highlands, forcing a postponement. According to the historian George McTurnan Kahin, Đông was without a command by the time the coup was held.|$|E
5|$|The {{substantial}} two storied station building, solidly build of stone, made {{an effective}} strong redoubt for the garrison, {{with the windows}} used by the defenders to fire their automatic rifles and <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> grenades from. At this time several white flags were reported at the station, but when the light horsemen approached they were fired on, {{and it was in}} this way that most of the light horsemen who died during the battle were killed. Once they succeeded in entering the station buildings, hand-to-hand fighting from room-to-room with rifles, bayonets, and swords, followed. Other groups of defenders deployed in the locomotives, tenders and carriages standing in the railway sidings, were also attacked.|$|E
5|$|When Turkey {{decided to}} join in the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy), the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed V. Reshad (1844–1918) {{declared}} a jihad against the Allied Powers (Britain, France and Russia) and issued a fatwa calling on Muslims all around the world to <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> lot with the Caliphate. This move had a huge impact on Muslims throughout the world as the Ottoman Sultan was revered as the Caliph of Islam and long considered by Indian Muslims as the final bulwark of Muslim power following the collapse of the Moghul empire in India. Overnight, Muslims serving under the British Army, such as the sepoys, faced an existential dilemma and their loyalty being torn between their ummah (community, brotherhood) and their British colonial superiors.|$|E

5|$|Back at home, Grampa babysits Bart and Lisa, who trick their {{grandfather}} into letting them <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> own party. At the lake the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away to go fishing, but Marge wakes up first. Marge is upset that Homer would choose fishing over their marriage, which Homer fails to understand as he visualizes Marge {{turning into a}} catfish. Homer takes a walk instead of returning to bed. On the dock, he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets frustrated. At home, Bart and Lisa's party has ended and {{the house is a}} total mess. Watching Grampa cry and fearing that he will get in trouble, they frantically clean up the house for him.|$|E

25|$|After Game 4, both teams' {{pitching}} coaches, Rick Honeycutt for the Dodgers and Brent Strom for the Astros, {{commented on}} how the baseball being used for the World Series is slicker than the baseball used during the regular season.

25|$|An adventurous or desperate captain {{might have}} taken up the challenge, but Illingworth was neither, Geoffrey Boycott and John Edrich were disinclined to <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> wickets away and had made an unbeaten stand of 161 when the game finally drew to a close. Ross Duncan in his only Test made 3 and took 0/30 in the first innings, did not bat or bowl {{in the second and}} took no catches.|$|E

25|$|Much {{strategy}} in cribbage {{derives from the}} fact that the first hand counted is the non-dealer's. The dealer may be only two holes from winning and the opponent twenty, but if the pone holds a 3-3-4-5 hand and has cut a 5, the dealer who pegs only a Go will lose. Players use this knowledge to decide when to <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> hands (or play their cards) aggressively or defensively.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tradition}} is the homecoming cane toss, which {{dates from the}} 1930s. Before the university's homecoming football game, third-year law students run from {{the north end of}} the football field at Camp Randall Stadium to the south end wearing bowler hats and carrying canes. When the students reach the goalpost on the south end of the field, they attempt to <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> canes over the goalpost. Legend has it that if the student successfully throws the cane over the goalpost and catches it, she will win her first case; if she fails to catch it, the opposite will hold true.|$|E
25|$|Peltasts {{were armed}} {{with a number of}} {{javelins}} and a sword, carried a light shield but wore no armour, though they sometimes had helmets; they were adept at skirmishing and were often used to guard the flanks of more heavily equipped infantry. They usually adopted an open order when facing enemy heavy infantry. They could <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> javelins at will at the enemy and, unencumbered by armour or heavy shields, easily evade any counter-charges made by heavily equipped hoplites. They were, however, quite vulnerable to shock-capable cavalry and often operated to particular advantage on broken ground where cavalry was useless and heavy infantry found it difficult to maintain formation.|$|E

On May 12, Rae was endorsed by longtime Trudeau cabinet stalwart Allan MacEachen. Former leadership contenders Maurizio Bevilacqua, Carolyn Bennett and Hedy Fry withdrew from the campaign to <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> support to Rae, with Bevilacqua becoming National Co-Chair for the campaign and Chief Advisor on Economic Policy. Susan Kadis, the former Toronto co-chair of Ignatieff's campaign, endorsed Rae on October 27. Former Finance Minister Ralph Goodale endorsed Rae on November 28.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, {{a visiting}} player will attempt a Lambeau Leap, {{only to be}} denied by Packers fans. This {{happened}} to then-Minnesota Vikings cornerback Fred Smoot when he intercepted a pass and returned it for a touchdown; Packers fans proceeded to <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> beverages on Smoot. During the , New York Giants running back Brandon Jacobs faked a Lambeau Leap after scoring a touchdown, angering many Green Bay faithful in the stands. Before {{a game against the}} Packers on September 20, 2009, Cincinnati Bengals wideout Chad Johnson, then known as Chad Ochocinco, announced he would do a Lambeau Leap if he scored a touchdown, and then followed through by leaping into the arms of pre-arranged fans wearing Bengals jerseys.|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of China, dances are held for {{young men and women}} to find partners. For example, young women are {{encouraged}} to <b>throw</b> <b>their</b> handkerchiefs to the crowd, and the young man who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in northeast Guizhou Province, young {{men and women of the}} Dong people would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.|$|E
