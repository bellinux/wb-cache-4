500|$|Fellow judge James L. Oakes {{described}} Medina as a {{fair and}} reasonable judge, and wrote that [...] "after the judge saw what the lawyers were doing, he gave <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of their own medicine, too." [...] Legal scholar and historian Michal Belknap writes that Medina was [...] "unfriendly" [...] to the defense, and that [...] "there {{is reason to believe}} that Medina was biased against the defendants", citing a statement Medina made before the trial: [...] "If we let them do that sort of thing , they'll destroy the government". According to Belknap, Medina's behavior towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had {{died of a heart attack}} during the 1943 trial involving the Smith Act. Some historians speculate that Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him into committing a legal error with the goal of achieving a mistrial.|$|E
500|$|Joel Brind, {{a faculty}} member at Baruch College in the Department of Natural Sciences, is the primary {{advocate}} of an abortionbreast cancer ("ABC") link. Brind is strongly anti-abortion and began lobbying politicians with the claim that abortion caused breast cancer in the early 1990s. Brind found that his lobbying efforts were not taken seriously because he had not published his findings in the peer-reviewed medical literature. He therefore collaborated with two anti-abortion physicians and a statistician to publish a 1996 article in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, arguing that induced abortion was a risk factor for breast cancer. The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: [...] "I have some doubts. I don't think the issue has been resolved. When {{we were talking about the}} conclusions, he [...] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The secretive {{attitude}} and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: [...] "Most characters like Snape {{are hard to}} love {{but there is a}} sort of ambiguity—you can’t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it’s fascinating when you think he’s going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he’s not so bad after all." [...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're not really sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay [...] "To Sir with Love" [...] in the book Mapping the World of Harry Potter, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as Wuthering Heights Heathcliff.|$|E
