5|$|During World War I {{the salon}} became {{a haven for}} <b>those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the war. Henri Barbusse once gave a reading from his anti-war novel Under Fire and Barney hosted a Women's Congress for Peace at the Rue Jacob. Other {{visitors}} to the salon during the war included Oscar Milosz, Auguste Rodin and poet Alan Seeger, who came while on leave from the French Foreign Legion.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of D.C. {{voting rights}} {{propose that the}} Founding Fathers never {{intended}} for District residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. <b>Those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> making D.C. a state claim that {{such a move would}} destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.|$|E
5|$|In December 1817, Edwards, {{responding}} to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly <b>those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> slavery, feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.|$|E

5|$|Edward sent assurances to the Pope {{that the}} {{conflict}} surrounding Gaveston's role was at an end. On {{the basis of these}} promises, and procedural concerns about the how the original decision had been taken, the Pope agreed to annul the Archbishop's threat to excommunicate Gaveston, thus opening the possibility of Gaveston's return. Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward. At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate <b>those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the royal steward and the marshal of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of purveyance and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, the parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.|$|E
5|$|In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was {{concluded}} between the British Government {{and representatives of}} the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, an oath of allegiance to the King was to be taken. Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and <b>those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.|$|E
5|$|Leaving {{a bowling}} alley, student Taylor Watts (Jacinda Barrett) is {{abducted}} by two men. As she is dragged into a car, her dropped purse shows {{that her father}} is Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). Watts is then seen briefing Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents on the kidnapping, as a witness describes one abductor, who was wearing a mask like those issued to U.S. troops in the Gulf War. FBI agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) remarks to the agents that Watts failed to mention of the Millennium Group or <b>those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> it in his briefing, and that her partner Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who has been investigating the Group, is absent.|$|E

50|$|Many {{members of}} the {{expedition}} felt a strong loyalty to Shipton, and were unhappy with his replacement. Edmund Hillary was one of <b>those</b> most <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the change, but was soon won round by Hunt's personality and frank admission that the change had been badly handled.|$|R

5|$|<b>Those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the new {{government}} began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer decided to move Edward to the more secure location of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire, where the former King arrived around 5 April 1327. Once at the castle, Edward was kept {{in the custody of}} Mortimer's son-in-law, Thomas Berkeley, and John Maltravers, who were given £5 a day for Edward's maintenance. It is unclear how well cared for Edward was; the records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated. A poem, the Lament of Edward II, was once thought to have been written by Edward during his imprisonment, although modern scholarship has cast doubt on this.|$|E
5|$|Upon Andronikos's death, two factions emerged at court: the {{supporters}} of Kantakouzenos, chiefly provincial magnates from Macedonia and Thrace, and <b>those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> him, led mainly by the Patriarch John XIV Kalekas, who obtained the support of Andronikos's widow, Anna of Savoy. Kantakouzenos did not claim the throne for himself, but demanded the regency, based on his close association with the deceased emperor, and {{with the support of}} the capital's troops secured it. His position, however, was weakened by the adherence of Apokaukos to the Patriarch's camp; Kantakouzenos, in his own account, relates that Apokaukos had urged him to seize the throne in hopes of his own advancement, and when he refused, the powerful chancellor switched over to his opponents' camp.|$|E
5|$|William {{returned}} to England to release his army from service in 1073 but quickly {{returned to}} Normandy, {{where he spent}} all of 1074. He left England {{in the hands of}} his supporters, including Richard fitzGilbert and William de Warenne, as well as Lanfranc. William's ability to leave England for an entire year was a sign that he felt that his control of the kingdom was secure. While William was in Normandy, Edgar the Ætheling returned to Scotland from Flanders. The French king, seeking a focus for <b>those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> William's power, then proposed that Edgar be given the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer on the Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William. Edgar was forced to submit to William shortly thereafter, however, and he returned to William's court. Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, turned his attentions to Brittany, leading to a revolt in 1075.|$|E

5000|$|In 1929, {{there was}} a debate over {{switching}} to the Latin alphabet for Russian and the many other languages of the Soviet Union. Proponents considered that the Latin alphabet was simple, rational, international, and easier to learn than the [...] "Church-Slavonic" [...] Cyrillic script. Aptekar was among <b>those</b> violently <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the change, which failed to gain momentum.|$|R
5|$|The anti-Khrushchev {{minority}} in the Presidium was augmented by <b>those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck {{at the heart of}} Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At a 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through Minister of Defense Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the Anti-Party Group, accused of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client Dmitri Shepilov who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to Mongolia; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.|$|E

50|$|In 1995 {{parliamentary}} elections, {{it became}} apparent that HND didn't attract many of HDZ voters, while <b>those</b> already <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> Tuđman overwhelmingly preferred older opposition parties. As a result, HND failed to enter Sabor. This led Mesić to leave the party and join Croatian People's Party, while Manolić began to try mending ties with HDZ. As a result, HND became marginalised.|$|R
50|$|In game theory, a {{cooperative}} game (or coalitional game) {{is a game}} with competition between groups of players ("coalitions") due {{to the possibility of}} external enforcement of cooperative behavior (e.g. through contract law). <b>Those</b> are <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> non-cooperative games in which there is either no possibility to forge alliances or all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).|$|R

25|$|The initial {{reaction}} to the marriage between Marie Antoinette and Louis-Auguste was mixed. On the one hand, the Dauphine was beautiful, personable and well-liked by the common people. Her first official appearance in Paris on 8 June 1773 was a resounding success. On the other hand, <b>those</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the alliance with Austria, and others for personal reasons, had a difficult relationship with Marie Antoinette.|$|E
