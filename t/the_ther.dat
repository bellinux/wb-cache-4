During the car festival, Kapaleeshwarar is depicted holding a bow while seated on a throne, with his wife Karpagambal alongside.

5000|$|Modern Icelandic is the Scandinavian dialect {{closest to}} Old Norse, which made a {{distinction}} between <b>the</b> plural <b>þér</b> and <b>the</b> dual þið. This distinction continued in written Icelandic the early 1920 when <b>the</b> plural <b>þér</b> was also used on formal occasions. The formal usage of þér seems to have pushed the dual þið {{to take over the}} plural so modern Icelandic normally uses þið as a plural. However, in formal documents such as by <b>the</b> president <b>þér</b> is still used as plural, and <b>the</b> usage of <b>þér</b> as plural and þið as dual is still retained in the Icelandic translation of the Christian scriptures. There are still a number of fixed expressions [...] particularly religious adages such as [...] "seek and ye shall find" [...] (leitið og þér munuð finna) [...] and the formal pronoun is sometimes used in translations from a language that adheres to a T-V distinction, but otherwise it appears only when one wants to be excessively formal either from the gravity of the occasion (as in court proceedings and legal correspondence) or out of contempt (in order to ridicule another person's self-importance), and þú is used in all other cases.|$|R

Navaratri lasts for nine days and is dedicated to various aspects of the presiding goddess, whereas Sivarathri is dedicated to Siva. Devotees visit the temple to attend the daily pujas and make their offerings. Booths are erected outside for the sale of food, drink, brassware, pottery, cloth and holy images. These functions primarily attract Hindus to the temple.|$|E

5000|$|During the Tamil {{month of}} Panguni, the {{traditional}} brahmotsavam (annual festival) takes place when the entire neighborhood comes alive with a mela (carnival)-like atmosphere. Since this month {{corresponds to the}} mid-March to mid-April duration, the Kapaleeshwarar temple celebrates the nine day-long as Panguni Peruvizha (Spring festival). The festival starts with Dwajarohanam (flag hoisting), includes the therotsavam, (Tamil, ther, [...] "car/chariot"; utsavam, [...] "festival"), Arupathimoovar festival and concludes with the Tirukkalyanam (Marriage of Kapaleeswarar & Karpagambal). In Brahmotsavam, the idols of Kapaleeshwarar and Karpagambal are decorated with clothes and jewels, are mounted on a vahana, and then taken around the temple and its water tank in a pradakshinam (a clockwise path when seen from above). This is repeated with different vahanas over the next nine days. The more important of the individual pradakshinams are the Athigara Nandhi on the third day, the Rishaba Vahanam on the midnight of the fifth day, <b>the</b> <b>ther</b> (about 13 meters in height and pulled by people) on the seventh morning, and the Arupathimoovar festival on the eighth day.|$|E

50|$|The main Thirukoneswaram Ther Thiruvilah Festival, the twenty-two-day annual chariot festival {{begins with}} the {{hoisting}} of the temple Nandi flag. This is followed by temple processions of Lord Konesar and his consort Mathumai Ambal, installed and pulled in an ornate chariot temple car while deities Pillayar and Murugan with his two consorts Valli and Theivayanai are taken ahead in two other decorated chariots. This is conducted throughout Trincomalee district, and follows Kulakottan's stone scriptures detailing how Hindus in Tamil villages like Sambaltivu, lands which historically belonged to the temple, are entitled to hold poojahs as their Upayam during the annual festival period. Until April 1624 the Koneswaram Ther Festival occurred around Puthandu in April annually with five chariots and this tradition was reintroduced in April 2003, three hundred and seventy nine years later. The water-cutting Theertham Thiruvilah festival (holy bath) takes place annually in the centuries-old Papanasachunai holy well (Papanasam Theertham) on Swami Rock during <b>the</b> <b>Ther</b> festival period. The deity and other holy artifacts are bathed in {{the water of the}} well in the complex's sacred precincts. Devotees are sprayed with the holy water following the Theertham. The Theppath Thiruvilah Boat Festival consists of Lord Konesar and goddess Mathumai Ambal taken in a boat around the temple from Swami Rock via the Back Bay Sea to the Dutch Bay Sea. Religious discourses and cultural items take place throughout the night before Puthandu at the Dutch Bay Sea beach. Thereafter the deities are taken to the temple early morning the next day on Puthandu by road through the Fort Frederick entrance. The Trincomalee Bhadrakali Amman Temple and other Hindu temples have held their water-cutting Theertham festivals in the Back Bay Sea (Theertha Kadatkarai) for several centuries. The Koneswaram Poongavanam Festival - the Temple Garden Festival is held during this twenty-two-day festival period.|$|E
5000|$|The shrine was {{attacked}} and destroyed on 14 April 1622, the Tamil New Years Day, by the Portuguese general Constantino de Sá de Noronha (who {{called it the}} Temple of a Thousand Pillars). Eleven brass lamps had been lit in the shrine and the main statues were taken out to town during <b>the</b> <b>ther</b> procession in the festive period, during which time Portuguese soldiers entered the temple dressed as Iyer priests and began robbing it. In an act of religious zeal, the temple was then levered over the edge into the sea. Fleeing priests buried some of the temple's statues in the surrounding area, and all remaining priests, pilgrims and employees were massacred. The final monument of the temple complex was destroyed two years later in 1624. Temple stones and its carved pillars were used to construct Fort Fredrick to strengthen the colonists' influence over the eastern seaboard of the island against other invading European armies, including the Dutch navy during the Dutch-Portuguese Wars. A new church and village were built {{in and around the}} fort. An extensive campaign of destruction of five hundred Hindu shrines, the Saraswathi Mahal Library and forced conversion in the Tamil country was conducted by the Portuguese upon their arrival to the island and conquest of the Jaffna kingdom; the temple had been paying protection fees of 1280 fanams a year to the Portuguese. Trincomalee witnessed several naval battles of Europe's Thirty Years' War under Phillip II's man Filipe de Oliveira. Between 1639 and 1689 A.D., the Ati Konanayakar temple was built in nearby Thampalakamam to house the idols on procession that survived. The destruction of the Konesar temple is historically viewed as the biggest loot of one of the richest temples of Asia. Gold, pearls, precious stones and silks collected for more than a millennium were robbed within a few hours. A site plan by De Quieroz states: [...] "On the first rise to the summit of the rock was a Pagoda, another at mid-ascent - the principal one of them all at the highest eminence, visited by a concourse of Hindus from the whole of India." [...] He describes three temples of the compound on the promontory, stating that pilgrims leaped from the last temple into the ocean in sacrifice to their idols. In his dispatch to Philip III, King of Portugal, Constantine described: [...] "The land of the Pagoda is 600 fathoms long and 80 feet at its broadest, narrowing to 30 feet." [...] Regarding a prophetic Tamil inscription de Noronha found at the site, he added [...] "When I went there to make this Fort, I found engraved on the Pagoda, among many other inscriptions, one that ran thus: Kulakottan has built this pagoda..." ...|$|E
