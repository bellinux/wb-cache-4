5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War, Khrimian led <b>the</b> <b>Armenian</b> delegation at the Congress of Berlin. The delegation's mission was to present a memorandum to the great powers concerning the implementation of reforms in <b>the</b> <b>Armenian</b> provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The delegation's main goal was to secure substantial reforms in <b>the</b> <b>Armenian</b> provinces that would be supervised by European powers—which meant Russia in reality, as its troops where stationed in parts of Armenia. Armenians hoped that Russian pressure (and threat of intervention) would force the Ottoman government to improve conditions in <b>the</b> <b>Armenian</b> provinces. <b>The</b> <b>Armenian</b> delegation furthermore demanded some form of autonomy for <b>the</b> <b>Armenian</b> provinces, similar to the Maronite autonomy in Mount Lebanon, but did not advocate breakup of the Ottoman Empire or annexation of <b>the</b> <b>Armenian</b> provinces into Russia.|$|E
