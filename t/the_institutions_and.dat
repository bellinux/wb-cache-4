25|$|From Garnham's critique, {{three great}} virtues of Habermas's public sphere are mentioned. Firstly, {{it focuses on}} the indissoluble like between <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> {{practices}} of mass public communication and <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> practices of democratic politics. The second virtue of Habermas's approach concentrate on the necessary material resource base for ant public. Its third virtue is {{to escape from the}} simple dichotomy of free market versus state control that dominates so much thinking about media policy.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} how {{the relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> producing texts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> intended reader of the text is construed in Swedish institutional texts about pensions from both Sweden and Finland. The texts are published in 2012 by Pensionsmyndigheten, the Swedish Pensions Agency, and Kela, <b>the</b> social security <b>institution</b> in Finland. <b>The</b> theoretical framework {{of the study is}} systemic-functional linguistics (see Halliday & Matthiessen 2004). The article studies what lexicogrammatic alterms are used to name <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader, what processes <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader are participants in and what ergative roles <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader are assigned in the processes. The results show that there are differences between the texts in all three cases. For example, in the Swedish texts the most common ergative role for both <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader is Medium, followed by Beneficiary and Agent. In the Finland-Swedish texts, however, <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> is most commonly Agent, followed by Medium and Beneficiary, whereas the reader is most commonly construed as Beneficiary, followed by Medium and Agent. The results show that {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader is construed as more explicitly asymmetrical and authoritative in the Finland-Swedish texts than in the Swedish texts...|$|R

25|$|Now, all {{the academy}} {{institutions}} are already under {{jurisdiction of the}} FASO; this agency was empowered to “evaluate”, relying on its own criteria, an efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> rearrange ineffective ones (this point is felt dangerous by many scientists). Furthermore, according to the law, the two other Russian national academies — for Agriculture and for Medicine — were fused to the RAS as its new specialized scientific divisions.|$|E

25|$|The Secretariat was revitalised at the 28th Party Congress (2 July 1990 – 13 July 1990), and the Deputy General Secretary, a newly {{established}} office, became the official Director of the Secretariat. Gorbachev chaired the first post-Congress session, {{but after that}} Vladimir Ivashko, the Deputy General Secretary, chaired its meetings. Though the Secretariat was revitalised, it never regained the authority it held in the pre-Gorbachev days. The Secretariat's authority was strengthened {{within the limits of}} <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> political rules, which had been introduced under Gorbachev – a return to the old-days was impossible.|$|E

25|$|In {{different}} deregulation processes <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> market {{designs were}} often very different {{but many of}} the underlying concepts were the same. These are: separate the potentially competitive functions of generation and retail from the natural monopoly functions of transmission and distribution; and establish a wholesale electricity market and a retail electricity market. The role of the wholesale market is to allow trading between generators, retailers and other financial intermediaries both for short-term delivery of electricity (see spot price) and for future delivery periods (see forward price).|$|E

Critics from the Right considered him a socialist due to the courting of socialist votes in parliament in exchange for political favours, while critics from the Left called him ministro della malavita (minister of the underworld) – a term coined by the historian Gaetano Salvemini – accusing him of winning elections {{with the support of}} criminals.|$|E

25|$|State racism—that is, <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> {{practices}} of a nation-state that {{are grounded in}} racist ideology—has {{played a major role}} in all instances of settler colonialism, from the United States to Australia. It also played a prominent role in the Nazi German regime, in fascist regimes throughout Europe, and during the early years of Japan's Shōwa period. These governments advocated and implemented ideologies and policies that were racist, xenophobic and, in the case of Nazism, genocidal. The politics of Zimbabwe promote discrimination against whites, in an effort to ethnically cleanse the country.|$|E

The idea for the CDF was borrowed substantially from a similar mechanism successfully employed the European Union (the EU's Cohesion Fund) in helping bring certain of its member states, such as Ireland, up to a certain economic level to assist them in effectively participating and benefiting from the integration process.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{leadership}} of the LDS Church, McKay focused on education. As General Superintendent of the church's Sunday School organization from 1918 to 1934, McKay built LDS seminaries near public high schools throughout Utah, allowing students to take LDS religious courses along with their secular high school education. McKay also transferred three LDS colleges to the state of Utah in the 1920s: Snow College, Weber State University and Dixie College. Utah underfunded <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> in 1953 the governor, J. Bracken Lee, offered to give them back to the LDS Church. McKay, then president of the church, said he would accept them, but the proposal failed on voter referendum.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> {{practices}} of canon law paralleled the legal development {{of much of}} Europe, and consequently both modern civil law and common law bear the influences of canon law. Much of the legislative style was adapted from that of Roman Law especially the Justinianic Corpus Juris Civilis. After the 'fall' of the Roman Empire and up until the revival of Roman Law in the 11th century canon law served {{as the most important}} unifying force among the local systems in the Civil Law tradition. The Catholic Church developed the inquisitorial system in the Middle Ages. The canonists introduced into post-Roman Europe the concept of a higher law of ultimate justice, over and above the momentary law of the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{weakening}} of the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction in Hispania began in 409, when the Germanic Suebi and Vandals, together with the Sarmatian Alans entered the peninsula {{at the invitation of}} a Roman usurper. These tribes who had crossed the Rhine in early 407 and ravaged Gaul. The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern Galicia and northern Portugal whereas the Vandals established themselves in southern Spain by 420 before crossing over to North Africa in 429 and taking Carthage in 439. As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture.|$|E

25|$|The {{revolution}} of 1933 undermined <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> coercive {{structures of the}} oligarchic state. The young and relatively inexperienced revolutionaries found themselves pushed into the halls of state power by worker and peasant mobilisations. Between September 1933 and January 1934 a loose coalition of radical activists, students, middle-class intellectuals, and disgruntled lower-rank soldiers formed a Provisional Revolutionary Government. This coalition was directed by a popular university professor, Dr Ramón Grau San Martín. The Grau government promised a 'new Cuba' with social justice for all classes, and the abrogation of the Platt Amendment. While the revolutionary leaders certainly wanted diplomatic recognition by Washington, they believed their legitimacy stemmed from the popular rebellion which brought them to power, and not from {{the approval of the}} United States' Department of State.|$|E
25|$|The kingdom {{strongly}} {{developed in}} the 14th and 15th century, {{which is to be}} considered as the Golden Age of the Valencian Culture, with first level works like Tirant lo Blanch. It also developed a high level role in Europe both economically with the silk trade, and politically with the rise of the Crown of Aragon (in which the Kingdom of Valencia became the most populated and the main economical power at that time) and the ascension of the Valencian House of Borja in Rome. After a slow decline following the dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon with the Kingdom of Castile, this came definitely to an end with the Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609 by the Hispanic Monarchy, which represented the loss of up to one third {{of the population of the}} Kingdom of Valencia and took the main agricultural labor force away.In 1707, in the context of the War of the Spanish Succession, and by means of the Nova Planta decrees, king Philip V of Spain abolished the Kingdom of Valencia, and the rest of states belonging to the former Crown of Aragon and which had retained some autonomy, and subordinated it to the structure of the Kingdom of Castile and its laws and customs. As a result of this, <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> laws created by the Furs of Valencia (Furs de València) were abolished and the usage of the Valencian language in official instances and education was forbidden. Consequently, with the House of Bourbon, a new Kingdom of Spain was formed implementing a more centralized government and absolutist regime than the former Habsburg Spain.|$|E
