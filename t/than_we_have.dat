25|$|Even {{the name}} Gentius or Genthius {{does not help}} {{to solve the problem}} since we have two Illyrian forms Genthius and Zanatis. If Gentius or Genthius derives from *ǵen- (be born) this is proof of a Centum language, but if the name Zanatis is {{similarly}} generated (or from *ǵen- know) <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a Satem language. Another problem related to the name Gentius is that nowadays it cannot be stated surely if the initial /g/ of the sources was a palatovelar or a labiovelar.|$|E

"In {{trying to}} explain the {{unexpected}} weakness of GDP growth over this period, it is natural to ask whether it was caused in part by fiscal tightening - either because {{it turned out to}} be larger <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> originally assumed or because a given tightening did more to depress GDP <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> originally assumed.|$|R

25|$|In three {{dimensions}} this restates in matrix form an observation made by Euler, so mathematicians call the ordered sequence of three angles Euler angles. However, {{the situation is}} somewhat more complicated <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> so far indicated. Despite the small dimension, we actually have considerable freedom in the sequence of axis pairs we use; {{and we also have}} some freedom in the choice of angles. Thus we find many different conventions employed when three-dimensional rotations are parameterized for physics, or medicine, or chemistry, or other disciplines. When we include the option of world axes or body axes, 24 different sequences are possible. And while some disciplines call any sequence Euler angles, others give different names (Cardano, Tait–Bryan, roll-pitch-yaw) to different sequences.|$|E

500|$|Only the {{flagship}} New York managed to match British practice in both categories. In Admiral Beatty's words, {{the results were}} [...] "distinctly poor and disappointing", and {{led him to the}} initial conclusion that he could not consider the American division the equivalent of a British one. The Americans worked to catch up, however, and with every target practice registered improved results. By the end of June 1918, Admiral Rodman was able to report that [...] "the firing was exceptionally fine, most encouraging and much better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> ever done previously".|$|E
500|$|The press {{soon learned}} of the March 1973 collaboration, leading to {{heightened}} rumours regarding a full Beatles reunion, particularly in the UK. That same month, Starr announced that any such reunion was [...] "absolutely out of the question". In October, by which point he had separated from Ono, Lennon told Chris Charlesworth of Melody Maker that the four ex-Beatles were [...] "closer now <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been for a long time" [...] and there was [...] "always a chance" [...] of a temporary reunion. He added that McCartney would probably have played on [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] also, had he been in Los Angeles at the time. Recognising {{the importance of the}} session with Lennon and Harrison, Starr decided to record McCartney's contribution to Ringo, [...] "Six O'Clock", in London, to ensure that McCartney also appeared on the album.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} chorus, a chorale fantasia, the melody of the German [...] "" [...] is {{embedded}} in an orchestral concerto. The movement opens with calls derived from the chorale tune played on the two horns, leading to a free concerto with the strings and oboes. The cantus firmus is sung by the soprano in long notes, while the lower voices engage in imitation. John Eliot Gardiner compares the movement to the openings of the two former cantatas for the same occasion: [...] "The presence of two horns ... reveals a much more regal portrait of the Good Shepherd <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> previously met." [...] Both Alfred Dürr and Klaus Hofmann assume that the music was not originally composed for this pastoral text, but previously, for the [...] Bach had composed a different chorale fantasia on the same melody in Auf Christi Himmelfahrt allein, BWV 128, with similar instrumentation.|$|E
500|$|Morton {{once again}} {{called for a}} series of reforms, repeating those from 1840, and {{including}} a proposal to transfer the tax burden from real to personal property. [...] He was criticized by the Whigs for omitting any mention of slavery in his inaugural address. [...] During his term the leaders of the various Democratic factions squabbled over executive and party appointments, and the death of President William Henry Harrison shortly after taking office brought on further party divisions as potential presidential nominees canvassed the state for support. [...] As a consequence, much of the reform agenda was either not implemented at all, or only minimally, despite a nominally working Democratic-Liberty coalition majority in the legislature. [...] George Bancroft bemoaned the lost opportunity: [...] "Never had a party a better opening <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> in Massachusetts, if all would but profit by our position. [...] But they will not." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1842 Bennett {{had been}} a {{director}} of the Philharmonic Society of London. He helped to relieve the society's perilous finances by persuading Mendelssohn and Spohr to perform with the Society's orchestra, attracting full houses and much-needed income. In 1842 the orchestra, under the composer's baton, gave the London premiere of Mendelssohn's Third (Scottish) Symphony, two months after its world premiere in Leipzig. In 1844 Mendelssohn conducted the last six concerts of the society's season, in which among his own works and those of many others he included music by Bennett. From 1846 to 1854 the Society's conductor was Michael Costa, of whom Bennett disapproved; Costa was too devoted to Italian opera and not a partisan of the German masters, as was Bennett. Bennett wrote to Mendelssohn on 24 July, displaying some querulousness, [...] "The Philharmonic Directors have engaged Costa... with which I am not very well pleased, but I could not persuade them to the contrary, and am tired of quarrelling with them. They are a worse set this year <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> ever had." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing the album's {{reception}} in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner wrote: [...] "Harrison's worldly critics, {{who had long}} found his sermons insufferable, responded like bulls to a red flag to Extra Texture, which contains a number of treatises on how reviewers always 'miss the point.'" [...] Even Harrison's loyal [...] "disciples", Schaffner continued, tended to view the album as [...] "plodding and aimless". Rolling Stones reviewer, Dave Marsh, highlighted [...] "You" [...] as a return to All Things Must Pass-style grandeur, and [...] "Can't Stop Thinking About You" [...] and [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as [...] "the most effective nine minutes of music" [...] the artist had made since 1970. Generally, on an album that was [...] "sketchy at best", however, Marsh bemoaned the over-reliance on [...] "merely competent" [...] keyboards and Harrison's [...] "affectingly feeble voice", before concluding: [...] "Harrison {{is no longer a}} Beatle, as he has reminded us more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> asked. But if he learned nothing else from his experience in that organization, it ought to have been that a good guitar player isn't worth much without a band." ...|$|E
500|$|Kubicek {{characterized}} {{the fact that}} Sebastian was not arrested for injuring Blaine as [...] "an absurd plot twist". He criticized Kurt for withholding the evidence and wrote, [...] "Santana's plan isn't vicious or mean, it's getting justice. Sebastian committed a crime and he should pay for it." [...] Slezak thought the {{decision as to whether}} the police would be given Santana's evidence should have been Blaine's to make, and Lynch posited that [...] "a talk with the police" [...] might teach Sebastian [...] "that violent actions have legal consequences". Chaney was incredulous at Will's statements to the glee club on the matter, especially, [...] "Unless you have proof that he tampered with the slushie, the police aren’t getting involved." [...] Kubicek called Artie's anger that led to [...] "Scream" [...] a story arc that [...] "goes nowhere and was just a poorly written excuse to do that song", but Votta was impressed that [...] "we learn more about Artie's frustration in this fantasy scene <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> in 3 seasons". Canning wrote that [...] "as extraneous as the extended [...] "Scream" [...] segment was, the build up to that moment was perfect".|$|E

In his review of the episode, Dan Iverson of IGN wrote: [...] "After a couple more episodes like the one that Family Guy had on Sunday night, we could officially and unequivocally call the show the best animated program to air on the weekend", adding [...] "we are completely willing to raise the once hit-or-miss comedy of Family Guy to the level of most consistently funny comedy on FOX Sunday nights— and that is thanks to great stories and hilarious comedy like that of this week's episode [...] "Barely Legal." [...] In a review of Family Guy, Volume five, Nancy Basile regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes". Brett Love of TV Squad commented: [...] "It seemed like more of a cohesive story <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen in a while as the whole family was tied in to the same storyline", later adding [...] "I liked the story of Meg's infatuation with Brian", concluding with [...] "overall, I'd call this one a really good episode." ...|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with The Sun that he was [...] "so proud of [...] lyrically" [...] and thought the song [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] contained the best lyrics he had ever written. Taylor explained that it was [...] "very easy" [...] for him to focus on the [...] "more serious lyrics, like a love song very dear to [...] heart" [...] but stated that [...] "Wrestlers" [...] was [...] "equally as important and feels like a very different style of music <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> ever got down on record before." [...] He discussed [...] "Wrestlers" [...] in the band's interview with The Sun, explaining that the song is [...] "musically and lyrically quite direct" [...] because [...] "it doesn't have thousands of layers", in contrast to the song [...] "Bendable Poseable". The concept of the song [...] "Wrestlers", originates from a text message from James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. After Doyle toured with Murphy, Murphy sent a text message that said, [...] "Sorry you can't have Al back, I'll wrestle you for him. And I'll beat you because I'm bigger and stronger than you." [...] Goddard explained that [...] "the words in that song are about wrestling", and the band [...] "have no doubt" [...] that Murphy would defeat them in a wrestling fight.|$|E
500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal learning, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book reads like that {{of a man who has}} really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E
