5|$|A {{brief period}} of {{inactivity}} followed before the advance continued. On 26 July, {{as a result of}} the casualties that they had suffered earlier in the month, the battalion was withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>and</b> moved to the rear. Although they undertook security duties, they did not see action again before the war ended on 15 August 1945. During the fighting around Balikpapan the 2/31st Battalion suffered the highest number of casualties of any Allied unit deployed in the Borneo campaign, losing 44 men killed and 134 wounded.|$|E

5|$|After the Six-Day War, Jerusalem's {{municipal}} borders were {{expanded to}} include the Old City and beyond. Barricades that had lined the border were torn down. Many buildings on Mamilla's eastern end were in shambles from <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>and</b> lack of maintenance. Several historic buildings were condemned. One was the Stern House, which housed Zionist leader Theodor Herzl on his 1898 visit.

5|$|The Germans also {{suffered}} heavily; the 47th Panzer Corps had committed its last reserves into the battle and could hardly afford {{to maintain its}} defensive line, while the 47th Volksgrenadier Division had suffered over 4,300 casualties during <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>and</b> the 340th Division had lost nearly 2,000 soldiers.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>and</b> led to the Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result of Austria's defeat, Kaiser Franz Joseph was forced to accede to Hungarian demands for greater autonomy, and the country became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867. The two halves of the Dual Monarchy held veto power over the other, and Hungarian disinterest in naval expansion led to severely reduced budgets for the fleet. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
