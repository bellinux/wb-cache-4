5|$|In the 1970s the {{resident}} of No 22, Miss Amabel Wellesley-Colley, painted {{her front door}} yellow instead of the traditional white. Bath City Council issued a notice insisting it should be repainted. A court case ensued {{which resulted in the}} Secretary of State for the Environment declaring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> could remain yellow. Other proposals for alteration and development including floodlighting and a swimming pool have been defeated.|$|E
5|$|When Quatermass and {{his team}} reach the crash area and succeed in opening the rocket, they {{discover}} that {{only one of the}} three crewmen, Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (Hugh Kelly) investigate the interior of the rocket, and are baffled by what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was never opened in flight, but {{there is no sign of}} the other two crewmen.|$|E
5|$|After finding Sharon's trashed hotel room, Mulder {{meets with}} Millar, who tells him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was {{pulled off the}} plane from the outside while it was in flight. Later, Frish finds his {{colleague}} dead from a faked suicide. A group of commandos arrive to capture Frish, but he escapes. Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds later, {{there was an explosion}} and the plane disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO. He finds Sharon nearby, having just been returned by her abductors.|$|E
50|$|Reception for fairy doors {{have been}} mixed, as proponents claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> are {{entertaining}} and can stimulate the imagination while critics claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> can cause {{damage to property}} or surrounding flora and fauna. Residents {{in the small town}} of Crewkerne, Somerset complained over a series of 200 fairy doors that had been installed in the nearby Wayford Woods as the village's infrastructure was not equipped to deal with the amount of tourism <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> attracted. <b>The</b> townspeople also complained of increased garbage along the wood's trails, leading to the woodland's trustees removing <b>the</b> fairy <b>doors.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck in the head several times while asleep in bed, {{awakening}} him. He ran for the door, where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help, and one of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the alarm, and the household soon realised that Ernest's other valet, Joseph Sellis, was not among them, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to Sellis's room was locked. The lock was forced, and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound apparently self-inflicted. Ernest received several serious wounds during the apparent attack, and required over a month to recover from his injuries. The social reformer and anti-monarchist Francis Place managed to get on the inquest jury and became its foreman. Place went to the office of a barrister friend to study inquest law, and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted the inquest be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he basically ran the inquest himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of suicide against Sellis.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

50|$|A common story {{regarding}} <b>the</b> tragedy states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> at <b>the</b> {{bottom of}} the Italian Hall's stairs opened inward. According to the story, when the fleeing party goers reached the {{bottom of the}} stairs, they pressed up against <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> preventing them from opening and causing many people to be crushed. All photos of <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> suggest a double set of doors with both sets opening outward. The book Death's Door: The Truth Behind Michigan's Largest Mass Murder pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were not mentioned as a contributing factor at the December 1913 coroner's inquest, the 1914 subcommittee hearing, or in any of the newspaper stories of <b>the</b> time. <b>That</b> book also included blueprints of the building drawn by an architect, showing the locations and configurations of <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>the</b> staircase, and the landings. A recent book by Alison K. Hoagland, Mine Towns (declared to be a Michigan Notable Book 2010), alleges there were two sets of doors opening onto a vestibule, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>doors</b> opened outward; and {{there may have been a}} set of inner bifold doors.|$|R

West-Indian chief selector Clyde Butts stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was open for Samuels {{to serve the}} West Indies in international cricket provided that he proved himself on the domestic circuit. During the 2011 World Cup in February and March, all-rounder Dwayne Bravo suffered an injury and the West Indies Cricket Board asked Samuels to fly out {{to act as a}} replacement. Samuels declined, stating that he did not yet feel ready, but that he was targeting a return during India's tour of the West Indies in June and July.|$|E
25|$|Five {{crew members}} {{escaped from the}} cockpit through a 14-by-10-inch clear vision panel, and two more through a gash in the {{fuselage}} in the crew compartment, the sole survivors of the accident. Holes were cut in the fuselage through which a stewardess and two passengers were removed, but the latter died before reaching a hospital, and the stewardess died later of her injuries. No {{attempt was made to}} use the emergency exits, and the main cabin door was jammed; at the inquiry a fire expert attached to the RAF stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the Constellation was the most difficult he had had to open in his 24-year firefighting career.|$|E

In the brief time it took them to discover <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was locked {{and return to the}} dress circle, the stage had become engulfed and they had no recourse but to attempt to work their way down the main dress circle stairs to the lobby, adding their numbers to the crush on those stairs. Fire Marshall Keady would later write that he never found evidence that the exit had been opened.|$|E
25|$|Mel is {{involved}} in high-profile storylines, such as a wedding to Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) to mark the Millennium Eve celebrations on New Year's Eve 1999, and later a problematic marriage to Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). Mel is heavily featured in a storyline marking the show's increase to four weekly episodes in 2001, when she is kidnapped by her former fling, Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). Outhwaite proved popular in the role and won multiple awards for her portrayal as Mel. Producers have indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is always open for Outhwaite {{to return to the}} role; however, Outhwaite revealed in 2010 that she has never been asked back. Outhwaite's return to the serial was announced in October 2017 and Mel will return in 2018.|$|E
25|$|After {{working through}} the checklists to safely power down the shuttle, the crew egressed Atlantis into the Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV). Shortly after, the Houston Mission Control Center handed over Atlantis to the landing convoy at the KSC. The crew {{performed}} the traditional walk-around of the shuttle after walking down the stairs from the CTV. On the runway, they also met NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, KSC Center Director Robert Cabana, shuttle program manager John Shannon, launch director Mike Leinbach, Atlantis flow manager Angie Brewer, and other NASA officials. Charles Bolden and Commander Ferguson spoke briefly on the tarmac. Feguson did note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the Waste Collection System in shuttle's mid-deck flew open during entry. After the speech, the crew got into the AstroVan for the ride to the crew quarters building where they spend the night before returning to Houston the next day.|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} {{centre of}} Gubbio has a decidedly medieval aspect: {{the town is}} austere in appearance because of the dark grey stone, narrow streets, and Gothic architecture. Many houses in central Gubbio date to the 14th and 15th centuries, and were originally the dwellings of wealthy merchants. They often have a second door fronting on the street, usually just {{a few inches from}} the main entrance. This secondary entrance is narrower, and a foot or so above the actual street level. This type of door is called a porta dei morti (door of the dead) because it was proposed that they were used to remove the bodies of any who might have died inside the house. This is almost certainly false, but there is no agreement as to the purpose of the secondary doors. A more likely theory is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was used by the owners to protect themselves when opening to unknown persons, leaving them in a dominating position.|$|E
25|$|Paine {{was arrested}} in France on December 28, 1793. Joel Barlow was {{unsuccessful}} in securing Paine’s release by circulating a petition among American residents in Paris. Sixteen American citizens were allowed to plead for Paine’s release to the Convention, yet President Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier of the Committee of General Security refused to acknowledge Paine’s American citizenship, stating he was an Englishman and a citizen of a country at war with France. Paine himself protested and claimed {{that he was a}} citizen of the U.S., which was an ally of Revolutionary France, rather than of Great Britain, which was by that time at war with France. However, Gouverneur Morris, the American minister to France, did not press his claim, and Paine later wrote that Morris had connived at his imprisonment. Paine narrowly escaped execution. A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the gaoler on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the mark had accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside; this was due to the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of Paine's cell had been left open whilst the gaoler was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. But for this quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning. He kept his head and survived the few vital days needed to be spared by the fall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794).|$|E

500|$|The Clash also {{inspired}} many {{musicians who}} were only loosely associated, if at all, with punk.

Other musicians who began performing while the Clash were active and acknowledged their debt to the band include Billy Bragg and Aztec Camera. U2's the Edge has compared the Clash's inspirational effect to that of the Ramones—both gave young rock musicians at large the [...] "sense <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of possibility had swung open."

[...] You hid in the environs of South Bend for several days, during which he was hunted by a squad led by sheriff Thomas A. Roney. [...] On January 15 he was sighted by two men; the following day the county commissioners met and agreed to offer a reward of $200 for You's capture. On January 17 You was finally apprehended by a three-man posse.

500|$|Wollheim was {{fortunate}} in obtaining {{a good deal}} of artwork from Hannes Bok, later to become a popular artist in the field. [...] Bok was enthusiastic enough about Kornbluth's [...] "Thirteen O'Clock" [...] to produce more interior drawings than Wollheim had room for in that issue; they were eventually used to advertise the magazine in later issues. [...] For the February 1941 issue of Stirring Science Stories, the $15 art budget went to Leo Morey, an established artist. [...] Morey's cover was undistinguished; Damon Knight commented later <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the airlock in the picture evidently did not fit, and that at $15 Morey was overpaid.
