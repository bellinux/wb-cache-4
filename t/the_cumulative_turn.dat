Data on road crashes involving fatal, serious and slight casualties in 571 wards in Eastern England were examined against four measures of average road curvature (mean angle per bend, cumulative angle per km, number of bends per km and ratio of road distance to straight distance) using regression analysis. Taking account of other risk factors, measures of average road curvature in wards were negatively associated with crash numbers, especially for fatal crashes. The strongest associations were with <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> angle <b>turned</b> per km. The results add to evidence suggesting that road casualty risk effects vary with geographical scale.

40|$|Bends in roads {{can cause}} crashes {{but a recent}} study in the UK found that areas with mostly curved roads had lower crash rates than areas with straighter roads. This present study aimed to {{replicate}} the previous research in a different country. Variations {{in the number of}} fatal road crashes occurring between 1996 and 2005 in 73 territorial local authorities across New Zealand were modelled against possible predictors. The predictors were traffic flow, population counts and characteristics, car use, socio-economic deprivation, climate, altitude and road characteristics including four measures of average road curvature. The best predictors of the number of fatal crashes on urban roads, rural state highways and other rural roads were traffic flow, speed limitation and socio-economic deprivation. Holding significant factors constant, {{there was no evidence that}} TLAs with the most curved roads had more crashes than elsewhere. Fatal crashes on urban roads were significantly and negatively related to two measures of road curvature: the ratio of road length to straight distance and <b>the</b> <b>cumulative</b> angle <b>turned</b> per kilometre. Weaker negative associations on rural state highways could have occurred by chance. These results offer limited support to the suggestion that frequently occurring road bends might be protective...|$|R
