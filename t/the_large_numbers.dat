5|$|According to Transport for London (TfL), {{the station}} is at {{capacity}} {{because of the large}} number of passengers leaving and entering the station, as well as <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> of passengers changing between lines. Currently, everyone who uses the station has to pass through the intermediate concourse {{at the bottom of the}} main escalators. This causes congestion and delays.|$|E
5|$|Aside from <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> {{of organisms}} {{actually}} {{consumed by the}} walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in U.S. history, SCATANA was invoked, thus {{stranding}} tens of thousands of passengers across the world. The FAA closed American airspace to all international flights, causing about five hundred flights to be turned back or redirected to other countries. Canada received 226 of the diverted flights and launched Operation Yellow Ribbon to deal with <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> of grounded planes and stranded passengers.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} masked shrike to be between 105,000–300,000 individuals, suggesting a global total of 142,000–600,000 birds. Although the population appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. <b>The</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> and extensive breeding range of about , mean that this shrike is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The local Biodiversity Action Plan {{recommends}} {{land management}} measures {{to control the}} spread of ragwort and bracken and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: Japanese knotweed, rhododendron, New Zealand flatworm and mink.

The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket only because of <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E
5|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} {{that there is}} serious competition for food between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the sheer amount of biomass carp now take up, and <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> of larvae carp produce, causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite (Lernaea cyprincea) and serious vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi).|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the war, {{large numbers of}} public memorials were erected {{around the country in}} memory of Belgian soldiers who had died fighting for the Allied cause during the conflict.

5|$|Relieved by a Polish unit in March 1945, the {{regiment}} {{returned to the}} front lines in early April after a period of rest. It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard and on 2 May, the 2nd New Zealand Division entered Trieste. While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. The partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders, and {{the regiment}} remained in Trieste for several weeks until <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> of Yugoslav partisans withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga was {{surplus to}} postwar {{requirements}} with <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> of Essex-class carriers in service, {{and she was}} assigned to Operation Crossroads on 22 January 1946. This was a test conducted at Bikini Atoll to evaluate {{the effect of the}} atomic bomb on ships. Captain Stanhope Ring assumed command on 6 March, but was relieved on 2 June by Captain Donald MacMahan. The ship hosted comedian Jack Benny's radio show on 21 April, while Saratoga was berthed in San Francisco before her departure for Bikini. She departed from pier 33 and headed out the Golden Gate on 1 May 1946.|$|E
5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. This decrease is attributed to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> of peasants who were either deported to Egypt to work in manufacturing, drafted into Egypt's military, or abandoned their villages and farms to join the Bedouin nomadic populations. Around 10,000 peasants were deported to Egypt and the general population was disarmed. The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well. As Ibrahim consolidated his hold over Palestine and disarmed the population, banditry by local tribesmen and civil strife was largely eliminated.|$|E

5|$|The European {{population}} of the Eurasian nuthatch has been estimated as 22.5–57million birds, suggesting a global total of 45.9–228million individuals. China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Russia each have between 10,000 and 100,000 breeding pairs. The known breeding area is about 23.3million km2 (9million sq mi), which is {{a large proportion of}} the potential suitable habitat, and the population appears to be stable. <b>The</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> and huge breeding range mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} yellowhammer to be from 54–93million individuals, suggesting a Eurasian total of 73–186million birds. Although the population {{appears to be in}} a decline, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. <b>The</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> and huge breeding range of about 12.9million km2 (5million sq mi), mean that this bunting is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} {{the population of}} the fulvous whistling duck to be from 1.3–1.5million individuals. This may be an underestimate since regional assessments suggest 1million birds in the Americas, 1.1million in Africa and at least 20,000 in South Asia. Although the population appear to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. <b>The</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> and huge breeding range mean that this duck is classified by the IUCN as being of Least Concern.

The Environment Agency considers that managed retreat {{is likely to be}} the long-term solution, and is working with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain of}} the castle, Major Hannibal Bonithon, was invited by Colonel John Arundell to retreat to the {{stronger}} fortress of Pendennis, but Bonithon and his men surrendered immediately without putting up resistance. This decision has been put down to a result of war-weariness, <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> of Parliamentary troops facing them and the generous surrender terms on offer, although the 19th-century historian Samuel Oliver also suspected that Bonithon might have had Parliamentarian sympathies. 160 small arms and 13 artillery pieces were captured: the castle's guns were removed and redeployed in the siege of Pendennis, which fell that August.|$|E
5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck feeds in wetlands by day {{or night}} on seeds {{and other parts of}} plants. It is sometimes regarded as a pest of rice cultivation, and is also shot for food in parts of its range.
