2500|$|Trypsin (...) is a serine {{protease}} from the PA clan superfamily, {{found in the}} digestive system of many vertebrates, where it hydrolyses proteins. Trypsin is formed in the small intestine when its proenzyme form, the trypsinogen produced by the pancreas, is activated. Trypsin cleaves peptide chains mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine, except when either is followed by proline. It is used for numerous biotechnological processes. The process is {{commonly referred to as}} trypsin proteolysis or <b>trypsinisation,</b> and proteins that have been digested/treated with trypsin are said to have been trypsinized. Trypsin was discovered in 1876 by Wilhelm Kühne.|$|E

40|$|Three major {{difficulties}} must {{be overcome}} {{to establish a}} quantitative method for melanosomal transfer analysis: (i) establishing a three-dimensional co-culture reassuring direct melanocyte to keratinocyte transfer, (ii) separation of melanocytes and keratinocytes following co-culture and (iii) melanosome quantification in each cell population. Melanocytes and keratinocytes are cultured on the {{opposite sides of the}} porous membrane of hanging cell inserts (1 mum pores, 2 x 10 (6) pores/cm(2)). Cell separation is performed after 3 days of co-culture by simple <b>trypsinisation.</b> Melanosome quantification in separated cell populations was accomplished by an ELISA-like method using gp- 100 as the antigen. Melanocytes and keratinocytes come into 'direct' contact through the pores, and melanosomal transfer is accomplished without cell passage through the membrane.

40|$|Research {{in medical}} {{genetics}} may frequently involve freezing {{of large numbers}} of peripheral blood samples. This is a convenient method for storing blood for subsequent DNA isolation and analysis. An area of potential concern is the low yield of DNA from blood samples that have been frozen. Here we report a modification of the widely used standard proteinase K/phenol DNA isolation method for improving the yield and purity of DNA from frozen blood samples, by an initial <b>trypsinisation</b> of whole blood before cell lysis to obtain lymphocytic nuclei and subsequent DNA purification. We report an increased total yield of DNA with pretrypsinised blood as well as improved purity. These results indicate that <b>trypsinisation</b> of thawed whole blood helps the deproteinisation process, reducing the amount of protein associated with the nuclear pellet.

40|$|AbstractThe {{activities}} of the sialyltransferase enzymes and the resulting expression of sialoglycoproteins were examined in tumor cells derived from different tissues {{in order to gain}} a greater understanding of the factors controlling the cell glycosylation state. Cell-cell contact, which is dependent on cell confluency state, was shown to influence glycosylation in the neurally-derived mouse neuro- 2 A neuroblastoma and the C 6 glioma cell lines. Both showed a relatively high level of cell sialyltransferase activity under sub-confluent conditions with activity decreasing upon the formation of cell-cell contacts associated with confluency. A parallel decrease in the expression of sialoglycoproteins, as determined by lectin blot analysis, was also observed under these conditions. In contrast, the H 411 e hepatoma cell line showed an increase in enzyme activity with confluency with the susceptibility of the enzyme in this cell line to glucocorticoid induction only being detected in sub-confluent cell cultures. The number of <b>trypsinisation</b> cycles of the cells was also shown to affect the enzyme activity of the neuro- 2 A and C 6 cells with an increase in enzyme activity coincident with passage number being observed in the neuro- 2 A cells, and a decrease in the C 6 glioma cell line. <b>Trypsinisation</b> had no effect on enzyme activity in the H 411 e cells. These results demonstrate that the control of sialyltransferase activity in tumor cells is multifactorial with the tissue of origin playing a key role...|$|E

METHODS [...] Immunohistochemistry, using a standard avidin-biotin technique, with microwave pretreatment and <b>trypsinisation</b> in a certain proportion of cases. The material comprised 43 mesotheliomas, 44 adenocarcinomas and five reactive pleuras. RESULTS [...] Epithelial mesotheliomas and the hyperplastic mesothelial cells reacted strongly with OV 632, the reaction with sarcomatoid and desmoplastic tumours was weak, and the reaction with adenocarcinomas was variable. An unequivocal but sometimes patchy positive reaction was obtained with MOC 31 {{in all but one}} of the adenocarcinomas; {{all but one of the}} mesotheliomas and all the reactive pleuras were negative. Review of the two apparently anomalous cases revealed that the original diagnoses had probably been incorrect. Reactions to both antibodies were abolished by microwave pretreatment, and also by prior <b>trypsinisation</b> in the case of OV 632. CONCLUSIONS [...] OV 632 is unsuitable for routine clinical use in paraffin wax embedded material. MOC 31, however, would be a useful addition to a panel of antibodies in the differential diagnosis of mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma in large biopsy and resection specimens and necropsy material. Its value in small biopsy specimens remains to be assessed. Microwave pretreatment does not enhance the reactions with either antibody...|$|E
40|$|In order {{further to}} characterise and {{evaluate}} the reproducibility of human red cells coated with complement in vitro, the number of molecules of C 3 subcomponents/red cell were determined by Scatchard analysis of equilibrium concentrations of bound and free antibody using 125 I-labelled goat anti-rabbit IgG. A 1 : 1 combining ratio was assumed. Red cells coated via the classical pathway had twice as much bound C 3 b and C 3 d as alternative pathway-coated cells. Assays using different anti-C 3 d sera gave different amounts of bound antigen, but results with any one antiserum versus one cell type were reproducible. Anti-C 3 d sera raised to C 3 d-tryp and to C 3 d-KAF detected significantly different amounts of bound C 3 d on the same cells. Both <b>trypsinisation</b> and serum KAF treatment of classical pathway-coated cells resulted in marked reduction of C 3 b molecules/cell (over 90 % in both cases). Similar reduction in bound C 3 b was seen after <b>trypsinisation</b> of alternative pathway-coated cells, but serum KAF treatment of such cells had no significant effect. K 0 values were lower with anti-C 3 c than with anti-C 3 d. Anti-C 3 d K 0 values with the various cells coated with complement in vitro were not statistically different (approximately 107 litres/mol), {{with the exception of}} trypsinised alternative pathway-coated cells (approximately 108 litres/mol, the same order of magnitude observed with cells coated with C 3 d in vivo). A non-linear relationship between antiglobulin titre and antigen strength was observed. The minimal number of C 3 d molecules/red cell detectable by agglutination with the various anti-C 3 d sera ranged from 200 to 670 molecules.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the first example}} of particulate materials that can detach cultured cells and then release them intact in a temperature controlled manner. Topologically open microgels composed of water swollen highly branched polymers prepared from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) were modified with a cell-adhesive peptide (GRGDS) to produce particles for gently detaching and then transferring cultured cells to new substrates. The particles bind to cell surface integrins on both dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells and at temperatures above the lower critical solution temperature (34 degrees C) remove cells from their normal culture substrates. Brief (45 min) cooling of the resultant particle-cell dispersion to beneath 34 degrees C releases the cells to grow on new substrates. This avoids the need for <b>trypsinisation</b> to detach cells or centrifugation to collect cells post-detachment and offers a flexible approach to cell detachment and transport which is compatible with normal cell culture methodologies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Genes {{upregulated}} {{within the}} tumour microenvironment represent potential targets for rational drug design. Most studies to date {{concentrate on the}} effects of hypoxia, although it is likely many genes are regulated by a more physiological combination of factors. MATERIALS & METHODS: Cells under conditions analogous to the normal and tumour microenvironments were isolated from the plateau-phase system and multicellular spheroids.

40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} {{investigate}} wound healing in bone {{it is essential}} to know the process of bone cell attachment and detachment to the surface. Cells are not found in isolation and they usually adhere to other cells or surrounding extracellular (ECM) environment in vivo and substrate or a surface in vitro. <b>Trypsinisation</b> was carried out in order to investigate its effect on cell detachment, in the presence of TGF-β 3, HCl or BSA/HCl solutions. Trypsin was therefore added to four groups of bone cells with addition of TGF-β 3, HCl, HCl/BSA solutions and additional flask as control. These results further confirmed that application of TGF-β 3, HCl and HCl/BSA at 50 ng/ml decreased the degree of cell attachment on surface of culture flasks. Cell detachment in control is about 43 % after 6 minutes, which is slow. Bone cells in presence of BSA/HCl have start detaching from the surface faster than control (about 4 -...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of comparative quality assessment studies in immunocytochemistry was examined. The reactions of three CD 15 antibodies [...] anti-Leu M 1, DM 1, and Tü 9 [...] {{were examined in}} paraffin wax sections in Hodgkin's disease {{under a variety of}} different fixation and pre-treatment conditions, using four immunochemical detection techniques. All three antibodies stained Reed-Sternberg cells, but DM 1 could be used at slightly higher dilutions to achieve comparable results. Tissue fixed in formol sublimate showed the most intense staining reactions, and formol saline and neutral buffered formalin gave relatively poor results. Although neuraminidase pre-treatment improved staining, its routine use is probably contraindicated by its high cost. <b>Trypsinisation</b> has some value for sections of tissue fixed in formol saline and neutral buffered formalin. The avidin-biotin complex technique produced the best results, but indirect immunoperoxidase produced acceptable results, is technically easier to perform, and is less expensive.

40|$|Several immunohistological {{methods for}} the {{demonstration}} of progesterone receptors were tried on routinely processed paraffin wax sections of breast carcinoma, using Abbott's PgR-ICA monoclonal antibody. The best results were obtained with the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex method with no prior <b>trypsinisation</b> or DNAse digestion, and with imidazole added to the final diaminobenzidine developing solution. A simple semiquantitative scoring system {{was used to assess}} the staining results which were then compared with the results obtained by a standard dextran-coated charcoal biochemical assay. Of 31 cases examined, the results of the two methods were concordant in 25 (81 %) of cases. This is near the higher end of the concordance range obtained by several other authors using frozen sections. The discordance encountered in a few cases was possibly the result of sampling errors which are more likely to occur with the chemical rather than the histological method.

The same sera bound to staphylococci without prior dilution and absorption {{could be used to}} group enzyme extracts of haemolytic streptococci by slide agglutination, the results again comparing favourably with those of the Phadebact kit. Beta-haemolytic streptococci have traditionally been serogrouped by precipitation reactions using antigen extracts. 1 - 3 Agglutination reactions using whole streptococci are unreliable, firstly because the group antigens are not always exposed, and, secondly, because cross-reactions regularly occur. 4 5 These problems can be overcome by <b>trypsinisation</b> of the streptococci and by absorption of the grouping sera with cross-reacting streptococcal strains. 4 Christensen et al. 5 have shown that the technique of coag-glutination, which is more sensitive than aggluti-nation as it uses a second particle, the antibody-coated staphylococcus in the reaction, can be used to group beta-haemolytic streptococci provided that the antisera are suitable (ie, give no cross-reactions).

40|$|AbstractThe {{selectivity}} of the lipid–protein {{interactions in}} trypsinised Na,K-ATPase membranes from Squalus acanthias {{has been determined}} by using EPR spectroscopy with different lipid probes spin-labelled on the 14 -C atom of the fatty acid chain. From measurements at low ionic strength and different pH values, the pattern of selectivity is: (stearic acid) −>(phosphatidylserine) −>(stearic acid) 0 >(phosphatidylcholine) ±, where superscripts indicate the formal electrostatic charge on the lipid headgroup. This {{is in the same}} order as that determined with native Na,K-ATPase membranes [M. Esmann, D. Marsh, Biochemistry 24 (1985) 3572 – 3578]. The selectivity for phosphatidylserine is independent of pH, over the range pH 6. 0 – 9. 0, as found also for native membranes. For membranes trypsinised in the presence of Rb+ ions, and in the presence of Na+ (which allows more extensive proteolysis), the relative association constants, Kr, of all lipids are the same as for control membranes, with the exception of ionised (stearic acid) − that shows the highest specificity. Therefore, both the stoichiometry and the principal determinants of the specificity of lipid–protein interaction are preserved on extensive <b>trypsinisation</b> of Na,K-ATPase membranes.

Epithelial cells of Barrett's oesophagus were isolated from resected oesophagus specimens by two methods not previously applied {{to the culture of}} Barrett's oesophagus cells. These techniques included <b>trypsinisation</b> of small fragments of mucosa, followed by plating in tissue culture dishes, and a direct tissue explant technique. A modified MCDB- 153 growth medium was used. Primary trypsin technique cultures were plated on uncoated plastic, or plastic coated with type I collagen, type IV collagen, or fibronectin. Growth on type IV collagen and fibronectin plates was slower but produced less contamination from fibroblasts. By 20 - 40 days most cultures formed confluent monolayers made up of cells with epithelial morphology. The cells were cytokeratin positive, vimentin negative, and contained alcian blue positive vacuoles, confirming their epithelial origin and suggesting their derivation from Barrett's oesophagus. Electron microscopy showed tonofilaments, microvilli, and desmosomes. Cells proliferated through up to eight subcultures before growth slowed and cells showed senescent changes.

New drugs that target cells within this microenvironment are required, {{the first step}} in this process being the identification of new targets. The aim of this thesis was to characterise changes in the transcriptome and proteome within specific regions of multicell-tumour spheroids (MCTS), an experimental model that mimics many of the features of the tumour microenvironment. HT 29 MCTS were separated by sequential <b>trypsinisation</b> into 3 main regions; the outer surface layer (SL) the peri-necroric region (PN) and the necrotic core (NC).

Scanning electron microscopy showed that Giardia attached to the apical microvillus membrane and basolateral membrane of rat enterocytes. Any location on the parasite surface could mediate attachment without predeliction for the ventral disc. Trophozoites attached more avidly to jejunal compared with colonic epithelial cells.

Under conditions in which cells are actively forming desmosomes, the largest polypeptide, dg 2, becomes phosphorylated on serine, but the two smaller polypeptides, dg 3 a and 3 b, do not. Controlled <b>trypsinisation</b> of intact cells yields three membrane-protected fragments (Mr 28, 000, 24, 000 and 23, 000) derived from these glycoproteins.

No correlation could be found between the life spans of synovial cell lines and the age of the cell donors, whether from rheumatoid or nonrheumatoid sources. Rheumatoid synovial cells isolated from intact joints were notable for especially high proportions of macrophage-like cells and suppression of fibroblasts. In most cases cell lines could not be established from these rheumatoid primary cultures, and in others the lines were short-lived. Early association with relatively high proportions of macrophage-like cells in rheumatoid cultures might thus be important in influencing the establishment and behaviour of synovial cell lines...|$|E
30|$|Cell {{migration}} assays {{were performed}} in duplicate in modified Boyden chambers. These assays consisted in counting cells migrating through a porous membrane with 8 μm pores (BD Biosciences, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, UK). After <b>trypsinisation,</b> cells in suspension (1 [*]×[*] 105) were {{loaded into the}} upper chamber in phenol-red RPMI without FCS. The lower chamber contained RPMI and 10 % charcoal-stripped (CS)-FCS (CS-RPMI). The upper and lower chambers contained the same concentration of BPA when tested. After 16 h to 24 h at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator, cells that had attached but not migrated were scraped from the upper surface, the membranes were fixed in 70 % methanol at − 20 °C and the migrated cells were stained for nuclei with Hoechst 33342 dye (1 μg/mL) (blue fluorescent) and evaluated by counting cell nuclei in 10 randomly chosen fields under fluorescence microscopy. The results are presented {{as a percentage of}} control (CTL), where cells were incubated in CS-RPMI culture medium alone. Alternatively, the Wound Healing Assay was also used to study PCa cell migration. The cells were seeded in a 12 -well plate (15 [*]×[*] 104). After the cells formed a confluent mono-layer, scratches were performed using a 100 μl tip. The wells were washed with PBS followed by the addition of BPA at different concentrations in CS-RPMI. The closure of scratch was analyzed under the microscope and images were captured 1 and 15 or 24 h after incubation in {{the presence or absence of}} BPA.|$|E
40|$|Previous in vivo {{studies have}} {{suggested}} a long term regulatory role for insulin in the exocrine pancreas. Furthermore, we reported that pancreatic acini have specific receptors for IGF I and II, and using different techniques (acid washing, <b>trypsinisation,</b> electron microscope autoradiography), that CCK 8 reduces the internalisation of IGF II. To now directly study the long term role for IGF and insulin in the exocrine pancreas we used AR 42 J cells, a rat cell line that is derived from a transplantable tumour of the acinar pancreas. Hormone binding studies with 125 I-labelled hormones indicated that those cells have insulin receptors, relatively fewer receptors for IGF II but in contrast with normal acini no detectable IGF I receptors. Insulin at concentrations as low as 1 nm stimulated the growth of AR 42 J cells, as measured {{by an increase in}} cell number, DNA and protein content. At 100 nM insulin had maximal effects stimulating the growth by about 50 %. IGF I and II had only very weak growth promoting effects probably due to their interaction with the insulin receptor. Additionally insulin increased amylase synthesis over the same concentration range that it stimulated growth. But immunoprecipitation studies revealed that insulin induced a selective increase of amylase synthesis over general protein synthesis. These studies indicate, therefore, that insulin is a growth promoting hormone for AR 42 J cells and that additionally it seems to specifically regulate amylase synthesis. The role for the IGFs in the exocrine pancreas, however, still remains to be determined...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Stable {{vitiligo}} can {{be treated}} by various surgical procedures. Non-cultured melanocyte grafting techniques were developed to overcome the time-consuming process of culture {{while at the same}} time providing acceptable results. All the techniques using non-cultured melanocyte transfer involve <b>trypsinisation</b> as an integral step. Jodhpur technique used by the author is autologous, non-cultured, non-trypsinised, epidermal cell grafting. Settings and Design: The study was conducted on patients visiting the dermatology outpatient department of a tertiary health centre in Western Rajasthan. Materials and Methods: At the donor site, mupirocin ointment was applied and dermabrasion was done with the help of micromotor dermabrader till pinpoint bleeding was seen. The paste-like material obtained by this procedure containing melanocytes and keratinocytes admixed with the ointment base was harvested with spatula and was subsequently spread over the recipient area. Recipient site was prepared in the same manner by dermabrasion. After 10 days, dressing at both sites was removed taking utmost care at the recipient site as there was a theoretical risk of dislodging epidermal cells. Results: In a study of 437 vitiligo patches, more than 75 % re-pigmentation (excellent improvement) was seen in 41 % of the patches. Lesions on thigh (100 %), face (75 %) and trunk (50 %) showed maximal excellent improvement, whereas patches on joints and acral areas did not show much improvement. Conclusions: This technique is a simplified, cost effective, less time-consuming alternative to other techniques which involve tryspsinisation of melanocytes and at the same time provides satisfactory uniform pigmentation...|$|E
40|$|Crypt abscesses allow {{prolonged}} apposition of activated neutrophils to the epithelial {{surface of}} the colon. Adhesion of neutrophils to both the vascular endothelium and basolateral epithelial membrane share common effector molecules but are distinct processes. This study aimed to define the mechanisms that effect adhesion, independent of transmigration, to the apical epithelium. HT 29 (cl 19 A) cells were grown to confluency and incubated with neutrophils under conditions of: (i) neutrophil stimulation with phorbol-myristate-acetate; (ii) monolayer stimulation with interferon gamma, tumour necrosis factor alpha (IFN gamma, TNF alpha); and (iii) recent epithelial cell <b>trypsinisation.</b> These experiments were {{carried out in the}} presence of neutralising antibodies to CD 18, CD 11 b, LFA- 1, E-selectin, P-selectin, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), and ICAM- 2; a novel CD 11 b/CD 18 antagonist, neutrophil inhibitory factor (rNIF); adenosine receptor agonists (5 'N-ethycarboxamido adenosine/N 6 -cylopentyladenosine (NECA/CPA)) and a platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist lexipafant. Adhesion of stimulated neutrophils to resting monolayers was Mac- 1, CD 18 dependent and ICAM- 1, ICAM- 2, E-selectin, P-selectin, PAF independent. Cytokine activated monolayers exhibited higher binding of neutrophils which was inhibited by rNIF and aCD 18. Recently trypsinised monolayers bound neutrophils in a CD 11 b/CD 18 and CD 18 independent manner. Adenosine agonists failed to influence neutrophil adhesion under any condition. This study shows neutrophil adhesion to apical epithelial membranes is similar to that at the epithelial basolateral membrane, though different to that seen at the vascular endothelium. These results highlight regional differences in neutrophil adhesion molecule usag...|$|E
