500|$|Patriot was {{announced}} on September 7, 2005 {{and was the}} park's largest investment at the time. Construction started in the <b>transfer</b> <b>track</b> and station area before progressing to the lift hill in early-October 2005. Just over two weeks later, the roller coaster's [...] lift hill was topped off. After erecting the first drop and loop, construction on the zero-gravity-roll was complete by mid-November. The third inversion, and Immelmann loop, was completed {{about a week later}} followed by the placement of the inclined loop pieces. After the corkscrew and other track elements were completed, the final piece of track was placed in the morning of January 13, 2006.|$|E
500|$|On April 28, 2000, Dorney Park {{announced}} that a [...] four inversion inverted roller coaster would be built for the 2001 season. No further details were given until August 30, 2000 when Dorney Park announced the full details of the new $13 million roller coaster and its name, Talon. The ride would be the Northeast's longest inverted roller coaster and would be built on a portion of land set aside for a major attraction by Cedar Fair when they purchased the park in 1992. Construction began on September 5, 2000 and continued through the winter. The first parts of Talon {{to be put into}} place were the brake run and <b>transfer</b> <b>track</b> in October 2000. The roller coaster was topped off (the highest piece of the lift hill) on November 21, 2000 and the track was completed in early 2001. After testing was complete, Talon opened on May 5, 2001.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{departing from}} the station, the train made a slight right turn {{leading into the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>track</b> section before {{beginning}} to climb the [...] lift hill. Once {{at the top and}} after going through a pre-drop, the train made a sharp [...] right-hand drop back to the ground. Then, the train goes through a 270 degree right overbanked turn before entering a Zero-gravity roll which was the first of three former near-miss points with the Chinese Fireball train. Then, the train made a slight right turn heading straight into a wall before entering a Cobra roll. After a straight section of track, the train enters the second former near-miss point with the other train, a vertical loop. The train then made a right turn into the final former near-miss point, a corkscrew. Next, the train made a right turn followed by a left turn leading into the final brake run. Following a right turn, the train returns to the station where the riders unload and the next riders load.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{departing from}} the station, the train made a slight left turn {{leading into the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>track</b> section before {{beginning}} to climb the [...] lift hill. Once {{at the top and}} after going through a pre-drop, the train made a sharp [...] left-hand drop back to the ground. Then, the train goes back up, through an Immelmann followed by a slight downward right turn before entering an air-time hill (this was the first of three near-miss points with the Hungarian Horntail train when the roller coasters duelled). Next, the train dropped back down turning left slightly leading into a second Immelmann. After a downward right helix and a short section of straight track, the train goes through the second former near-miss point with the other train, a vertical loop. After the loop and another section of straight track, the train made a right turn leading into the third and final former near-miss element which was a corkscrew. Then, the train made a left turn followed by a small drop leading into another section of straight track before entering the final element in the coaster layout, another corkscrew. The train then made a left turn into the final brake run. Following a left turn, the train returned to the station where riders unloaded and the next riders load.|$|E

The train then travels up the [...] tall lift hill. At the top of the lift hill the train immediately plunges down the ride's initial [...] drop at over [...] At the bottom of the drop the train immediately starts back uphill. While cresting the hill, riders experience air-time before diving back down the ride's second [...] drop. At the bottom of the drop the train crosses under the exit from Thunderbird's vertical loop, and once again returns uphill. Riders also experience air-time as the train crests the third hill and down the [...] drop.|$|E

40|$|Maximum power <b>transfer</b> <b>tracking</b> (MPTT) {{is meant}} to {{track the maximum power}} point during the system {{operation}} of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Traditionally, MPTT is achieved by impedance matching at the secondary side when the load resistance is varied. However, due to a loosely coupling characteristic, the variation of coupling coefficient will certainly affect the performance of impedance matching, therefore MPTT will fail accordingly. This paper presents an identification method of coupling coefficient for MPTT in WPT systems. Especially, the two-value issue during the identification is considered. The identification approach is easy to implement because it does not require additional circuit. Furthermore, MPTT is easy to realize because only two easily measured DC parameters are needed. The detailed identification procedure corresponding to the two-value issue and the maximum power <b>transfer</b> <b>tracking</b> process are presented, and both the simulation analysis and experimental results verified the identification method and MPTT...|$|R

2500|$|The wooden {{track on}} The Voyage {{is made out}} of {{numerous}} layers of Southern Yellow Pine, topped with a single layer of steel along the top, sides, and underside of the track where the train's wheels make contact. The supports for the track itself are made out of an estimated [...] of steel. The total length of the track is [...] and includes , , and [...] drops in addition to five underground tunnels. The track features a chain lift hill and five block sections, which theoretically allows a maximum of four trains at a time to run; however, this is impractical when considering {{the time it takes to}} dispatch 28-passenger trains. The most trains The Voyage has operated at one time is three. The Voyage uses fin brakes throughout the ride to allow the train to be stopped in the final (primary) brake run, the secondary brake run, the mid-course brake run, the station, and the <b>transfer</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

At the top of the horseshoe, the train hits a 91-degree angle before dropping toward the ground and under the guest pathway leading to the park entrance. It then enters a second banked turn to the left, reaching a height of [...] Following a straight section of track, the train goes over a [...] camelback hill and makes a near-180-degree turn. It then enters a second camelback hill, followed by a left turn into a third camelback hill that ends with the final brake run. The train makes a 180-degree turn as it returns to the station.
