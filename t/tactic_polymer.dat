The reactivity {{of this new}} alkylidyne complex towards terminal alkynes was investigated. Two other new tungsten alkylidynes, W(CCMe 3) (pyr) 3 (pyr = 2, 5 -dimethylpyrrolide) and W(CCMe 3) (Ph 2 N) 3 were prepared {{by the addition of}} three equivalents of lithium dimethylpyrrolide or lithium diphenylamide, respectively, to W(CCMe 3) Cl 3 (dme). The reactivity of these new alkylidynes with various alcohols is reported. The reactivity of several tungsten alkylidyne compounds towards ligand displacement by surface silanols is reported, resulting in the synthesis of several new silicasupported tungsten alkylidynes. The alkyne metathesis activity of all new homogeneous and heterogeneous alkylidyne complexes is reported. Chapter 2 : Addition of one equivalent of 2, 4, 6, 2 ', 4 ', 6 '-hexaisopropylterphenol to Mo(NAd) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (pyr) 2 results in the formation of Mo(NAd) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (pyr) (HIPTO) (HIPTO = hexaisopropylterphenoxide). This new alkylidene compound was found to catalyze the metathesis of 1 -hexene in 20 % yield to 95 % cis 5 -decene, which represents the first report of highly Z-selective metathesis homocoupling of a terminal olefin. The decomposition of the catalyst in the presence of ethylene is explored. The syntheses of several new bulky achiral phenoxide ligands are presented, along with the syntheses of the corresponding MAP (monoalkoxide monopyrrolide) molybdenum imido alkylidene compounds. The reactivity of new MAP compounds containing bulky phenoxide ligands towards the Z-selective metathesis of terminal and internal olefins is presented. The cis-selectivity of this system is proposed to arise from the combination of a relatively small imido ligand in conjunction with a very bulky alkoxide forcing the substituents of the substrate to point in this same direction with each insertion. Photolysis of MAP compounds with 366 nm radiation was found to produce significant amounts of anti alkylidenes, and the kinetics of decay of unstable anti alkylidenes are investigated. Chapter 3 : The reaction of 2, 3 -dicarbomethoxynorbomadiene (DCMNBD) with Mo(NAd) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (pyr) (HIPTO) (Ad = 1 -adamantyl, HIPTO = hexaisopropylterphenoxide) affords > 98 % cis, > 98 % tactic polyDCMNBD. The tacticity of this polymer is proved to be syndiotactic through polymerization of DCMenthNBD (2, 3 -dicarbomenthoxynorbomadiene) and IH- H COSY. A variety of related MAP alkylidene compounds are also investigated towards the ROMP of DCMNBD and found to produce polyDCMNBD in a range of tacticities and cis contents. Highly cis polyNBDF 6 (poly-bis(CF 3) -norbomadiene) was also prepared using molybdenum MAP compounds, and the resulting polymer was found to be essentially insoluble in common organic solvents. Solid state CPMAS 13 C NMR spectroscopy revealed insoluble polyNBDF 6 to be highly tactic, and the tacticity is proposed to be syndiotactic. Cis, <b>tactic</b> <b>polymer</b> was prepared through the addition of 3, 3 -methylphenylcyclopropene (MPCP) to molybdenum MAP compounds. Attempts towards determination of the tacticity of cispolyMPCP are presented, including the synthesis of three 3, 3 -disubstituted cyclopropene monomers containing chiral tags. The cis-selective ROMP of cyclooctene and 1, 5 - cyclooctadiene are reported. The syndioselectivity of the catalysts is proposed to be controlled by the configuration of the 4 -coordinate metal center, which alternates with each insertion of monomer. Chapter 4 : Racemic 2, 3 -dicarbomethoxynorbornene (rac-DCMNBE) is polymerized by Mo(NAd) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (pyr) (HMTO) (Ad = 1 -adamantyl, pyr = pyrrolide, HMTO = hexamethylterphenoxide) to afford an all-cis polymer that is syndiotactic and composed of alternating enantiomers. The cis, syndiotactic ROMP of several other racemic chiral monomers are reported, also affording structures containing a high degree of enantiomer alteration. Attempts towards the alternating copolymerization of two different monomers are reported. The ROMP of enantiomerically pure (+) -dicarbomethoxynorbornene with Mo(NAd) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (pyr) (HIPTO) leads to the production of 92 % trans-isotactic polyDCMNBE. The structure of trans-isotactic polyDCMNBD is proved through hydrogenation and comparison of its 3 C NMR spectrum with that of known cis-isotactic polyDCMNBE. Both cis/syndiotactic/alternating poly-rac-DCMNBE and trans/isotactic poly-(+) -DCMNBE are polymer structures that have not been previously reported. The thermal properties of all new polymers and their hydrogenated counterparts are reported and are found to correlate closely with polymer structure. by Margaret McGuigan Flook. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The ROMP of 2, 3 -dicarbomethoxynorbornadiene served as a test reaction to investigate the influence of the various experimental parameters (reaction time and temperature, nature of the solvent and catalyst, and TMSD initiation conditions). An all-trans, highly tactic (> 79 %) polymer was obtained under a wide variety of conditions. Strikingly, the addition of tricyclohexylphosphine had a detrimental influence on the polymerization yield and stereoselectivity. The procedure was successfully applied to various other 2, 3 -dicarboalkoxynorbornadienes, benzonorbornadiene, and their 7 -oxa analogues. In the case of the diester monomers, an increase in the alkyl substituent size led to a decrease of the polymer trans content and tacticity. Because of the ruthenium catalyst's ready availability and marked resistance to oxygen and water, reactions were very easy to set up and to carry out. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Living” anionic, cationic, metalloporphyrin and {{ring-opening}} metathesis polymerizations {{have been}} used to prepare well-defined side-chain liquid crystalline homopolymers, block and graft copolymers and statistical copolymers. This paper analyzes their successes and failures by reviewing the mechanistic aspects and experimental conditions of each type of polymerization, and identifies other classes of mesogenic monomers that could be polymerized in a controlled manner in the future. The emerging structure/property relationships are then identified using well-defined SCLCPs in which only one structural feature is varied while all others remain constant. The thermal transitions of liquid crystalline polymethacrylates, polynorbomenes and poly(viny 1 ether) s reach their limiting values at less than 50 repeat units, which are generally equal to those of the corresponding infinite molecular weight polymers’lncreasing spacer length depresses the glass transition of SCLCPs, and consequently often uncovers mesophases that are not observed without a spacer. The crystalline melting of tactic SCLCPs also tends to decrease (with odd-even alternation) with increasing spacer length. Without additional order within the polymer backbone due to high tacticity, mesogenic side-chains generally do not crystallize until the spacer contains at least nine carbon atoms. As the flexibility of the polymer backbone increases, the glass transition temperature decreases, and the side chains are able to crystallize at shorter spacer lengths and form more ordered rr esophases. The isotropization temperature (Ti = ΔHi/ΔSi) also increases since the change in entropy decreases more rapidly than the change in enthalpy with increasing backbone flexibility. However, the mesogenic side groups of most highly <b>tactic</b> <b>polymers,</b> which are less flexible than the corresponding atactic polymers, are evidently in the proper configuration to crystallize and/or form ordered phases. If the mesogen density is taken into account, the increase in ΔHi and ΔSi per methylenic unit in the spacer are equivalent for a given mesophase, and increase as the order of the mesophase increases. The discontinuity and/or change in the slope of ΔΔHi/-CH 2 - and ΔΔSi/ -CH 2 - with a change in the type of mesophase can be used to confirm that a phase change has occurred with the addition or subtraction of one methylenic unit in the spacer of a homologous series. Model compounds corresponding to exactly one repeat unit of the polymer, or which take into account only the (appropriately substituted) mesogen and spacer, mimic the phase behavior of the corresponding SCLCPs well. The monomers themselves, which have chemical structures very {{different from that of the}} polymer backbone, are the least appropriate model compounds for most SCLCPs. The effect of polydispersity has not been clarified yet, although it may manifest itself in broad phase transitions if the broad polydispersity is accompanied by polydispersity in molecular architecture, and the molecular architectures are immiscible. Liquid crystalline block and graft copolymers microphase separate into classic morphologies, but with the mesogens within the liquid crystalline block organize anisotropically if the blocks are sufficiently long. Although the same mesophase is generally formed by the copolymers and homopolymer, the phase diagram is asymmetric and less ordered mesophases may result if spheres of the liquid crystalline block are dispersed in a matrix of the other block. The morphology and thermotropic behavior of diblock and ABA and BAB triblock copolymers of 2 -(cholesteryloxycarbonyloxy) ethyl methacrylate and styrene are identical when the volume fraction of the blocks are equal. Statistical copolymers also require a minimum concentration of the mesogenic monomer to form a mesophase. The isotropization temperatures of statistical copolymers based on two mesogenic monomers whose homopolymers exhibit identical mesophases follow ideal solution behavior as a function of copolymer composition. Copolymers based on structural units which are not isomorphic do not exhibit their respective mesophases over the entire copolymer composition, and intermediate compositions may exhibit an entirely different phase...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1. An olefin {{metathesis}} reaction between Mo(NAr) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (OCMe(CF 3) 2) 2 (Ar = 2, 6 diisopropylphenyl) and trans-i 1, 4 -divinylbenzene or trans, trans- 1, 4 -di-buta- 1, 3 -dienylbenzene (5) {{results in}} the formation of bimetallic ROMP initiators [(DME) ((CF 3) 2 MeCO) 2 (ArN) MoCH] 2 - 1, 4 -C 6 H 4 (DME = 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane; la) and [(DME) ((CF 3) 2 MeCO) 2 (ArN) MoCHCHCH] 2 - 1, 4 -C 6 H 4 (6), respectively. An X-ray study of [(THF) ((CF 3) 2 MeCO) 2 (ArN) MoCH] 2 - 1, 4 -C 6 H 4 (THF = tetrahydrofuran; ib), which is closely related to la, showed it to be the expected bimetallic species in which each end is approximately a trigonal bipyramidal monoadduct of a syn alkylidene with the THF coordinated to the NOO face of the metal trans to the Mo=C bond. Treatment of la with hium-t-butoxide yielded [(Bu-t-O) 2 (ArN) MoCH] 2 - 1, 4 -C 6 H 4 (2). Addition of four equivalents of Me 3 CCH 2 MgCl to la produced the bimetallic species [(Me 3 CCH 2) 2 (ArN) MoCH] 2 - 1, 4 -C 6 H 4 (3), which upon treatment with 2, 6 diisopropylphenol generated a diastereomeric mixture of [(DME) (ArO) (Me 3 CCH 2) (ArN) MoCH] 2 - 1, 4 -C 6 H 4 (4). The solid state structure of 3 revealed a "syn/syn" bimetallic species related to lb. In solution two resonances can be observed in the alkylidene region of the 1 H NMR spectra for the "syn/anti" isomer of la, Ib, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The total amount of the "syn/anti" isomer varies between 4 and 20 % of the total. Bimetallic species la, 2, and 6 initiate at both ends upon addition of less than ten equivalents of 4, 5 -dicarbomethoxynorbornadiene (DCMNBD),and afford homopolymers of DCMNBD and methyltetracyclododecene (MTD) in a living fashion. MALDI-TOF mass spectra of ferrocene-containing homopolymers have been obtained that are consistent with the polymerization process being living. (cont.) Triblock copolymers MTDxDCMNBDyMTDx were prepared by adding y equivalents of DCMNBD to the bimetallic ROMP initiators followed (after consumption of DCMNBD) by 2 x equivalents of MTD. These triblocks were shown to be of relatively high purity (free of homopolymer and diblock copolymer) and to have a relatively low polydispersity index. Chapter 2 A series of monomers with side chain liquid crystals (SCLCs) were synthesized for ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The liquid crystals (LCs) used were 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 -methoxyphenyl ester (MPOB-H), which is known to exhibit a nematic liquid crystalline phase, and biphenyl- 4 -carboxylic acid 4 -(1 butoxycarbonylethoxy) phenyl ester (BPP 4 -H), which is known to exhibit a smectic phase. The side chains differed in spacer length, spacer type, {{and the nature of the}} LC. Monomers were polymerized using a bimetallic ROMP initiator [(Bu-t-O) 2 (ArN) MoCH] 2 - 1, 4 -C 6 H 4 (where Ar = 2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl); both homopolymers and ABA type triblock copolymers, where the B block is the LC functional monomer, and A is methyltetracyclodocene (MTD) were prepared. The polymers displayed unimodal peak distributions with polydispersities < 1. 22. Incorporation of a polyoxyethylene spacer decreased the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer block to - 25 from + 20 TC, the Tg when an alkyl spacer was used. Although no distinct LC phase was observed with the polyoxyethylene spacer when MPOB was used, use of BPP 4 in conjunction with a polyoxyethylene spacer displayed a distinct liquid crystalline transition. Polymers with an alkyl spacer exhibited liquid crystalline behavior and good phase segregation on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering studies. (cont.) Chapter 3. Molybdenum imido alkylidene complexes supported by 2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl, 2, 6 dimethylphenyl, 1 -adamantyl, or 2 -trifluorophenyl that contain relatively electronwithdrawing phenolate (pentafluoro), binaphtholate (3, 3 '-bis(9 -anthracenyl), 3, 3 'bispentafluorophenyl, or 3, 3 '-bis(3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl)) or biphenolate (3, 3 '-ditert-butyl- 5, 5 '-bistrifluoromethyl- 6, 6 '-dimethyl- 1, 1 '-biphenyl) ligands have been prepared to be tested in olefin metathesis reactions. A series of new monomeric pyrrolide complexes, Mo(NR) (CHCMe 2 R') (2, 5 -dimethylpyrrolide) 2 (where R' = Me or Ph) and Mo(NAd) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (2, 4 -dimethylpyrrolide) 2, were also synthesized and treated with alcohols, biphenols or binaphthols in order to generate Mo(NR) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (diolate) species. In several cases the new alkylidene complexes could be prepared only through reaction of two equivalents of pentafluorophenols or an equivalent of binaphthol (3, 3 'bis(pentafluorophenyl) binaphthol or 3, 3 '-bis(3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl binaphthol) with a bis(2, 5 -dimethylpyrrolide) complex. The pyrrolide approach can be employed either to isolate catalysts on a preparative scale or to generate catalysts in situ. Several simple preliminary ring-closing metathesis reactions show that the new complexes are catalytically competent. Chapter 4. Living ring opening metathesis polymerization of cyclopropenes using Mo(NAr) (CHCMe 2 R) (O-t-Bu) 2 (where R = Me; la or R = Ph; ib) and Mo(NAr) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (OCMe(CF 3) 2) 2 (2) has been achieved. The polydispersity indices of the polymers generated are recorded to be < 1. 10 for la and lb based on gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Living polymerization of 3 -methyl- 3 phenylcyclopropene (MPC) by t-butoxide derived molybdenum imido alkylidene initiators is utilized in the synthesis of block copolymers. (cont.) Diblock copolymers MPCPxDCMNBDy (where DCMNBD = 2, 3 - dicarbomethoxynorbornadiene and x and y are the number of equivalents of MPC and DCMNBD, respectively) were prepared in quantitative yield with unimodal peak distribution via sequential addition of monomers to the initiator 1 b. Triblock copolymers MPC 100 MEMC 100 MPCoo 0 and MTDiooMEMCIooMTDjoo were prepared using [(O-t-Bu) 2 (ArN) MoCH] 2 - 1, 4 -C 6 H 4 (IC) as an initiator. The block copolymers revealed good phase segregation based on the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). ROMP of MPC by molybdenum imido alkylidene initiators containing electron-withdrawing diolates resulted in highly <b>tactic</b> <b>polymers</b> as determined by 'H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. IR spectroscopy of all MPCl 00 revealed absorptions at 963 and/or 982 cm- 1 of approximately equal intensity that are most consistent with a trans structure. Chapter 5. Addition of one equivalent of ROH to Mo(NAr) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (2, 5 -dimethylpyrrolide) 2 (Ar = 2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) in diethyl ether or THF yielded Mo(NAr) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (OR) (2, 5 -dimethylpyrrolide) species where R = (CH 3) 3 C (1), (CH 3) 2 CH (2), Ar (3), (CF 3) 2 CH (4), (CF 3) 2 MeC (5), (Bu-t-O) 3 SiO (6) or C 6 F 50 (7). Treatment of an equivalent of PMe 3 to 5 resulted {{in the formation of}} (Me 3 P) Mo(NAr) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (OCMe(CF 3) 2) (PyrMe) (Me 3 P- 5), which showed trans binding of PMe 3 with respect to 2, 5 -dimethylpyrrolide ligand as determined by the 'H NOESY spectrum. The solid state structure of 3 depicts a psuedo-tetrahedral geometry around the metal center with the 2, 5 -dimethylpyrrolide ligand bound rq' to the metal cener. (cont.) Complexes 1 - 6 show rapid reaction when treated with one atmosphere of ethylene and catalyze ring-closing metathesis reactions. Hetereogenous analogs of 6, Mo(NAr) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (PyrMe) (OSisurf) (10 a), Mo(NAd) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (PyrMe) (OSisurf) (10 b) and Mo(NArF) (CHCMe 2 Ph) (PyrMe) (OSisurf) (10 c) (Ad = 1 -adamantyl and ArF = 2 trifluoromethylphenyl) showed great enhancement in the catalytic activity when employed in self-metathesis of propene and ethyloleate. Ring-closing enyne metathesis catalyzed by 1 - 6 leads to cyclic products that arise through initial addition of the triple bond to a methylene species (initially neophylidene) to yield an cC- or a 3 -substituted metallacyclobutene intermediate. by Rojendra Singh.
