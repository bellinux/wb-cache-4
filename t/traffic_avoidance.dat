25|$|On October 26, 2006, Skybus {{announced}} {{a deal with}} the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to buy 65 of its Airbus A319 aircraft. The order carried an estimated retail price of $3.7 billion, though the actual price Skybus would have paid had not been announced. Additionally, the aircraft were going to come with a 12-year maintenance agreement that was new for Airbus and Skybus was the launch customer for this service plan which helped them manage maintenance costs. Additionally, the aircraft would have been equipped with the latest in EFB (electronic flight bags) and HUD (heads up display) technology, as well as TCAS II terrain and <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> technology which is integrated in with an EGPWS technology box that protects from terrain collision. Skybus planned to lease aircraft of the same type until the new aircraft were to begin delivery in late 2008.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{trim tabs}} {{significantly}} reduces pilots' workload during continuous maneuvers (e.g. sustained climb to altitude after takeoff or descent prior to landing), {{allowing them to}} focus their attention on other tasks such as <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> or communication with air traffic control.|$|E

With the introduction of Traffic Message Channel-based (TMC) <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> features in 2002, Navigon became the first company to offer such a feature on a consumer GPS product.|$|E
30|$|To {{visualize}} {{the positive effect of}} considering <b>traffic</b> jam <b>avoidance,</b> we calculate {{the difference in}} D between a simulation run without <b>traffic</b> jam <b>avoidance</b> and one with <b>traffic</b> jam <b>avoidance</b> (10 %, first iteration). This difference is shown in Fig. 5. Although the change is relatively small, it reduces overall deviation to 0.0298, since most changes increase traffic in the inner city, {{which was one of the}} main errors (see Fig. 3).|$|R

5000|$|Because {{the basic}} <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> {{principle}} of flying under {{visual flight rules}} (VFR) is to [...] "see and avoid", it follows that distance from clouds {{is an important factor}} in the VMC minima: as aircraft flying in clouds cannot be seen, a buffer zone from clouds is required (to provide for time to react to an aircraft exiting the clouds).|$|E
50|$|Easier <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> - Unlike trams (where side {{tracks are}} often unavailable), an {{out-of-service}} vehicle {{can be moved}} {{to the side of}} the road and its trolley poles lowered. The ability to drive a substantial distance from the power wires allows trackless vehicles to avoid obstacles, although it also means a possibility that the vehicle may steer or skid far enough that the trolley pole can no longer reach the wire, stranding the vehicle. Trackless trolleys also are able to avoid collisions by maneuver, while trams can only change speed.|$|E

50|$|AGATE was {{intended}} to foster revenue growth and job creation {{in the areas of}} manufacturing, sales, training, service, support and operations industries within the U.S. small airport infrastructure. The program focuses on the development of new GA technologies including bad weather flight and landing systems, complete with graphic displays of weather and guidance information; emergency coping and avoidance measures that use on-board systems to support decision-making; <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> systems; systems that reduce the flight planning workload and enhance passenger safety; and systems designed to improve passenger comfort, aircraft performance and efficiency. The success of AGATE will be measured in terms of increases in pilot population, flight hours, airport utilization and new aircraft deliveries.|$|E
50|$|The AW169 is {{equipped}} with various avionics systems, including a Rockwell Collins glass cockpit featuring three displays outfitted with touchscreen interfaces, digital maps, dual radar altimeters, automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast tracking, Health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS), and night vision goggles (NVG) compatibility. Many elements of the cockpit and avionics {{are similar to those}} installed on the AgustaWestland AW139 and the AgustaWestland AW189, providing a high level of support. The use of a four-axis digital automatic flight control system and a dual flight management system incorporating terrain and <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> systems has allowed for the rotorcraft to be certified to be flown by a single pilot under instrument flight rules (IFR).|$|E

50|$|On 29 March 2011 Cessna {{unveiled}} several {{improvements to}} the Cessna 400 at Sun 'n Fun, designating the new variant the TTx. The aircraft has not been selling well since the late-2000s recession started, with 110 delivered in 2008, the first year Cessna produced the model, 41 in 2009 and just seven sold in 2010. The improved aircraft features a new glass cockpit panel, designed by Cessna {{and based on the}} Garmin G2000. Called Intrinzic, it features two 14 in wide high definition displays and a touchscreen controller that uses an infra-red grid to accept touch commands. The updated model also has dual Attitude and Heading Reference Systems, a GFC 700 autopilot, a Garmin GTS800 <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> system, Garmin GTX 33ES transponder with ADS-B and the Garmin Electronic Stability Protection System, which protects the aircraft from operations outside the approved flight envelope. The new TTx model has no traditional instruments and instead employs the L-3 Trilogy as a back-up. The TTx also features a built-in pulse oximeter, a new paint scheme and a new interior. By the end of Sun 'n Fun 2011 the company indicated it had sold 16 of the new TTx model.|$|E
50|$|After {{new city}} {{government}} {{took over in}} 2013, an idea of abolishing the trolleybus network was raised again, partially prompted by the experimental introduction of the electric buses. Due to the possible creation of the pedestrian zone in the entire central section of Belgrade, propositions include the change of the routes in downtown, the relocation of the central terminus from Studentski Trg to Slavija and of the depo from Dorćol to Medaković. The remaining lines should connect the hilly parts of the city: Konjarnik, Medaković, Vračar, Banjica and Kanarevo Brdo. City manager Goran Vesić announced that one single tram line will replace all four trolleybus lines (19, 21, 22 and 29) and the only bus line (31), which traverse through the city’s main street Kralja Milana. Regarding reasons, Vesić stated that the overhead lines look ugly in downtown and that citizen complained about the noise made by the trolleybuses. The immediate reaction of the citizens was mostly negative. However, some {{of the advantages of}} the trolleybuses are their minimal noise pollution. Also, there is a matter of price of digging up the entire center of the city so that at least 6 km of tram tracks can be placed, and the cost of buying the new trams which will supposedly be operated on capacitors, without the grid. At the moment, five lines pass through the main street 47 times per hour. On average, that is one vehicle on every 86 second, which is virtually impossible with only one line. In May 2017, Prime Minister of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić, even though the Belgrade's city transportation is completely outside of his jurisdiction, stated that he wants to abolish the trolleybus network completely and replace it with the electric buses. As a reason, he said that the trolleybuses are causing problems and that when one stops due to the malfunction, it stops the entire traffic behind it. Though electric buses may be a better solution than the trams, Vučić's reasoning is dubious, just like the Vesić's. Trolleybus has easier <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> than a tram. Contrary to the trams, which indeed stops all the trams behind when one malfunction because they all use the same tracks when a trolleybus is broken, it is simply unhooked from the grid and is easily bypassed by the trolleybus behind it.|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs) into civil airspace will require {{new methods of}} ensuring <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance.</b> This paper discusses issues affecting requirements for RPV <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> systems and describes the safety evaluation process {{that the international community}} has deemed necessary to certify such systems. Alternative methods for RPVs to perform <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> are discussed, including the potential use of new seeand-avoid sensors or the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Concerns that must be addressed to allow the use of TCAS on RPVs are presented. The paper then details the safety evaluation process that is being implemented to evaluate the safety of TCAS on Global Hawk. The same evaluation process can be extended to other RPVs and <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> systems for which thorough safety analyses will also be required. I...|$|E

30|$|It {{is clearly}} visible that <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> chances {{of more than}} 10 % cannot lead to an improvement. The best match between {{simulated}} and real data is achieved for a <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> chance of 10 % after one iterative step. Note, that using a 5 % <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> chance also iterations 1, 3, and 5 are in relatively good agreement, while even numbered iterations perform worse in general. The reason for this effect is the iterative nature of the traffic jam avoidance. The initial guess (0) features no traffic jam avoidance. In iteration 1, the agents avoid the heavily congested roads, making them less congested, corresponding to a more realistic picture. In iteration 2, some of the agents change back to the previously heavily congested roads, since they were less congested in iteration 1. This process repeats itself, so that the odd numbered iterations always produce more realistic results.|$|E
40|$|Altitude {{deviations}} (also {{referred to}} as level busts) may result in substantial loss of vertical separation and/or horizontal separation, which could cause a midair collision. <b>Traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> maneuvers, if required, usually result in injuries to passengers and crewmembers (particularly to cabin attendants) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} pilot {{situation awareness}} across three traffic management concepts. The Concepts varied {{in terms of}} the allocation of <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance</b> responsibility between the pilot on the flight deck, the air traffic controllers, and a conflict resolution automation system. In Concept 1, the flight deck was equipped with conflict resolution tools that enable them to fully handle the responsibility of weather avoidance and maintaining separation between ownship and surrounding traffic. In Concept 2, pilots were not responsible for traffic separation, but were provided tools for weather and <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance.</b> In Concept 3, flight deck tools allowed pilots to deviate for weather, but conflict detection tools were disabled. In this concept pilots were dependent on ground based automation for conflict detection and resolution. Situation awareness of the pilots was measured using online probes. Results showed that individual situation awareness was highest in Concept 1, where the pilots were most engaged, and lowest in Concept 3, where automation was heavily used. These findings suggest that for conflict resolution tasks, situation awareness is improved when pilots remain in the decision-making loop...|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{accident}} and other near midair collisions (NMAC) in terminal control areas, the Federal Aviation Administration required that all jets in US airspace be equipped with a <b>traffic</b> collision <b>avoidance</b> system (TCAS), and required that light aircraft operating in dense airspaces be equipped with Mode C transponders which can report their altitude.|$|R

40|$|Park {{managers}} {{are concerned that}} moose (Alces alces), caribou (Rangifer tarandus), and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) may be avoiding areas along the 130 km road through Denali National Park {{as a result of}} high traffic volume, thus decreasing opportunities for visitors to view wildlife. A wildlife monitoring system was developed in 1996 that used 19 landscape level viewsheds, stratified into four sections based on decreasing traffic along the road corridor. Data were collected from 22 samplings of all viewsheds during May–August in 1996 and 1997. In 1997, nine backcountry viewsheds were established in three different areas to determine whether density estimates for each species in the backcountry were higher than those for the same animals in similar road-corridor areas. Densities higher than those in the road corridor were found in one backcountry area for moose and in two backcountry areas for grizzly bears. None of the backcountry areas showed a higher density of caribou. We tested hypotheses that moose, caribou, and grizzly bear distributions were unrelated to the road and traffic. Moose sightings were lower than expected within 300 m of the road. More caribou and grizzly bears than expected occurred between 601 and 900 m from the road, while more moose and fewer caribou than expected occurred between 900 and 1200 m from the road. Bull moose in stratum 1 were distributed farther from the road than bulls and cows in stratum 4; cows in stratum 1 and bulls in stratum 2 were distributed farther from the road than cows in stratum 4. Grizzly bears in stratum 2 were distributed farther from the road than bears in stratum 3. The distribution of moose sightings suggests <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance,</b> but the spatial pattern of preferred forage may have had more of an influence. Caribou and grizzly bear distributions indicated no pattern of <b>traffic</b> <b>avoidance...</b>|$|E
