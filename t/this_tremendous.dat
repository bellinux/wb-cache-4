[...] Garcia's style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing had a number of so-called [...] "signatures". [...] Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs [...] "Good Morning Little School Girl", [...] "New Speedway Boogie", [...] "Brokedown Palace", [...] "Deal", [...] "Loser", [...] "Truckin'", [...] "That's It for the Other One", [...] "U.S. Blues", [...] "Sugaree", and [...] "Don't Ease Me In").
