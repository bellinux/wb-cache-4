5|$|In 1912 <b>the</b> <b>Reformist</b> Party was founded, which {{attracted}} intellectuals. Figures {{like its}} leader, Alejandro Lerroux, helped attract wide {{support from the}} working class. His advocacy of anti-clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona. He argued that the Catholic Church was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under. It was around this time that republicanism came to the fore.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} {{half of the}} 20th century, the novel Nandan, by A. Gopalasami Iyengar and G. Aravamudha Iyengar, {{includes}} reformist Brahmin characters that argue Nandan's case against their peers. Nandan also echoes <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> ideas of Hindu spiritual leaders like Ramanuja and Vivekananda, and progressive upper-caste leaders.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes III {{ascended the}} throne of Sparta in 236 BC or 235 BC, after deposing his father, Leonidas II. His {{accession}} to power ended a decade-long period of heightened conflict between the two royal families. Sparta's ancient dual kingship was explained by the founding legend, that the original conquerors of Sparta were twin brothers and their descendants shared Sparta. During the turmoil, Leonidas II had executed his rival king, <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> Agis IV.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after his}} accession, Emperor Shunzong began to reappoint <b>the</b> <b>Reformists,</b> <b>the</b> leader {{of whom was}} Wang Shuwen. <b>The</b> <b>Reformists</b> {{implemented}} a series of policies, including the abolition of Gong Shi and the Scoundrels in the Five Workshops (:zh:五坊小兒, [...] ), which acted as tools to oppress the civilian population.|$|R

50|$|Despite the party's {{improving}} electoral results, the PSI remained {{divided into}} two major branches, <b>the</b> <b>Reformists</b> and <b>the</b> Maximalists. <b>The</b> <b>Reformists,</b> led by Filippo Turati, were strong mostly in the unions and the parliamentary group. The Maximalists, led by Costantino Lazzari, were affiliated with the London Bureau of socialist groups, an international association of left-wing socialist parties.|$|R
5|$|In 1258, a {{group of}} barons seized power from Henry in a coup d'état, citing the need to {{strictly}} enforce Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the Provisions of Oxford. The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to Louis IX of France in 1263–1264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. <b>The</b> <b>reformist</b> barons argued their case based on Magna Carta, suggesting that it was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken its terms.|$|E
5|$|In writing {{polyphonic}} {{settings of}} psalms, Josquin was a pioneer, and psalm settings form {{a large proportion}} of the motets of his later years. Few composers prior to Josquin had written polyphonic psalm settings. Some of Josquin's settings include the famous Miserere, written in Ferrara in 1503 or 1504 and most likely inspired by the recent execution of <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> monk Girolamo Savonarola, Memor esto verbi tui, based on Psalm 119, and two settings of De profundis (Psalm 130), both of which are often considered to be among his most significant accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{was born}} on 15 July 1914 in Agra. He was among the four sons and three daughters of Khansaahib Ameer Ahmed Khan and Mehmoodah Begum. His father, a police inspector, was {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> thinking of Syed Ahmed Khan. In his early age, Khan's mother {{introduced him to the}} poetry of Maulana Hali and Muhammad Iqbal, the sermons of Abul Kalam Azad, and the Sufist philosophy of Rumi. This upbringing influenced his interest in historical as well as contemporary social, economic, and political affairs.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of Tuesday, February 25, at around 7 a.m., a minor clash {{occurred}} between loyal government troops and <b>the</b> <b>reformists.</b> Snipers stationed atop the government-owned Channel 9 tower, near Channel 4, began shooting at <b>the</b> <b>reformists.</b> Many rebel soldiers surged to the station, and a rebel S-76 helicopter later shot the snipers at the broadcast tower. The troops later left after a V-150 was blocked by the crowd assembled.|$|R
5|$|Long {{began his}} {{involvement}} in politics {{at the local level}} in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a major issue which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> Republican Benjamin Butler for governor in 1871, but received an unsolicited Democratic nomination later that year for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.|$|E
5|$|Through his freemason {{contacts}} with Pierre Maurice Glayre, Piattoli won {{the confidence of}} Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski, becoming his agent in Paris and, {{by the end of}} 1789, his private secretary and librarian, although without any official title. Acting as a sort of cultural aide, Piattoli, who had strong ties to <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers—Ignacy Potocki in particular—and the king. In the words of a Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was “like a tireless spring”, constantly mediating between the two factions.|$|E
5|$|Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226BC {{seeking an}} {{unexpected}} alliance now that <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening {{the rest of}} Greece in the Cleomenean War (229–222BC). In exchange for military aid, AntigonusIII demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225BC. In 224BC, AntigonusIII's forces took Arcadia from Sparta. After forming a Hellenic league {{in the same vein}} as PhilipII's League of Corinth, he managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222BC. Sparta was occupied by a foreign power {{for the first time in}} its history, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor PhilipV.|$|E
5000|$|These {{parties can}} operate inside the Islamic regime. Until 2010 two groupings functioned: the Conservatives (extremist and ultra-{{religious}} right-wing parties) and <b>the</b> <b>Reformists</b> (moderate religious right-wing parties). [...] only the Conservative parties can carry out {{political and cultural}} activities inside Iran. <b>The</b> <b>Reformists</b> have turned into [...] "Moderates" [...] so as to continue their activities without being arrested.

5|$|Both {{parents were}} monarchists and liberal conservatives, being {{committed}} to the emancipation reform of 1861 introduced by <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> Tsar Alexander II; they avoided political radicals {{and there is no}} evidence that the police ever put them under surveillance for subversive thought. Every summer they holidayed at a rural manor in Kokushkino. Among his siblings, Lenin was closest to his sister Olga, whom he often bossed around; he had an extremely competitive nature and could be destructive, but usually admitted his misbehaviour. A keen sportsman, he spent much of his free time outdoors or playing chess, and excelled at school, the disciplinarian and conservative Simbirsk Classical Gimnazia.|$|E
5|$|Many factors {{contributed to}} the Song's {{repeated}} military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens. Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong's imperial court responsible for {{the decline of the}} dynasty. These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for their moral failures. Early Song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of Confucianism, but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> Wang Anshi's expulsion as chancellor in 1076. Corruption marred the reign of Huizong, who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler. Huizong was known for his extravagance, and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state's grip on power.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli was {{politically}} active in Warsaw {{during and after}} the Four-Year Sejm (1788–92). He served as intermediary between <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> Patriotic Party and King Stanisław August Poniatowski, and as an aide to the King (1789–93). He is best remembered for his participation in drafting the Constitution of May 3, 1791, a milestone act in the history of Polish political legislation. He was one of the organizers of the Kościuszko Insurrection against Russian influence in 1794, which was the last armed struggle to be held under the banners of the Commonwealth. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Piattoli was interned by the Austrians for several years, together with another Polish activist of the Constitution movement, Hugo Kołłątaj. Freed in 1800, he worked several years with Polish and Russian statesman Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski in the service of Russia, before retiring to Courland.|$|E
50|$|Political {{scientist}} Ivan Choy {{commented that}} the election results showed the loss of trust between <b>the</b> mainstreamers and <b>reformists.</b> <b>The</b> New Territories East branch which <b>the</b> <b>reformists</b> dominated would confront the party's central authorities. That might lead to another split if the conflicts continued and bad election results came out badly in the District Council elections next year.|$|R

5|$|The Dominican Order had {{its origins}} in <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> {{ideology}} of Dominic de Guzmán, later Saint Dominic. By 1219, Dominic had established houses as far apart as Paris, Bologna, Madrid and Segovia; at his death in 1221, there were 21 houses. Expansion of the order continued into England as houses were established at Oxford in 1221 and London in 1224. There were five houses in England by 1230, by which time the Order was poised to enter Scotland. Later tradition had it that the Dominican Order entered Scotland in 1230, encouraged by King Alexander II and William de Malveisin, Bishop of St Andrews. However, the earliest certain date for {{the foundation of a}} Dominican house in Scotland is 1234.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Reformist</b> Party {{supported}} privatization, {{opposing the}} Modernist Party, which had dominated politics {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu and the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d. 68 BC). The Modernists argued that state monopolies provided abundant raw materials, good working conditions, and high quality iron; the Reformists countered that state-owned ironworks produced large and impractical implements designed to meet quotas rather than to be of practical use, were of inferior quality, and were too expensive for commoners to purchase. In 44 BC, the Reformists had both the salt and iron monopolies abolished, but the monopolies were reinstated in 41 BC after their abrupt closure resulted in significant losses of revenue for the government and disruption of the private economy.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} {{tried to}} stop, or limit, {{the changes in}} the ČSSR through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at Čierna nad Tisou, near the Slovak-Soviet border. At the meeting, with attendance of Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin, Nikolai Podgorny, Mikhail Suslov and others on the Soviet side and Dubček, Svoboda, Oldřich Černík, Smrkovský and others on the Czechoslovak side, Dubček defended the proposals of <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> wing of the KSČ while pledging commitment to the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. The KSČ leadership, however, was divided between vigorous reformers (Josef Smrkovský, Oldřich Černík, and František Kriegel) who supported Dubček, and conservatives (Vasil Biľak, Drahomír Kolder, and Oldřich Švestka) who adopted an anti-reformist stance.|$|E

5|$|While {{these reforms}} succeeded in forming an {{equilibrium}} {{between the old}} common law courts and the new courts, they were viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. While the King's Bench was more revolutionary, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. The disparity between <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> King's Bench and conservative Common Pleas was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on how to cut costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|A {{new round}} of snap {{elections}} in October 2014 resulted in a third GERB victory with around {{a third of the}} vote. A record of eight parties won seats, {{the first time since the}} beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament. After being tasked by President Rosen Plevneliev to form a government, Borisov's GERB formed a coalition and members of the parties in <b>the</b> <b>Reformist</b> Bloc (Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), Bulgaria for Citizens Movement (DBG), Alternative for Bulgarian Revival and Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS)) were chosen for Minister positions. However, Boyko Borisov made a vow in 2016 – should GERB President nominee Tsetska Tsacheva does not win the Bulgarian presidential election, 2016, he would resign as a Prime Minister. GERB lost at this election from the independent candidate Rumen Radev who was, nevertheless, supported by the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Subsequently, Boyko Borisov resigned for the second time.|$|E
5|$|After peace returned, Gibraltar {{underwent}} {{major changes}} during <b>the</b> <b>reformist</b> governorship of General Sir George Don, who {{took up his}} position in 1814. The damage caused by the Great Siege had long since been repaired, but Gibraltar was still essentially a medieval town in its layout and narrow streets. A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding St Bernard's Hospital to serve the civilian population and initiating {{the construction of the}} Cathedral of the Holy Trinity to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians. For the first time, civilians began to have a say in the running of Gibraltar. An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers. A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 Gibraltar became a Crown colony. In the same year, the Gibraltar Police Force was established, modelled on London's pioneering Metropolitan Police Service, and a Supreme Court was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.|$|E

25|$|The {{debate was}} {{characterized}} by two opposing factions, <b>the</b> <b>reformists</b> and <b>the</b> modernists. <b>The</b> <b>reformists</b> were largely Confucian scholars who opposed the policies of Emperor Wu and demanded {{the abolition of the}} monopolies on salt and iron, an end to the state price stabilization schemes, and huge cuts in government expenditures to reduce the burden on the citizenry. The Modernists supported the continuation of Emperor Wu's policies in order to appropriate the profits of private merchants into state coffers to fund the government's military and colonization campaigns in the north and west.|$|R
