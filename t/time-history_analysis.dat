To answer this need, the ongoing RFCS research project PROINDUSTRY is addressing the question of the development of innovative seismic protection systems, both for the design of new industrial plants and for the retrofit of existing ones. This paper presents a specific aspect of the ongoing investigations within the referred project, namely a case study considering a Gas Tank. The protection systems under development contemplate both seismic isolation and energy dissipation techniques. For the presented case study, the base isolation system under development was finally chosen to improve the seismic performance of the Tank structure. In order to characterize the behavior of the Gas Tank structure, several numerical simulations were performed comprising modal analyses, push-over analyses and time-history nonlinear analyses. For the <b>time-history</b> nonlinear <b>analysis</b> ground motions were generated on the basis of available information on ground motion histories from national, European and Mediterranean Strong Motion Data-bases.

The Lagrangian approach was used with fluid elements to model impounded water. The interface elements were used to simulate the slippage between the concrete face slab and the rockfill. The horizontal component of the 1992 Erzincan earthquake, with a peak ground acceleration of 0. 515 g, was considered in <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis.</b> The Drucker-Prager model was preferred in nonlinear {{analysis of the}} concrete slab, rockfill and foundation soil.

Finally, the some new measures and methods of enhancing anti-seismic design for the truss bridge structure are also proposed. 1. Preface The seismic design is needed in the seismic fortification area, so the dynamic response analysis of truss bridge structure under the seismic action is also needed. Seismic response analysis includes the elastic stage of the response spectrum analysis method and <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis</b> method. In order to perform the elasto-plastic analysis under the strong earthquakes, the dynamic process analysis calculation methods are often used. Especially in the high intensity area or more than the total number of crosses, across long, big and complex across the truss bridge structure, the seismic response <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis</b> is needed. For the input of the different seismic waves, the calculation result of structural seismic response may vary greatly.

40|$|AbstractA new {{approach}} has been proposed by the authors and applied to allocate linear viscous dampers optimally for twoand three-dimensional building structures recently. This approach is extended {{to search for the}} optimal allocation of non-linear viscous dampers in this paper. The same initial damper placement is used for conducting the analysis. However, instead of carrying out the linear <b>time-history</b> seismic <b>analysis,</b> the non-linear <b>time-history</b> seismic <b>analysis</b> is performed first to obtain the inter-story drift ratio. Then, check the inter-story drift ratio for the locations where dampers were added and move the damper in the location with the minimal inter-story drift ratio to the location with the maximal inter-story drift ratio. Finally, repeat this process until the prescribed stop criterion is met. The nonlinear viscous dampers with two exponents, including 0. 3 and 0. 5, and two seismic records, including the El Centro earthquake and Chi-Chi earthquake, are used in this paper. Three examples, including two 10 -story and one 20 -story three-dimensional unsymmetrical building structures, are used to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. The results are compared with those obtained using the simplified sequential search algorithm (SSSA) and are also compared with the optimal placement of linear viscous dampers obtained using the proposed approach. It is found that the proposed approach requires much fewer analyses than the SSSA while their accuracy is comparable. The efficiency of the proposed approach for allocating non-linear viscous dampers is also comparable to or better than for allocating linear viscous dampers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Time-history</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{the most}} {{reliable}} method {{for the assessment of}} the behaviour of bridges subjected to seismic loads. It has been widely used in recent years on the evaluation of the seismic vulnerability of bridges. The selection of seismic motions {{is one of the most}} important issues for the <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis.</b> This thesis discusses four different methods for obtaining spectrum-compatible acceleration time histories (i. e., accelerograms) of seismic motions. Based on these methods, four sets of accelerograms compatible with the design spectrum for Montreal were selected for this study. These included (i) scaled real accelerograms, (ii) modified real accelerograms, (iii) simulated accelerograms, and (iv) artificial accelerograms. The selected sets were used as excitation motions in the nonlinear analysis of two existing bridges in Montreal. The bridges included a three-span continuous concrete slab bridge and a three-span continuous slab-girder type bridge. These two bridges are considered to be representative of typical highway bridges in Quebec. A number of response parameters, such as, the deck displacement, bearing displacement, column curvature ductility, and base shear were used for the evaluation of the effects of the selected sets on the response of the bridges. Based on the results from the analysis, simulated accelerograms are recommended for use in the <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis</b> of the bridges. Furthermore, a study was conducted on the investigation of the minimum number of accelerograms required for both linear and nonlinear time-history analyses. Two different scaling methods, i. e., partial area under the spectrum and the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the bridge, were used to obtain the bridge responses. It was found that 5 accelerograms are sufficient for the linear <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis</b> and 10 accelerograms are required for the nonlinear <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis</b> based on the results from the two bridges considered in this study...|$|E

40|$|Time history-analyses of {{building}} structures {{have been used}} for a quite long time for research at universities. Considering the advantage of <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis</b> relative to the equivalent static force method, the National Building of Canada and other modern building codes around the world require the use of <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis</b> in the design of specified types {{of building}}s located in seismic regions. One of the main issues in the use of <b>time-history</b> <b>analysis</b> is related to the selection and scaling of the seismic excitations (i. e., accelerograms) to be compatible with the design spectrum for the location considered. Currently, both recorded (i. e., “real”) accelerograms and artificial accelerograms are used in the analyses. 	The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the effects of the selection and scaling of seismic excitations on the response of reinforced concrete frame buildings. Three reinforced concrete frame buildings with heights of 4 storey, 10 storey and 16 storey, designed for Vancouver (high seismic zone) were used in this study. Five sets of seismic excitations were used in the analysis – one set of “real” accelerograms, and four sets of artificial accelerograms obtained by different methods. All sets were scaled to be compatible with the design spectrum for Vancouver. Both linear and nonlinear time history analyses were conducted on the buildings considered. Interstorey drifts and storey shear forces were used as response parameters. 	The results from the linear analysis show that both the interstorey drifts and the shear forces are affected significantly by the type of the excitation set. Similarly, the effects of the type of the seismic excitations on the drifts from nonlinear analysis are substantial. On the other hand, the influence of the excitation sets on the storey shears from nonlinear analysis are quite small.

Since {{it is difficult}} to evaluate the robustness of elastoplastic structures due to heavy computational load on the <b>time-history</b> response <b>analysis</b> including elastoplastic response, a double impulse input is used to provide a closed-form solution of the critical response of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) elastic–perfectly plastic structure under a near-field ground motion.

It is shown that, by using the derived upper bound of the critical response, the robustness function, a measure of the robustness, of elastoplastic structures can be evaluated efficiently.

It estimates the likely locations of damage (including concealed structural damage), potentially saving the owner time and money by focusing post-earthquake safety and repair inspections.
