40|$|Concentration {{of three}} forms of {{phosphorus}} {{was measured in}} nine lakes throughout one year. The fraction occurring as soluble organic was similar in tight lakes. Results of pre-vious workers wcrc produced by using their methods of separating seston from the water. Use of a filter with 0. 1 ~,u-diameter ports reduced the soluble organic fraction to 18 % of the total. Turnover time of inorganic P was less than 10 min in all lakes during the sum [...] mer but increased during the winter. Soluble phosphorus in the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone</b> of lakes occurs in the inorganic form as orthophosphate and {{in a form that}} does not react with acidified molybdatc. In the latter form, it has been called “soluble organic phosphorus ” by Hutchinson (1941) and “colloidal phosphorus ” by Einsele ww, although the operational term “soluble reactive ” coined by Strickland and Parsons (1960) is probably more dcscrip-tive of our knowledge of this fraction. That inorganic phosphorus is readily used is beyond dispute. In fact, the orthophosphate in the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone</b> of lakes is con-tinually taken up and released by plankton, the turnover time of this fraction being as short as 3. 6 min (Rigler 1956). However, the availability of naturally occurring solu-ble organic phosphorus has not been adc-quately measured.

40|$|Abstract : The {{first record}} of depth-time {{profiles}} for some physicochemical and biological parameters of Lake Bishamon-numa based on periodic observations during the ice-free season of 1996 are reported. Throughout the observed period, the thermocline was either absent or very weak. In accordance with this structure of water temperature, the dissolved oxygen was distributed uniformly {{in the water}} column at above a 90 % saturation level. The average and standard deviation of transparency was 5. 1 ± 1. 1 m. On the assumption that the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone</b> is from the surface to a depth of twice the transparency, the whole water body of the east basin in which the sampling station is located, constitutes the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone.</b> pH was fairly constant from July to December with an average and standard deviation of 6. 2 ± 0. 1. Compared with past data, the pH of Lake Bishamon-numa has changed greatly within a relatively short time period in the past and has lately stabilized around pH 6. The concentrations of Na, K, Mg, and Ca were in the order of m mol 1 ~- 1, while those of Fe and Mn were of μmol 1 ~- 1. Ranked in descending order of concentrations, they are Na, Ca, Mg, K, Mn and Fe. The annual maximum of Chl. a was 1. 5 μg 1 ~- 1 in May. Though there were slight maxima and minima, the Chl. a concentration was below 1 μg 1 ~- 1 in most seasons and averaged 0. 51 μg 1 ~- 1. This Chl. a level corresponds to those of other oligotrophic lakes. Nano-phytoplankton ranging from 2 to 20 μm predominated, and macro-phytoplankton greater than 20 μm were relatively scarce. 　Key words : Goshiki-numa Lake Group, depth-time profiles, metals seasonal tren...|$|E
40|$|Annually, {{during the}} months January to June, a heavy bloom of the dinoflagellate Peri-dinium cinctum fa w&ii occurs in warm (13 - 30 ” C), {{monomictic}} Lake Kinneret, Israel. The rates of carbon assimilation, determined with ‘“C, were not exceptionally high, but algal biomass and chlorophyll concentrations measured during the bloom season were among the highest recorded for the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone</b> of any natural water body. Effective utiliza-tion of environmental conditions by the motile Peridinium, which dominates the phytoplank-ton assemblage and is only slightly grazed, may partly explain the large standing crops. During the bloom, physiological activities are minimal (low assimilation numbers, activity coefficients, and specific growth rates); conversely, high values for these parameters occur in late summer and fall (when Chlorophyta prcdominatc) and {{at the start of}} the bloom. The patterns of algal behavior in Lake Kinneret may have general implications for undcr-standing the role of phytoplankton in warm eutrophic ccosystcms.

40|$|Diatom {{production}} in the offshore waters of Lake Michigan is limited by silica supplies in late summer and can be predicted from the seasonal disappearance of silica from the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone.</b> Biogenic silica fluxes obtained from sediment trap collections were compared with fluxes predicted from the silica disappearance model. Measured and predicted fluxes were in good agreement for offshore stations, but at stations closer to shore measured fluxes were 2 - 3 times greater than predicted fluxes. Sediment trap and water chemistry data show that little of the diatom production is dissolved in the water column. Therefore, greater than predicted fluxes at nearshore locations were attributed to new silica supplied from upwellings, tributary inputs, and recycling and resus-pension in nearshore sediments. The good agreement between measured and predicted fluxes in offshore waters shows that biogenic silica fluxes {{may be useful in}} determining the collecting efficiency of sediment traps. Lake Michigan provides an ideal system for the study of seasonal dynamics of the silica cycle. The annual seasonal change i...|$|E

Gross release rates were 15, 21, 33, and 100 mg P m- 2 d- l (average summer values). In three of the lakes, water temperature alone explained- 70 % of the seasonal variation in sediment P release. Long-term experiments with undisturbed sediment cores revealed that the P release was significantly influenced by tem-perature and NO,- in all four lakes, but by pH only in one lake when these three parameters varied within the normal seasonal range (temperature: O”- 21 °C; NO,-: O- 200 PM; pH: 7. 5 - 10. 5). Q 10 values for the temperature effect were between 4. 1 and 6. 8 in the three lakes with large proportions of Fe-bound P in the sediment, but only 3. 5 in the lake in which the P pool was relatively small. The thickness of the oxidized layer at the sediment surface varied from 3 to 15 mm and decreased when temperature increased. High N 03 - concentrations increased the thickness throughout the season and accordingly sediment P release was reduced in winter and early summer. Meanwhile, in late summer when inorganic N was depleted in lake water, N 03 - additions increased the P release from sediment, probably by stimulating the mineralization process...|$|E
40|$|Ah true t Silica, nitrate, {{total and}} {{dissolved}} phosphorus, and conductivity were measured during {{spring and summer}} in Lake Powell, Utah-Arizona. Phytoplankton productivity was also de-tcrmined. Conductivity is used as;L tracer for delineating the advective influence of inflows from the Colorado and San Jtlan Rivers on nutrient d&very and distribution in the reservoir. High spring runoff (l,OOO- 2, 000 m 3 *s-l) enters the lake essentially as an overflow and dom-inates the nutrient cycle in the epilimnion. The interaction of advective nutrient d&very and high turbidity controls the distribution of phytoplankton productivity and nutrient depletion. The cycling of nutrients in most lakes is controlled primarily by internal pro-cesses (cf. Wetzel 1975; Likens 1975). Regeneration of nutrient levels to the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone</b> of lakes depends on wind-induced mixing or diffusion through the water column during periods of little or no density stratification. Reservoirs, however, are often very different from natural lakes in their hydrological cycles (Wright 1967; Wunderlich 1971). The hy-drology o. f a reservoir can influence its nutrient dynamics through reservoir mor-phometry, inflow-outflow regimes, depth of discharge, and density stratification characteristics. Wright’s (1967) hypothe-sis that deep discharge reservoirs will have nutrient cycles opposite to those of natural lakes (i. e. a progressive loss of nutrients) has been supported by recent work.

40|$|Adipocere is a late stage postmortem {{decomposition}} product that forms from the lipids present in soft tissue. Its formation in aquatic environments is typically {{related to the}} presence of a moist, warm, anaerobic environment, and the effect of decomposer microorganisms. The ideal temperature range for adipocere formation is considered to be 21 - 45 C and is correlated to the optimal conditions for bacterial growth and enzymatic release. However, adipocere formation has been reported in cooler aquatic environments at considerable depths. This study aimed to investigate the chemical process of adipocere formation in a cold freshwater environment in Lake Ontario, Canada. Porcine tissue was used as a human tissue analogue and submerged at two depths (i. e. 10 and 30 feet) in the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone</b> of the lake. Samples were collected at monthly postmortem submersion intervals and analysed using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy to provide a qualitative profile of the lipid degradation and adipocere formation process. Early stage adipocere formation occurred rapidly in the cold water environment and proceeded to intermediate stage adipocere formation by the second month of submersion. However, further adipocere formation was inhibited in the third month of the study when temperatures approached the freezing point. The depth of submergence did not influence the chemical conversion process as similar stages of adipocere formation occurred at both depths investigated. The study demonstrated that adipocere can form rapidly, even on small amounts of soft tissue, which may be representative of dismembered or disarticulated limbs discovered in an aquatic environment...|$|E
40|$|Research of the {{microbial}} ecology of McMurdo Dry Valley lakes has concentrated primarily on phototrophs; relatively {{little is known}} about the heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Bacteria represent a substantial proportion of water column biomass in these lakes, comprising 30 to 60 % of total microplankton biomass. Bacterial production and cell numbers were measured 3 to 5 times, within four Antarctic seasons (October to January), in Lakes Fryxell, Hoare, and Bonney. The winter– spring transition (September to October) was included during one year. Lake Fryxell was the most productive, but variable, lake, followed by Lakes Bonney and Hoare. Bacterial production ranged from 0 to 0. 009 µg C ml− 1 d− 1; bacterial populations ranged from 3. 2 × 104 to 4. 4 × 107 cells ml− 1. Bacterial production was always greatest just below the ice cover at the beginning of the season. A second maximum developed just above the chemocline of all the lakes, as the season progressed. Total bacterioplankton biomass in the lakes decreased as much as 88 % between successive sampling dates in the summer, as evidenced by areal integration of bacterial populations; the largest decreases in biomass typically occurred in mid-December. A forward difference model of bacterial loss in the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone</b> and the entire water column of these lakes showed that loss rates in the summer reached 6. 3 × 1014 cells m− 2 d− 1 and 4. 16 × 1012 cells m− 2 d− 1, respectively. These results imply that bacteria may be a source of carbon to higher trophic levels in these lakes, through grazing...|$|E
40|$|Lake Kinneret (LK) is a {{monomictic}} {{lake that}} has undergone significant {{biological and chemical}} changes {{over the last three}} decades of the twentieth century. The transition between the 1970 s and the 1980 s attracted a lot of scientific attention as it was marked by significant changes in the ecology of the lake. In the early 1980 s, phytoplankton biomass increased, apparently in response to an increase in the external soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) load. This period was marked by a rise in hypolimnetic levels of ammonium (NH 4) and SRP as well as surface water dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH. Cconcomitantly, in surface waters in winter levels of NH 4 increased and NO₃ decreased. In this study interrelationships amongst these observations were examined with a mass balance modelling approach, including simulation of individual nutrient sources and sinks, focusing on nitrogen fluxes in winter. The step-like rise in phytoplankton biomass in 1981 may have been triggered by the increase in winter external loads of SRP, as P {{is likely to be the}} growth-limiting nutrient during this season. The additional P load led to a sequence of changes including greater summer phytoplankton biomass, followed by enhanced sedimentation of organic matter. Furthermore, higher organic matter mineralization fluxes within the hypolimnion resulted in elevated levels of NH 4 and SRP in this layer through the 1980 s, with a feedback to productivity in the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone</b> following seasonal destratification in early winter. In an apparent transition period (late 1970 s to early 1980 s), an increase in the modelled rate of nitrate (NO₃) production occurred via nitrification together with increased uptake of the additional nitrate by phytoplankton. These results are consistent with increased phytoplankton abundance and elevated levels of surface water NH 4 and DO during this period. Through this period the increase in phytoplankton uptake of NO₃ predominated over the increase in nitrification, and NO₃ concentrations in the 1980 s were reduced compared with the previous decade, with increased partitioning of N in biomass and NH₄...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the response}} of the carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of sedimentary organic matter to rapid human-induced eutrophication and meromixis as well as subsequent restoration efforts [in-lake phosphorus (P) -Precipitation, P-remediation of the well inflow and multiannual destratification] in a 46 -yr sediment core sequence (1963 - 2009) from Fischkaltersee, a small hard-water lake (S-Germany). In addition, the sediment record was compared with detailed data on water column chemistry during almost (1977 - 2009) the recorded history of eutrophication and trophic recovery of the named lake. While the onset of eutrophication resulted in an abrupt positive excursion (+ 2. 4 ‰), the overall reaction of δ 13 C SOM to ongoing eutrophication and meromixis as well as to permanent hypolimnion aeration and trophic recovery is a continous negative trend (- 3. 7 ‰) with the most depleted signatures (- 38. 8 ‰) present in the youngest part of the core. This negative trend was not influenced by multiannual hypolimnion aeration, which although oxygenating bottom waters (> 2 mg O 2 L – 1), did not reverse the increasing anoxis in the sediment, as is indicated by an declining Mn/Fe ratio. Hence, we conclude that in Fischkaltersee δ 13 C SOM was controlled by photoautotrophic input only during an early phase in the eutrophication process. The signal of intensifying microbially mediated carbon cycling processes in the sediment, i. e. methanogenesis and methanotrophy, was superimposed on the primary productivity signal by crossing a certain TP threshold (approx. TP= 0. 04 mg L – 1). Sedimentary δ 15 N values exhibit an overall increase (+ 3. 4 ‰) in reaction to the eutrophication process, while trophic recovery produces a continous decrease in the signal (- 2. 7 ‰). Linear correlation of δ 15 N to nitrate utilisation in the epilimnion, however, is rather weak (R 2 = 0. 33). Comparison between sediment δ 15 N values and water column data reveals that two negative shifts in the isotopic signal (- 1 ‰/- 0. 6 ‰) around 1980 and 1984 respectively, {{can be attributed to the}} existence of significant amounts of ammonium (up to 2 mg L – 1) in the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone.</b> Coincident drops in nitrate utilisation (- 20 %/- 53 %) indicate phytoplankton assimilation of ammonium. As the artificial aeration did also not affect δ 15 N, we conclude that water column denitrification never contributed significantly to the sedimentary N isotope signal...|$|E
40|$|Äquatoriale Hochgebirgsseen sind eine besondere Art von Seen, die zwischen 2. 500 und 4. 000 m über dem Meeresspiegel liegen und hauptsächlich in den Anden von Ecuador, Peru und Kolumbien vorkommen. Im allgemein sind sie Kaltwasserseen mit Wassertemperaturen unter 20 °C. Ihre limnologischen Merkmale werden durch einige typische tropische Umweltparameter bestimmt, wie z. B. hohe Strahlungseingabe, niedrige saisonbedingte Variationen von Temperatur und Lichteingabe, sowie hohe tägliche Temperaturschwankung. Der San Pablo See liegt 2. 660 m über den Meeresspiegel in den Anden von Ecuador. Intensive landwirtschaftliche Nutzung des Einzugsgebietes, Bodenerosion und die direkte Einleitung von Abwasser in den See haben zum aktuellen Eutrophiezierungsgrad und dem gegenwärtigen schlechten Zustand des Sees beigetragen. Im Rahmen der hier vorgelegten Studie wurden zwischen 1998 und 2001 limnologische Untersuchungen am San Pablo See durchgeführt. Es wurde festgestellt, dass eine thermische Schichtung von niedriger Stabilität von Ende September bis Ende Mai auftritt. Diese führt zu einem Temperaturunterschied zwischen Epi- und Hypolimnion von ca. 2 °C, mit einer monomiktischen Zirkulationsphase während der Sommermonaten zwischen Juni und August. Weiterhin wurde ein nächtlicher konvektiver Mischungsprozess festgestellt, der durch starke Nachmittagswinde und nächtliche Abkühlungsprozesse verursacht wird. Dieser Prozess führt zu einer Destratifizierung und Durchmischung der trophogenischen Zone, die bis tief in die tropholytischen Zone eine Wassertiefe von bis zu 20 m erreichen kann. Solch ein thermisches Ereignis hängt von lokalen Wetterbedingungen ab, kann mehrere Tage und sogar Wochen dauern und ist als "Atelomixis" bekannt. Das atomare N:P Verhältnis liegt zwischen 5 und 25 und zeigt eine Limitierung durch Stickstoff wäh nd den Stratifikationsphasen und manchmal auch durch Phosphor während den Zirkulationsperioden. Die im See herrschenden Zirkulationsprozesse scheinen wichtige limitierende Faktoren zu sein. Die Phytoplanktonanalyse zeigt eine geringe Artenvielfalt mit einer relativen hohen Abundanz der vorhandenen Organismen und hoher Biomasse. Das Phytoplankton wird hauptsächlich durch die fädige Diatomeae Aulacoseira granulata sowie durch einige Chlorococcales, u. a. Scenedesmus linearis und Pediastrum boryanum, und der Euglenophyceae Trachelomonas volvocina dominiert. Das Zooplankton im See ist extrem artenarm und es wird durch den Crustaceen Daphnia pulicaria, und Metacyclops mendocinus sowie durch die Rotatorien Keratella tropica, Trichocerca similis, Anuraeopsis fissa und Asplanchna sp. repräsentiert. Es scheint, dass die im See lebenden Organismen an die hohe natürliche UV-Strahlung gut angepasst sind. Diese Ergebnisse können als Basis für die Planung von Programmen für die Kontrolle der Eutrophikation im See {{verwendet}} werden. Equatorial {{high mountain}} lakes are singular lakes that lie between 2, 500 and 4, 000 m above the sea level (a. s. l) {{mainly in the}} Andes of Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. They are typically cold-water lakes with water temperatures below 20 °C. Their limnological characteristics are determined by some environmental parameters typical for tropical regions, such as high radiation input, low seasonal variation of temperature and light input, and high daily temperature variation. Lake San Pablo is located at 2, 660 m a. s. l. in the Andes of Ecuador. Intensive agricultural activities, land erosion in the catchment area {{as well as the}} inflow of untreated waste water directly into the lake have contributed to eutrophication and to the present deteriorated state of the lake. In the present study, limnological investigations were carried out at Lake San Pablo between 1998 and 2001. During this study a temperature stratification of low stability occurring from late September to late May was observed. This leads to a temperature difference between epi- and hypolimnion of nearly 2 °C, with a monomictic circulation phase during the summer moths between June and August. Furthermore, a nightly convective mixing due to afternoon winds and nightly cooling processes was observed. This induces the destratification and mixing of the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>zone,</b> which can reach into the tropholytic zone up to 20 m depth. This sort of thermal behavior depends on local daily weather conditions and is known as atelomixis. The N:P atomic ratio lies between 5 to 25, indicating a limitation by nitrogen, mainly during stratification periods, and sometimes by phosphorus, generally after overturn. The complex water mixing processes in the lake also seem {{to play an important role}} as limiting factor in biological productivity. The analysis of phytoplankton indicates low species richness and relatively high abundance of existing organisms and high biomass. Phytoplankton is represented principally by the filamentous diatom Aulacoseira granula, and also by some Chlorococcales as Scenedesmus linearis and Pediastrum boryanum, and the Euglenophyceae Trachelomonas volvocina. The zooplankton community is very poor and is represented by the Crustacea Daphnia pulicaria, Metacyclops mendocinus and the Rotatoria Keratella tropica, Trichocerca similis, Anuraeopsis fissa and Asplanchna sp. The organisms in the lake seem to be well adapted to the natural high UV-radiation. These results could be used as the basis for planning future programs for the mitigation and control of eutrophication in the lake...|$|E
