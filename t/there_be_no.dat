5|$|In late 1916 {{and early}} 1917, secret peace talks {{took place between}} Austria-Hungary and France. There is circumstantial {{evidence}} that parallel discussions were held between Austria-Hungary and Serbia with Prime Minister Pašić dispatching his righthand man Stojan Protić and Regent Alexander dispatching his confidant Colonel Petar Živković to Geneva on secret business. Charles I of Austria laid out Austria-Hungary's key demand for returning Serbia to {{the control of the}} Serbian Government in exile: that Serbia should provide guarantees that <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> further political agitation emanating from Serbia against Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Major Robert Anderson, sent {{a request for}} provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists {{as an act of}} war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> invasion.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{decided that}} the summer 1942 {{campaign}} would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus. The Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning point of the war, began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe. The Sixth Army entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded {{by the end of}} November in Operation Uranus, Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day. The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.|$|E

5|$|The Americans, British, and French all {{differed}} on {{the issue}} of reparations settlement. The Western Front had been fought in France, and that countryside had been heavily scarred in the fighting. France's most industrialized region in the north-east had been laid to waste during the German retreat. Hundreds of mines and factories were destroyed along with railroads, bridges and villages. Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France, thought it appropriate that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage they had caused. He also saw reparations as a means to ensure that Germany could not again threaten France and as well to weaken the German ability to compete with France's industrialization. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, such as Belgium, also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations in favour of a less crippling reparations settlement so that the German economy could remain a viable economic power and British trading partner. He furthermore argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances to be paid to war widows, which would, reserve a larger share of the reparations for the British Empire. Wilson opposed these positions, and was adamant that <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> indemnity imposed upon Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped awnings {{on all of the}} cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought the total number of freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E

25|$|Women's clubs {{were noted}} for {{promoting}} educational efforts {{around the country}} by their contemporaries. Putting women onto school boards was part of many women's club agendas in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Women's groups also influenced discussion surrounding class size; the Chicago Woman's City Club asking that <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> more than thirty children per class. Chicago clubs also helped sponsor school lunches for students. Clubwomen have also protested cuts in teacher's salaries. Black women's clubs worked to create educational efforts for their communities when these areas were ignored by white people.|$|E

25|$|While {{organization}} of the corps {{was found to be}} generally reliable, the corps' subdivision into four or five divisions hampered overall ease of command. General Lee had already considered before the Battle of Antietam to slim down the overall structure, but intended <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> changes in leadership. The Confederate Congress authorized the establishment of the Corps, and President Davis affirmed the assignment of the commanders and promoted Major Generals Longstreet and Jackson to Lieutenant Generals. General Lee announced this in Special Order 234 on November 6, 1862. About 60,000 soldiers served at the Maryland Campaign.|$|E
25|$|French {{was then}} {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces for 1916–18. This period saw the country running increasingly short of manpower for the Army. Whilst the Third Battle of Ypres was in progress French, {{as part of}} Lloyd George’s intrigues to reduce the power of Haig and Robertson, submitted a paper critical of Haig's command record and recommending that <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> further major offensives until the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) was present in strength. He then became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1918, a position he held {{throughout much of the}} Irish War of Independence (1919–1922), during which time he published 1914, an inaccurate and much criticised volume of memoirs.|$|E
25|$|A three member {{panel of}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a {{decision}} on January 8, 2008. Writing for the majority, Chief Judge Randall R. Rader upheld the District Court's decision that the '212' patent was enabled by the EMERALD paper and therefore invalid. However, he concluded that there were issues of material fact about whether the Live Traffic paper constituted prior art. Since a grant of summary judgment requires that <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> remaining issues of material fact between the parties, the majority vacated and remanded the District Court's grant of summary judgment that the Live Traffic paper invalidated the '203', '212', '338', and '615' patents.|$|E

25|$|These {{plans were}} scuttled {{by the death}} of Edward VII on 6 May 1910. Asquith and his ministers were {{initially}} reluctant to press the new king, George V, in mourning for his father, for commitments on constitutional change, and the monarch's views were not yet known. With a strong feeling in the country that the parties should compromise, Asquith and other Liberals met with Conservative leaders in a number of conferences through much of the remainder of 1910. These talks failed in November over Conservative insistence that <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> limits on the Lords's ability to veto Irish Home Rule. When the Parliament Bill was submitted to the Lords, they made amendments that were not acceptable to the government.|$|E
25|$|When {{they came}} back to the Bethel and Hai area, Abram's and Lot's sizable {{livestock}} herds occupied the same pastures. This became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each family's cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand (north) or on the right hand (south), that <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> conflict amongst brethren. But Lot chose to go the plain of Jordan where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoar, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward Sodom. Abram went south to Hebron and settled in the plain of Mamre, where he built another altar to worship God.|$|E
