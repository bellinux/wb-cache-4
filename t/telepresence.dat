25|$|Telerobotics becomes <b>telepresence</b> {{when the}} time delay is short enough to permit control of the {{spacecraft}} in close to real time by humans. Even the two seconds light speed delay for the Moon is too far away for <b>telepresence</b> exploration from Earth. The L1 and L2 positions permit 400-millisecond round trip delays, which is just close enough for <b>telepresence</b> operation. <b>Telepresence</b> has also been suggested {{as a way to}} repair satellites in Earth orbit from Earth. The Exploration Telerobotics Symposium in 2012 explored this and other topics.|$|E
25|$|A <b>telepresence</b> {{system is}} a {{high-end}} videoconferencing system and service usually employed by enterprise-level corporate offices. <b>Telepresence</b> conference rooms use state-of-the art room designs, video cameras, displays, sound-systems and processors, coupled with high-to-very-high capacity bandwidth transmissions.|$|E

25|$|They {{found that}} <b>telepresence</b> {{exploration}} of Mars has many advantages. The astronauts have near real-time {{control of the}} robots, and can respond immediately to discoveries. It also prevents contamination both ways and has mobility benefits as well.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{in close}} {{orbit around the}} planet could control {{equipment}} on the surface in real time via <b>telepresence,</b> so bringing many {{of the benefits of}} a surface mission, without its associated increased forward and backward contamination risks.|$|E
25|$|They {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that telerobotic approaches could permit direct study of the samples on the Mars surface via <b>telepresence</b> from Mars orbit, permitting rapid exploration and use of human cognition to take advantage of chance discoveries and feedback from the results obtained so far.|$|E
25|$|After {{enrolling in}} a {{computer}} science PhD program at Stanford University, Page was {{in search of a}} dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph—his supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received. He also considered doing research on <b>telepresence</b> and autonomous cars during this time.|$|E
25|$|Teleconferencing and <b>telepresence</b> {{technologies}} are often implemented in green computing initiatives. The advantages are many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins {{as a result of}} lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc. The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed. Other related initiatives, such as Hoteling, reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it. Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.|$|E
500|$|The Farallones Local Area Network {{allows the}} access {{of more than}} 4,200 {{computers}} to a 10 Mbit/s dedicated Internet link provided by the High Speed University Network ( [...] , RUAV), which provides the member universities with the infrastructure for advanced services such as access to digital libraries, telemedicine, <b>telepresence</b> and Videoconferencing, as well as educational resources including virtual campuses and laboratories. [...] The RUAV {{is part of the}} National Academic Network of Advanced Technology ( [...] , RENATA), which is connected to the Internet2 and GÉANT networks through the Latin American Cooperation of Advanced Networks ( [...] , CLARA).|$|E
500|$|During {{his meeting}} with fellow GE executives, in which Jack {{is not allowed to}} be with them due to his bedbugs condition, a <b>telepresence</b> system—a {{television}} screen in which the executives can be seen—is placed in Jack's office to witness the meeting. One of the executives (Michael Mulheren) asks Jack if he likes the Cisco Systems equipment, which he does, calling it [...] "the gold standard by which all business technology is judged. Cisco: The Human Network", then after an argument with the executives, they mute him, prompting Jack to say [...] "Did you just mute me!? Did you just use Cisco's cutting edge SureMute™ technology to mute me!?" [...] Some reviewers wondered whether or not 30 Rock continued doing more product placement with the addition of Cisco Systems, as they {{have done in the past}} with Snapple, Verizon, and SoyJoy.|$|E
2500|$|Al Garani can't {{travel to}} the United States, so his {{participation}} will be via <b>telepresence.</b> [...] Anderson called al Garani very articulate.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Telepresence</b> [...] {{refers to}} a set of {{technologies}} which allow a person to feel as if they were present, to give the appearance of being present, or to have an effect, via telerobotics, at a place other than their true location.|$|E
2500|$|Robotic exploration, {{telerobotics}} and <b>telepresence</b> give {{a method}} of exploration of a planet {{that do not have}} the same issues of forward and backward contamination. This could be of special interest during early stages when the celestial body is not yet well understood.|$|E
2500|$|On September 30, 2010, he {{appeared}} as himself on The Big Bang Theory season 4 episode [...] "The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification". While dining in The Cheesecake Factory where Penny works, he is approached by Sheldon via <b>telepresence</b> on a Texai robot. Leonard {{tries to explain}} to Penny who Wozniak is, {{but she says she}} already knows him from Dancing with the Stars.|$|E
2500|$|The {{equipment}} sites (labs) and {{a central}} data repository {{are connected to}} the global earthquake engineering community via the NEEShub website. [...] The NEES website is powered by HUBzero software developed at Purdue University for nanoHUB specifically to help the scientific community share resources and collaborate. [...] The cyberinfrastructure, connected via Internet2, provides interactive simulation tools, a simulation tool development area, a curated central data repository, animated presentations, user support, <b>telepresence,</b> mechanism for uploading and sharing resources, and statistics about users and usage patterns.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scientific}} {{goals of}} RSN are significant. [...] A {{vast array of}} natural phenomena that occur throughout the world's oceans and seafloor {{are found in the}} Northeast Pacific Ocean. As a whole, the mission of RSN is to provide a human <b>telepresence</b> in the ocean that will that will serve researchers, students, educators, policymakers, and the public. [...] Scientists will be able to conduct local investigations of such global processes as major ocean currents, active earthquake zones, creation of new seafloor, and rich environments of marine plants and animals.|$|E
2500|$|A smaller {{pressurised}} module {{is attached}} to the top of Kibō, serving as a cargo bay. The dedicated Interorbital Communications System (ICS) allows large amounts of data to be beamed from Kibō ICS, first to the Japanese KODAMA satellite in geostationary orbit, then to Japanese ground stations. When a direct communication link is used, contact time between the ISS and a ground station is limited to approximately 10 minutes per visible pass. When KODAMA relays data between a LEO spacecraft and a ground station, real-time communications are possible in 60% of the flight path of the spacecraft. Japanese ground controllers use <b>telepresence</b> robotics to remotely conduct onboard research and experiments, thus reducing the workload of station astronauts. [...] Ground controllers also use a free-floating autonomous ball camera to photodocument astronaut and space station activities, further freeing up astronaut time.|$|E
2500|$|A Mars analog {{habitat is}} one of several historical, {{existing}} or proposed research stations designed to simulate the physical and psychological environment of a Martian exploration mission. [...] These habitats are used to study the equipment and techniques that will be used to analyze the surface of Mars during a future manned mission, and the simulated isolation of the volunteer inhabitants allows scientists to study the medical and psychosocial effects of long-term space missions. They are often constructed in support of extensive Mars analogs (see List of Mars analogs). However, sometimes existing natural places are also valued as Mars analogs, such as a high Earth altitude where the pressure is equal to the pressure at the surface of Mars or a certain cave. Manned Mars habitats are featured in most human Mars missions; an alternative may be terraforming or <b>telepresence.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cisco {{documented}} the <b>Telepresence</b> concept and implementation {{details in the}} book Cisco <b>TelePresence</b> Fundamentals, where the difference between <b>Telepresence</b> and the {{at this point in}} time prevalent Videoconferencing is defined as quality, simplicity, and reliability.|$|E
5000|$|Interestingly, {{users have}} the ability to {{incorporate}} webinar capabilities into an Immersive or Adaptive <b>Telepresence</b> solution to extend meeting attendance. Yet this injection of <b>Telepresence</b> Lite capabilities all along the <b>Telepresence</b> solution spectrum still does not address support for simultaneous interactions with the material being presented in a meeting.|$|E
50|$|In February 2007, {{the firm}} {{introduced}} a new bridge platform called RMX 2000 designed to support high definition and <b>telepresence</b> applications.

50|$|Adaptive <b>telepresence</b> {{solutions}} may use {{the same}} technology, but the environments at both ends are not highly controlled and hence often differ. Adaptive solutions differ from <b>telepresence</b> lite solutions {{not in terms of}} control of environments, but in terms of integration of technology. Adaptive solutions use a managed service, whereas <b>telepresence</b> lite solutions use components that someone must integrate.|$|E
50|$|TiLR is the world's first enterprise-grade <b>telepresence</b> robot {{developed}} by RoboDynamics Corporation. The <b>Telepresence</b> internet-connected Low cost Robot (TiLR) enables a user to instantly transport {{to a remote}} location whereby the robot would embody the user in the remote location.

50|$|There {{have been}} two primary {{approaches}} that both utilize videoconferencing on a display 1) desktop <b>telepresence</b> robots - typically mount a phone or tablet on a motorized desktop stand to enable the remote person to look around a remote environment by panning and tilting the display or 2) drivable <b>telepresence</b> robots - typically contain a display (integrated or separate phone or tablet) mounted on a roaming base. Some examples of desktop <b>telepresence</b> robots include Kubi by Revolve Robotics, Galileo by Motrr, and Swivl. Some examples of roaming <b>telepresence</b> robots include Beam by Suitable Technologies, Double by Double Robotics, RP-Vita by iRobot and InTouch Health, Anybots, Vgo, TeleMe by Mantarobot, and Romo by Romotive. More modern roaming <b>telepresence</b> robots may include an ability to operate autonomously. The robots can map out the space {{and be able to}} avoid obstacles while driving themselves between rooms and their docking stations.|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} by Gartner, {{the spectrum of}} <b>Telepresence</b> solutions can range from Lite to Adaptive to Immersive.
