On <b>the</b> <b>grueling</b> two-year voyage—as he struggled with tiredness and bowel diseases—he wrote Martin Eden, filling its pages with his frustrations, adolescent gangfights and struggles for artistic recognition.

40|$|Traditionally {{prepared}} cereal based {{complementary food}} are too dilute for adequate energy and nutrient density as infant complementary food. The consistency of complementary food {{is of particular}} importance for infants who cannot masticate and therefore, depend on liquid or semi solid foods. In Nigeria mothers regard cereal malting and supplementation with legume as extra-labor. Increase of gruel energy density is important to improve the energy intake of young children in developing countries. This study investigated the effect of malting and co-fermentation bi-component flour (co-fermented maize/cowpea 70 : 30 w/w) on the consistency of <b>the</b> <b>gruel</b> product. Five processes in which either of the grain is germinated, un-germinated, un-germinated and boiled, un-germinated boiled, wet-milled and sieved before co-fermentation were explored. Consistency of <b>the</b> <b>gruel</b> of <b>the</b> products with concentration ranging from 4 - 18 %; was measured using Bostwick Consistometer. The dry matter of <b>the</b> <b>gruel</b> was determined according to standard method. It was observed that boiling and milling of un-germinated maize and cowpea before co-fermentation was more effective in viscosity reduction at 12 % flour concentration. At 12 % flour concentration that boiling and milling of un-germinated maize and cowpea before co-fermentation can enhance the consistency and by implication reduce the viscosity of co-fermented maize/cowpea as infant complementary food...|$|R

During shooting, Maguire hesitated under <b>the</b> <b>grueling</b> heat and 16-hour workdays, but pressed on to complete the filming. The actors first trained shooting blank loads, and then live ammunition for action conflict scenes. More than 250 Civil War black-powder pistols were used during the production phase. Over 140 extras played Lawrence residents, and more than 200 Civil War re-enactors were brought in to relay their style of living to the filming sequences.|$|E

Slaveholders often put slave women to work alongside men in <b>the</b> <b>grueling</b> atmosphere of the fields but were aware of ways to exploit them with regards to their gender as well. Choosing between the two was regularly a matter of expediency for the owners. In both small and large estates women were heavily involved in fieldwork, {{and the chance to}} be exempted in favor of domestic work was a privilege. Their roles in reproduction were still emphasized by owners, but often childbirth only meant that the physical demands of the field were forced to coexist with the emotional and physical pull of parenthood.|$|E

25|$|Vietnam {{obtained}} independence {{following the}} First Indochina War. In 1945, Hồ Chí Minh declared an independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which {{was recognized by}} the fellow Communist governments of China and the Soviet Union. Fighting lasted until March 1954, when the Việt Minh won the decisive victory against French forces at <b>the</b> <b>grueling</b> Battle of Điện Biên Phủ. This led to the partition of Vietnam into the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, under Việt Minh control, and the State of Vietnam in the south, which {{had the support of}} the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. It was at the 1954 Geneva Conference that France relinquished any claim to territory in the Indochinese peninsula. Laos and Cambodia also became independent in 1954, but were both drawn into the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year's {{race was}} the last Giro to be run with a points system. The race saw the first appearance of Costante Girardengo, who won the sixth stage, and would come to dominate the Giro in the future. Carlo Oriani— who had just gotten out of serving the Italian military in the Italo-Turkish War— won the event by six points over the second-place finisher, Eberardo Pavesi. The 1914 Giro d'Italia saw the calculation of the general classification shift from a points system to a time based system. In the new system, every rider's finishing time for each stage is totaled together and the rider with the lowest total time is the overall leader. Out of the eighty-one riders entered the race only eight of them finished. <b>The</b> <b>grueling</b> race was won by Alfonso Calzolari, who won by almost two hours over the second-place finisher. A Giro was planned for 1915, but the plans were scrapped when Italy entered World War I.|$|E
25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>grueling</b> {{worldwide}} {{tour the}} band had completed {{in support of}} Red Medicine, Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow up release. By March 1997 Fugazi had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with producer/engineer Don Zientara to begin recording {{what would become the}} End Hits album with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent 7 months recording the album. Due to the title, rumors began circulating at the time that it was to be their last release. Released on April 28, 1998 the album was commercially successful and marked one of the band's highest debuts yet on the Billboard charts. However, critical reaction to End Hits was mixed. Many critics praised the album's heavier tracks, while others questioned the inclusion of the group's longer, more experimental songs.|$|E

In a 2011 interview, Dawson recalled a meeting with executives from Viacom Enterprises about keeping the show for one more season. Dawson was growing tired of <b>the</b> <b>grueling</b> taping schedule and initially wanted to stop altogether. After discussing the situation with ABC and Viacom, Dawson {{said that he would}} return for a final syndicated season of thirty-nine weeks of episodes but would not continue doing the daytime series. After this, Dawson did not hear from Viacom for approximately a week and once they contacted him again, Dawson was told that Viacom was no longer interested in continuing the syndicated Feud beyond the 1984–85 season. Viacom made this official in January 1985 ahead of that year's NATPE convention, and within a few weeks, ABC decided that it too would not renew Feud for the 1985–86 season. The daytime version came to an end on June 14, 1985. The syndicated version aired its last new episode on May 17, 1985, and continued to air in reruns after that until September 6, 1985.|$|E
