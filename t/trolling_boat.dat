40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the importance of}} fishery resources to the Republic of the Maldives and identifies three basic types of fish resources available to the Republic, namely those in coral reef habitats, surface-swimming tuna and deep-swimming tuna which are found beyond the reef area. Reef fisheries may be overexploited by <b>trolling</b> <b>boats</b> {{but the number of}} these boats is still increasing. Pole-and-line boats are used to harvest surface-swimming tuna. The pole-and-line fleet is being rapidly mechanized and consequences of this are noted. Deep-swimming tuna stocks are not harvested by the Maldivians nor is the harvesting of these licensed to foreigners in the exclusive economic zone of the Maldives. Ways in which the Maldivians could obtain economic gain from this resource are discussed along with the overall policy problems which the Maldives faces for its three types of natural fishery resources...|$|R
50|$|On November, 4 1987, Outlaw was <b>trolling</b> on his <b>boat,</b> the Sea Walker, {{when they}} caught the 13 pound Spanish {{mackerel}} {{on a blue}} and white Sea Witch with a strip of fastback menhaden on a 7/0 hook, held by a Shimano bait-casting reel on a Kuna rod with 30-pound test line.|$|R
50|$|A year-round {{activity}} is boating - waterskiing, <b>trolling,</b> and more <b>boats</b> can use five multi-lane boat launch ramps. These are located at Bidwell Canyon, Loafer Creek, Spillway, Lime Saddle, Enterprise, Nelson Bar, Vinton Gulch, Foreman Creek, and Dark Canyon. Boat supplies and rentals {{are available on}} {{the south end of the}} Lake at Bidwell Marina or the north end at Lake Oroville Marina.|$|R
50|$|Small {{outboard}} motors are frequently used as <b>trolling</b> motors on <b>boats</b> with much larger engines {{that do not}} operate as efficiently or quietly at trolling speeds. These typically are designed with a manual pull start system, throttle and gearshift controls {{mounted on the body}} of the motor, and a tiller for steering, but in a trolling application, will be connected to the steering mechanism at the helm.|$|R
25|$|Historically, in Alaska, {{hand hook}} and line {{trolling}} {{were used to}} catch king and silver salmon in salt water. This method required minimal gear-boat, lines and hooks—and was used to catch fish that were still feeding in open water before returning to spawn. Trolling was very successful in southeast Alaska and historically the catch {{was used by the}} fresh and mild-cured fish packing industries. Power boats located near feeding grounds conducted most of the <b>trolling.</b> Each <b>boat</b> had four to ten lines, extending from tall poles hung outboard when fishing; each line carried several hooks, with heavy lead sinkers and spoons or baits as lures. Trolling lengthened the fishing season, allowing fishermen to fish in early spring before spawning runs.|$|R
5000|$|The 340 acre Pinchot Lake {{provides}} {{opportunities for}} boating. It has 24-hour launch areas and 286 shore moorings and canoe racks {{that can be}} rented from April 1 to November 1, the boat rental also rents electric motors and <b>trolling</b> engines for <b>boats.</b> Boats using the lake, with a motor must display a boat registration from any state. Non-powered boats must display one of the following: boat registration from any state,launching permit or mooring permit from Pennsylvania State Parks that are available at most state park offices, launch use permit from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.|$|R
5000|$|The {{length of}} fishing {{line between the}} downrigger release and the lure {{is known as the}} [...] "lead" [...] and this varies in length {{depending}} on how far behind the boat the fisherman would like to lure to trail. This fishing line is typically between ten and twenty pound test. When fishing for salmon this lead is often quite lengthy {{in order to avoid the}} fish being frightened by the noise of the <b>boat's</b> <b>trolling</b> motor. When many <b>boats</b> are <b>trolling</b> in a small area this often results in crossed lines and tangles which are a detriment to the fishing experience.|$|R
5000|$|The park rents rowboats, paddleboats and rowboats with an {{attached}} <b>trolling</b> motor. A <b>boat</b> can be rented with a valid driver's license {{that must}} {{be held in the}} office as a deposit. The person whose license is given as a deposit must be in the boat at all times during the rental. Park policy states that boaters under the age of sixteen, all paddle boat users and all passengers in a rowboat where any passenger is standing to cast a fishing line must wear their life jackets. Capacity restrictions as stated on the boats are followed for each boat type.|$|R
25|$|Trolley is an American word {{derived from}} the {{electric}} current pickup mechanism in early systems. The first successful electric streetcars in the United States used a system devised by Frank J. Sprague, in which a spring-loaded trolley pole pushed a small trolley wheel up against an overhead wire to collect electricity for the motors. Although not the first overhead collection system, it was far more reliable than its predecessors, and eventually became used by almost all streetcars. Some authorities believe that the vehicle became known as a trolley car because it reminded people (particularly on the West Coast) of a <b>boat</b> <b>trolling</b> for fish. Others believe it derived from a dialect word for a wheeled cart.|$|R
5000|$|The fishing lure {{is either}} {{tied with a}} knot, such as the {{improved}} clinch knot, or connected with a tiny safety pin-like device called a [...] "swivel" [...] onto the fishing line which is in turn connected to the reel via the arbor. The reel {{is attached to a}} rod. The motion of the lure is made by winding line back on to the reel, by sweeping the fishing rod, jigging movements with the fishing rod, or by being pulled behind a moving <b>boat</b> (<b>trolling).</b> exceptions included are artificial flies, commonly called flies by fly fishers, which either float on the water surface, slowly sink or float underwater, and represent some form of insect fish food.|$|R
25|$|There {{is a minor}} {{recreational}} fishery for rainbow runner {{in parts of the}} world. Often they are taken while trolling for other species such as tuna and mackerel, but are often targeted inshore by anglers on the west coast of the Americas using surface 'popper' style lures. The fish are caught {{on a wide variety of}} lures and baits, with deep diving lures, surface lures and even saltwater flies used to good measure. The species takes a wide variety of baits including live and cut fish, squid, octopus, and probably other crustaceans resembling their natural food. They are renowned as gamefish, especially at larger sizes. The species themselves are also commonly used as bait, either as live bait or dead bait rigged to be <b>trolled</b> behind game <b>boats</b> for larger species such as billfish and tuna.|$|R
40|$|Muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) are an {{economically}} and ecologically important species. Yet, {{our understanding of}} their feeding habits and habitat preference is limited and incomplete. This study addressed these shortcomings with muskellunge in Lake St. Clair. Muskellunge were captured by <b>trolling</b> on charter <b>boats</b> and electrofishing. Feeding habits were determined by comparing fish consumed to abundance of fish in the lake. Habitat preference was determined by spatially analyzing collected fish catch-per-unit-effort and lake conditions such as depth and submerged aquatic vegetation coverage. Overall, 167 muskellunge were sampled and 77 % of them had empty stomachs. White bass (Morone chrysops) {{was the most common}} found prey species in their diet. Moronidae was the family composing the largest portion of their diet. Muskellunge were more abundant in water with greater depth. The entire lake appears to have suitable coverage of submerged aquatic vegetation with an average of 67 %. In conclusion, muskellunge consumed small amounts of the main sport fish species in Lake St. Clair and likely have minimal impacts on those populations. The majority of Lake St. Clair has the preferred habitat for muskellunge and {{is likely to be a}} contributing factor to their large population...|$|R
40|$|During July 1970, {{albacore}} <b>boats</b> <b>trolling</b> surface jigs (jig boats) had record {{catches in}} an area off {{the mouth of the}} Columbia River. The jig fishery declined suddenly in late July and was poor throughout the remainder of the summer. No obvious oceanographic changes were correlated with these drastic changes in fishing success. Favorable water temperatures extended through August, traditionally the month of highest albacore landings in Oregon. Bait boats, which chum with live bait, had good fishing off Oregon from mid-August to October, indicating that the poor success of jig boats during this time was caused by the behavior of albacore relative to surface-trolled fishing gear. It is postulated that albacore descended into subsurface water in response to a change in availability of their preferred prey, the saury; here they were less accessible to jig boats than bait boats. Saury were common in the stomachs of albacore during periods of good jig fishing and were usually the dominant food where high albacore catches were made by our research vessel. The first albacore catches of the season were probably from an area of warm temperature and low salinity representing Columbia River plume water. The subsequent migration to the north appeared to be along the oceanic edge of the plume. In general, high catches by boats were not within the core of the plume but in 15. 5 °C water, especially in areas where a horizontal thermal gradient was apparent...|$|R
40|$|Jacksonville 2 ̆ 7 s 1901 Fire Marker, Jacksonville, Fl. This marker {{about the}} Great Fire of 1901 {{is located in}} Hemming Plaza in {{downtown}} Jacksonville, Florida, USA. The Great Fire of 1901 {{was one of the}} worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the Southeast. It was similar in scale and destruction to the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. It swept over 146 blocks and destroyed over 2, 368 buildings. The text on the marker reads as : 2 ̆ 2 On May 3, 1901 at 12 : 30 p. m., a fire began at the Cleaveland Fibre Factory, ten blocks northwest of this site. Chimney embers ignited sun-dried moss to be used as mattress stuffing. Fueled by wind and dry weather, the fire roared east destroying most structures in its path. By 3 : 30 p. m., the fire reached this site, then called Hemming Park. The park and its renowned live oaks were devoured by the flames and only the Confederate Monument survived, its base glowing red from heat. The fire continued an eastward march to Hogan 2 ̆ 7 s Creek, where a citizens 2 ̆ 7 ? bucket brigade stayed the flames. Then, turning south, the inferno roared to Bay Street 2 ̆ 7 s riverfront docks. Extreme heat caused a waterspout in the river where rescue <b>boats</b> <b>trolled</b> for survivors. The fire was so intense, black smoke clouds could be seen as far away as South Carolina. As flames moved west on Bay Street, the firefighters? gallant stand and dying winds brought the fire under control by 8 : 30 p. m. In just eight hours, nearly 10, 000 people were homeless, 2, 368 buildings were lost, 146 city blocks were destroyed, but miraculously only seven people perished. Jacksonville 2 ̆ 7 s 1901 Fire remains the most destructive burning of a Southern city in U. S. history. 2 ̆ 2 Placed by the Jacksonville Historical Society and the Florida Department of State.

6000|$|One great {{mistake is}} made by the company which farms the Loch, stocks it, {{supplies}} the boats, and regulates the fishing. They permit trolling with angels, or phantoms, or the natural minnow. Now, trolling may be comparatively legitimate, when the boat is being pulled against the wind to its drift, {{but there is no}} more skill in it than in sitting in an omnibus. But for <b>trolling,</b> many a <b>boat</b> would come home [...] "clean" [...] in the evening, on days of calm, or when, for other reasons of their own, the trout refuse to take the artificial fly. Yet there are men at Loch Leven who troll all day, and poor sport it must be, as a trout of a pound or so has no chance on a trolling-rod. This method is inimical to fly-fishing, but is such a consolation to the inefficient angler that one can hardly expect to see it abolished. The unsuccessful clamour for trolling, instead of consoling themselves, as sportsmen should do, with the conversation of the gillies, their anecdotes of great trout, and their reminiscences of great anglers, especially of the late Mr. Russell, the famed editor of the [...] "Scotsman." [...] This humourist is gradually [...] "winning his way to the mythical." [...] All fishing stories are attached to him; his eloquence is said (in the language of the historian of the Buccaneers) to have been [...] "florid"; he is reported to have thrown his fly-book into Loch Leven on an unlucky day, saying, [...] "You brutes, take your choice," [...] and a rock, which he once hooked and held on to, is named after him, on the Tweed. In addition to the humane and varied conversation of the boatmen, there is always the pure pleasure of simply gazing at the hillsides and at the islands. They are as much associated with the memory of Mary Stuart as Hermitage or even Holyrood. On that island was her prison; here the rude Morton tried to bully her into signing away her rights; hence she may often have watched the shore at night for the lighting of a beacon, a sign that a rescue was at hand.|$|R
