5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>university</b> grew, McMaster Hall {{started to}} become overcrowded. The {{suggestion}} to move <b>the</b> <b>university</b> to Hamilton was first {{brought up by}} a student and Hamilton native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered by <b>the</b> <b>university</b> until two years later. By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to Hamilton. As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became more acute, <b>the</b> <b>university</b> administration debated the future of <b>the</b> <b>university.</b> <b>The</b> <b>university</b> nearly became federated with <b>the</b> <b>University</b> of Toronto, as had {{been the case with}} Trinity College and Victoria College. Instead, in 1927, <b>the</b> <b>university</b> administration decided to transfer <b>the</b> <b>university</b> to Hamilton. The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec secured $1.5 million, while the citizens of Hamilton raised an additional $500,000 to help finance the move. The lands for <b>the</b> <b>university</b> and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates. Lands were transferred from Royal Botanical Gardens to establish the campus area. The first academic session on the new Hamilton campus began in 1930. McMaster's property in Toronto was sold to <b>the</b> <b>University</b> of Toronto when McMaster moved to Hamilton in 1930. McMaster Hall is now home to the Royal Conservatory of Music.|$|E
