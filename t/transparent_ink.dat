The monk uses a single long thin needle about 18 inches in length and about four millimeters in width. The tip of the spike is split into two (like a split cane), so that each stab of the spike produces two dots of ink in the skin. There are about 8 of these needles in a pot of a type of cleaning solution. Sometimes the monk will sharpen the needle with fine grade sandpaper before beginning. The monk will then select from several different rubber templates with the design of choice. He will apply the template to ink and then press {{it on to the}} recipients back to transfer the design. When ready to begin, he will dip the tip of the needle into a mix of oil, probably palm oil, Chinese charcoal ink, and possibly snake venom. He then begins to trace the pattern.

40|$|Printed {{electronics}} is {{an established}} industry allowing {{the production of}} electronic components such as resistors, and more complex structures such as solar cells, from functional inks. Composites, a mixture {{of two or more}} materials with different physical and/or chemical properties that combine to create a new material with properties differing from its constituent parts, have been important in areas such as the textile and automotive industries, and are significant in printed electronics as inks for printed circuit components, touch and vapour sensors. Here, the functional performance and physical behaviour of two screen printable multi-component nanocomposite inks, formulated for touch-pressure sensing applications, are investigated. They each comprise a proprietary mixture of electrically conducting and insulating nanoparticles dispersed in an insulating polymer binder, where one is opaque and the other transparent. The opaque ink has a complex surface structure consisting of a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles. The transparent inks structure is characterised by large aggregates of nanoparticles distributed through the printed layer. Temperature dependent electrical transport measurements under a range of compressive loadings reveal similar non-linear behaviour in both inks, with some hysteresis observed, and this behaviour is linked to the inks structures. A physical model comprising a combination of linear and non-linear conduction contributions, with the linear term attributed to direct connections between conductive particles and the non-linear term attributed to field-assisted quantum tunnelling, has been developed and used successfully to describe the underpinning physical processes behind the unique electrical functionality of the opaque ink and, to a lesser extent, the <b>transparent</b> <b>ink...</b>|$|E

Firstly, a selfassembled photonic nanostructure is developed to exploit that {{a range of}} colors on incident light will reflect on a crystalline structure with appropriate periodicity. The photonic crystal substrates are utilized to demonstrate a technique for creating erasable, high-resolution color images with <b>transparent</b> <b>inks.</b> The photonic-crystal-based technique is applied to construct a photonic crystal resonator in the waveguide through which light travels and is confined in small mode volume. The confined light energy enables the optical force experienced by a trapped dielectric nanoparticle. Based on this principle, angular orientation and rotational control of both biological and non-biological nanoscale rods are demonstrated using a photonic crystal nanotweezer to extend the capabilities of near-field optical techniques, including trapping, transport, and handling of nanomaterials. In experiments, single microtubules (diameter 25 nm, length 8 [mu]m) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (outer diameter 110 - 170 nm, length 5 [mu]m) are rotated by the optical torque resulting from their interaction with the evanescent field emanating from these devices. An angular trap stiffness of k = 92. 8 pN[MIDDLE DOT] nm/rad 2 -mW is demonstrated for the microtubules and a torsional spring constant of 22. 8 pN nm/rad 2 -mW is measured for the nanotubes. Finally, the near-field optical technique is utilized to develop a label-free method for measuring the binding affinity and stoichiometry of free-solution interactions between antibodies and single influenza viruses at the attogram scale. Common approaches, including optical, electrochemical, and mechanical detection schemes require immobilizing {{one or both of the}} interacting molecules on an assay plate or a sensor surface, which constrains their active binding. This restriction prevents a precise measurement of their affinity and binding capacity, especially when one of the interacting biomolecules is much larger than the other and multivalent, for example a virus and an antibody. The method, however, presented here detects specific binding by analyzing changes in the confined Brownian motion of the virus, which is trapped but not immobilized using a photonic crystal resonator. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|R

First and foremost, {{although}} the colored lines were reasonably fine (about 75 sets of three colored {{lines to the}} inch) they were still disturbingly visible at normal viewing distances and nearly intolerable when enlarged by projection. This problem was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} each screen was individually ruled on a machine which used three pens to apply the <b>transparent</b> colored <b>inks,</b> resulting in irregularities, high reject rates and high cost. The glass used for photographic plates at the time was not perfectly flat, and lack of uniform good contact between the screen and the image gave rise to areas of degraded color. Poor contact also caused false colors to appear if the sandwich was viewed at an angle. Although much simpler than the Kromskop system, the Joly system was not inexpensive. The starter kit of plate holder, compensating filter, one taking screen and one viewing screen cost $30 (the equivalent of at least $750 in 2010 dollars) and additional viewing screens were $1 each (the equivalent of at least $25 in 2010 dollars).

The process which makes use of this black printer is known as gray-component replacement. Developed from {{the extension of the}} undercolor removal process, the use of gray-component replacement in printing halftone reproductions is said to result in numerous technical and cost benefits. When used to the maximum, the process eliminates one of the three process color inks in a given unit area and prints black ink from highlight to shadow. A problem can result from the use of this process as it applies a greater amount of an opaque black ink in combination with selectively <b>transparent</b> colored <b>inks.</b> Where this black ink overprints {{one or more of the}} three colored inks there will be an increase in unwanted absorption and a decrease in the wanted absorption.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{emulsification}} process of lithographic ink and water was conducted to investigate methods for determining the water content of lithographic ink and water emulsions. Experiments using infra-red spectroscopy {{and analysis of the}} hydroxyl and carbonyl absorption bands revealed several variables which must be considered when attempting to use infra-red spectroscopic methods for the determination of the water content of ink emulsions. These factors include the choice of pigment, (either transparent or opaque), the type of cell medium, and methods for dispersing added water into an ink. The initial problem encountered was a lack of reproducibility when attempting to construct a calibration system. The carbonyl absorption band at 1745 cm^- 1 was shown to vary with each sample of emulsion. The intensity of the hydroxyl absorption band at 1645 cm^- 1 was discovered to be erratic between differing samples of ink and water emulsions. This resulted in hydroxyl contents which appeared to be inconsistent with known concentrations of water. The simulation of 2 ̆ 2 on-press 2 ̆ 2 emulsification, as it occurs in the lithographic process on an offset press, is a very important factor. The importance of added water attaining the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion is the prime criterion for valid and reproducible data obtained from infra-red spectroscopic analysis. This is accomplished by applying sufficient forces to generate an adequate rate of shear on the ink as added water is introduced into the emulsification process. The two modes of vibration of a water molecule were studied utilizing data obtained from infra-red spectra. The O-H stretching mode exhibited at 3400 cm^- 1 proved to be more sensitive to changes in water content of an ink than the bending mode exhibited at 1645 cm^- 1. Valid data used to construct a calibration system for water content determination of lithographic emulsions relies on the elimination of any moisture contamination of the cell medium used in the optics system of an infra-red spectrophotometer. Likewise, use of a <b>transparent</b> pigmented <b>ink</b> yields a continuous spectra. An opaque pigmented ink causes excessive light scattering resulting in off-scale deflections of absorption bands. Present methods of laboratory simulation of the emulsification of water into an ink were investigated to determine the optimum system which would yield stable ink and water emulsions in which the added water would assume the internal phase of the lithographic emulsion. Factors such as the rate of shear and time of dispersion were studied and found to significantly influence the formation of stable lithographic emulsions. Finally, the behavior of added water on the tack of an ink was also investigated. The tack values of a 2 ̆ 2 dry 2 ̆ 2 ink were closely monitored for extended periods of time. Immediate changes in tack were noted and recorded upon the addition of water. The addition of water to an ink in which the tack had apparently stabilized, effectively lowered the tack to the point where a homogeneous, stable emulsion was possible...|$|R
