The core contains fundamental, time-tested values and traditions. The <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> may include incoming and outgoing thoughts and ideas from such diverse sources as divine inspiration to planetary mass media.

50|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} {{of information that}} are processed by action performance. <b>Transient</b> <b>information</b> corresponds to intermediate results and is accessible for immediate use by the action. The data that comprises <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> encompasses the values given by expressions. If these values are not immediately used, they are lost. Scoped information corresponds to symbol tables and can be referenced from anywhere within the action and its sub-actions. It is also possible for such information to be hidden within a sub-action, via {{the creation of an}} inner scope, in which case it would be only locally accessible within that scope, to that sub-action. Stable information corresponds to values assigned to variables and can be modified in the action performance. Because alterations to storage during the performance of an action are persistent, only explicit actions can cause such modifications. In accordance with this, stable information is available until it is explicitly destroyed. And, unlike scoped information, it cannot be hidden. Permanent information corresponds to data exchanged between actions and can be extended but not modified. <b>Transient</b> <b>information</b> is produced only when an action completes or escapes, and scoped information is produced only when an action completes. The modification of stable information and the extension of permanent information must take place during action performance.|$|E

The work reported here addresses this need using shear horizontal {{surface acoustic wave}} (SH-SAW) sensors, which function effectively in the liquid phase. To achieve enhanced sensitivity and partial selectivity for hydrocarbons, the devices are coated with thin chemically sensitive polymer films. Various polymer materials are investigated {{with the goal of}} identifying a set of coatings suitable for a sensor array. The system is tested with compounds indicative of fuel and oil contamination, in particular, BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes), at relatively low concentrations. Of particular importance is benzene, a known carcinogen. Using responses of the SH-SAW sensor devices coated with three different polymer materials, benzene was quantified in the aqueous phase in the presence of other aromatic interferents. It is shown that various concentrations of BTEX in water can be identified and quantified by evaluation of both steady-state and <b>transient</b> response <b>information.</b> Key words: groundwater, fuel and oil contamination, surface acoustic wave sensors, liquid-phase sensing, benzene, <b>transient</b> response <b>information...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} function, neurons require energy which is {{supplied}} by blood flow. Although {{it is not}} completely understood, the hemodynamic response has been correlated with neuronal activity, that is, as the activity level increases, the amount of blood used by neurons increases. This response takes several seconds to completely develop. Accordingly, fMRI has limited temporal resolution. The hemodynamic response {{is the basis for}} the BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) contrast in fMRI. The hemodynamic response occurs within seconds of the presented stimuli, but it is essential to space out the events {{in order to ensure that}} the response being measured is from the event that was presented and not from a prior event. Presenting stimuli in a more rapid sequence allows experimenters to run more trials and gather more data, but this is limited by the slow course of hemodynamic response, which generally must be allowed to return baseline before the presentation of another stimulus. According to Burock “as the presentation rate increases in the random event related design, the variance in the signal increases thereby increasing the <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> and ability to estimate the underlying hemodynamic response”.|$|E
50|$|An action entity {{has five}} {{different}} facets, one for processing {{that does not}} rely on information, and four for processing {{each of the four}} different types of information. The basic facet, an example of which would be control flows, is not tied to information of any kind. The functional facet deals with the processing of <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> and is characterized by actions giving and accepting data. The declarative facet deals with the processing of scoped information and is characterized by actions creating and receiving bindings. The imperative facet deals with the processing of stable information and is characterized by actions allocating and freeing storage cells, and fetching and modifying the data stored in them. The communicative facet deals with processing permanent information and is characterized by actions sending and receiving messages and “offering contracts to agents.” There are two different kinds of actions in terms of their effect on the information in each facet. Primitive actions only affect the information in one facet. Action combinators permit actions that involve multiple facets, governing how control and information flows for each facet involved in a combined action. In combining actions, action combinators governor the sequencing of sub-action performances and the incoming and outgoing flows of data for each sub-action.|$|E

40|$|Instructional dynamic {{pictures}} (animations and videos) contain <b>transient</b> visual <b>information.</b> Consequently, when {{learning from}} dynamic pictures, students must process in working memory the current images {{while trying to}} remember the images that left the screen. This additional activity in working memory may lead dynamic pictures to be less suitable instructional materials than comparable static pictures, which are more permanent. In order to directly show the influence of <b>transient</b> visual <b>information</b> on dynamic learning environments, we designed a well-matched comparison between a permanent and a transient presentation of an abstract-symbol memory task on the computer. In the task, 104 university students (50 % females) had to memorize the type, color, and position of the symbols in a rectangular configuration. In addition, an embodied cognition factor was included where the symbols in the task were either shown with a precision grasping static hand or not. We also assessed how individual characteristics (spatial ability, spatial memory span, and gender) influenced performance. Results showed that (a) permanent outperformed transient presentations, (b) observing hands hindered learning, and (c) high spatial ability and high spatial memory span were beneficial, but gender did not affect performance...|$|R

Otherwise, the transient is designated as a step transient and no separate modeling is applied. Instead, the <b>transient</b> position <b>information</b> is used in the sinusoidal and noise analysis for window adaptation.|$|R

40|$|When using modern {{educational}} technology, {{some forms}} of instruction are inherently transient in that previous information usually disappears {{to be replaced by}} current information. Instructional animations and spoken text provide examples. The effects of transience due to the use of animation-based instructions (Experiment 1) and spoken information under audio-visual conditions (Experiment 2) were explored in a cognitive load theory framework. It was hypothesized that for <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> presented in short sections, animations would be superior to static graphics, due to our innate ability to learn by observing. For <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> in long sections, animations should lose their superiority over static graphics, due to working memory overload associated with large amounts of <b>transient</b> <b>information.</b> Similarly, the modality effect under which audio-visual information is superior to visual only information should be obtainable using short segments but disappear or reverse using longer segments due to the working memory consequences of long, transient, auditory information.

40|$|We analyze how {{difficult}} it is to synchronize to a periodic sequence whose structure is known, when an observer is initially unaware of the sequence's phase. We examine the <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> T, a recently introduced information-theoretic quantity that measures the uncertainty an observer experiences while synchronizing to a sequence. We also consider the synchronization time tau, which is the average number of measurements required to infer the phase of a periodic signal. We calculate T and tau for all periodic sequences up to and including period 23. We show which sequences of a given period have the maximum and minimum possible T and tau values, develop analytic expressions for the extreme values, and show that in these cases the <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> is the product of the total phase information and the synchronization time. Despite the latter result, our analyses demonstrate that the <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> and synchronization time capture different and complementary structural properties of individual periodic sequences [...] properties, moreover, that are distinct from source entropy rate and mutual information measures, such as the excess entropy.

40|$|Non-intrusive load {{monitoring}} (NILM), {{the problem}} of disaggregating whole home power measurements into single-appliance measurements, has received increasing attention from the academic community because of its energy saving potentials, however the majority of NILM approaches are either variants of event-based or event-less disaggregation. Event-based approaches are able to capture much information about the transient behavior of appliances but suffer from error-propagation problems whereas event-less approaches are lessprone to error-propagation problems but can only incorporate <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> to a small degree. On top of that inference techniques for event-less approaches are either computationally expensive, do not allow to trade off computational time for approximation accuracy or are prone to local minima. This work will contribute three-fold: first an automated way to infer ground truth from single appliance readings is introduced, second an augmentation for event-less approaches is introduced that allows to capture side-channel as well as <b>transient</b> <b>information</b> of change-points, third an inference technique is presented that allows to control the trade-off between computational expense and accuracy. Ultimately, this work will try to put the NILM problem into a probabilistic framework that allows for closing feedback loops between the different stages of event-based NILM approaches, effectively bridging event-less and event-based approaches. The performance of the inference technique is evaluated on a synthetic data set and compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
