5000|$|Don Yoder {{argued that}} there were five {{separate}} ways of defining folk religion. The first was a perspective rooted in a cultural evolutionary framework which understood folk religion as representing <b>the</b> <b>survivals</b> of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute [...] "the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development". This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as <b>the</b> <b>survivals</b> of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as <b>the</b> <b>survivals</b> of Medieval Catholicism. The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of indigenous American and African communities.|$|R

5|$|Resident Evil 4 redefined <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> horror genre by {{emphasizing}} reflexes and precision aiming, thus broadening the gameplay {{of the series}} with elements from the wider action game genre. However, this also led some reviewers {{to suggest that the}} Resident Evil series had abandoned <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit, by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill Homecoming and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes represent an overall trend among console games shifting towards visceral action gameplay. While working on The Last of Us, Naughty Dog took cues from Resident Evil 4, particularly the tension and action.|$|E
