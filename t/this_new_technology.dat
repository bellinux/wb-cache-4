5|$|During {{tests with}} the Ju 87 A-2, new {{technologies}} were tried out {{to reduce the}} effects of g forces. The pressurised cabin was of great importance during this research. Testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2 g could cause death in an unpressurised cabin and without appropriate clothing. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology,</b> along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested. When the United States Army occupied the Junkers factory at Dessau on 21 April 1945, they were both impressed at and interested in the medical flight tests with the Ju 87.|$|E
5|$|Steam engines {{appeared}} in the United States {{as a source of}} power in the late 18th century, and living in Delaware and Philadelphia meant Evans was exposed to early examples of their application there. John Fitch had launched the first rudimentary steamboat onto the Delaware River in the late 1780s, and the Philadelphia waterworks was by 1802 operating two low-pressure steam engines to pump water from the Schuylkill River, but these were rare examples and most instances of <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> were to be found in Europe. Much of the development of steam power had occurred in Great Britain, with Thomas Newcomen and James Watt instrumental in developing and commercializing steam power there and elsewhere in Europe, with several hundred of machines operating there in industrial and labor-saving applications by 1800.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tesla Motors, almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they {{play a crucial role}} in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can have a big impact on how someone feels about a prospective purchase. Sales people have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars while they do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales. As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York {{worked to}} expand telegraphic {{communication}} through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a telegraph line he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new telegraph {{was an instant}} hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the New York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This new system would relieve this issue.|$|E

The article presents the concepts, basic principles and architectural survey phases with DSM: planning, data acquisition, processing and post-processing to obtain other products from point cloud data. Then, we present several existing software for DSM, classified in three categories: web-based tools, free software/opensource and commercial software. Finally, we discuss the potentialities of <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> for architectural documentation and compare DSM with 3 D laser scanning...|$|R

25|$|The 1986 Corvette saw the {{reintroduction}} of {{the convertible}} {{and was named}} as the Pace Car for the Indianapolis 500. 1986 also saw {{the introduction of the}} Pass Key I passive anti-theft system, wherein each key contained a special pellet that could be detected and identified by the car's computer system by detecting electrical resistance.

Other enhancements include satellite navigation, communications equipment, modern facilities for the crew (kitchen, lavatories, washing machines, desalination equipment, ventilation, refrigerators), watertight bulkheads and fire protection (fire sprinkler systems, fire hydrants etc.).

25|$|Despite the {{technology}} being available, it wasn't until the 1950s, when curved shapes such as conoids and hyperbolic parabolas became fashionable, that glue laminated arches were {{more commonly used}} in Australia, particularly for church structures.

St Paul's was completed first, with engineering details for both buildings provided by Cairns engineer R McLean.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} century {{refrigeration}} allowed new settlement patterns to emerge. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> has allowed for new areas to be settled that are not on a natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbor that may have otherwise not been settled. Refrigeration has given opportunities to early settlers to expand westward and into rural areas that were unpopulated. These new settlers with rich and untapped soil saw opportunity to profit by sending raw goods to the eastern cities and states. In the 20th century, refrigeration has made “Galactic Cities” such as Dallas, Phoenix and Los Angeles possible.|$|E
25|$|Then between 1986 and 1989, new {{techniques}} were brought into play {{to combine the}} signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one, more powerful signal, {{in a kind of}} an antenna array. This was done at Goldstone, California, Canberra, and Madrid using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, the Parkes Radio Telescope was brought into the array in time for the fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, the Very Large Array in New Mexico was brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone. Using <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth.|$|E
