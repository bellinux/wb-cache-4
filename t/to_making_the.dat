5|$|After {{returning}} {{her guests}} to New York, West Alsek sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, for operation by the Oriole Line. She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on pulverized coal to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed that in addition <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage.

5|$|Hansen {{played his}} first full season with the Canucks in 2008–09, making the roster out {{training}} camp and establishing himself as a third-line forward. He became known as a player for his speed and work ethic, lending to his effectiveness in puck-pursuit and forechecking. Also responsible defensively, he began to be used consistently on the penalty kill. Hansen has recalled {{the transition to the}} NHL requiring a change in his style of play to incorporate more physicality and abrasiveness. Prior <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> NHL, he relied more on skill and finesse, having been a go-to offensive player for teams up to that point.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density had no effect on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive encounters.|$|E
5|$|John died in 1216 and was {{succeeded by}} his nine-year-old son, Henry, {{with the support}} of the barons. With no {{prospect}} of becoming King of England, Louis returned to France. Rochester Castle was returned to royal control in 1217. Given the damage incurred during John's siege, the castle was in dire need of repairs. Between 1217 and 1237 around £680 were spent on repairs, of which £530 were taken up by work on the keep. In 1225 and 1226 the town walls were enhanced by the addition of a ditch at the cost of £300. The new ditch enclosed Boley Hill, possibly to deny the position to future aggressors who might attack the castle. Repairs began with the castle's outer curtain wall. At the same time a chapel was built within the castle. In 1226 the hall, buttery, and dispensary were repaired. Work probably did not begin on the keep until 1226. It was mostly repaired by 1227, but work continued on it until 1232. During 1230 and 1231 a stone wall dividing the castle's enclosure into two parts was built which no longer survives. While attention was paid <b>to</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> castle a working fortification, Henry III also funded construction of residential and other buildings. In 1244, £132 was spent on building a second chapel next to the royal apartments. Stables and an almonry were added in 1248. The main gatehouse was rebuilt between 1249 and 1250 at a cost of over £120. Further repairs were carried out on the keep in 1256, this time costing more than £120. Later in the decade further attention was paid to the castle's defences, possibly in response to HenryIII's worsening relations with his barons.|$|E
