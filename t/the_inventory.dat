5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several components of <b>the</b> <b>inventory,</b> including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are {{a total of}} eighty slots for carrying items in <b>the</b> <b>inventory,</b> spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from <b>the</b> <b>inventory</b> once they have been acquired. The player can access <b>the</b> <b>inventory</b> by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to <b>the</b> <b>inventory,</b> and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating monsters like zombies, undead dogs, and giant spiders. The player can open doors, push certain objects, climb obstacles, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory that the player can access at any time. Items in <b>the</b> <b>inventory</b> can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. <b>The</b> <b>inventory</b> is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from <b>the</b> <b>inventory</b> to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space.|$|E

A sample of 356 individuals from the UK working population completed various combinations of <b>the</b> five <b>inventories.</b> Overall, <b>the</b> results indicated sensible and interpretable factor structures for <b>the</b> <b>inventories.</b> Cross-inventory factor analyses of the extracted factors revealed {{a variant of the}} Big Five model underpinning them, enabling examination of inventory convergence and divergence.

5|$|Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the protagonist Jill Valentine from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment and enemies. Aside from Jill, the player takes control of another character for a brief portion of the game. To advance through the game, the player has to explore a city while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating various types of enemies. The player can interact with the environment in several ways, such as opening doors, pushing objects or climbing obstacles. Scattered throughout the city are weapons, ammunition and other items, which can be collected and put in the player's inventory. Items can be examined, used, or combined with others. <b>The</b> <b>inventory</b> is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from <b>the</b> <b>inventory</b> to a storage box located in special rooms to manage space.|$|E

5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>inventory,</b> {{but they have been}} lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the optimal control in a failure prone manufacturing system. A discrete-time model is used. A single commodity is produced {{and there is}} a constant demand. The optimal control policy minimizes the long run average cost incurred by holding inventory and by failing to meet the demand. We show that the optimal control policy in any finite horizon problem is characterized by a critical number, which we call <b>the</b> ideal <b>inventory</b> level (or hedging point). The system should not produce at all if <b>the</b> resulting <b>inventory</b> level exceeds <b>the</b> ideal <b>inventory</b> level, and it should produce at full capacity if <b>the</b> resulting <b>inventory</b> level is less than <b>the</b> ideal <b>inventory</b> level, it should produce exactly enough to meet <b>the</b> ideal <b>inventory</b> level if <b>the</b> ideal <b>inventory</b> level is attainable. We also show that <b>the</b> ideal <b>inventory</b> level increases and converges to a finite value as the horizon length increases. This implies that the optimal control policy in the infinite horizon problem is also characterized by a critical number...|$|R

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like <b>the</b> <b>inventory</b> system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic.

5|$|Henry's {{only means}} of {{communication}} is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah.

5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As <b>the</b> <b>inventory</b> management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, <b>the</b> <b>inventory</b> needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E
