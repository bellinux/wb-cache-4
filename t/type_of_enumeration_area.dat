30|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} pathways to invisibility have been identified. These include poor definitions and poorly specified instructions to enumerators, forced congregation with the onus to be enumerated placed on the respondent, data collected on far fewer characteristics of individuals and their household, collection of data which are ill adapted to measuring poverty and wealth of mobile pastoralists, categorisations which fail to capture key elements of mobile pastoral well-being and adaptations such as split and flexible households, lack of published tables, inability to identify from the data - and particularly from published tables - the particular characteristics of mobile pastoralists, specific <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>enumeration</b> <b>area</b> enabling easy exclusion from sampling frames, deliberate exclusion from most sample surveys, and the temporal disjunction between the cartography and the interviewing phases of a survey meaning that mobile groups {{are unlikely to be}} identified in both. These are coupled with a more general spatial and political marginalisation in many countries which means that pastoral nomads are far less likely to be schooled and to have good contact with administrative services, and thus fundamental data, such as age, which are collected, are likely to be less accurate than for other populations.|$|R
40|$|U. S. {{population}} in Census 2000, the U. S. Census Bureau conducted the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A. C. E.). The A. C. E. included {{various stages of}} sampling. An initial A. C. E. sample of block clusters was drawn, and housing units within the sampled block clusters were listed. Then, the A. C. E. sample was reduced through subsampling operations (Childers and Fenstermaker, 2000). The A. C. E. uses dual-system estimation to measure coverage error. The dual system estimation method assumes there are two independent lists of the population. The first list is the original census enumerations in the A. C. E. clusters, {{and the second is}} a list of those covered by the sampling frame for the A. C. E. sample (Hogan, 2000). The independence assumption can fail due to causal dependence, or conditioning of Census 2000 data collected in A. C. E. block clusters. This can also be referred to as contamination. Contamination occurs when the event of an individual’s inclusion or exclusion from one list affects the probability of their inclusion in the other list (Mulry and Spencer, 1991). Research undertaken on the 1990 census and on test censuses leading up to Census 2000 mostly show that we have not experienced contamination in the past between the census and the coverage measurement survey (Davis, 1990; Hawala, 1999).

30|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Nigeria using survey design. The survey was conducted in three states. Kano State, Anambra State, and Lagos State, which were considered high and medium risk areas for bird flu introduction and transmission based on the risk maps developed in the project. There are seven states classified as high and medium bird flu disease risk in terms of transmission and introduction. The high risk areas are Kano State, Borono State, Sokoto State, Lagos State, while medium risk areas are Anambra, Rivers, and Kastina. All other states in Nigeria are classified as low risk areas in bird flu introduction and transmission (National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) 2014, AICP (2014)). The choice of these three states were informed {{based on the fact that}} population of poultry producers in these states accounted for 67.5 % of poultry producers in Nigeria (2013). In addition, the incidence of bird flu accounted for 80 % of the entire disease incidence in Nigeria (NBS, 2014). Following the UNDP (2007) definitions of poultry production system, Nigeria poultry industry is classified into four production systems (backyard/free-range (BY), and small-scale (SS), and medium-scale (MS), and large-scale (LS). The sampling frame constitutes the entire household in the selected states. In fact, 97 and 75 % of household in rural and urban Nigeria rear/own poultry, respectively (Obi et al. 2009). A complete listing of housing units and households in each selected <b>enumeration</b> <b>area</b> provided the frames of households (HHs) for the second stage selection in selected EAs. The total <b>of</b> 30 <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> were sampled in each state based on poultry population, which was provided by poultry association of Nigeria (PAN) and Avian Influenza Control Project Office (AICP) in each of the selected states. Given the focus of the project was on the poor, the distribution <b>of</b> <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> was skewed to rural <b>areas.</b> Therefore, 23 <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> were selected in rural areas or peri-urban <b>areas</b> and 7 <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> were selected in urban areas.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the impact of {{remittances}} from labour migrants on welfare, as well as the impact of the use of equivalence scales on poverty, in Tajikistan. The magnitude of remittances sent back is fairly well known from official statistics (e. g. the amount of remittances is regularly monitored by the balance of payment at the Central Bank). In 2009 a change in the flow of money from abroad occurred, and volumes dropped, but it was unknown to what extent; its impact on poverty is still officially unknown. This paper describes a project aimed at conducting a survey to investigate this impact. It would not be possible to do this kind of analysis with a traditional sample survey, since it would generate only a small selection of migrant households. Instead, the new Migration, Remittances and Poverty Survey was used, which was conducted by the Tajik State Statistical Office in August 2010 using an adaptive sampling design from a set <b>of</b> <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> selected mainly from the 2009 Integrated Household Budget Survey (IHBS) and showing households with remittances.

The sample was first stratified to provide adequate representation of urban and rural areas, as well as all regions and districts. Then, the sample was selected in two stages. The first stage involved selecting primary sampling units (PSUs), also called clusters, based on the list <b>of</b> <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> (EAs) created in the 2004 Sierra Leone General Population and Housing Census. The <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> provided the master frame for drawing 435 clusters (277 rural and 158 urban), selected with a probability proportional to their size.

Methods: Cross-sectional survey 6 months after the Israeli attack. Households were selected by cluster sampling in two stages: a random sample <b>of</b> <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> (EAs) and a random sample of households within each chosen EA. One randomly chosen adult from each of 3017 households included in the survey completed the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument, in addition to reported information on distress, insecurities and threats. Results: Mean HRQoL score (range 0 GÇô 100) for the physical domain was 69. 7, followed by the psychological (59. 8) and the environmental domain score (48. 4). Predictors of lower (worse) scores for all three domains were: lower educational levels, residence in rural areas, destruction to one's private property or high levels of distress and suffering. Worse physical and psychological domain scores were reported by people who were older and those living in North Gaza governorate. Worse physical and environmental domain scores were reported by people with no one working at home, and those with worse standard of living levels. Respondents who reported suffering stated that the main causes were the ongoing siege, the latest war on the Strip and internal Palestinian factional violence.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{baseline}} {{to assess}} {{impact of a}} mass education-entertainment programme offered an opportunity to identify risk factors for domestic physical violence. Methods In 2002, cross-sectional household surveys in a stratified urban/rural last-stage random sample <b>of</b> <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas,</b> based on latest national census in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Working door to door, interviewers contacted all adults aged 16 – 60 years present {{on the day of}} the visit, without sub-sampling. 20, 639 adults were interviewed. The questionnaire in 29 languages measured domestic physical violence by the question "In the last year, have you and your partner had violent arguments where your partner beat, kicked or slapped you?" There was no measure of severity or frequency of physical violence. Results 14 % of men (weighted based on 1, 294 / 8, 113) and 18 % of women (weighted based on 2, 032 / 11, 063) reported being a victim of partner physical violence in the last year. There was no convincing association with age, income, education, household size and remunerated occupation. Having multiple partners was strongly associated with partner physical violence. Other associations included the income gap within households, negative attitudes about sexuality (for example, men have the right to sex with their girlfriends if they buy them gifts) and negative attitudes about sexual violence (for example, forcing your partner to have sex is not rape). Particularly among men, experience of partner physical violence was associated with potentially dangerous attitudes to HIV infection. Conclusion Having multiple partners was the most consistent risk factor for domestic physical violence across all countries. This could be relevant to domestic violence prevention strategies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Access {{to quality}} obstetric care is {{considered}} essential to reducing maternal and new-born mortality. We evaluated {{the effect of}} the introduction of a multifaceted voluntary health insurance programme on hospital deliveries in rural Nigeria. Methods: We used an interrupted time-series design, including a control group. The intervention consisted of providing voluntary health insurance covering primary and secondary healthcare, including antenatal and obstetric care, combined with improving the quality of healthcare facilities. We compared changes in hospital deliveries from 1 May 2005 to 30 April 2013 between the programme area and control area in a difference-in-differences analysis with multiple time periods, adjusting for observed confounders. Data were collected through household surveys. Eligible households (n = 1500) were selected from a stratified probability sample <b>of</b> <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas.</b> All deliveries during the 4 -year baseline period (n = 460) and 4 -year follow-up period (n = 380) were included. Findings: Insurance coverage increased from 0 % before the insurance was introduced to 70. 2 % in April 2013 in the programme area. In the control area insurance coverage remained 0 % between May 2005 and April 2013. Although hospital deliveries followed a common stable trend over the 4 pre-programme years (P = 0. 89), the increase in hospital deliveries during the 4 -year follow-up period in the programme area was 29. 3 percentage points (95 % CI: 16. 1 to 42. 6; P < 0. 001) greater than the change in the control area (intention-to-treat impact), corresponding to a relative increase in hospital deliveries of 62 %. Women who did not enroll in health insurance but who could make use of the upgraded care delivered significantly more often in a hospital during the follow-up period than women living in the control area (P = 0. 04).

Three <b>enumeration</b> metods are discussed, with specific attention for the implementation aspects. The enumeration methods considered are the ordinary lexicographical enumeration, the memory saving enumeration as proposed by Zahorjan and Wong, and the enumeration for the case we consider a queuing network with a constraint on the total population size, rather than with constraints {{on the number of}} clients included in each of the individual client types...|$|R
40|$|External number {{representations}} {{are commonly}} used throughout {{the first years of}} instruction. The twenty-frame is a grid that contains two rows of 10 dots each, and within each row, dots are organized in two groups of five. The assumption is that children can make use of these structures for enumerating the dots, rather than relying on one-by-one counting. We compared first-grade children's performance on two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> computerized <b>enumeration</b> tasks, in which between one and 20 dots were presented in random arrangements or on a twenty-frame. The number of dots was a strong predictor of response times and accuracy rates in the enumeration task with random arrangements but not in the twenty-frame task. Performance on the twenty-frame task was correlated with performance on a number and arithmetic test, even when other cognitive variables were statistically controlled. We discuss these findings in the light of theories on utilizing external representations to support numerical learning. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|The {{classification}} of mobile (or even not so mobile) pastoralists in Tanzanian censuses highlights the Tanzanian government’s attitude towards them: their ‘special’ <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> differ from ‘normal’ <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas.</b> They are grouped with, but slightly separate from institutional or collective populations and the homeless, but as special EAs, {{they could never}} be selected to receive the ‘long questionnaire’ which collects socio-economic, housing and living standards data. Not only {{does this mean that}} their characteristics were inevitably missing from all censuses but also that their (special) <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> could not be selected for the national sampling frame and thus for all subsequent national data collection exercises.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} distribution and ecological correlates of referrals {{of children and adolescents}} to the Regional Children 2 ̆ 7 s Centre, a psychological assessment and treatment centre located in Windsor, Ontario. Referral data for the study were collected by the Regional Children 2 ̆ 7 s Centre for the study period April, 1992 through March, 1994. Referral rates were calculated at the <b>enumeration</b> <b>area</b> level for various 2 ̆ 7 diagnostic 2 ̆ 7 and demographic sub-groups. The spatial distribution of referrals was assessed using the Poisson probability test. This test revealed that, for each sub-group analysed, the distribution of referrals in the study area was non-random. The socio-ecological structure of the study area was derived using a principal components analysis of a set of socio-economic indicator variables from the 1991 Census of Canada and a cluster analysis <b>of</b> component scores. <b>Enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> were aggregated as like socio-economic areas {{on the basis of the}} cluster analysis results, and the Poisson probability test was used to assess the distribution of the referrals with respect to the clusters derived. Once again, results of this test revealed that the distribution of referrals in the study area was not a result of some random process. Step-wise multiple correlation-regression revealed a significant ecological relationship between referral rates and the socio-ecological structure of the study area. This relationship was not found, however, when examining referrals for neurophysiologically based concerns. Dept. of Geography.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} of geographic information systems (GIS) technology for possible introduction into {{the analysis of the}} population census of Kenya. It does so from a starting point of no digital mapping being used at present, and no staff trained in the technology. The one year research programme had a number of aims which would underwrite a fuller evaluation of GIS back in Kenya; to(i) evaluate the training implications in GIS. (ii) evaluate the quality and usefulness of base maps produced by the Kenya Statistics office, with a view to automating them for subsequent digital mapping. (iii) achieve capability and understanding of concepts in the process largely referred to as "digital mapping”. The 1989 census was the first to map the country to the level of Villages which are small subdivisions <b>of</b> the Sub-Locations. <b>Enumeration</b> <b>Areas</b> were based on these Villages. The 1989 census field work was the most detailed of all previous censuses. About 4000 Sub-Location maps or <b>Enumeration</b> <b>Area</b> maps were prepared for the census. They were used to produce the required copies for the Enumerators and Supervisors who participated in the census <b>enumeration.</b> The preparation <b>of</b> the District maps for digitising e. g. tracing, identifying and fixing reference points; digitising and editing the coverages; transforming the coverages; and updating the coverage data files took approximately five months. Using this database a population density map was produced. The study has proved the feasibility of full computer mapping for the analysis of the 1989 Kenya population census. It provides a basis {{for the development of a}} full GIS capability. Further, the cartographic information from Kenya, while having limitations, has been combined and integrated to provide a national coverage. Census data, already in the computer form, are relatively easily integrated into the GIS database...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} centred on {{informal}} entrepreneurship, an age-old economic endeavour and {{an integral part}} of economic activity in Zamfara, Nigeria. The aim is to evaluate informal entrepreneurship in terms of its nature and character; the reasons why different groups participate in it; and potential policy measures which could improve the conditions of entrepreneurs in the sector and facilitate the growth of their informal firms, and encourage their voluntary and gradual formalisation. The study adopted a nested two-stage survey method research design for the data collection (household and enterprise surveys). The household survey sample consisted <b>of</b> 75 <b>enumeration</b> <b>areas</b> drawn from nine localities cutting across rural, suburban and urban localities, while the enterprise survey comprised of 215 participants as a sub-sample of the first stage survey. On the nature and character of informal entrepreneurship, the study reveals that this phenomenon is highly heterogeneous and widely spread among different sectors of the economy with a considerable participation by both males and females. Also, empirical evidence from the study suggests the participants were regulated informally by their trade associations, contrary to the conventional belief that the sector is wholly unregulated. Adopting an eclectic theoretical approach, the study provides insights on the drivers of informal entrepreneurship from three theories with wider application in the field: theories of informal economy, institutional theory, and theory of motives of informal entrepreneurship. These are relevant in explaining the rationale for engagement in the activity and suggest the co-existence of multiple logics and the interplay of inter-institutional systems for engaging in informal entrepreneurship. The study further suggests that almost two thirds of informal entrepreneurs (64...|$|R
