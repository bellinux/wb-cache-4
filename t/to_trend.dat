25|$|Missouri {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a bellwether in American politics, often making it a swing state. The state had a longer stretch of supporting the winning presidential candidate than any other state, having voted with the nation in every election from 1904 to 2004 with a single exception: 1956, when Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson of neighboring Illinois lost the election despite carrying Missouri. The state's status as a bellwether has been questioned in recent years, as Missouri twice voted against Democrat Barack Obama, who nonetheless widely prevailed in the 2008 and 2012 elections. Missouri's nearly 10% margin in favor of the losing Mitt Romney in 2012 suggests the state is starting <b>to</b> <b>trend</b> more Republican in presidential contests.|$|E

500|$|He {{returned}} to international cricket in September 2007 for the inaugural World Twenty20, {{where he took}} three wickets and was man of the match as India beat Pakistan in the final. This earned him a recall into the ODI team, {{where he was a}} regular for most of the next 12 months before being dropped as his economy rate continued <b>to</b> <b>trend</b> upwards and subsequently struggled with a loss of form and injuries. In late-2007 Pathan was also recalled into the Test team after 19 months and hit his maiden Test century, but could not maintain his place in the team as his bowling was not effective enough with only two pacemen needed. Pathan played his last Test for India in April 2008 against South Africa. He continued to perform with both bat and ball at the domestic level, although his sedate pace is frequently criticized as being irrelevant at the international level. However, he impressed during the 2011–12 Ranji Trophy, where he was the leading wicket-taker, and his performances earned him a recall to the national side again.|$|E

In the video, PewDiePie shows his reaction to a duo he had paid to display the message [...] "DEATH TO ALL JEWS" [...] on a sign, as a joke and attempt to highlight the ridiculous things which can be provided as a paid service on the Internet. He immediately apologised within the same video stating, [...] "I am sorry. I didn't think they would actually do it.

[...] PewDiePie received criticism from some users in the video's comment section, {{as well as from}} some media outlets. As a result of this video, both PewDiePie and the duo were banned from Fiverr, prompting the latter to upload an apology video stating that they did not understand the meaning of the sign, and that they were sorry to all Jews.|$|E

40|$|Population {{monitoring}} programs {{perform an}} essential function in conservation, perceiving trends {{that are critical}} to understanding extinction risk. A key element of such a program includes identifying necessary sample effort needed <b>to</b> detect a <b>trend</b> if one is present. To explore the efficiency and accuracy of these techniques <b>to</b> detect <b>trends,</b> I simulated population dynamics in biennial plant populations, and used different techniques to sample those populations <b>to</b> measure <b>trends</b> in abundance. I found that count-based survey techniques can have high power <b>to</b> detect <b>trends</b> in plant populations, but underlying population characteristics affect the ability <b>to</b> perceive negative <b>trends.</b> Decreasing density, increasing aggregation, and decreasing sample size, reduce power <b>to</b> detect <b>trends.</b> Sampling design attributes, including sample size, sample frequency {{and the use of}} repeated measures, can moderate these effects and increase statistical power. My results emphasize the need to invest in preliminary data on variability in abundance, as well as population distribution. Such an investment allows managers to choose sample designs that optimize the ability <b>to</b> detect a <b>trends,</b> as well as limited sampling resources...|$|R
