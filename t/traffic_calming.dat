5|$|The plan {{included}} narrowing 3rd Avenue from four-lanes westbound {{towards the}} Robert C.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> measures on these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} the Fulton Avenue roundabout.|$|E

The two streets are directly comparable apart from their design qualities. One has been <b>traffic</b> <b>calmed</b> and the other has had home zone features applied to one section. This work found that residents stayed in the home zoned section of the street for relatively long periods, engaging in optional activities and also socializing.

5|$|On the mainland, SR 160 {{once again}} runs atop the east levee, now 1–2 miles (1.5–3km) west of Interstate 5. The final {{bridge over the}} river is the Freeport Bridge, which carries County Route E9 to the west levee, where it turns south to return to SR 160 at {{the west end of}} the Paintersville Bridge. About a mile (1.5km) beyond the Freeport Bridge, SR 160 leaves the levee, enters the city of Sacramento (where state {{maintenance}} and control ends), passes under I-5, and farms give way to suburbs. Here the former SR 160 is known as Freeport Boulevard, a major surface road that passes the Sacramento Executive Airport and Sacramento City College. Freeport Boulevard turns to the northwest at about 4th Avenue. It was formerly a one-way pair with 21st Street with Freeport heading one-way southbound and 21st heading one-way northbound. The city converted these streets back to two-way streets for <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> purposes in 2008. After a short jog west on Broadway, former SR 160 turns north on the one-way pair of 15th (southbound) and 16th (northbound) Streets, almost immediately crossing Business 80 and entering downtown Sacramento.|$|E

25|$|More recently, in {{response}} to growing numbers of traffic accidents and speeding problems, cities across North America have begun creating <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> programs to improve safety and liveability on residential streets.

25|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>calming</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} used for decades in cities across Europe. For example, a living street (sometimes known as home zones or by the Dutch word woonerf, as the concept originated in the Netherlands) {{towards the end of}} the 1960s, initially in Delft, is a street in which the needs of car drivers are secondary to the needs of users of the street as a whole; <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> principles are integrated into their design. From the Netherlands, application spread rapidly to Germany, starting in North-Rhine Westphalia in 1976, becoming very widespread by the early 1980s. The ideas and techniques also spread to the UK {{towards the end of the}} 1980s, and practice there was advocated by academics such as Tim Pharaoh and Carmen Hass-Klau. The guidelines published by Devon County Council (of which Tim Pharaoh was the principal author) in 1991 were particularly well received.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Although {{there are}} no {{legislations}} governing the installation of speed humps in Taiwan, their existence is of need in certain road sections, in particular, <b>traffic</b> <b>calm</b> areas. This study compares the effectiveness of single and tandem speed humps in speed reduction. Data collected include {{the distance from the}} speed humps where drivers brake to reduce speed, which would shed light on the effective area of speed humps. Difference in speed reduced by single and tandem speed humps are also determined by the before-after study to compare the effectiveness of these two types of speed humps in speed reduction. The results reveal that speed humps are effective in reducing speed and that tandem speed humps are more effective than single speed humps in speed reduction. The findings in this study can be useful references for traffic engineering and can serve as guidelines for deciding which type of humps to be installed on certain road sections...|$|R
40|$|To {{provide for}} peoples {{needs in the}} future, further {{improvements}} of the road network are a necessity. Simultaneously, harmful effects of this network on both local inhabitants and {{the flora and fauna}} become more penetrating. So, sustainable land use planning creates a great challenge for rural road network planning. To serve interests of both accessibility and a sustainable environment, a new planning approach must be developed. This approach also should tackle the problem of traffic unsafety on minor rural roads. The spatial concept of the <b>Traffic</b> <b>Calmed</b> Rural Area (TCRA) is presented as a solution to the dilemma between improving accessibility and damaging the environment. The concept will result in a concentration of present diffuse flows at the minor rural roads at a few trunk roads. So, traffic volumes and speeds within the region will decrease. For two regions, several impacts of the TCRA concept (on volumes, accessibility and environment) are calculat...|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} visual changes to roads {{are being made}} to {{encourage}} more attentive driving, reduced speed, reduced crashes, and a greater tendency to yield to pedestrians.

25|$|Speed {{cushions}} {{have several}} distinct advantages over similar <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> devices. Many municipalities are challenged by opposition to speed humps and speed tables since they slow down emergency vehicles. Speed cushions {{address this problem}} by allowing larger vehicles to straddle the cushion without slowing down. This is also an advantage for buses, as lower floor vehicles can sometimes ground out on traditional humps.|$|E
25|$|A {{speed hump}} (also called a road hump, or undulation, and speed ramp) is a rounded <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> device {{used to reduce}} vehicle speed and volume on {{residential}} streets.

Common speed hump shapes are parabolic, circular, and sinusoidal.|$|E
