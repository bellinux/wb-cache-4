5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> {{refused to}} {{cooperate}} with the investigation, accusing the UN Human Rights Council of anti-Israel bias and arguing that the report could not possibly be fair.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{residents}} of Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally {{allowed to enter}} the Temple Mount and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced {{on the occasion of}} Friday prayers, other times they are {{over an extended period of}} time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of the arch along the western wall of the Temple Mount, yet {{at a distance from}} the Western Wall plaza, has prompted <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>Government</b> to allow the area to be used for alternative (non-Orthodox)services.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969, they claimed {{citizenship}} under the Law of Return, which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> ruled in 1973 {{that the group}} did not qualify for automatic citizenship {{because they could not}} prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion. The Black Hebrews were denied work permits and state benefits. The group accused <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> of racist discrimination. In 1981, a group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' situation. No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were deported for working illegally.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. The {{majority of the}} Palestinian people view him as a heroic freedom fighter and martyr who symbolized the national aspirations of his people. Conversely, most Israelis came to regard him as an unrepentant terrorist, while Palestinian rivals, including Islamists and several PLO leftists, often denounced him for being corrupt or too submissive in his concessions to <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
50|$|The PSC led a {{campaign}} to block <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government's</b> tourism bureau from advertising in British newspapers, its argument being that Israel was misrepresenting Palestinian territories as its own.|$|R

5|$|In September 2012 <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> set {{up another}} inquiry {{at the request}} of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The team was led by Yossi Kuperwasser, {{director-general}} of the Strategic Affairs Ministry. In May 2013 it published a 44-page report concluding that the al-Durrahs had not been hit by IDF fire and may not have been shot at all.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1996, Benjamin Netanyahu {{was elected}} Prime Minister of Israel. Palestinian-Israeli {{relations}} grew even more hostile {{as a result}} of continued conflict. Despite the Israel-PLO accord, Netanyahu opposed the idea of Palestinian statehood. In 1998, US President Bill Clinton persuaded the two leaders to meet. The resulting Wye River Memorandum detailed the steps to be taken by <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> and PNA to complete the peace process.|$|E
5|$|After Israel {{captured}} East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, {{a number}} of plans were submitted {{for the design of}} a new building. After years of deliberation and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter. The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th-century style received approval by <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>Government</b> in 2000, and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15, 2010.|$|E

5|$|On December 23, 2016 {{under the}} Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, {{effectively}} {{allowing it to}} pass. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized the Administration's actions, and <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6million in United States dollars, on January 6, 2017. On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.|$|E
5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> to identify another Palestinian leader {{to represent the}} Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> {{and some}} Jewish groups {{strongly}} criticised the report, which they asserted was biased and commissioned by a UN body that was hostile to Israel. Hamas also dismissed the findings {{that it had}} committed war crimes. Goldstone himself came under sustained personal attack, with critics accusing him of bias, dishonesty and improper motives in being party to the report. Goldstone denied the accusations, saying he felt that being a Jew increased his obligation {{to participate in the}} investigation.|$|E

5|$|Brand {{testified in}} 1954 at the {{controversial}} libel trial in Jerusalem of Malchiel Gruenwald, who was sued by <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> {{on behalf of}} Rezső Kasztner. Gruenwald was a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who had moved to Israel after the war. In a self-published pamphlet in 1952 he accused Kasztner, by then an Israeli civil servant, of having collaborated with the Nazis by dealing with Eichmann. Brand testified for Kasztner, but instead of defending him {{took the opportunity to}} accuse the Jewish Agency, whose officials became the first Israeli government, of having helped the British scupper the blood-for-goods proposal.|$|E
5|$|Experienced and well-trained, 69 Squadron {{nevertheless}} {{entered the}} Yom Kippur War unready for the challenges {{brought about by}} start of the war. Prior to the outbreak of war, the IAF had been preparing for a pre-emptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian positions, but this was rejected by <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government.</b> 69 Squadron aircraft {{were in the process}} of re-armament to the air-to-air role when hostilities began at 14:00 on October 6, 1973. The aircraft were scrambled to perform CAPs, some having to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean, yet no aerial opposition was encountered. The squadron flew 37 sorties on the first day of the war, of which only 4 were strike missions, while two aircraft suffered damage from SA-7s over the Golan Heights.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{critics argue}} that Vanunu had no {{additional}} information that would pose a real security threat to Israel, and that <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government's</b> real motivation is a desire to avoid political embarrassment and financial complications for itself and allies such as the United States.|$|R

5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government.</b> Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E
5|$|Schindler {{moved to}} West Germany after the war, {{where he was}} {{supported}} by assistance payments from Jewish relief organisations. After receiving a partial reimbursement for his wartime expenses, he moved with his wife, Emilie, to Argentina, where they took up farming. When he went bankrupt in 1958, Schindler left his wife and returned to Germany, where he failed at several business ventures and relied on financial support from Schindlerjuden ("Schindler Jews") – the people whose lives he had saved during the war. He was named Righteous Among the Nations by <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> in 1963. He died on 9 October 1974 in Hildesheim, Germany, and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, {{the only member of}} the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>government</b> {{arranged}} for the trial to have prominent media coverage.

Many major newspapers {{from all over the}} globe sent reporters and published front-page coverage of the story. The trial was held at the Beit Ha'am (today known as the Gerard Behar Center), an auditorium in central Jerusalem. Eichmann sat inside a bulletproof glass booth to protect him from assassination attempts. The building was modified to allow journalists to watch the trial on closed-circuit television, and 750 seats were available in the auditorium itself. Israelis had the opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of the proceedings, and videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day.|$|E
