5|$|As {{the state}} religion, Saivism enjoyed all the prerogatives of the {{establishment}} {{during the period of}} the Jaffna kingdom. The Aryacakravarti dynasty was very conscious of its duties as a patron towards Saivism because of <b>the</b> <b>patronage</b> given by its ancestors to the Rameswaram temple, a well-known pilgrimage center of Indian Hinduism. As noted, one of the titles assumed by the kings was Setukavalan or protector of Setu another name for Rameswaram.

Queen Victoria favoured apricot and fawn colours. Queen Victoria's passion for Pugs was passed on to many {{other members of the}} Royal family, including her grandson King George V and his son King Edward VIII. Many responded to the breed's image of anti-functionalism and diminutive size during this period.|$|E

5|$|Mallanarya of Gubbi, a poet bilingual in Kannada and Sanskrit, enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>patronage</b> of King Krishnadeva Raya.

The former {{was based}} on a 7th-century Tamil work and about a Chola King {{in the context of the}} Shaiva faith; the latter is a writing of encyclopedic proportions that goes beyond philosophical content, describing the various forms (or sports, called lila) of god Shiva and the lives of famous Shaiva saints.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in <b>the</b> <b>patronage</b> system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
