40|$|With {{promises}} of “bottom-up” {{economic development and}} women’s empowerment, microfinance has been established as the “new orthodoxy” in mainstream development circles (Fernando 1997). This study suggests a more limited potential for microfinance to reduce poverty, however. Instead of alleviating poverty, microfinance may be improving the incomes of already established, relatively prosperous women micro-entrepreneurs. How enhanced income translates into social power for women will be a central theme of this essay. Specifically, this topic will be treated within the urban, polygamous and Senegalese context. The role that ideology plays in this process will also be crucial. Polygamy {{can be understood as}} such an ideology aiding in income’s transformation into power for women. <b>This</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>helps</b> make the case that women’s empowerment is a complex process that requires both female income and a value system that validates such productivity...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a complex {{distribution}} network design problem in supply chain system which includes location and inventory decisions. Customers’ demand is generated randomly and each distribution center maintains {{a certain amount of}} safety stock in order to achieve a certain service level for the customers it services. Unlike most of past research, our model allows for multiple levels of capacities available to the distribution centers. <b>This</b> <b>consideration</b> <b>helps</b> to achieve the capacity utilization to a high level as our computational results show this fact. We show that this problem can be formulated as a non-linear integer programming model. A hybrid heuristic combining Tabu search with Simulated Annealing (SA) sharing the same tabu list is developed for solving the problem. We comprise the hybrid algorithm with the optimal solution, Simulated Annealing algorithm and Tabu search algorithm. The results indicate that the method is efficient {{for a wide variety of}} problem sizes...|$|E
40|$|History {{of science}} and {{philosophy}} of science are interrelated despite the separation that predominantly occurred in xx th century, at least in cultural contexts influenced by the “anglo-saxon” philosophy. But, actually, history of science provides a rich field of philosophical problems, and <b>this</b> <b>consideration</b> may powerfully <b>help</b> renewing many “standard” considerations of the philosophy of science, such as, for instance, the changes and evolutions of scientific theories and representations, to take only one example, but which has been significantly related with the structural or systemic character of these theories or representation, with known consequences from the “impossibility solutions” (claimed for rationality) on the debates about the social aspects of science. If, instead, history and rational concerns are to be taken together in considering, both philosophically and historically, the problem of scientific changes, then the a priori impossibility shows no more relevant, as the existence of changes is taken as factual, {{and we have to}} think deeper to understand how they occur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} {{perspective}} of service-dominant logic, specifically value co-creation in service ecosystems to the context of sports. It builds {{on the notion that}} co-created value can only be understood as value-in-context. Therefore, a structural model is developed and tested for different contexts of spectating live broadcasts of football games during the Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup 2014. The context-specific contributions of the co-creating actors, spectators&# 039; experience evaluations, and the resulting context-specific value perceptions from the spectators&# 039; perspective are identified. The results highlight that the relative influence of the main co-creating actors and the relative importance of the value dimensions differ across contexts. Service providers (in sports) should identify how consumers evaluate experience and which dimensions of value are most important to them in the context under <b>consideration.</b> <b>This</b> will <b>help</b> them to successfully facilitate value co-creation, make meaningful value propositions, and achieve strategic benefit for themselves...|$|R
50|$|The {{approach}} {{acknowledges the}} issues of the lead user or the vertical diversification, takes up and enhances various elements of design thinking, and - deviating from previous approaches - always takes the use of socio-technical products as its premise. Training, detailed information (market research, roles or persona and user journeys) and interdisciplinary cooperation should allow product developers to become aware of how and for what the development is going to be used, and to regard its usage from all relevant perspectives. <b>This</b> form of <b>consideration</b> <b>helps</b> to establish a useful diversity in the early phases of the product development that is not influenced by hierarchies and battles for position.Additionally, UPD follows a normative process - in contrast to design thinking etc. that consider its procedures as non-binding guidelines that don't limit innovation potentials.Based on the stringent usage-centred inclusion of all potential requirements from various perspectives, the engineers try to ensure technical feasibility, market acceptance and unique selling propositions. Considering the separate usage phases from various perspectives is an important aspect. The phases are subsequently used for scenarios to form role-based use cases that are weighted by quality and quantity criteria. Thus, the so-called main use cases emerge, which are needed for accomplishing a minimum of acceptance. It is necessary to identify all possible use cases, all perspectives and scenarios to identify the market acceptance as well as beneficial potentials by combining all detected variables. Simultaneously, product demands on the user should be minimised in order to create accessible and low-threshold solutions.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{efficiency}} and performance is evaluated for 22 seaports {{in the region of}} East Africa and the Middle East. The aim of our study is to compare seaports situated on the maritime trade road between the East and the West. These are considered as middledistance ports at which goods from Europe and Far East/Australia can be exchanged and transhipped to all countries in the Middle East and East Africa. All these seaports are regional coasters, and dhow trade was built on these locations, leading {{this part of the world}} to become an important trade centre. Data was collected for 6 years (2000 - 2005) and a non-parametric linear programming method, DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) is applied. The ultimate goal of our study is: 1) to estimate the performance levels of the ports under <b>consideration.</b> <b>This</b> will <b>help</b> in proposing solutions for better performance and developing future plans. 2) to select optimum transhipment locations.

The study mainly highlights the importance of leadership, by identifying the leadership styles and the relevant leadership characteristics and practice in Sri Lankan offshore IT companies to lead the IT projects effectively and efficiently. The findings of the project reveal that the suitable leadership styles to be practiced within Sri Lankan offshore IT companies are Transformational leadership styles that lead to characteristics of Idealized influence, Intellectual stimulation, Inspirational motivation and Individualized <b>consideration.</b> <b>This</b> identification <b>helps</b> IT project leaders to adopt these leadership styles and behaviors in order to enhance team members' organizational commitment, improve work performance, and consequently induce a positive working atmosphere.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{release of}} {{greenhouse}} gasses (GHG) {{has increased in}} the last 50 years, contributing to global climate change. Because agriculture {{is one of the}} major contributors to the production of non-CO 2 GHG, the opportunities for mitigating GHG emissions from agriculture are often considered by policy makers. However, the implementation of agricultural GHG mitigation policies can have unintended consequences or trade-offs (both negative and positive). A major problem, for policy makers, is that although most of these trade-offs have been described in the past, no overview of them exists; and in many cases, there is no consensus with regard to the impact of the mitigation measures on aspects such as cost effectiveness, social acceptance, environmental impact, etc. The current article gives an overview of the different kinds of trade-off that might occur and their relationships to GHG mitigation and agricultural production. The authors offer policy makers a framework which can be applied to any GHG mitigation measure to determine which trade-offs are the most important and which ones should be taken into <b>consideration.</b> <b>This</b> will <b>help</b> policy makers to create an optimal agricultural GHG mitigation measure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the Cournot-Marshall dilemma on the {{incompatibility}} of increasing returns and competition may be overcome under an integrated theory of the firm {{that takes into account}} not only returns to scale but also knowledge and transaction cost considerations.

It is argued that the boundaries of the firm cannot be attributed solely to one single cause, but are instead the result of the interplay between knowledge-, scale-scope- and transaction-based <b>considerations.</b> <b>This</b> interaction favours the emergence of a variety of organisational structures and the coexistence of different sizes even in the same sector of activity.

50|$|Prevention {{could be}} helped by {{professional}} sports such as the National Hockey League pushing towards making hockey safer. Concussions have become a more common injury in hockey today and are being critiqued under a microscope for both their immediate and long-lasting effects. Concussion symptoms can last for an undetermined amount of time depending on the player and {{the severity of the}} concussion. There is also the potential of post-concussion syndrome, which can last for months after the concussion. Concussions damage the brain of a person and the brain controls everything in the body so to limit this severe injury to the highest percentage possible would be in everybody’s best interest. National Hockey League Commissioners have been pushing towards stricter rules and longer suspensions to crack down on concussions. There have been great strides taken in changing the rules to help concussion prevention but officials still have to continue to look into this considering the game is evolving at an extremely fast pace. Players also need to make it a responsibility within themselves to protect each other and not take runs at each other with a player with their head down. Taking all these things into <b>consideration,</b> <b>this</b> could <b>help</b> the prevention of concussions in the National Hockey League considerably.|$|R

60|$|This general {{attitude}} {{of interest and}} inquiry is of deep importance to the proper comprehension of Charles Darwin's life and work, and that for two distinct reasons. In the first place, the universal stir and deep prying into evolutionary questions which everywhere existed among scientific men in his early days was naturally communicated to a lad born of a scientific family, and inheriting directly in blood and bone the biological tastes and tendencies of Erasmus Darwin. In the second place, {{the existence of such}} a deep and wide-spread curiosity as to ultimate origins, and the common prevalence of profound uniformitarian and evolutionary views among philosophers and thinkers, made the acceptance of Charles Darwin's particular theory, when it at last arrived, a comparatively easy and certain matter, because by it the course of organic development was assimilated, on credible grounds, to the course of all other development in general, as then already widely recognised.

40|$|In {{transport}} logistic operations, {{an efficient}} delivery plan and better utilisation of vehicles {{will result in}} fuel cost savings, reduced working hours and even reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. This thesis proposes various algorithmic approaches to generate improved performance in automated vehicle load packing and route planning. First, modifications to best-fit heuristic methodologies are proposed and then incorporated into a simple but effective “look-ahead” heuristic procedure. The results obtained are very competitive {{and in some cases}} best-known results are found for different sets of constraints on three-dimensional strip packing problems. Secondly, a review and comparison of different clustering techniques in transport route planning is presented. This study shows that the algorithmic approach performs according to the specific type of real-world transport route planning scenario under <b>consideration.</b> <b>This</b> study <b>helps</b> to achieve {{a better understanding of how}} to conduct the automated generation of vehicle routes that meet the specific conditions required in the operations of a transport logistics company. Finally, a new approach to measuring the quality of transportation route plans is presented showing how this procedure has a positive effect on the quality of the generated route plans. In summary, this thesis proposes new tailored and effective heuristic methodologies that have been tested and incorporated into the real-world operations of a transport logistics company.
