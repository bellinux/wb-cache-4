50|$|Spatio-temporal {{specificity}} in <b>trans-activation</b> of the perlecan gene during {{development is}} key to the maturation of basement membranes and thus to the complete separation of epithelia from endothelia and stroma. A thorough study of perlecan expression during chick embryo development has shown that perlecan is present at the morula stage {{and for the rest of}} development, although expression can be transient and precisely timed in certain tissue predecessors. In the rat embryo, perlecan expression has been shown to increase in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) post e19 in fetal development. This correlates perfectly with the ceasing of proliferation of VSMCs at e18 and a change in their phenotype. The theory put forward in this study is that perlecan plays an anti-proliferative role for VSMCs once a certain developmental point is reached, much like confluence-dependent expression of perlecan in culture. These findings were corroborated by similar results from studies of rat pulmonary artery and lung epithelia. These tissues also were found to begin perlecan production once cell division had ceased, around fetal day 19.|$|E

[...] ERCC1 mRNA is also found to have either wild-type or three alternative transcription start points. Neither the level of overall mRNA transcription, splice variation nor transcription start point of mRNA correlates with protein level of ERCC1. The rate of ERCC1 protein turnover also does not correlate with ERCC1 protein level. A translational level control of ERCC1, due to a microRNA (miRNA), has been shown during HIV viral infection. A <b>trans-activation</b> response element (TAR) miRNA, coded for by the HIV virus, down-regulates ERCC1 protein expression. TAR miRNA allows ERCC1 mRNA to be transcribed, but acts at the p-body level to prevent translation of ERCC1 protein. (A p-body is a cytoplasmic granule “processing body” that interacts with miRNAs to repress translation or trigger degradation of target RNAs.) In breast cancer cell lines, almost one third (55/167) of miRNA promoters were targets for aberrant methylation (epigenetic repression).

For instance, it is activated by Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors and can bind/activate some Ras protein effectors. M-Ras also weakly stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and ERK2 activity, but modestly stimulates <b>trans-activation</b> from different nuclear response elements which bind transcription factors, such as SRF, ETS/TCF, Jun/Fos, and NF- kB/Rel. M-Ras has been found to induce Akt kinase activity in the PI3-K pathway, and it {{may play a role in}} cell survival of neural-derived cells. Moreover, M-Ras plays a crucial role in the downregulation of OCT4 and NANOG protein levels upon differentiation and has been demonstrated to modulate cell fate at early steps of development during neurogenesis. M-Ras, induced and activated by BMP-2 signaling, also participates in the osteoblastic determination, differentiation, and transdifferentiation under p38 MAPK and JNK regulation. M-Ras is involved in TNF-alpha-stimulated and Rap1-mediated LFA-1 activation in splenocytes. More generally, cells transfected with M-Ras exhibit dendritic appearances with microspikes, suggesting that M-Ras may participate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, it is reported that M-Ras forms a complex with SCRIB and SHOC2, a polarity protein with tumor suppressor properties, and may play a key role in tumorigenic growth.|$|E
40|$|The Tat protein encoded {{by human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 is a strong transcriptional activator of gene expression from the viral long terminal repeat and is essential for virus replication.

40|$|The Tat protein coded {{by human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a strong activator of viral gene expression from the long terminal repeat (LTR). It appears that Tat-mediated <b>trans-activation</b> of the HIV LTR is predominantly a transcriptional event. It {{has been reported that}} Tat acts at the level of both transcriptional initiation and elongation through interaction with a nascent RNA target sequence termed TAR (for <b>trans-activation</b> response element). However, the precise mechanism(s) by which Tat mediates TAR-dependent transcriptional activity is not known. To determine whether Tat functions similarly to other eukaryotic transcriptional activators through any of the conventional promoter elements, we tested Tat activity on synthetic promoters containing consensus sequences required for binding transcription factor Sp 1 and a TATA box. Here, we report that a chimeric Tat protein targeted to the promoter region by the DNA-binding domain of yeast transcription factor GAL 4 activates the synthetic promoter. Because this <b>trans-activation</b> depends on Sp 1 -binding sites, Tat can apparently mediate transcriptional activation through its interaction with Sp 1. Mutational analysis of the gal 4 -tat chimeric gene reveals that the N-terminal 48 -amino acid region of Tat constitutes the activation region for Sp 1 -dependent <b>trans-activation.</b> This region of Tat exhibits substantially more activity than the N-terminal 58 amino acids of Tat, which includes the arginine-rich basic region.

Alternative splicing forms of this gene have been reported in different species, with few functional studies. Apart from the POU 1 F 1 -Wild-type with the expected length, in this work we isolated three additional splicing variants: POU 1 F 1 -β, with a 78 bp insert in the <b>trans-activation</b> domain; POU 1 F 1 -γ that lacks exon 3 and POU 1 F 1 -δ that lacks exons 3, 4 and 5. Four different protein isoforms were also detected by Western blot in the sheep pituitary tissue. Functional assays were performed to study the <b>trans-activation</b> of GH and PRL promoters by the splicing variants.

40|$|EWS fusion {{proteins}} (EFPs) {{caused by}} chromosomal translocations contain a transcriptional activation domain from EWS (EWS Activation Domain, EAD) and DNA binding domains {{of a variety}} of transcription factors. EFPs function as oncogenes and most likely, tumorigenesis arises via transcriptional de-regulation by EFPs. Studies on EAD action are therefore important for understanding <b>trans-activation</b> and oncogenesis. The mechanism of <b>trans-activation</b> by the EAD is beginning to emerge. One subunit of human pol II, hsRPB 7, interacts directly with the EAD, suggesting that hsRPB 7 plays a role in <b>trans-activation.</b> hsRPB 7 directly interacts with another subunit hsRPB 4 to form a dissociable sub-complex of pol II. By exploiting yeast as a genetically manipulatable organism together with a yeast transcriptional assay for the EAD, I have probed the role of RPB 4 and RPB 7 in EAD action. Firstly, my results showed that <b>trans-activation</b> by the EAD is dependent on RPB 4. Secondly, hsRPB 4 could cooperate with hsRPB 7 to support <b>trans-activation,</b> showing that RPB 7 is also required. hsRPB 4, however, could not cooperate with scRPB 7 in <b>trans-activation.</b> These functional data correlate well with previously shown interactions between RPB 4 and RPB 7, strongly suggesting that RPB 4 and RPB 7 function as a complex in EAD-mediated <b>trans-activation.</b> Thirdly, RPB 7 subunits from three other species could cooperate with scRPB 4 to support <b>trans-activation,</b> and fusion of only 17 aa from the N-terminus of scRPB 4 to hsRPB 4 enabled hsRPB 4 to functionally cooperate with scRPB 7, indicating a strong structural and functional conservation of RPB 4 and RPB 7 subunits from humans to yeast. Finally, promoter-bound hsRPB 7 activates transcription to a level comparable to the EAD, suggesting interaction of the EAD with RPB 7 is sufficient to recruit the general transcription machinery to the promoter and activate transcription. Overall, my results provide functional evidence for the role of RPB 4 and RPB 7 in EAD action. Besides, my results demonstrate that direct communication between a transcriptional activator and RNA polymerase is a possible transcription mechanism in a eukaryotic system and that RPB 4 / 7 may be the direct targets of natural yeast and mammalian activators...|$|E
