5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over <b>the</b> <b>railing,</b> leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Following the victory, {{the largely}} UT crowd {{stayed in the}} stands to {{celebrate}} the Longhorns' return to the Rose Bowl—this time for {{a shot at a}} National Championship. As players circled the stadium giving high-fives and handshakes to fans, a section of <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> collapsed and fans spilled onto the sideline. Oneperson suffered injuries and was removed from the field on a stretcher.|$|E

5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E
5|$|During a {{train ride}} to New York, the {{conductor}} {{told her to}} move into the smoking car. She refused, explaining her government service. He cursed at her and grabbed her, but she resisted and he summoned two other passengers for help. While she clutched at <b>the</b> <b>railing,</b> they muscled her away, breaking her arm in the process. They threw her into the smoking car, causing more injuries. As these events transpired, other white passengers cursed Tubman and shouted for the conductor to kick her off the train.|$|E

5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|The choir {{is where}} the priest and/or a choral group sings the psalms. It {{is located in the}} central nave between the main door and the high altar, and built in a semicircular fashion, much like Spanish cathedrals. It was built by Juan de Rojas between 1696 and 1697. Its sides contain 59reliefs of various saints done in mahogany, walnut, cedar and a native wood called tepehuaje. <b>The</b> <b>railing</b> that {{surrounds}} the choir was made in 1722 by Sangley Queaulo in Macao, China and placed in the cathedral in 1730.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E

The Bharhut gateway is dated to 100-75 BC (most probably 75 BC based on artistic analysis).|$|R

Johnny was {{a replacement for}} Waltman who missed the event due to undisclosed reasons. Shelley began the bout alone, until Johnny, who was in attendance along with several of Candido's family members, jumped <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> to join Shelley as his tag team partner by taking a tag from Shelley. A bit later, Douglas kicked Candido in the crotch and pinned him with a roll-up pin, thus eliminating Shelley and Candido from the contest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|Michael kidnaps Laurie {{and takes}} {{her back to}} their old home. He tries to show Laurie that she is his sister, {{presenting}} a picture of them with their mother. Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael with his own knife before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she can leave and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a balcony and charges her head-on, knocking both of them over <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b> Laurie finds herself {{on top of an}} unconscious Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she fires just as Michael awakens.|$|E

5|$|The captain puts Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{in charge}} of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), who has brought his girlfriend Katy Moore (Amy Adams) on the cruise with him, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) share an awkward moment alone on the deck away from their {{significant}} others. Michael continually tries to take charge of the event by standing next to the captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, sending the passengers into a panic and causing one passenger to grab a life vest and jump off the ship, the captain temporarily detains him by zip tying him to <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> on the deck outside.|$|E
5|$|In Martin and St. Lucie counties, {{the storm}} was {{considered}} among the worst on record. The storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations. At Stuart, winds removed or badly damaged 75% of the roofs in town. The storm destroyed {{the third floor of}} the building that housed a bowling alley and the Stuart News, a local newspaper. At Olympia, an abandoned settlement also known as Olympia Beach, strong winds leveled the old Olympia Inn, a gas station, and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building. Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant. A bridge leading to the barrier island from Olympia was partly wrecked; the bridge tender survived by gripping <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> during the storm. Winds leveled his nearby home. According to the Monthly Weather Review, some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at Olympia. The storm left many homes in Hobe Sound uninhabitable, forcing crews to tear them down. Winter estates on the island, however, were better built and little damaged. While Stuart and Hobe Sound sustained significant damage, Port Salerno suffered minimally. In Stuart, the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless, up to nearly 10% of the population, which was 5,100 at the time. Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce, the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines. In the latter city, high waves washed out a portion of the causeway. In the 1980s, an elderly resident recalled that {{the storm was}} the most severe on record in Fort Pierce.|$|E
5|$|The Four-Way Elimination Tag Team {{match for}} the NWA World Tag Team Championship was next, in which The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens), who were {{accompanied}} by Jimmy Hart, defended against the teams of Alex Shelley and Sean Waltman, America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), and Team Canada (A-1 and Eric Young). The bout duration was 18 minutes and 1 second. Waltman was advertised to team with Shelley for the encounter, but missed the show due to undisclosed reasons. In this bout, if {{a member of a}} team is pinned or made to submit, then him and his partner is eliminated from the contest; the objective is to be the last team standing. Shelley began the bout alone, until Chris Candido's legitimate brother Johnny Candido, who was in attendance along with several of Candido's family members, jumped <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> to join Shelley as his tag team partner. A bit later, Douglas kicked Candido in the crotch and pinned him with a roll-up pin, thus eliminating Shelley and Candido from the contest. AMW were the next eliminated; Young pinned Harris with a roll-up after A-1 hit Harris across the back with a hockey stick. The Naturals pinned A-1 after slamming him into the mat face-first with their signature tag team Natural Disaster maneuver. Due to the pin, Team Canada were eliminated from the contest, thus giving the victory to The Naturals who retained the NWA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5000|$|While {{arguing with}} the police, John Bedford Leno's friend, Humphreys, noticed that <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> would stand no {{pressure}} {{and began to}} sway them backwards and forwards.
