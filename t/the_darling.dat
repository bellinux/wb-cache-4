5|$|Ramsay did not {{graduate}} from Cambridge, but instead returned to Australia in 1883 {{to go into}} farming, first as a jackaroo on Winbar Station in New South Wales and then, in late 1885, with his older brother Frank at Eton Vale, a large station on <b>the</b> <b>Darling</b> Downs owned by their father and Arthur Hodgson, later Sir Arthur Hodgson, that was then being managed by Arthur Hodgson's son Edward.|$|E
50|$|Another absence in {{the movie}} was Dud Wash. All <b>the</b> <b>Darlings</b> appear {{including}} Charlene but her husband Dud is not seen or mentioned. Nor is Charlene's and Dud's daughter Andelina ("The Darling Baby") seen or mentioned.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Darlings</b> {{were often}} {{compared}} with the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, another African American all-girl swing band. <b>The</b> <b>Darlings</b> were darker skinned than the Sweethearts. Toby Butler, a white member of the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, was rumored to have left the band and joined <b>the</b> <b>Darlings</b> in <b>the</b> mid-1940s, when racial segregation made playing in mixed bands illegal. This rumor was confirmed in 1946 when she was arrested while performing in Georgia.|$|R

5|$|The {{species has}} become naturalised beyond its {{original}} range in Australia. In New South Wales {{it is especially}} prevalent around Sydney and the Central Coast region. In Tasmania it has spread in {{the east of the}} state and become weedy in bushland near Hobart. In Western Australia, it is found in <b>the</b> <b>Darling</b> Range and western wheatbelt as well as Esperance and Kalgoorlie.|$|E
5|$|The species tolerates a {{range of}} soils, {{requiring}} only that its soil be well-drained. Like most dryandras, it grows well in lateritic soils and gravels, although this species {{is also found in}} deep sand, sand over laterite, and sand over limestone. It also occurs in {{a range of}} vegetation complexes, including coastal and kwongan heath, tall shrubland, woodland and open forest. It is a common understorey plant in drier areas of Jarrah forest, and forms thickets on limestone soils of the Swan Coastal Plain. Banksia sessilis sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas; for example, it has been recorded colonising gravel pits in <b>the</b> <b>Darling</b> Scarp.|$|E
5|$|In January 1861, Tom, Horatio and a {{party of}} {{employees}} and their families travelled by steamer to Brisbane, disembarked in Moreton Bay, and then, with livestock and supplies, set out on an eight-month trek through Queensland's rugged interior. Food was scarce and Tom hunted native game to fend off starvation. They suffered many other hardships and even death when, in Toowoomba, one of Horatio's men drowned. On <b>the</b> <b>Darling</b> Downs over 10,000 sheep were collected. The size of the Wills party {{attracted the attention of}} local Aborigines, and the two groups engaged in games of mimicry. Wary of entering the region's frontier war, Horatio maintained a conciliatory attitude to the Aborigines. The party reached Cullin-la-ringo, situated on Kairi Aboriginal land, in early October, and proceeded to set up camp.|$|E

5|$|In July 1899, the Premier of Queensland, James Dickson, {{offered a}} {{contingent}} of troops for service in South Africa {{in the event of}} war between the British Empire, and the Boer Transvaal Republic and Orange Free State. For a time Chauvel served as an enrolment officer, signing up volunteers from <b>the</b> <b>Darling</b> Downs. The Boer War broke out in October 1899, and Chauvel was given command of one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that departed Brisbane on 1 November 1899. They disembarked at Cape Town on 14 December and joined the Imperial force under Lord Methuen at the Orange River. The Queensland Mounted Infantry's first fighting was in an action at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900 alongside the infantry of the Royal Canadian Regiment. In February, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of Major General John French's Cavalry Division. After a strenuous march, the Cavalry Division relieved the Siege of Kimberley on 15 February.|$|E
5|$|The black {{honeyeaters}} {{is considered}} to be migratory rather than nomadic, with regular seasonal movements related to flowering of food plants, especially the emu bush. Some movements are southwards in the Southern Hemisphere spring and summer, moving northwards again in autumn and winter. During severe droughts it has been recorded south of Bendigo and in the Hunter Region. Irruptions (sudden population increases) can occur in some areas after rain or the movement of floodwaters. Breeding has generally been recorded in the drainage basins of Cooper Creek and <b>the</b> <b>Darling</b> River in southwestern Queensland and northwestern New South Wales, {{as well as in the}} Pilbara and Gascoyne Regions in Western Australia. However favourable conditions may result in it breeding anywhere in an irruption.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} boobook {{is found}} across Australia, although is scarce in more arid regions such as western New South Wales, southwestern and western Queensland, much of South Australia {{away from the}} coast and interior Western Australia and Northern Territory. In drier areas it is generally found along watercourses such as <b>the</b> <b>Darling</b> and Paroo Rivers, and Lake Eyre basin. It is found on numerous offshore islands such as Groote Eylandt, Melville Island, Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and many islands off eastern Australia. It is found in southern New Guinea, Roti, Timor and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is found {{in a wide range}} of habitats, from forest and open woodland to scrubland and semi-desert areas. In Australia it resides in mainly Eucalypt forests. It has adapted to landscapes altered by human activity and is found in farmland and suburban areas as long as there are some scattered trees. In fact, it can adapt to any habitat as long as there are some trees present.|$|E

5|$|Suillus luteus can {{be found}} all over the Northern Hemisphere. Native to Eurasia, it is {{widespread}} across the British Isles. To the east it has been recorded from Pakistan, where it was found along canals in Dashkin {{in the district of}} Astore, and as far east as South Korea. It has also been widely introduced elsewhere by way of pine plantations around the globe. It is very commonly found in Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) plantations, despite the tree being native to California and hence not in the fungus' native range. In North America it is found in the northeast, the Pacific Northwest and the southwestern United States. According to Ernst Both, it was Charles Horton Peck who first suggested in 1887 that the fungus was introduced to New York State on Pinus sylvestris. DNA studies show that the North American populations differ little genetically from European populations, supporting the idea that the fungus arrived to North America relatively recently as a result of human activity. Suillus luteus is found in coastal and mountainous pine forests and exhibits a tolerance of the northern latitudes. Southern Hemisphere locales where the slippery jack grow with plantation pines include South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In southwestern Australia, the bolete is limited to areas of greater than 1000mm (40in) annual rainfall. It has been recorded as far north as <b>the</b> <b>Darling</b> Downs and southern Queensland, and occasionally in Tasmania. The fungus fruits in spring, summer and fairly prolifically in autumn, following periods of wet weather. Mushrooms can appear in large troops or fairy rings.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was created}} in the 1930s from an {{existing}} system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields. Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River (modern-day Guildford Road), it was actually used for the road through Belmont, south of the river. This section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour, with the road base made from sections of tree trunks. Over the years the road has been upgraded, with the whole highway sealed by 1953, segments reconstructed and widened, dual carriageways created in Perth and Kalgoorlie, and grade separated interchanges built at major intersections. Great Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth's eastern suburbs opened in 1988, allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites, and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam. A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway's current ascent of <b>the</b> <b>Darling</b> Scarp has been identified. The planned route is a controlled-access highway along Toodyay Road to Gidgegannup, and then across to Wundowie via a new alignment. Though planning began in the 1970s, , construction of this route has not been scheduled, and it is not considered a priority.|$|E
