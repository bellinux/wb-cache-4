5|$|This {{nuthatch}} is omnivorous, eating {{insects and}} seeds. It places large food {{items such as}} acorns or hickory nuts in crevices in tree trunks, and then hammers them open with its strong beak; surplus seeds are cached under loose bark or crevices of trees. The diet in winter may be nearly 70% seeds, but in summer it is mainly insects. The insects consumed by the white-breasted nuthatch include caterpillars, ants, and pest species such as pine weevils, oystershell and other scale insects, and jumping plant lice. This bird will occasionally feed on the ground, and readily visits feeding stations for nuts, suet and sunflower seeds, the last of which it often <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> to store. The white-breasted nuthatch was also observed visiting raccoon latrines {{in order to find}} seeds.|$|E
5|$|Other images, such as Thalaba {{reclaiming}} his father's magic sword, are {{symbols that}} effectively reinforce Southey's moral themes. However, these events represent the {{minority of the}} plot and are rarely relied on early in the story. To the contrary, the heavily represented magic ring is used to protect Thalaba with little explanation as to how it works {{and there is no}} moral statements tied to its use. As a whole, the poem is able to portray scenery and events in strongly descriptive manners, but the manner in doing this <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> from their meaning and effect. In terms of religious imagery, Islam within the poem is more similar to Zoroastrian thought and morality. Other religious images lose their power as Southey removes any mystical aspects of them, including Simorgh being stripped of it being a symbol of harmony with life. In terms of the divine, there is a dual entity: Allah representing preservation and Eblis representing destruction. However, evil, though an opposite to good, is never explained but merely used to further the plot.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E

25|$|According to Christopher B. Doob, {{outsourcing}} is companies' subcontracting {{of services}} to other companies instead of continuing to provide those services themselves. This <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> from jobs offered in the United States and {{makes it more difficult}} to maintain and get jobs. Outsourcing raises the unemployment rate, and while outsourcing has been steadily increasing since the 1990s, data on the subject is limited by the power elite. Companies like Apple and Nike outsource jobs overseas so they can have cheaper labor to make their products and keep from raising prices in the States.|$|E
25|$|A second {{consideration}} is the rotational energy {{stored in the}} wheels. The pinewood derby car converts gravitational potential energy into translational kinetic energy (speed) plus rotational energy. Heavier wheels have a greater moment of inertia and their spinning <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> energy that would otherwise contribute to {{the speed of the}} car. A standard wheel has a mass of 2.6 g, but this can be reduced to as little as 1 g by removing material from the inside of the wheel. A raised wheel can reduce the rotational energy up to one-quarter, but this advantage is less with a bumpy track.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Ajax {{moved to}} a new home ground in the {{southeast}} of the city known as the Amsterdam Arena. This was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding approximately 52,000 spectators. The average attendance in 2006–07 was 48,610, rising in the next season to 49,128. The Arena has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the Arena has earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008–09 season, ground staff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} chief article is this: Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins and was raised again for our {{justification}} (Romans 3:24–25). He alone is the Lamb of God who <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> {{the sins of}} the world (John 1:29), and God has laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Isaiah 53:6). All have sinned and are justified freely, without their own works and merits, by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood (Romans 3:23–25). This is necessary to believe. This cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work, law or merit. Therefore, it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us... Nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered, even though heaven and earth and everything else falls (Mark 13:31).|$|E
25|$|The lamb {{stands on}} an altar, and is {{surrounded}} by 14 angels arranged in a circle, some holding symbols of Christ's Passion, and two swing censers. The lamb has a wound on its breast from which blood gushes into a golden chalice, yet it shows no outward expression of pain, a reference to Christ's sacrifice. The angels have multicolored wings and hold instruments of Christ's passion, including the cross and the crown of thorns. The antependium on the upper portion of {{the front of the}} altar is inscribed with the words taken from John 1:29; ECCE AGNUS DEI QUI TOLLIT PECCATA MUNDI ("Behold the Lamb of God who <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> the sins of the world").

40|$|The {{international}} literature contains {{numerous studies}} in which socioeconomic status {{has been found to}} affect dietary and health habits, and disease outcomes. An Australian survey by BIS Shrapnel (1993) found that nationwide there are 12, 000 independent <b>take</b> <b>away</b> food outlets, and 2, 000 <b>take</b> <b>away</b> chain food stores. However, despite being a primary source of unhealthy foods for many individuals, the literature shows a surprising lack of any study conceming intervention with respect to <b>take</b> <b>away</b> food outlets. This study was undertaken to develop a baseline level of information regarding the types of food sold, current preparation and cooking practices in <b>take</b> <b>away</b> food outlets. Information was also sought to develop an understanding of the characteristics of the customers and owners of <b>take</b> <b>away</b> food outlets, including their attitudes towards health, as well as the business itself Data was collected by face to face interviews with outlet owners or managers, using a structured questionnaire, which contained both open and closed questions. The questionnaire included sections focussing on foods sold, common food preparation methods, customers, owners, the business, and the possibility of working with health promotion units. Data collected enabled a baseline level of descriptive information to be compiled regarding <b>take</b> <b>away</b> food outlets. Results of types of food sold and preparation methods indicate that most foods available at <b>take</b> <b>away</b> food outlets are high fat foods. Although there are some healthy food options offered at <b>take</b> <b>away</b> food outlets they tend to be less frequently available.

On the way, the crew stop at an island to take on fresh water and encounter a lioness suckling a human baby. The empress goes ashore and finds her own baby being treated by the lioness as her cub (a griffin – we already know – had snatched away the lioness shortly after it stole the child {{and took it to}} this island, where the lioness had killed it). The empress returns to the ship with her child and the lioness follows.
