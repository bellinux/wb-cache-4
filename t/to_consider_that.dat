5|$|In {{common with}} the other main island chains of Scotland {{many of the more}} remote islands were {{abandoned}} during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since prehistoric times. These places had been perceived as relatively self-sufficient agricultural economies, but both island residents and outsiders later came <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> the more remote islands lacked the essential services of a modern industrial economy.|$|E

5|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{had opened}} the {{previous}} year, and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, and indicated that longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery, could be dealt with, and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next. When the Grand Junction Railway was authorised in 1833, it was possible <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> railways might one day link central Scotland and the south of England.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{material}} from the Bronze Age and earlier has been recovered and excavations have shown that there was unsustained late-Neolithic and Bronze Age human activity in the vicinity. The earliest known permanent settlement dates from the Iron Age and began where a track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. Although only sparse pottery evidence has been found for the middle Iron Age period, 4,290 pellet mould fragments, likely used for minting and dated to 50BC–AD 50, have been uncovered south east of the modern town centre, south of a crossing of the River Slea and near Mareham Lane in Old Sleaford. The largest {{of its kind in}} Europe, the deposit has led archaeologists <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> the site in Old Sleaford {{was probably one of the}} largest Corieltauvian settlements during this period and may have been a tribal centre.|$|E
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
5|$|Historian David Detzer {{has argued}} that the fame that {{surrounds}} the 11th New York is misplaced. During its time in service, the 11th New York Regiment saw little fighting compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York, 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York, also known as the Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes. The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th New York was no different than many regiments, North and South.|$|E

5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an {{administrator}} of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role {{in the relationship between}} princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E
5|$|Steins;Gate {{was created}} at the {{animation}} studio White Fox, and {{was produced by}} Mika Nomura and Yoshinao Doi, directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Satō, and written by Jukki Hanada, with Kyuuta Sakai serving as character designer and chief animation director. While Takeshi Abo, the composer for the Science Adventure games, only had a small role in the previous anime adaptation of the series, he was appointed to compose for the Steins;Gate anime together with his coworker Jun Murakami. Abo composed new music, and made use of the same atmosphere and musical worldview as when he composed for the Steins;Gate game, but also had <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> the music had to be synchronized with the motions of the anime; {{this was a very}} different way of working than the one he uses when composing for games.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole met the {{botanist}} and collector John Tradescant {{the younger}} around 1650. Tradescant had, with his father, {{built up a}} vast and renowned collection of exotic plants, mineral specimens and other curiosities {{from around the world}} at their house in Lambeth. Ashmole helped Tradescant catalogue his collection in 1652, and, in 1656, he financed the publication of the catalogue, the Musaeum Tradescantianum. In 1659, Tradescant, who had lost his only son seven years earlier, legally deeded his collection to Ashmole. Under the agreement, Ashmole would take possession at Tradescant's death. When Tradescant died in 1662, his widow, Hester, contested the deed, claiming her husband had signed it when drunk without knowing its contents, but the matter was settled in Chancery in Ashmole's favour two years later. Hester was to hold the collection in trust for Ashmole until her death. Ashmole's determined aggressiveness in obtaining the Tradescant collection for himself has led some scholars <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> Ashmole was an ambitious, ingratiating social climber who stole a hero's legacy for his own glorification.|$|E

However, the judge in Bailey's trial had not directed the jury <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> situation.

25|$|Six loci {{have over}} 100 alleles {{that have been}} {{detected}} in the human population. Of these, the most variable are HLA B and HLA DRB1.

To interpret this table, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>that</b> an allele is a variant of the nucleotide (DNA) sequence at a locus, such that each allele differs from all other alleles in at least one (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP) position. Most of these changes result in a change in the amino acid sequences that result in slight to major functional differences in the protein.|$|E
