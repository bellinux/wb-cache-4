5|$|In {{contrast}} to bony fish, {{with the exception}} of the coelacanth, the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%) and <b>trimethylamine</b> N-oxide (TMAO), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. A few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea. When a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.|$|E

Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and <b>trimethylamine</b> N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration.

40|$|SUMMARY: MR {{spectroscopy}} is a noninvasive {{technique that}} allows the detection of several naturally occurring compounds (metabo-lites) from well-defined regions of interest within the human brain. Alzheimer disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, {{is the most common}} cause of dementia in the elderly. During the past 20 years, multiple studies have been performed on MR spectroscopy in patients with both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. Generally, MR spectroscopy studies have found decreased N-acetylaspartate and increased myo-inositol in both patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, with greater changes in Alzheimer disease than inmild cognitive impairment. This review summarizes the information content of proton brainMR spectroscopy and its related technical aspects, as well as applications ofMR spectroscopy tomild cognitive impairment andAlzheimer disease. WhileMR spectroscopymay have some value in the differential diagnosis of dementias and assessing prognosis, more likely its role in the near future will be predominantly as a tool formonitoring disease response or progression in treatment trials.

40|$|Summarizing all our results, we {{can draw}} the {{following}} picture (Fig. 6). The expression of HCV proteins induces an ER stress response. The consequence of prolonged ER stress is {{the release of}} Ca 2 + from the ER into the cytosol. Cytosolic Ca 2 +-transients activate Ca 2 + dependent kinases, which phosphorylate the transcription factor CREB. Phosphorylated CREB binds to the CRE-element in the PP 2 Ac promoter and induces transcription. Elevated PP 2 Ac level inhibits the enzymatic activity of PRMT 1. Two consequences of reduced PRMT 1 activity are the hypomethylation of STAT 1 and the hypomethylation of NS 3 helicase. Hypomethylated STAT 1 shows increased association with PIAS 1 and decreased binding to IFNa-target genes upon IFNa treatment. The consequence of the inhibited IFNa-signaling is a reduced antiviral response, which contributes {{to the development of}} chronic liver infection, which later on can progress to liver cirrhosis and HCC. On the other hand, the unwinding activity of hypomethylated NS 3 is increased compared to methylated NS 3. The higher unwinding activty of NS 3 causes an increase in viral replication. Therefore the upregulation of PP 2 Ac has two advantages for the virus: reduced cellular antiviral response and increased viral replication. Perspectives: The promising results of the improved IFNa signaling in UHCV 57. 3 cells (express HCV proteins in the absence of tetracycline) after AdoMet/Betaine treatment {{and the fact that the}} expression of HBV proteins in Huh 7. 93 cells induces obviously the same IFNa inhibiting mechanism (increased PP 2 Ac levels, hypomethylated STAT 1 and decreased induction of IFNa target genes), it opens the interesting perspective of correcting the HBV induced defect in IFNa signaling also by treating cells with AdoMet and betaine. We would expect, that the AdoMet/betaine treatment would at least partially restore the IFNa signaling in Huh 7. 93 cells and would lead to an increased induction of antiviral genes compared to Huh 7. 93 cells not treated with AdoMet/Betaine. AdoMet and Betaine are two compounds, which are already on the market as over the counter drugs, and which are used to treat liver diseases. Now that we could show improved IFNa signaling in UHCV 57. 3 cell pretreated with AdoMet and betaine, we plan to apply these drugs to HCV patients in a clinical study. The plan is to retreat nonresponders with a combination of AdoMet, Betaine, IFNa and rabavirin. To increase the activity of PRMT 1 by manipulating the methionine/AdoMet cycle is one possibility to correct the inhibition of the IFNa signaling by HCV. Another possibility would be to target the first event, induction of ER stress by HCV. Without the induction of ER stress during expression of HCV proteins, Ca 2 + would not leak out of the ER and the phosphorylation of CREB would not occur, so the level of PP 2 A would not rise and therefore there would be no inhibition of PRMT 1. One possibility to avoid ER stress is the treatment of cells with chemical chaperones. Chemical chaperones are a group of low-molecular-weight componds, which can reverse the mislocalization and/or aggregation of proteins(138). Polyos such as glycerol, <b>trimethylamines</b> such as trimethlyamine N-oxide (TMAO), amino acid derivatives and other compounds like 4 - phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and membrane-permeable forms of enzyme antagonists belong to the chemical chaperones. The mechanisms by which chemical chaperones function are not fully understood but are thought to include stabilization of improperly folded proteins, reduction of aggregation, prevention of nonproductive interactions with other resident proteins and alteration of the activity of endogenous chaperones in such a way that the affected proteins are more efficiently transported to the appropriate intracellular or extracellular destination. An interesting experiment would be the expression of viral proteins in UHCV 57. 3 cells for 24 h in the presence of chemical chaperones, and check afterwards for the level of PP 2 Ac and for the induction of ER stress markers like BiP or spliced XBP 1. We would expect, that the increased level of chaperones in the ER prevent the induction of ERstress and the Ca 2 + -transients in the cytosol. Therefore the transcription factor CREB does not get phosphorylated, and the PP 2 Ac level stays constant even in the presence of viral proteins...|$|R
