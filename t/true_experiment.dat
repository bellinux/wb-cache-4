50|$|Experiments {{might be}} {{categorized}} {{according to a}} number of dimensions, depending upon professional norms and standards in different fields of study. In some disciplines (e.g., psychology or political science), a 'true experiment' is a method of social research in which {{there are two kinds of}} variables. The independent variable is manipulated by the experimenter, and the dependent variable is measured. The signifying characteristic of a <b>true</b> <b>experiment</b> is that it randomly allocates the subjects to neutralize experimenter bias, and ensures, over a large number of iterations of the experiment, that it controls for all confounding factors.|$|E

Such behavioural genetic designs may be considered a subset of natural experiments, quasi-experiments that attempt {{to take advantage of}} naturally occurring situations that mimic <b>true</b> <b>experiments</b> by providing some control over an independent variable. Natural experiments can be particularly useful when experiments are infeasible, due to practical or ethical limitations.|$|R

50|$|The {{independent}} variable {{of a study}} often has many levels or different groups.

Thus, when everything else except for one intervention is held constant, researchers can certify with some certainty that this one element is what caused the observed change. In some instances, having a control group is not ethical. This is sometimes solved using two different experimental groups. In some cases, {{independent variable}}s cannot be manipulated, for example when testing the difference between two groups who have a different disease, or testing the difference between genders (obviously variables that would be hard or unethical to assign participants to).

Particularly when experimentation is used as a tool for informing policy decisions (e.g., in recommending the efficacy of some instructional approaches with disadvantaged students over other, less effective interventions), the design should be of the highest degree of rigor possible.

40|$|Individuals’ opinion {{expression}} {{about public}} affairs has {{entered a new}} phase {{with the growth of}} new venues for social interaction among fellow citizens such as online discussion forums. However, not much empirical evidence exists to understand an individual’s voicing views in online discussion. Focusing on this attention-deserved form of political activity online, the current dissertation aimed to yield insights into some fundamental questions: who, with what characteristics, more intends and tends to talk on an online discussion forum, and what forum conditions (and combinations of them) facilitate an individual’s opinion expression intention and behavior. To investigate these questions, two experimental research methods – scenario-based thought and website-based <b>true</b> <b>experiments</b> – were implemented. Thought experiments relied on a hypothetical scenario technique, the most widely used method in spiral of silence research, but employed the multifaceted, detailed scenarios. <b>True</b> <b>experiments,</b> on the other hand, used the stimulus online forums designed for this study to actually place the participants in the online discussion situation. The findings from these two different approaches indicated that a person’s race, issue involvement, issue knowledge, and the revelation of identity were factors that generally influenced opinion expression online. Racial minorities, compared to Whites, were consistently more willing and likely to voice their views on the online forum. Those who were involved in and knowledgeable about the issue under discussion were more likely to post messages to the forum. Disclosing one’s real name and other personal information was a big hindrance to actual opinion expression on the discussion forum. However, comparing the findings from scenarios to those obtained from real, analogous situations also revealed that the use of scenarios could not accurately identify some existing phenomena. Thought and <b>true</b> <b>experiments</b> returned incongruent predictions regarding the roles of age, fear of isolation, and the votes climate as well as the contribution degree of issue knowledge (to posting intention). In particular, trait fear of isolation, which has been pointed out as the primary culprit behind silencing minority opinion holders, played a completely opposite role. Against the background of these findings, the theoretical and methodological implications of the study were discussed...|$|R
