5|$|Pumice {{found at}} Tell el Dab'a in Egypt <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> {{composition}} of the Thera eruption has been dated to 1540 BCE, closer to the traditionally-accepted date of Thera's eruption. This pumice has been contentious since the 1990s, as it represents the most prominent supported date to differ from the old chronology.|$|E
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of}} the electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E
5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> {{one from the}} Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E

5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} weapons, with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the color <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the screen with shots. Purple weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow weapons, are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|E
5|$|Madeline Ferguson (Lee) {{meets with}} James Hurley and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) at the RR Diner. They discuss Laura's death; Hurley and Hayward believe Laura hid a diary {{at her home}} and want Ferguson, who is now staying there, to look for it. They leave as Jennings and Shelly arrive; Hank is seated at another table and pulls Jennings aside to ask to start working in order to regain her trust. Meanwhile, using a {{photograph}} from Renault's home and the clues from Cooper's dream, the investigators find a log cabin in the woods that {{they believe to be}} the scene of the murder; on the floor Cooper finds a fragment of a One Eyed Jacks casino chip <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> piece found in Laura's stomach, and Truman finds Waldo, the caged myna bird.|$|E
5|$|The {{means by}} which gamma-ray bursts convert energy into {{radiation}} remains poorly understood, and as of 2010 {{there was still no}} generally accepted model for how this process occurs. Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma-ray emission <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> observed diversity of light curves, spectra, and other characteristics. Particularly challenging is the need to explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma-ray bursts may convert as much as half (or more) of the explosion energy into gamma-rays. Early observations of the bright optical counterparts to GRB 990123 and to GRB 080319B, whose optical light curves were extrapolations of the gamma-ray light spectra, have suggested that inverse Compton may be the dominant process in some events. In this model, pre-existing low-energy photons are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion, augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into gamma-rays.|$|E

More than 200 cameras are used to monitor activities in the luggage area.|$|E
25|$|The no-SCAR {{technique}} uses a two-plasmid system; this {{is because}} co-transformation of both cas9 containing plasmid and the sgRNA plasmid results in cell death. More specifically, the cell lethality {{is a consequence of}} Cas9 cleaving the E. coli DNA <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> sgRNA. In order to circumvent this issue, multiple plasmids are used in order to maintain expressional control of both cas9 and sgRNA.|$|E

25|$|In Figure 5, both ribosomal {{subunits}} (small and large) assemble at {{the start}} codon (towards the 5' end of the RNA). The ribosome uses RNA <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> current codon (triplet) on the mRNA to append an amino acid to the polypeptide chain. This is done for each triplet on the RNA, while the ribosome moves towards the 3' end of the mRNA. Usually in bacterial cells, several ribosomes are working parallel on a single RNA, forming {{what is called a}} polyribosome or polysome.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{melamine}} as fertilizer for crops {{had been}} envisaged during the 1950s and 1960s {{because of its}} high nitrogen content (2/3). However, melamine is much more expensive to produce than are other common nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea. To be effective as a fertilizer, {{it is essential that}} the plant nutrients are released or made available in a manner <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> needs of the growing crop. The nitrogen mineralization process for melamine is extremely slow, making this product both economically and scientifically impractical for use as a fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Reformatting an SD {{card with}} a {{different}} file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use wear leveling, in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32. In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.|$|E

25|$|Black tie {{trousers}} {{traditionally have}} no cuffs (turn-ups in British English) or belt loops. The outer seams are usually {{decorated with a}} single braid of silk or a material <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> lapel facing. Traditionally, braces (suspenders), hidden by the waistcoat, are used to support the trousers. Belts should not ever be worn with black tie trousers. Evening trousers can be flat-fronted or pleated today; pleats first coming into fashion in the 1930s. Whilst flat-fronted trousers are more fashionable at present, pleated trousers may be considered more comfortable by men who have wider hips and a narrow waist.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an ongoing}} effort to {{increase}} the conversion efficiency of PV cells and modules, primarily for competitive advantage. In order {{to increase the efficiency}} of solar cells, it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate band gap <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> solar spectrum. This will enhance the electrical and optical properties. Improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency. There are several groups of materials that are being developed. Ultrahigh-efficiency devices (>30%) are made by using GaAs and GaInP2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells. High-quality, single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency, low cost cells (>20%).|$|E
25|$|Lagrangian {{points are}} the constant-pattern {{solutions}} of the restricted three-body problem. For example, given two massive bodies in orbits around their common barycenter, {{there are five}} positions in space where a third body, of comparatively negligible mass, could be placed so as to maintain its position relative to the two massive bodies. As seen in a rotating reference frame <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> angular velocity of the two co-orbiting bodies, the gravitational fields of two massive bodies combined with the minor body's centrifugal force are in balance at the Lagrangian points, allowing the smaller third body to be relatively stationary {{with respect to the}} first two.|$|E
