5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not want to do}} himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Sidel’s {{criticism of}} certain Kerschensteiner’s views about work-school and work-education. Sidel disputed that Kerschensteiner was {{the creator of}} the idea about work-school, emphasizing that, significantly before Kerschensteiner, he put forth this idea in his papers, in which he proved the pedagogical value of work and the need for work-school. Sidel objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not convincingly elaborate the need for introducing work-school, that, when explaining the need for handcraft, he underestimated the significance of books for education and culture in general, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not specify the term "giftedness", <b>that</b> is, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not indicate <b>that</b> besides spiritual, there are other kinds of giftedness and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not understand correctly the relation between work and obviousness. Sidel also thinks that Kerschensteiner did not understand the relation between the society, state and education, i. e. <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not demonstrate <b>that</b> school reform is conditioned by social reasons, that work-school is a social an political need, that work education is the need and interest of modern society and state. Also, he objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not understand nor emphasize the significance and value of handcraft for artistic education, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not speak about the role of work in the development of inventive spirit of the young, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not sufficiently emphasize that significance of handcraft for the development of will, moral and character, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not speak in which way work-school can be realized, i. e. <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not see the mutual relationship between social development and school and did not demand any social changes for the purpose of accomplishing that goal. Sidel concludes that Kerschensteiner’s work-school, introduced in the conditions of monarchist organization of schools in Germany, cannot be a role model which should be followed...|$|R
