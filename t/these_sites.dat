The toxicity of aluminum to fish is increased by a water pH of below 4.5 to 6.5.

30|$|While the second-order {{interactions}} are still largely conjectural, {{there appear to}} be synergistic effects between, soil fertility and exposure (both site factors), and genotype, <b>these</b> <b>site</b> factors often amplifying the expression of genotypic differences. Returning to the case of long-internode genotypes showing very poor tree form on sites that are very fertile and/or exposed, low stockings will almost certainly have a synergistic effect, making the situation even worse. A similar synergism likely involves poor wood stiffness (and longitudinal shrinkage), also at low stockings on sites that are very fertile and/or exposed. In such cases, expression of genotypic differences may be amplified, in LoE interaction, by <b>these</b> <b>site</b> and silviculture factors. However, if a combination of <b>these</b> <b>site</b> and silviculture factors means that all genotypes cause almost uniformly disastrous tree form, there would be LoE interaction suppressing effective expression of genotypic differences.|$|R

However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites.

5|$|Chemical {{activity}} occurs along a protein's active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to {{this site}} and blocking its activity, {{under the assumption}} that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain allosteric sites which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. <b>These</b> <b>sites</b> are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H.|$|E
40|$|The initial {{spatial pattern}} of seed {{deposition}} influences plant {{population and community}} structure, particularly when that pattern persists through recruitment. In a vertebrate-dispersed rain forest tree, Virola calophylla, we found that spatially aggregated seed deposition strongly influenced the spatial structure of later stages. Seed dispersion was clumped, and seed densities were highest underneath V. calophylla females and the sleeping sites of spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus), the key dispersal agent. Although <b>these</b> <b>site</b> types had the lowest per capita seed-to-seedling survival, they had the highest seedling/sapling densities. Conversely, seed and seedling/sapling densities were lowest, and seed survival was highest, at sites of diurnal seed dispersal by spider monkeys. Negative density-dependent and positive distance-dependent seed survival thinned seed clumps. Nonetheless, the clumped dispersion at sleeping and parental sites persisted to the seedling/sapling stage because differences in seed deposition were large enough to offset differences in seed survival among <b>these</b> <b>site</b> types...|$|R

5|$|Conservation of A.viridimontanum is {{primarily}} limited by its restricted habitat on serpentine cliffs and talus slopes. However, <b>these</b> <b>sites</b> are also of little value to humans. The most likely {{threat to the}} species is expansion of asbestos mining, which often occurs near populations of the fern, or other reuse of abandoned asbestos mines. Road construction might also threaten some sites, although this is mitigated by the fern's ability to flourish on disturbed serpentine. None of the sites are as yet known to be invaded by non-native plants. The species is considered more difficult to cultivate than either of its parent species.|$|E
