40|$|This study aims to {{ask whether}} the Japanese state was capable of {{responding}} to a challenge from international labour migration as a force of globalisation. and to consider {{the significance of the}} subsequent change in the relation between state transformation and the realisation of social justice within the context of globalisation. The focal point of the study is Japan's criminal justice system in the 1990 s, with particular attention to the `language barrier', namely legal and political problems that affect foreigners and state officials. The study analyses how the language barrier emerged in Japan, how it influenced the state, and how state and civil society actors reacted to address the problem. This theoretical and empirical study in International Relations and International Political Economy takes an interdisciplinary approach, drawing insights from Sociology and Gender Studies concerning international labour migration. Documentary research on secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>documents</b> of Japan's state and civil society actors has been complemented by sixteen semi-structured interviews with those {{who were involved in the}} process of tackling the language barrier. The study argues that, by introducing judicial interpreters over the decade and with inputs from civil society actors, the Japanese state was able to reduce the extent of constraints posed by the language barrier on its ability to control crime. This indicates that an internal sector of the Japanese state that is in charge of political matters, namely law enforcement, has been able to largely solve the challenge of the language barrier, which is a manifestation of international economic force. This study thus counters the claim of the Hyperglobalist thesis of globalisation concerning loss or decline in capability of the state, and extends the plausibility of the Transformationalist thesis in terms of geographical area and the issues analysed.

40|$|As {{a teacher}} of the New South Wales Higher School Certificate Geography Syllabus in the 1970 s, I became aware of {{problems}} of interpretation and implementation of syllabus documents dealing with models and theories of human aggregate behaviour. A positivistic underpinning allowed explanation in human geography to employ deductive - nomological methodology. This field study investigates a defined literature of academic geography including journals, and both secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>documents</b> to identify the extent and quality of nomothetic and idiographic traditions from the late 19 th century to the mid 1970 s. The literature prior to the late 1950 s revealed a dominant regional tradition and idiographic methodology {{with an emphasis on}} description of uniqueness of areal phenomena. But underlying currents of a nomothetic nature, running parallel to this regionalidiographic tradition,exerted a noticeable challenge to gain acceptance in geographic circles. This kind of nomothetism was in the form of environmental determinism which held that physical laws operating in nature were also at work to shape and direct human societies. Environmental determinism contained generalised assertions, enjoyed some appeal, but lacked rigorous justification. Even within regional frameworks, authors used environmentally induced determinants to explain the unique character of regions. Not until the 1930 s did environmental determinism lose its appeal, after which time the regional - idiographic tradition strengthened as an explanatory mode of human behaviour. Nomothetism emerged in the late 1950 s in Australia in the application of models and theories explaining human behaviour. Normative theory was supported by an increased use of quantification and by the growing preference for systematic studies in geography. Neither mode of explanation exists at the total exclusion of the other; so that while nomothetism enjoyed widespread appeal in academic geography from the late 1950 s, significant challenges were mounted against it because of its inadequacies as a mode of explaining human aggregate behaviour. Nomothetic explanation in human geography can be seen at the research level and in education circles. Many normative models and theories found their way into senior geography courses to the extent they promoted a systems approach. Teachers would have been aware of normative theory in geography from their university studies and teacher training courses during the late 1950 s and throughout the 1960 s. The tension between associated explanatory modes in systematic and regional geography becomes apparent in the analysis of the N. S. W. H. S. C. Geography Syllabus in which confusing statements raise problems for teachers interpreting and implementing this prescriptive document. Given these tensions and problems of explanation in human geography, the adoption of a critical rationalist viewpoint as propounded by Karl Popper is suggested as a possible solution for geography teachers when interpreting a syllabus such as that of the N. S. W. H. S. C. Falsification rather than verification should be the node of inquiry towards explanation of human aggregate behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{civil war}} in Angola ended in 2002 and the country has {{experienced}} great economic growth ever since. We will examine how the economic BOOM has {{had an impact on}} the economic equality in Angola and how equality/inequality plays a role in the development of democracy in Angola. Angola has had the same political party (MPLA) and the same president since 1979. The first election in Angola was held in 1992, although there were allegations of corruption. In 2008 the first real democratic elections were held. This was six years after the end of the {{civil war in}} 2002. The latest election was held in 2012 and the ruling party, MPLA, won yet again. Opposition parties and NGOs have all expressed criticism of both of the elections in 2008 and 2012. The criticism includes media coverage favoring the government and critical journalists are often met with defamation law suits. Despite the lack of political stability in Angola, the structural framework, required to create growth and promote the democratic process. The democracy has been strengthened through a national constitution. The economic growth has not solved the humanitarian problems in Angola. The country has only experienced a minimal decrease in the income inequality from 2000 to 2009, despite the great economic growth. The Gini-index in Angola is still among the highest in the world. This means that the majority of the population isn’t benefitting from the economic BOOM. Investments in sectors like health and education don’t follow the rate of the economic growth, thus creating a massive problem for the majority of the population in Angola; a population where half of the people are under 15 years. Education and health has, according to the UN, a clear relation to the development of democracy. According to the UN, education, health and democracy are all important factors when it comes to the respect of human rights. Looking at Angola, there’s still a long way to fulfill the UN's 2015 goals. Goals that work towards reducing hunger, having a higher cure rate of illness and disease, strengthening education. Goals that, if fulfilled, will ultimately strengthen the human rights of the citizens. NGOs report of problems in Angola related to the constitutional rights of freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. The reports explain how critical journalists are being harassed and how peaceful demonstrations against the government are met with violence. To explain the development in Angola we have used theories of democracy and regime types and we have used theory of income distribution, equality/inequality and poverty. This way we use some more quantitative terms when we define democracy. Quantitative terms are also used when we look at how the increase in economic growth affects the equality/inequality in the Angola. We try to find causal relations between the various theories and if that’s not possible, we try to identify some areas where there may be causality. The lack of quantitative empirical data from Angola is critical in regards of solving or answering problem we have posed. There’s also uncertainty about the data that is produced by the country itself. We have chosen to respond to this issue by using international sources that are publicly considered to be reliable. At the same time we explain the purposes of our sources and the underlying organization's intentions. This way we illuminate the purposes of our sources and thus we see the produced data in this light. This way we can use our document studies of <b>tertiary</b> <b>documents</b> as indirect field studies, something that would not otherwise have been an option. In conclusion we’ve found that, despite of the economic growth in Angola, the country still lacks a more equal economic distribution. A way to solve this problem could be achieved by investments in health and education. It’s also important to mention that 50 % of the population in Angola still lives below the poverty line, thus making it unable to demand democracy. The lack of respect for democratic principles and democratic procedures, which is written in the constitution, is undermining the development of democracy in the country. Despite political initiatives, for example how a president can stay for a maximum of 10 years in power, there are still major issues related to corruption and violation of national and international rights...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: On 25 th February 2009, a Boeing 737 crashed nearby Amsterdam, leaving 126 victims. In trauma patients, some {{injuries}} initially escape detection. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the incidence of Delayed Diagnosis of Injury (DDI) and the tertiary survey on the victims of a plane crash, and the effect of ATLS (R) implementation on DDI incidence. Patients and methods: Data from all victims were analysed with respect to hospitalisation, DDI, tertiary survey, ISS, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), injuries (number and type) and emergency intervention. Clinically significant injuries were separated from non-clinically significant injuries. The data were compared to a plane crash in the UK (1989), which occurred before ATLS (R) became widely practiced. Results: All 126 victims of the Dutch crash were evaluated in a hospital; 66 were hospitalised with a total of 171 clinically significant injuries. Twelve (7 %) clinically significant DDIs were found in 8 patients (12 %). In 65 % of all patients, a <b>tertiary</b> survey was <b>documented.</b> The incidence of DDI in patients with an ISS >= 16 (n = 13) was 23 %, vs. 9 % in patients with ISS 5 injuries had a DDI incidence of 25 %, vs. 12 % in patients with 5 injuries was 5 %, vs. 8 % in those with <= 5 injuries. Conclusion: DDI in trauma still happen. In this study the incidence was 7 % of the injuries in 12 % of the population. In one third of the patients no <b>tertiary</b> survey was <b>documented.</b> A high ISS, head injury, more than 5 injuries and an emergency intervention were associated with DDI. The DDI incidence in our study was lower than in victims of a previous plane crash prior to ATLS implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

40|$|Missed {{injuries}} in trauma patients {{are a significant}} source of preventable morbidity. The tertiary survey is a head-to-toe physical exam performed within 24 hours of admission to identify any injuries which may have been missed during initial assessment and resuscitation. The Physician Assist Trauma Software (PATS) is an electronic program designed to guide users through a thorough <b>tertiary</b> survey and <b>document</b> the results. This thesis project was designed to study the impact of implementing this novel mobile device based electronic tertiary survey program on missed injuries. The first phase of this study involved quantifying and characterizing the missed injury rate at two distinct pilot sites. The second phase compared missed injury rates before and after implementation of the PATS program. Completion rates before and after implementation were also compared as a measure of feasibility. The implementation of the PATS program significantly decreased missed injury rates and improved documentation compliance at both sites. The third phase focused on user-level feasibility by surveying the pre- and post-PATS practitioners responsible for completing the tertiary survey. Overall, users found the PATS program useful, time-saving, and effective. The PATS program appears to be an effective and feasible way to reduce missed injuries and improve documentation in trauma...|$|R

Abstract is included in. pdf <b>document.</b> <b>Tertiary</b> vinylogous amides, both open-chain and cyclic, were prepared by several routes {{with a view}} toward their use as ligands for metal ions. It is shown that the thermodynamically preferred isomer (functionality trans) is the exclusive product in the open chain case. A new convenient synthesis of [beta]-aminobutenones is described. In contrast to previous studies, {{it was found that}} activated vinylidene chlorides (AVDC's) with [alpha]-hydrogen (Cl 2 C=CH-L, L = carbonyl function or cyano), react with certain secondary amines to give acetylenes, [ [...] . ], either as intermediates or final products except with L = CHO. The mechanism of this reaction is discussed. A simple synthesis of 3, 3 -dichloropropenoic acid and its conversion to several functional derivatives are described. A case is presented for rotational isomerism in four [beta,beta]-dichlorovinyl carbonyl compounds. Nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectral correlations were made for the compounds prepared. In particular, it is shown that nmr spectroscopy allows ready distinction of piperidino vinylogous ureas from the isomeric acyl ketenaminals of this amine. Synthesis and partial characterization of complexes of some of the above polarized ethylenes and acetylenes with cobalt(II) chloride are reported. The polarized ethylenes behave somewhat like tertiary amides as ligands; in two cases, different forms of complex with same ligand were found. The "push-pull" acetylenes form 1 : 1 complexes in which the triple bond absorption(s) of the ligand is absent. The possible implications of this result are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background and AimsThe {{self-propelled}} disposable colonoscope (SPDC) with a 360 ° view {{is designed}} to enhance visualization, minimize risks of perforation and infection transmission, and shorten operator training time associated with conventional colonoscopy (CC). We evaluated SPDC efficacy for cecal intubation and safety. MethodsProspective patients presenting for colorectal cancer screening underwent SPDC immediately followed by CC. Initial patients necessary for SPDC operators to achieve proficiency comprised the training cohort. Subsequent enrolled patients comprised the study cohort. SPDC colonoscopy was performed up to the cecum, where anatomic landmarks were photographed and mucosal suction marks were placed. During SPDC withdrawal, polyps were recorded and similarly marked. On the second pass (by using CC), any potential mucosal damage and suction marks from the SPDC as well as polyps were recorded. Main endpoints included SPDC cecal intubation rates, confirmed by anatomic landmarks and residual marks seen on subsequent CC, and frequency and severity of adverse events and mucosal damage with SPDC. The secondary endpoint was subjective procedure proficiency, evaluated by the operator based on the training cohort. The <b>tertiary</b> endpoint was <b>documenting</b> pathologies visualized with SPDC. ResultsFifty-six of 58 enrolled subjects completed the study. Proficiency with SPDC was attained after 8 to 10 procedures. Cecal intubation was successful in 98. 2 % (55 / 56 subjects; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 90. 4 %- 99. 9 %), including 100 % (95 % CI, 90. 7 %- 100 %) of the study cohort and 94. 4 % (95 % CI, 72. 7 %- 99. 9 %) of the training cohort.

40|$|Background/PurposeBloodstream {{infection}} (BSI) is {{a serious}} infection with a high mortality. We aimed to construct a predictive scoring system to stratify the severity of patients with BSI visiting the emergency department (ED). MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study consisting of patients who visited the ED of a <b>tertiary</b> hospital with <b>documented</b> BSI in 2010. The potential predictors of mortality were obtained via chart review. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to identify predictors of mortality. Penalized maximum likelihood estimation (PMLE) was applied for score development. ResultsThere were 1063 patients with bacteremia included, with an overall 28 -day mortality rate of 13. 2 % (n =  140). In multiple logistic regression with penalization, the independent predictors of death were “predisposition”: malignancy (β-coefficient, 0. 65; + 2 points); “infection”: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteremia (0. 69; + 2 points), pneumonia (1. 32; + 4 points), and bacteremia with an unknown focus (0. 70; + 2 points); “response”: body temperature 5 % (1. 00; + 3 points), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) > 15 % (0. 63; + 2 points); and “organ dysfunction”: pulse oximeter oxygen saturation 2  mg/dL (0. 69; + 2 points). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the model was 0. 881 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 848 – 0. 913], with a better performance than the Pitt bacteremia score (AUROC: 0. 750; 95 % CI 0. 699 – 0. 800, p <  0. 001).

40|$|Injuries to {{the stomach}} are {{commonly}} associated with abdominal trauma because of its anterior position and its susceptibility to rupture when filled with food. 1 This is despite the thick muscular walls of the stomach, which make it more resistant to injury than other organs, 1, 2 and its well-protected location in the thoraco-abdominal region, which deters many external insults. Penetrating trauma to the stomach is more common than blunt trauma. 4 Breach of the stomach wall leads to leakage of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, in turn leading to chemical peritonitis, which mandates laparotomy. Delay {{in recognition of the}} injury and failure to deal with the peritonitis promptly result in increased morbidity and mortality. 2 There have been few, if any, reports addressing gastric trauma in recent years, no doubt because of the standardised management of hollow visceral injuries, with few management controversies and even fewer complications related to anastomotic dehiscence. 2 This study was undertaken in a single surgical ward at a <b>tertiary</b> hospital to <b>document</b> outcomes of the current management of gastric injuries. Patients and methods This prospective study was of all patients treated for gas-tric injuries in a single surgical ward at King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, over a period of 7 years, from 1998 to 2004. Demographic data, clinical presentations, findings at laparotomy, and outcomes were documented. The delay before laparotomy included both pre-hospital and in-hospital delays. Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure of ≤ 90 mmHg. Patients with peritonitis or peritonism underwent emergency laparotomy. Patients with blunt trauma and with equivocal findings underwent computed tomography (CT) scan to exclude solid visceral injury, and were managed expectantly. The injury severity score (ISS) was used to grade severity of injury. 4 The amount of blood transfused was documented. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was given at induction of anaesthesia before laparotomy. Patients found to have gastric perforations were given antifungal prophylaxis. A double-layer repair with absorbable sutures was performed. All other injuries were managed according to their merits.

40|$|High grade gliomas (HGG) are {{the most}} common primary brain tumour in adults. Radiation therapy has {{a key role in the}} {{management}} of HGG. The aims of this thesis are to document and improve the radiotherapy outcomes in this disease. This is achieved by 1) Utilising the AGOG (Australian Genomics and Clinical Outcomes of Glioma) database of patients from seven major <b>tertiary</b> hospitals to <b>document</b> the pathological, surgical, radio- and chemotherapeutic patterns of care in Australia; 2) Using non-invasive imaging biomarkers such as the oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) MRI to monitor radiotherapy response; 3) Enhancing the effect of radiation therapy by using the glycolytic inhibitor dichloroacetate. By analysing the AGOG database, the treatment outcomes achieved in Australia are comparable to that in published randomised trials. The radiotherapy utilisation rate is very high and systemic therapy is in line with many international published series. However, several areas of potential improvement have been identified and include the reduction in prophylactic anti-epileptic use and increase in clinical trial enrolments. The efficacy of radiation therapy is often not known until well after all the therapy has been delivered and the patient returns for progress imaging. Using a novel MRI OGSE, which measures the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) over short diffusion distances, better visualisation of the brain tumour can be achieved and the tumour response can be assessed much earlier and reliably than conventional DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) methods. This offers the potential to modify therapy during the course of treatment or use dose painting techniques to dose escalate non-responding regions. Up-regulated glycolysis is associated with radiation resistance. Elevated glycolysis in GBM (Glioblastoma) cells was observed post-RT together with up-regulated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α and its target pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK 1). Dichloroacetate (DCA), a PDK inhibitor currently being used to treat lactic acidosis, can modify tumour metabolism by activating mitochondrial activity to force glycolytic tumour cells into oxidative phosphorylation. DCA alone demonstrated modest anti-tumour effects in both in vitro and in vivo models of GBM and has the ability to reverse the RT-induced glycolytic shift when given in combination. In vitro, an enhanced inhibition of clonogenicity of a panel of GBM cells was observed when DCA was combined with RT. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that DCA sensitised GBM cells to RT by inducing the cell cycle arrest at the G 2 /M phase, reducing mitochondrial reserve capacity, and increasing the oxidative stress as well as DNA damage in GBM cells together with RT. In vivo, the combined treatment of DCA and RT improved the survival of orthotopic GBM-bearing mice. In conclusion, several avenues have been identified which may lead to improved outcomes for patients with HGG. This includes reducing prophylactic anti-epileptic use and increasing clinical trial participation. There is also potential to develop OGSE sequences for human scanning as an early non-invasive marker of treatment response. Dichloroacetate combined with radiation therapy also warrants further study in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials...|$|R
