When the director left the group, Matsunashi decided to make her own films though she had no formal training in cinema. Her first film, the 1995 short, <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be, which she wrote, directed and acted in, won an Encouragement Prize in the Off Theater Competition at the 1996 Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|Hamlet's soliloquies have {{captured}} the attention of scholars as well. Early critics viewed such speeches as <b>To</b> <b>be,</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be as Shakespeare's expressions of his own personal beliefs. Later scholars, such as Charney, have rejected this theory saying the soliloquies are expressions of Hamlet's thought process. During his speeches, Hamlet interrupts himself, expressing disgust in agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly, and instead skirts around the basic idea of his thought. Not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, is Hamlet really able to be direct and sure in his speech.|$|E
25|$|Ferrer's other notable film roles {{include the}} Turkish Bey in Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Herod Antipas in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), a budding Nazi in Ship of Fools, a pompous {{professor}} in Woody Allen's A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982), the treacherous Professor Siletski in the 1983 remake of <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be, and Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV in Dune in 1984. In an interview {{given in the}} 1980s, he bemoaned the lack of good character parts for aging stars, and admitted that he now took on roles mostly for the money, such as his roles in the horror potboilers The Swarm, in which he played a doctor, and Dracula's Dog, in which he played a police inspector.|$|E

25|$|Benny also {{acted in}} films, {{including}} the Academy Award-winning The Hollywood Revue of 1929, Broadway Melody of 1936 (as a benign nemesis for Eleanor Powell and Robert Taylor), George Washington Slept Here (1942), and notably, Charley's Aunt (1941) and <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be (1942). He and Livingstone {{also appeared in}} Ed Sullivan's Mr. Broadway (1933) as themselves. Benny often parodied contemporary movies and movie genres on the radio program, and the 1940 film Buck Benny Rides Again features all the main radio characters in a funny Western parody adapted from program skits. The failure of one Benny vehicle, The Horn Blows at Midnight, became a running gag on his radio and television programs, although contemporary viewers may not find the film as disappointing as the jokes suggest.|$|E
25|$|Avicenna's {{consideration}} of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated {{in terms of his}} ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.|$|E

She had just finished her 57th movie, <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be, and was on her way home from a successful war bond selling tour when the flight's DC-3 airliner crashed into a mountain near Las Vegas, Nevada, killing all 22 passengers aboard, including 15 servicemen en route to training in California. Gable flew to the crash site to claim the bodies of his wife, mother-in-law, and Winkler, who had been the best man at Gable and Lombard's wedding. Lombard was declared to be the first war-related American female casualty of World War II, and Gable received a personal note of condolence from President Roosevelt. The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation into the crash concluded that pilot error was its cause.|$|E

In the 1990s, two novelists were explicitly influenced by Hamlet. In Angela Carter's Wise Children, <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> {{to be is}} reworked as a song and dance routine, and Iris Murdoch's The Black Prince has Oedipal themes and murder intertwined with a love affair between a Hamlet-obsessed writer, Bradley Pearson, and the daughter of his rival.|$|E

Sarmiento summarizes the book's message in the phrase [...] "That is the point: <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be savages". The dichotomy between civilization and barbarism is the book's central idea; Facundo Quiroga is portrayed as wild, untamed, and standing opposed to true progress through his rejection of European cultural idealsfound at that time in the metropolitan society of Buenos Aires.|$|E

500|$|Lombard's final film, <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be (1942), {{directed}} by Ernst Lubitsch and co-starring Jack Benny, a satire about Nazism and World War II, was in post-production {{at the time}} of her death. The film's producers decided to cut part of the film in which Lombard's character asks, [...] "What can happen on a plane?" [...] out of respect for the circumstances surrounding her death. When the film was released, it received mixed reviews, particularly about its controversial content, but Lombard's performance was hailed as the perfect send-off to one of 1930s Hollywood's most important stars.|$|E
500|$|It {{was nearly}} a year before Lombard {{committed}} to another film, as she focused instead on her home and marriage. Determined that her next film be [...] "an unqualified smash hit", she was also careful in selecting a new project. Through her agent, Lombard heard of Ernst Lubitsch's upcoming film: <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be (1942), a dark comedy that satirized the Nazi takeover of Poland. The actress had long {{wanted to work with}} Lubitsch, her favorite comedy director, and felt that the material—although controversial—was a worthy subject. Lombard accepted the role of actress Maria Tura, despite it being a smaller part than she was used to, and was given top billing over the film's lead, Jack Benny. Filming took place in the fall of 1941, and was reportedly one of the happiest experiences of Lombard's career.|$|E
500|$|Paramount quickly began casting Lombard as {{a leading}} lady, {{primarily}} in drama films. Her profile increased when she married William Powell in 1931, but the couple divorced after two years. A turning point in Lombard's career came when she starred in Howard Hawks' pioneering screwball comedy Twentieth Century (1934). The actress found her niche in this genre, and continued to appear in films such as Hands Across the Table (1935) (forming a popular partnership with Fred MacMurray), My Man Godfrey (1936), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and Nothing Sacred (1937). At this time, Lombard married [...] "the King of Hollywood", Clark Gable, and the supercouple gained much attention from the media. Keen to win an Oscar, {{at the end of}} the decade, Lombard began to move towards more serious roles. Unsuccessful in this aim, she returned to comedy in Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941) and Ernst Lubitsch's <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be (1942)—her final film role.|$|E

500|$|Q1 is {{considerably}} shorter than Q2 or F1 {{and may be}} a memorial reconstruction of the play as Shakespeare's company performed it, by an actor who played a minor role (most likely Marcellus). Scholars disagree whether the reconstruction was pirated or authorised. It is suggested by Irace that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for travelling productions, thus the question of length may be considered as separate from issues of poor textual quality. Editing Q1 thus poses problems in {{whether or not to}} [...] "correct" [...] differences from Q2 and F. Irace, in her introduction to Q1, wrote that [...] "I have avoided as many other alterations as possible, because the differences...are especially intriguing...I have recorded a selection of Q2/F readings in the collation." [...] The idea that Q1 is not riddled with error but is instead eminently fit for the stage has led to at least 28 different Q1 productions since 1881. Other productions have used the probably superior Q2 and Folio texts, but used Q1's running order, in particular moving the <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be soliloquy earlier. Developing this, some editors such as Jonathan Bate have argued that Q2 may represent [...] "a 'reading' text as opposed to a 'performance' one" [...] of Hamlet, analogous to how modern films released on disc may include deleted scenes: an edition containing all of Shakespeare's material for the play for the pleasure of readers, so not representing the play as it would have been staged.|$|E
