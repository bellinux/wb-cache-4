[...] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported {{that the number of}} contributors with an average of five of more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 editors, which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the quoted <b>trend</b> <b>rate,</b> the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented <b>trend</b> <b>rate</b> indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated. Given that the trend analysis published in The Economist presents the number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.|$|E

50|$|The {{impact of}} the Korean War on the Economy of the United States refers {{to the ways in}} which the American economy was {{affected}} by the Korean experience from 1950 to 1953. While the cost of the Korean War was less significant than that of World War II, it still changed the structure of the American growth as a result of its financing. The Korean War boosted GDP growth through government spending, which in turn constrained investment and consumption. While taxes were raised significantly to finance the war, the Federal Reserve followed an anti-inflationary policy. Though there was a large increase in prices at the outset of the war, price and wage controls ultimately stabilized prices by the end of the war. Consumption and investment continued to grow after the war, but below the <b>trend</b> <b>rate</b> prior to the war.|$|E

These two t 3. pes of models derive from parsimonious and transparent data-generating processes and, {{in the case of}} structural time series models, allow the researcher to incorporate economically meaningful explanatory variables into a t/me series framework. When specified in state-space form, unobserved components models and structural dine series models become available to the Kalman filter estimation technique. The Kalrnan filter explicitly accounts for possible measurement errors in the observed severit 3 " and frequency data. Model. Structural time series models, which nest unobserved components models, are applied to state-level time series data for (on-leveled and wage-adjusted) indemnity and medical severities, and for frequency. Parameter estimates, hypothesis tests, and growth forecasts are provided for by the software package ST:U. STAMP is especially designed for estimating unobserved components and structural time series models. Results. NCCI developed a production process that employs unobserved components and structural time series models to state-level data of indemnity and medical seventies, and frequency.

As both the UK’s then fiscal rules (the Golden rule and the sustainable investment rule) began to bite, the UK government desired to halve the real rate of growth in public spending from 4% per annum over the last decade to 2% per annum {{over the next three years}} - a 0.5% below than the <b>trend</b> <b>rate</b> of growth of the economy.

40|$|Trend {{growth in}} total factor {{productivity}} (TFP) is unobserved; it is frequently assumed to evolve continuously over time. That assumption {{is inherent in the}} use of the Hodrick-Prescott or Bandpass filter to extract trend. Similarly, the Kalman filter/ unobserved-components approach assumes that changes in the <b>trend</b> growth <b>rate</b> are normally distributed. In fact, however, innovations to the <b>trend</b> growth <b>rate</b> of {{total factor productivity}} are far from normal. The distribution is fat-tailed, with large outliers in 1973.
