5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to {{understand}} white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened.</b> Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E
500|$|Wyatt was {{repeatedly}} criticized {{in the media}} over {{the remainder of his}} life. His wife Josephine wrote, [...] "The falsehoods that were printed in some of the newspapers about him and the unjust accusations against him hurt Wyatt more deeply than anything <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to him during my life with him, with the exception of his mother's death and that of his father and brother, Warren." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{seems that}} some of the FA's {{officials}} had long held grudges against Ramsey. [...] The British journalist and author Leo McKinstry said [...] "England's most successful manager would have had a legacy fit for a hero {{had it not been for}} the malevolence of the FA chief Harold Thompson". [...] Alan Ball described the treatment of Ramsey as [...] "the most incredible thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in English football".|$|E
500|$|Clinkscales {{expressed}} regrets over leaving Queens after Norm Roberts, who {{had shown}} {{an interest in}} him, was hired by St. John's. While in Ocala, he tried to become better at basketball by doing 200 push-ups every night. He also visited his hometown during school vacations. In his time living in Florida, Clinkscales had a growth spurt and stood nearly at 6ft (1.83 m), boosting his performance on the court. Commenting on Clinkscales' decision to move to Florida, Clarence Washington said, [...] "Going down there {{was the best thing}} <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{declared}} himself gay {{in an interview}} with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, [...] "If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality". In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, [...] "It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to me". According to his first wife, Angie, Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy then restlessly {{wandered around}} the hotel, {{checking}} {{in on his}} staff. When asked if King's murder had {{reminded him of the}} 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, his brother, Kennedy replied, [...] "Well, that. But it makes me wonder what they might do to me too." [...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in the world." [...] Greenfield later said, [...] "I could not {{for the life of me}} understand that callousness until, of course, I realized he had been thinking of the death of his brother." ...|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{opposed the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold), the {{landmark}} {{campaign finance reform}} law. In 2001, during {{the debate on the}} bill, Hastert criticized Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, saying that McCain had [...] "bullied" [...] House Republicans by sending them letters in support of his campaign-finance reform proposals. Hastert called the legislation [...] "the worst thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to Congress" [...] and expressed the view that there were [...] "constitutional flaws" [...] in the legislation. Supporters of campaign-finance reform circumvented Hastert by means of a discharge petition, a seldom-used procedural mechanism in which a measure may be brought to a floor vote (over the objections of the speaker) if an absolute majority of Representatives sign a petition in support of doing so. The discharge petition was not successfully used again until 2015.|$|E
500|$|In December 1983, DJ François Kevorkian {{released}} a [...] "New York" [...] {{mix of the}} single on Megadisc records. Kevorkian geared the song for nightclub dancefloors. The track {{was intended to be}} pressed in limited numbers for New York club DJs. However, Rough Trade boss Geoff Travis liked the mix and gave the release wide distribution in the UK. Morrissey publicly disowned the mix, and urged fans not to purchase copies. Travis later claimed, [...] "it was my idea, but they agreed. They said 'Go ahead', then didn't like it so it was withdrawn." [...] He also said, [...] "Nothing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in the Smiths occurred without Morrissey's guidance; there's not one Smiths record that went out that Morrissey didn't ask to do, so there's nothing on my conscience." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1956 Curtiss-Wright began isotope {{work at the}} facility, and The New York Times {{published}} {{two stories}} on the new nuclear research laboratory that year, followed by a November 1957 report that the one-megawatt nuclear reactor was completed. In 1958, the corporation received a twenty-year license from the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to operate a four-megawatt pool-type nuclear research reactor, and received permission from the Pennsylvania Sanitary Water Board to dispose of some radioactive waste in Meeker Run, a tributary of Mosquito Creek. The project was billed as [...] "the greatest thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in North Central Pennsylvania", and was expected to employ between 7,000 and 8,000 people. Curtiss-Wright spent $30million on the project, and developed a community for its scientific and technical staff at the village of Pine Glen, southeast of Karthaus in Centre County.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} played only once and {{received}} minor treatments afterwards, {{with the addition}} of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song's length. Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. Nothing like <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to me in the studio in my whole life." [...] The band's original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns—songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.|$|E

[...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they {{recruited}} bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a period}} of adjustment, Selänne gained an {{appreciation}} for his new team; he quickly came to call the deal the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to him. He was paired with Paul Kariya, whom he met at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game, and the duo were counted on to lead the young franchise to a post-season berth for the first time. Selänne scored 36 points in 28 games with the Ducks, and combined with his Jets totals, finished the 1995–96 season with 108 points. He followed {{it up with a}} third 100-point season in 1996–97, finishing with 109, including 51 goals. He was named to the First All-Star Team for a second time, while he and Kariya led the Mighty Ducks into the franchise's first playoff appearance in 1997.

500|$|The {{loss of the}} Red Sox {{was seen}} as a manifestation of the Curse of the Bambino, long thought to be the reason behind all things bad <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to the Red Sox. Described as a [...] "shocking blast" [...] by the Sporting News, Dent's home run silenced the Fenway Park crowd. [...] For the light-hitting Dent, it was just his fifth home run of the 1978 season. It sealed Dent's {{reputation}} among Yankee fans, while inspiring the permanent nickname [...] "Bucky Fucking Dent" [...] in New England. Dent, later the manager of the Yankees, was fired during a series in Boston in 1990. Twenty-five years later, in Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series, Aaron Boone received similar treatment by Red Sox fans after he hit the home run {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning that clinched the pennant for the Yankees, but the Yankees would later lose to the Florida Marlins in the World Series, which went six games.|$|E

500|$|As {{the series}} ended its first season, a problem had arisen for the producers: the {{pregnancy}} of Gillian Anderson, who played Dana Scully. Some network executives wanted the role recast, which Carter refused to do. Though they considered having Scully {{giving birth to}} an alien child, the producers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy by having her abducted and appearing comatose several episodes later. This was described by executive producer Frank Spotnitz as [...] "the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to the series" [...] as it helped form the intricate mythology that would run throughout the show. The writers decided to close the X-Files {{at the end of}} the first season and thus separate Mulder and Scully in the earlier episodes of the season. To hide Anderson's pregnancy in the early episodes, the producers disguised it with [...] "very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing". Anderson was not featured at all in the episode [...] "3", as she was giving birth to her daughter at the time.|$|E
500|$|.....as I {{began to}} research, even I, {{as someone who}} had been paying {{attention}} {{to some of these}} sorts of things {{for a long time and}} was open to alternative explanations, even I was fairly astonished when I put it together, basically by going county by county and finding the criminal arrest records and the jail records in county after county after county from this period of time and seeing that if there had been crime waves, there had to have been records of crimes and people being arrested for crimes. And in reality, it's just not there."There's no evidence that <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened.</b> In fact, it's the opposite. The crime waves that occurred by and large were the aftermath of the war and whites coming back from fighting in the Civil War and settling scores with people and all sorts of renegade activity that didn't involve black people at all, but they were blamed for it, and that was then used as a kind of ruse for why these incredibly brutal new legal measures then began to be put in place." ...|$|E
