In this paper, a multiple models fuzzy PID controller is designed. Considering the air-condition <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> to combat aircraft and the frequently changing external environment the multiple fuzzy PID controllers are estimated according to the temperature changing area. Each time, based on temperature tested, only one fuzzy PID Controller is chosen to improve the control precision. At the end, simulation results show that multiple model fuzzy PID control is superior to the single fuzzy PID control, which effectively improve the transient response of the system, the steady state accuracy and robustness, having good prospects for engineering applications...|$|E

30|$|This paper optimizes {{the time}} series output of {{temperature}} controlling devices through <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{by combining the}} dynamic variation law of adjusted temperature and power consumption, thus indirectly adjusting power load. An optimal economic operation model of microgrid is established, which takes the minimum sum of fuel cost, start-stop cost, penalty for wind curtailment and cost of energy storage loss as the objective function. The model is solved by HPSO algorithm which is easy-to-operate, has high accuracy, and overcomes local optimum. An isolated community microgrid with heat pump {{is used in the}} case study and the heat pump properly participates in microgrid scheduling according to the <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> characteristics. The results show that <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> of <b>temperature</b> controlling devices can not only improve the economic efficiency of the microgrid, but also reduce charge–discharge cycles of the energy storage system and increase microgrid schedulability. In practical engineering applications, temperature controlling devices can adopt more complicated control strategies and realize minute-based scheduling of the microgrid which will be the key content of our future research.|$|R

40|$|In a {{hypersonic}} {{boundary layer}} over {{a wall of}} variable curvature, the region most susceptible to Goertler vortices is the <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> layer over which the basic state temperature decreases monotonically to its free stream value. Except for a special wall curvature distribution, the evolution of Goertler vortices trapped in the <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> layer will in general be strongly affected by the boundary layer growth through the O(M sup 3 / 2) curvature of the basic state, where M is the free stream Mach number. Only when the local wavenumber becomes as large as of order M sup 3 / 8, do nonparallel effects become negligible in the determination of stability properties. In the latter case, Goertler vortices will be trapped in {{a thin layer of}} O(epsilon sup 1 / 2) thickness which is embedded in the <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> layer; here epsilon is the inverse of the local wavenumber. A weakly nonlinear theory is presented in which the initial nonlinear development of Goertler vortices in the neighborhood of the neutral position is studied and two coupled evolution equations are derived. From these, it can be determined whether the vortices are decaying or growing depending on the sign of a constant which is related to wall curvature and the basic state temperature...|$|R

40|$|The Goertler vortex {{instability}} {{mechanism in}} a hypersonic boundary {{layer on a}} curved wall is investigated. The precise roles {{of the effects of}} boundary layer growth, wall cooling, and gas dissociation is clarified in the determination of stability properties. It is first assumed that the fluid is an ideal gas with viscosity given by Sutherland's law. It is shown that when the free stream Mach number M is large, the boundary layer divides into two sublayers: a wall layer of O(M sup 3 / 2) thickness over which the basic state temperature is O(M squared) and a <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> layer of O(1) thickness over which the basic state temperature decreases monotonically to its free stream value. Goertler vortices which have wavelengths comparable with the boundary layer thickness are referred to as wall modes. It is shown that their downstream evolution is governed by a set of parabolic partial differential equations and that they have the usual features of Goertler vortices in incompressible boundary layers. As the local wavenumber increases, the neutral Goertler number decreases and the center of vortex activity moves towards the <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> layer. Goertler vortices with wavenumbers of order one or larger must necessarily be trapped in the <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> layer and it is this mode which is most dangerous. For this mode, {{it was found that the}} leading order term in the Goertler number expansion is independent of the wavenumber and is due to the curvature of the basic state. This term is also the asymptotic limit of the neutral Goertler numbers of the wall mode. To determine the higher order corrections terms in the Goertler number expansion, two wall curvature cases are distinguished. Real gas effects were investigated by assuming that the fluid is an ideal dissociating gas. It was found that both gas dissociation and wall cooling are destabilizing for the mode trapped in the <b>temperature</b> <b>adjustment</b> layer, but for the wall mode trapped near the wall the effect of gas dissociation can be either destabilizing or stabilizing...|$|R

As {{a result of}} manufactured tolerance and external disturbance, the secondary mirror can&# 39;t arrive at designed position precisely after a deployable telescope is unfolded. We investigate an <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> with {{six degrees of freedom}} based on hexapod structure to solve this problem. There are mainly four parts in this paper. Firstly, the adjustment methods of deployable telescopes for microsatellites are introduced. Generally several kinds of optical components can be adjusted to align a deployed telescope: primary mirror, tip/tilt mirror and secondary mirror. Due to its high sensitivity and convenience, the secondary mirror is chosen to collimate the optical system of the telescope. Secondly, an <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> with hexapod structure is designed for a secondary mirror with 85 mm diameter. After comparing the characteristics of step motors, piezo actuators and voice coil motors (VCMs), VCMs are selected as the linear actuators. By using optical gratings as displacement sensors in the system, we can make closed-loop control come true. The hexapod structure mainly consists of 6 VCMs, 6 optical gratings and 6 oblique legs with flexible hinges. The secondary mirror <b>adjustment</b> <b>system</b> is 83 mm in diameter and 55 mm high. It has tip/tilt rotational ranges of ± 2. 205 ° with resolution of better than ± 0. 007 °, and translational ranges of ± 1. 545 mm with resolution of better than ± 0. 966 μm.
