40|$|The {{low-temperature}} ball/wedge {{wire bonding}} process {{is an essential}} precondition {{for the use of}} temperature sensitive materials in microelectronic packaging. Thus, the objective of the project was to achieve a high process reliability for wire bonding at temperatures as low as 80 C by utilizing a transducer system with a higher <b>frequency</b> (128 <b>kHz).</b> Supplementary tests with a 100 kHz transducer system have been conducted for the purpose of comparison. Furthermore, the bondability of contact systems with alternative top layers on the chip bond pads (Ni/Au) and on the lead frame (Pd) has been studied. Applying both <b>transducer</b> <b>frequencies</b> (100 <b>kHz</b> and 128 kHz), the goal was again to make thermosonic gold wire bond contacts reliably at 80 C process temperature. The results of the research project prove both objectives to be achieved. Evaluating long-term reliability tests, no significant differences to conventional wire bond contacts could be found. The project results can be transferred directly to regular manufacturing process without any delay because the research has already been done with automatic wire bond equipment. (orig.)

Since this velocity can {{be influenced by the}} specimen's dimension or by the <b>transducer's</b> <b>frequency,</b> this influence must be known to obtain reliable results.

40|$|To advance {{basic and}} applied {{research}} in the deep sea where human access isdifficult, studies were made on reliable techniques for underwater transmission ofdigital data by means of wideband ultrasound transducers. Several <b>transducers</b> withmultiple resonance <b>frequencies</b> in the wideband were developed to transmit acousticdata at high speeds. In particular, a tilted toroidal-beam wideband transducer wasdesigned {{on the basis of}} the free-flooded ring method. This transducer has a 40 kHzbandwidth that corresponds to 50 % of its central frequency. Linear and nonlinearadaptive equalizers were designed to reduce multipath effects, and these were used toprocess acoustic waves propagated through the sea. The transducer and adaptiveequalizers were successfully incorporated in a transmitter-and-receiver system. Finally,experiments carried out at 20 kHz with a 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation schemeshowed that it is possible to transmit data from a vehicle and from moored sensors in thedeep sea to a surface ship at a rate of 32 kbps. Almost identical transmissionexperiments were performed over a range of about 500 m using a quadrature phase-shiftkeying modulation scheme with a transmission rate of 80 kbps and a <b>transducer</b> ofcentral <b>frequency</b> 80 <b>kHz</b> to control a remotely operated unmanned vehicle.

40|$|Contributor: John Dalen 1. Review of {{the survey}} design of the {{international}} trawl- acoustic surveys in the Irminger Sea and adjacent waters. The methods of hydroacoustic and trawl estimation of abundance and biomass of pelagic redfish in the Irminger (and partly Labrador) Sea were reviewed under consideration of past experience, re-cent knowledge on the biology of the species and technological developments. Recommendations for the upcoming survey in June/July 2005 and for future work were developed by the Group. Especially the signal-to-noise ratios and tar-get strength models applied within the hydroacoustic measurements require fur-ther experimental work. The use of a lower <b>transducer</b> <b>frequency</b> (18 <b>kHz)</b> was also considered as a possibility for the estimation of redfish density below the “deep-scattering layer” (DSL). 2. Planning of the international trawl/acoustic survey of redfish in the Irminger Sea and adjacent waters in June/July 2005. Based on past experience and the suggested improvements that can already be implemented during the next survey in June/July 2005, the detailed survey plan for this survey was set up. Three ves-sels from Germany, Iceland and Russia {{will participate in the}} survey and operate within an area of around 400 000 NM 2 in the Irminger and Labrador Sea to esti-mate the abundance and biomass of pelagic redfish. In the depth zone that can be surveyed by hydroacoustic measurements, i. e. shallower than the DSL (down to about 350 m), hydroacoustic measurements and identification trawls will be car-ried out, whereas within and below the DSL (down to about 1000 m), redfish abundance can currently only be estimated by trawls. The Group decided that the trawling duration of the deeper hauls will be expanded to at least 3 hours to in-crease the catch rates for a more precise abundance estimation. As in the past sur-veys, biological data will be collected from the redfish caught by the pelagic nets employed, and hydrographic measurements will be taken on regular stations on the survey tracks. 3. Required frequency, number of vessels needed and timing of future surveys. Although an annual survey would certainly allow an improved estimation of in-terannual changes in distribution and abundance, the Group felt that the continua-tion of bi-annual surveys would be more realistic, considering limitations in na-tional budgets for survey time. The Group recommends that at least four vessels should participate to allow a sufficiently dense coverage {{of the survey}} area. The efforts directed at involving other nations in the survey should be continued. Since the most recent survey in May-June 2003 was carried out about 3 weeks earlier than previous surveys and pointed to considerable seasonal effects, the Group recommends to keep the timing of the survey from (mid-) June to (mid- to late) July...|$|R
