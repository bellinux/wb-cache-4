On {{the basis}} of {{analyzing}} the cutting edge structure and cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> measurement of high-speed insert, thermal- mechanical coupling finite element method (FEM) is used in this paper, to obtain the effect law of different cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> on the mechanical-thermal distribution of high-speed cutting TiAl 6 V 4.

There is a clear exposition of the intrinsic reason why the cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> has influence on the mechanical-thermal distribution of high-speed cutting process. The {{results indicate that the}} experimental results have a good agreement with FEM; with the cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> increases, cutting force increases; cutting temperature is not monotonic, but there exists an optimum <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> that makes temperature lowest; cutting edge changes the plastic flow of materials around tool tip and broaden plastic deformation zone.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} avoid the {{stochastic}} damage of micro cleavage on cutting edge, a brittle-ductile transition lapping mechanism is proposed for the mechanical lapping of single crystal diamond cutting tools to direct the tools lapping. As expected, the critical depths of cut for brittle-ductile transition in different orientations and on different crystal planes are calculated. According to the theoretical results, the actual dynamic depth of cut is controlled within the critical depth of cut, which ensures that the tool lapping is carried out in ductile regime and the changes of cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> characterize with some specific time laws in lapping. Therefore, the time series and nonlinear least square methods are used to analyze the changing laws of cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius.</b> As a result, a coupled model to build a bridge between the cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> changes and lapping time is developed. In terms of this developed model, a required cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> restricts a tool’s lapping time. Above all, the cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> is known in advance and has no needs measuring. So the production efficiency of diamond cutting tools is improved and its production cost is reduced accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Diamond {{coatings}} {{have been}} increasingly used in cutting tools applications. Coating delamination {{is the major}} tool failure mode and occurs due to deposition-induced residual stresses and thermomechanical loading in machining. This study applies finite element analysis to investigate stress distributions, with the <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> focused, in diamond coating tools considering depositions and machining. After depositions, the residual stresses around the edge are compressive and tensile for the radial and tangential components, respectively, with high stress concentrations. The stress concentrations can be alleviated by a large <b>edge</b> <b>radius.</b> When machining loading is imposed, stress reversal occurs on both components, i. e., radial (or tangential) stresses shifting toward less tensile (or compressive). For the <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> effects, at a low feed, increasing the hone radius will reduce the maximum tangential normal stress (from compression toward tension). However, the <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> seems to have minor effects at a high feed...|$|R

A coupled thermal-mechanical {{model of}} plane-strain {{orthogonal}} metal cutting with continuous chip formation is developed {{to investigate the}} residual stresses in the finished workpiece.

30|$|Besides that, {{when the}} UCT is {{comparable}} to the cutting tool <b>edge</b> <b>radius,</b> the tool could no longer be simplified as a sharp edge. The interactions between the cutting tool edge and the materials make the material deform in different ways. For instance, the shearing plane which used to be a plane [11 – 13] extends to a shearing zone [14, 15]. Woon et al. [15] systematically investigate the effect of tool <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> on the material deformation behavior {{in a wide range of}} UCT. In nano-cutting process, Fang et al. [16, 17] propose that the materials are extruded in front of the cutting tool when the UCT is much less than tool <b>edge</b> <b>radius.</b> Woon et al. [18] also found an extrusion-like material deformation behavior at a critical combination of UCT and tool edge [18]. Simoneau et al. [19] found the chip formation changes from the shearing to a quasi-shear-extrusion mechanism with a decrease of UCT. When UCT decrease to a critical value, the material cannot remove stably or just no formation of chip. The threshold value is defined as the minimum UCT. It is a key parameter which strongly relates to the material separation mechanisms in front of the tool edge and determines the machined surface quality. Two major mechanisms have been proposed in describing the material separation at the cutting tool edge [20, 21]. One is based on the existence of stagnation point at the tool edge [22], another one is based on the formation of stagnation region in which the material flow velocity is almost zero [23]. The stagnation point or the tip of stagnation region is where the workpiece material starts to split into two parts to form the chip or the machined surface. The material deformation mechanism influenced by tool edge would further affect the generated surface quality. The cutting edge with large <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> results in higher average surface roughness values than that with small <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> [24], and the effect of the cutting <b>edge</b> <b>radius</b> on the surface roughness decreased with an increase in workpiece hardness.
