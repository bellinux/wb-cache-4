5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of <b>this</b> <b>division</b> differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. <b>This</b> <b>division</b> and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
