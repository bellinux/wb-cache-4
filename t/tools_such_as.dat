5|$|Metalwork was an {{important}} and well-developed craft, and metal <b>tools</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> axes, mammoties and hoes were widely used.

The development of new, regionally relevant <b>tools,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> those used for the collection of marine resources seen at Abdur, Ethiopia, Pinnacle Point Cave, South Africa, and Blombos Cave, South Africa. The use of fire demonstrates another innovative aspect of human behavior when it is used in order to create stronger <b>tools,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the heated silcrete at Blombos, Howiesons Poort and Still Bay, and the heat treated bone tools from Still Bay.|$|E

Hazel, birch and willow grew in the area at this time but the pine and oak must have been driftwood or imported timber.|$|E
