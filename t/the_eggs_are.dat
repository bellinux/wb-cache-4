5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton Zoo, Auckland Zoo and Wellington Zoo also breed tuatara {{for release}} into the wild. At Auckland Zoo in the 1990s it was {{discovered}} that the temperature at which <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> incubated determines the sex of the animal.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches lay {{four to six}} bluish-white eggs, {{which are}} oval in shape and about , {{roughly the size of}} a peanut. It is thought that they are laid during the night. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{incubated}} by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Sapphire Pendant <b>Egg</b> <b>was</b> sent to Tsar Alexander III on April 5, 1886 from Fabergé's workshop. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> {{presented}} by <b>the</b> Tsar to Tsarina Marie Fedorovna on April 13 {{of the same}} year. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> housed in <b>the</b> Anichkov Palace until the Revolution. The last documented location of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> from <b>the</b> archive of the provisional government's inventory in 1922 when <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> held in <b>the</b> Armory Palace of the Kremlin. It is not known whether <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> lost or is currently in private hands.|$|R
50|$|In placental mammals, where <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> nourished from <b>the</b> mother {{throughout}} the whole fetal period, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> reduced in size to essentially a naked egg cell (zygote).|$|R
5000|$|Another common {{practice}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of <b>eggs</b> {{as a form}} of cleansing or to remove the Evil Eye. In this exercise, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> washed, dried, and then covered in Holy Water while the practitioner prays over it, saying an Apostles' Creed, an Our Father, and three Hail Marys. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> then rolled over the alleged victim's body in a loosely prescribed pattern, paying especial attention to any area which may feel the most pain; <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> believed to absorb any negative energy. After doing this with <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> for fifteen minutes, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> broken by throwing it in the toilet and flushing the remains.|$|R
5|$|Clutch size {{depends on}} the {{location}} and the food source, but generally Aerodramus swiftlets lay one or two eggs. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> a dull white, and are laid every other day. Many, if not all, species are colonial nesters; some build their nests in high, dark corners on cave walls.|$|E
5|$|Egg laying {{dates and}} clutch size vary by region; in Texas {{the time period}} is from late February to late August, in Iowa it ranges from late April to June. The clutch size is {{generally}} 3 to 6 eggs, but can reach as high as seven in Texas. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots, and are more heavily marked at the broad end. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> incubated by the female for 12–16 days. After the young hatch, they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days. As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season. In one study, three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area.|$|E
5|$|In the argonaut (paper nautilus), {{the female}} secretes a fine, fluted, papery shell in which <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{deposited}} {{and in which}} she also resides while floating in mid-ocean. In this she broods the young, and it {{also serves as a}} buoyancy aid allowing her to adjust her depth. The male argonaut is minute by comparison and has no shell.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> yellowish-green in colour, but {{changes during}} {{development}} to a yellowish-gold, the area under the spines becoming orange, which, as development continues, spreads till more than hall <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> coloured.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> largest cell in {{the human}} body and {{contains}} a high amount of water. When <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> frozen, <b>the</b> ice crystals that form can destroy the integrity of the cell. To prevent this, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> must <b>be</b> dehydrated prior to freezing. This is done using cryoprotectants which replace most of the water within the cell and inhibit the formation of ice crystals.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Egg</b> <b>was</b> first {{given to}} Tsarina Alexandra of Imperial Russia on Easter of 1897. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> {{displayed}} in <b>the</b> Empress' apartment at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, resting in a jewelled carriage. Upon {{the fall of}} the Romanov Dynasty, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> confiscated by <b>the</b> Provisional Government in 1917 and was listed among the treasures removed from the Anichkov Palace. It was then dispatched to the Kremlin and finally transferred to the Sovnarkom in 1922 for sale.|$|R
5|$|Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows {{tunnelled}} into vertical sandy banks, {{often at}} the side of a river or in flat ground. As they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.|$|E
5|$|Tanaka et al. (2015) {{found that}} among modern archosaurs (the group {{including}} birds, crocodilians, and dinosaurs), the porosity of eggshells {{can be used}} to accurately predict whether <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> buried or laid in open nests. They concluded that Macroolithus nests were either open or only partially covered with vegetation. The eggs' blue-green coloration could have acted as a camouflage to hide the nest from predators.|$|E
5|$|The clutch size is two eggs, {{which is}} low for such small rails. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> greyish milk white dotted with brown-rufous spots and lavender-mauve spots that are {{concentrated}} around {{the apex of}} the egg. They are large for the size of the mother compared to other rails, and resemble the eggs of the corn crake.|$|E
5000|$|Executed in gold, {{the curves}} are set with {{diamonds}} and rubies. The body of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> covered in laurel leaves and bulrushes that are chased in 14-carat green gold. These symbolize {{the source of}} the [...] "living waters". The spikyheads are set with square rubies. White enamel ribbons inscribed with historical details encircle <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> On <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> an enameled wreath which encircles Nicholas II's monogram. The bottom of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> adorned with <b>the</b> double-headed imperial eagle, made of black enamel and crowned with two diamonds.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> 2 {{millimeters}} wide.|$|R
50|$|Other solid {{ingredients}} (such as mushrooms, clams, or crab meat) {{may also}} be added to <b>the</b> mixture. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> mixture <b>is</b> poured into a dish, which is then placed in a steamer and steamed until fully cooked. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> should <b>be</b> steamed until just firm, so that the texture of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>is</b> still smooth and silky. A plate is usually placed {{on top of the}} bowl containing <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> mixture and left on while <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> being steamed. Uncapped steamed eggs will have water on top of the finished dish due to the steam.|$|R
5|$|The date of {{egg-laying}} varies {{according to}} locality, but is generally from February to March in the Northern Hemisphere, and from July to August in the Southern Hemisphere, although the Australian subspecies macropus may breed as late as November, and equatorial populations may nest anytime between June and December. If <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> lost early in the nesting season, the female usually lays another clutch, although this is extremely rare in the Arctic due to the short summer season. Generally three to four eggs, but sometimes as few as one or as many as five, are laid in the scrape. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> white to buff with red or brown markings. They are incubated for 29 to 33 days, mainly by the female, with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day, but only the female incubating them at night. The average number of young found in nests is 2.5, and the average number that fledge is about 1.5, due to the occasional production of infertile eggs and various natural losses of nestlings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{incubated}} by {{the female}} for 14–15 days to hatching. Chicks are fed initially by the male, both parents sharing the duty {{after a few}} days when the female does not need to brood so often, and they fledge in a further 14–15 days. There may be two broods in a year.|$|E
5|$|The female banded sea kraits {{then lay}} {{as many as}} 10 eggs per clutch. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{deposited}} in crevices where they remain until hatching. These eggs are very rarely found in the wild; only two nests have been definitively reported throughout {{the entire range of}} the species.|$|E
5|$|The top of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> {{depressed}} and forms a small central cavity called micropyle through which <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> fertilised. <b>The</b> micropyle is situated on top in <b>eggs</b> which <b>are</b> globular, conical, or cylindrical; in those <b>eggs</b> which <b>are</b> flattened or lenticular, the micropyle {{is located on}} the outer margin or rim.|$|R
5|$|The {{scene of}} Kane {{inspecting}} <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> shot in post-production. A fiberglass <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light {{on it and}} see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> while wearing rubber gloves. The top of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> hydraulic, and <b>the</b> innards were a cow's stomach and tripe. Test shots of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason {{the image of a}} hen's <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> used on <b>the</b> poster, and has become emblematic of the franchise as a whole—as opposed to <b>the</b> Alien <b>egg</b> that appears in the finished film.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> elliptical, about 2 mm long, {{and pure}} white. It is almost {{flat on the}} ventral surface, and more convex on <b>the</b> dorsal. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> often {{somewhat}} longitudinally curved.|$|R
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and {{powerful}} jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} a {{depression}} in the ground, {{which may or may}} not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and fledge after 21–24 days. If the parents are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} eggs laid depends on species, with batch sizes ranging {{from two to}} several dozen. The total number of eggs {{produced}} in a female's lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several thousand. In some species, the flea lives in the nest or burrow and <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> deposited on the substrate, but in others, <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid on the host itself and can easily fall off onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps {{become one of the}} primary habitats of eggs and developing larvae. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Experiments have shown that fleas lay more eggs on hosts which have limited food intakes, and that eggs and larvae survive better under these conditions, perhaps because the host's immune system is compromised.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDrosophila melanogaster mature oocytes in ovaries {{are arrested}} at {{metaphase}} I of meiosis. Eggs that {{have reached the}} uterus have released this arrest. It was not known where in the female reproductive tract egg activation occurs and what triggers it. We investigated when and where <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> activated in Drosophila in vivo and at what meiotic stage <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> fertilized. We found that changes in <b>the</b> <b>egg's</b> envelope's permeability, one feature of activation, initiate during ovulation, even while most of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> still within <b>the</b> ovary. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> becomes impermeable as it proceeds down the oviducts; the process is complete by <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> uterus. Cross-linking of vitelline membrane protein sV 23 also increases progressively as <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> moves through <b>the</b> oviducts and the uterus. Activation also triggers meiosis to resume before <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> reaches <b>the</b> uterus, such that <b>the</b> earliest <b>eggs</b> that reach <b>the</b> uterus are in anaphase I. We discuss models for Drosophila egg activation in vivo...|$|R
50|$|The size of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> 0.5 mm.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> {{covered in}} pearls {{and topped with}} rose pink enamel on a guilloché field. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> {{supported}} by cabriolet legs of green-gold leaves with rose-cut diamond dewdrops. The gold-stemmed lilies have green enameled leaves and flowers made of gold set with rubies, pearls, and diamonds.|$|R
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> then laid.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
50|$|Peeling a cooked <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> easiest when <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> {{put into}} boiling water {{as opposed to}} slowly heating <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> in cold water.|$|R
50|$|The Lilies of <b>the</b> Valley <b>Egg</b> <b>is</b> a jewelled Fabergé <b>egg</b> {{made under}} <b>the</b> {{supervision}} of the Russian jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé in 1898 by Fabergé ateliers.
