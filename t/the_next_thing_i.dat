500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did... everything was such a blur to me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{subsequent}} interview with New York magazine, Hersh regretted that [...] "I actually didn't quite say what I {{wanted to say}} correctly. ... It wasn't that inaccurate, but it was misstated. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know, {{it was all over}} the blogs. And I just realized then, the power of—and so you have to try and be more careful." [...] In Chain of Command, he wrote that one of the witness statements he had read described the rape of a boy by a foreign contract interpreter at Abu Ghraib, during which a woman took pictures.|$|E
60|$|I never {{pretended to}} {{understand}} Private Ortheris; and so <b>I</b> did <b>the</b> <b>next</b> best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> left him alone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have hardly thought: I cannot tell at all. But we will {{consider}} that after <b>I</b> have done. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> is, <b>I</b> am to dine here Thursday--that is, to-morrow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, also, I {{suppose that}} thou wilt say in thy heart, I would you would show us {{then what is}} saving faith; which thing it may be I may touch upon a while hence, in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> am to speak unto. O they that have that are safe indeed! ...|$|R
2500|$|When he was 16, {{and still}} in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp for Jewish {{children}} in upstate New York, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then {{became aware of the}} possibility of writing his own songs. [...] "And <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> got a guitar {{when we got back to}} Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs," [...] he said. He adds that his attraction to songwriting was the [...] "first real interest" [...] he had growing up, besides helping him release his youthful [...] "frustrations".|$|E
2500|$|Jordan's script {{called for}} a group of five con artists or [...] "grifters", {{with a wide range of}} ages, {{appearances}} and experience. [...] The production team cast Adrian Lester, at the time playing Henry V at the National Theatre, as Michael Stone, the leader of the group; Marc Warren as Danny Blue, Stone's younger protégé; and Robert Glenister as Ash Morgan, the [...] "fixer"; in August 2003. Although having numerous credits in film and on the stage, Lester was an unknown face in television, having had less than two hours' broadcast screen time prior to the first Hustle series. Lester explained that he [...] "couldn't imagine playing the same character for years, but Hustle was completely different. In the very first rehearsal we were doing a dance routine and then <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know I'm whacking out several different accents and I just thought, 'I'm in heaven, this is great!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not hear}} {{anything}} about it for some time afterwards: I remember them coming in at the gate, {{and the sight of}} Polly's face, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> recollect, was that I was laying on the sofa, with Polly crying softly over me, and Dr. Whitmore standing beside me.|$|R
60|$|SECOND.--The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> am to prove, is this; namely, That by this Jesus Christ, the Son of the Virgin, {{the world}} was made: And here I shall be brief, having touched on it already. Only I shall lay {{down some of the}} scriptures, that hold forth this to be a truth, and so pass to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>things</b> that <b>I</b> intend to speak of.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was an accident," [...] groaned the Colonel. [...] "Your {{wife was}} looking at my new gun. I {{told her it was}} loaded, and that she must be careful, and I thought she had put it down. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> heard was the report. It is all my cursed fault for leaving the {{cartridges}} in." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{lull in the}} {{conversation}} followed, but Hasluck was not thin-skinned, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> distinguished was his cheery laugh.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew I was on Cowan's shoulders, {{and he was}} tearing {{round and}} round the fort with two {{companies}} at his heels.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I {{already had}} a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well {{supplied}} with arms.|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{when the}} time came for the steamer to start, the young man said to Toby: [...] "Now, my boy, you won't feel hard at me for {{shooting}} the monkey, will you? I would have done anything to bring him back to life, but, as I could not do that, helping you to get home was <b>the</b> <b>next</b> best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could do." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They spoke {{together}} for a little, and though none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't go home, to be {{laughed at}} by Chris and Abner. I'll shoot something, if I stay all night. Who cares for hunger and {{mosquito}} bites? Not I. Hunters can bear more than that, <b>I</b> guess. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> live <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> see I'll shoot it, {{and make a}} fire and have a jolly supper. Now which way will I go,--up or down? A pretty hard prospect, either way." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{did was to}} {{take the}} liberty which she had already sanctioned--I mean the liberty of reading what she had written. Here it is, copied exactly: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{saw was the}} top-knot {{of silver}} hair surmounting Captain Ellis' smooth red face, {{which would have been}} apoplectic if it hadn't had such a fresh appearance.|$|E
60|$|JUDITH (wearily). Then {{you were}} here: that's <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> remember. I suppose I fainted. Now bid me goodbye, Tony. Perhaps I shall faint again. I wish I could die.|$|E
60|$|Bel. You {{need not}} doubt me, madam; I am more in your power {{than you can}} be in mine: Besides, if I were once known in town, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing,</b> for aught <b>I</b> know, would be to bring me before the fathers of the inquisition.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> {{remember}} is {{the coming of}} the men of Agger. This cannot have been very long after Steinar went to Lesso, for he had not yet returned. Being still weak from my great illness, I was seated in the sun in the shelter of the house, wrapped up in a cloak of deerskins--for the northern wind blew bitter. By me stood my father, who was in a happy mood now he knew that I should live and be strong again.|$|R
60|$|I was too dazed {{to realise}} very clearly what {{happened}} after that. Dompierre, I know, kicked {{open the door of}} the house, and the crowd rushed in, in his wake. I managed to keep my feet and to work my way gradually out of the crowd. I must have gone on mechanically, almost unconsciously, for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> remember with any distinctness was that I found myself once more speeding down the Rue Blanche, with all the yelling and shouting some little way behind me.|$|R
60|$|Meg {{began to}} cry. I suppose {{she looked at}} him through her tears. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard was a cry from the old woman, and the sound of {{staggering}} feet.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> {{heard my}} uncle calling me, {{and found the}} pair in the road together. It was the captain who {{addressed}} me, and that with an air (very flattering to a young lad) of grave equality.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{after this}} she {{announced}} that she meant to see Morris once {{to say good-bye to}} him before she went to London, and left me. Practically <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard about her was that she was dead." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sigi {{comes up}} to me after a game and says, [...] "See you on the state team." [...] But I wasn't on <b>the</b> state team. <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, I got a tryout {{and was on the}} team, and it was his doing. Obviously, I owe a lot to him.

6000|$|... "I went to bed, {{and waited}} for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> to happen. <b>I</b> found my {{thunderbolt}} waiting for me when I woke up. I didn't {{know what it was}} going to be, but when I felt a ring through the envelope of that note I knew what it was. I mind-read that note before I opened it." ...|$|R
6000|$|How {{very kind}} of you, dearest Mrs. Martin, to write to me so much at length and at such a time. Indeed, it was exactly the time when, if we were where we have been, we should have wished you to walk over the hill and talk to us; and although, after all that the most zealous friends of letter writing can say for it, it {{is not such a}} happy thing as talking with those you care for, yet it is <b>the</b> <b>next</b> happiest <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> am sure I thought so when I read your letter ...|$|R
6000|$|For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> became {{conscious}} of {{was that the}} cart was at a standstill, and that the pony stood cropping the thyme-sweet turf by the wayside. I touched the cold dark hand. [...] "Hush, my dear, we are here!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} have been {{unconscious}} more than a few seconds, and yet I know that I was unconscious, for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> realized was that a growing radiance was illuminating the corridor about me and the eyes were gone.|$|E
60|$|At last, I fell asleep, {{dreaming about}} Harry {{fighting}} a duel of dice-boxes with the military-looking man below; and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, was {{the glare of}} a light before my eyes, and Harry himself, very pale, stood before me.|$|E
5000|$|... "Aghartas what {{we start}} with in the movie. Our point of {{departure}} is the silent period, the five years in which Miles didn't really play — '75 to '79. I believe his music got {{to a place where}} he pushed it as far as he could. He'd been so prolific and had followed that muse wherever it went. I know he was exhausted at that point. Not just musically but physically and emotionally. If you're on that sort of train where you've got to keep coming up with <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> — <b>I</b> can imagine how exhausting that can be."

5000|$|Speaking of the album's {{release and}} lack of {{commercial}} success, Lea said: [...] "It dropped drastically. But that wasn't the point, you see it got us the footing in London, {{so it was a}} case of mission accomplished for us. Chas Chandler took us over. We still had some time to run on our contract with Bavistock, so we released our next two singles on Fontana. There were some internal hassles between Chas and the new boss of Fontana, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> knew was that we were out of the Fontana deal. Chas had connections with Polydor, due to when he managed Jimi Hendrix, so we signed a contract with them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Development {{was handled}} by {{the creator of the}} Ace Attorney series, Shu Takumi. [...] "I first thought of this idea about five years ago," [...] Takumi told Famitsu. [...] "We were working on the third Ace Attorney and figured it was time to start {{thinking}} about <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing.</b> So <b>I</b> {{came up with a plan}} to make a new type of mystery, something different in style from Ace Attorney."The game was originally titled as [...] "Ghost Spy", and was later renamed as [...] "Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective". Following a release on the Nintendo DS in Japan on December 2010, the iOS version was released for the rest of the world on February 2, 2012. The first two chapters are available for free, with additional chapters costing extra.|$|R
