40|$|Abstract Background In Singapore, an {{outbreak}} of fungal keratitis caused {{by members of the}} Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) was identified in March 2005 to May 2006 involving 66 patients. Epidemiological investigations have indicated that improper contact lens wear and the use of specific contact lens solutions were risk factors. Methods We assessed the genetic diversity of the isolates using AFLP, Rep-PCR, and ERIC-PCR and compared the usefulness of these typing schemes to characterize the isolates. Results AFLP was the most discriminative typing scheme and appears to group FSSC from eye infections and from other infections differently. Conclusion There was a high genomic heterogeneity among the isolates confirming that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a <b>point</b> source outbreak. </p...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of state}} is {{questioned}} using the theological point of view. Therefore <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> work of sociology, political or historical science.

The aim of <b>this</b> work <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>pointing</b> on specific cases but looking for moral theology principles and rules. The starting point is that state can never a be direct object of theological studies because that can only be an individual person. The main rule for searching the answers is the fact, that state should only be one of tools for delivering the common good. Also the common good should never be considered the target itself, because the common good only embraces the sum of conditions whereby man can attain its perfection.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} {{mechanism}} by which feature selection improves the accuracy of supervised learning. An empirical bias/variance analysis as feature selection progresses indicates that the most accurate feature set corresponds to the best bias-variance trade-off point for the learning algorithm. Often, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the <b>point</b> separating relevant from irrelevant features, but where increasing variance outweighs the gains from adding more (weakly) relevant features. In other words, feature selection {{can be viewed as}} a variance reduction method that trades off the benefits of decreased variance (from the reduction in dimensionality) with the harm of increased bias (from eliminating some of the relevant features). If a variance reduction method like bagging is used, more (weakly) relevant features can be exploited and the most accurate feature set is usually larger. In many cases, the best performance is obtained by using all available features. ...|$|R

Contrary to widespread belief, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the <b>point</b> at which the individual thinks they cannot complete any more repetitions, but rather the first repetition that fails due to inadequate muscular strength. Training to failure is a controversial topic with some advocating training to failure on all sets while others believe that this will lead to overtraining, and suggest training to failure only on the last set of an exercise. Some practitioners recommend finishing a set of repetitions just before reaching a personal maximum at a given time.
