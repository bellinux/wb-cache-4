5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, saw <b>this</b> <b>constant</b> {{allusion to}} the theatre as an {{indication}} that Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's renunciation of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. This theory persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, <b>this</b> <b>constant</b> synthesis {{makes it easy to}} spot the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E

5|$|Continual {{growth and}} outside {{investments}} {{during these years}} allowed the company to expand and grow: Odwalla's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59million in sales, their highest ever. <b>This</b> <b>constant</b> growth made Odwalla {{one of the largest}} fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they would reach $100million in sales by 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla's products were healthier than regular juice because of unpasteurization.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that <b>this</b> <b>constant</b> provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} used determine the substrate's dielectric constant. <b>This</b> <b>constant</b> is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As <b>this</b> <b>constant</b> determines the signal propagation speed, frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in wideband applications; as flat dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as achievable is important here. The impedance of transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.|$|E

40|$|Planck {{constant}} {{is thought}} {{to belong to the}} universal constants among the fundamental physical <b>constants.</b> However, <b>this</b> paper demonstrates that, just like the fine-structure constant α and the Rydberg constant R∞, Planck constant belongs to the micro material <b>constants.</b> <b>This</b> paper also identifies the existence of a constant smaller than Planck <b>constant.</b> <b>This</b> new <b>constant</b> is a physical quantity with dimensions of angular momentum, just like the Planck <b>constant.</b> Furthermore, <b>this</b> paper points out the possibility that an unknown energy level, which cannot be explained with quantum mechanics, exists in the hydrogen atom...|$|R

25|$|Horses {{maintain}} {{visual contact}} with their family and herd at all times and have a host of ways to communicate with one another, including vocalizations, scent marking, and {{a wide range of}} visual and tactile signals. Each kick, groom, tilt of the ear, or other contact with another horse is a means of communicating. <b>This</b> <b>constant</b> communication leads to complex social behaviors among Przewalski's horses.|$|E
25|$|The Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked {{minerals}} and trees. Sumerian structures {{were made of}} plano-convex mudbrick, not fixed with mortar or cement. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. <b>This</b> <b>constant</b> rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as tells, are found throughout the ancient Near East.|$|E
