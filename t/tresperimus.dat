40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test the}} {{efficiency}} of locally administrated <b>tresperimus</b> in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). METHODS: EAU was induced in Lewis rats by S-antigen (S-Ag) immunization. Three intravitreal injections of <b>tresperimus</b> (prevention or prevention/treatment protocols) were performed at different time points after immunization. The pharmacokinetics of <b>tresperimus</b> was evaluated in the ocular tissues and plasma. The in vitro effect of <b>tresperimus</b> was evaluated on macrophages. EAU was graded clinically and histologically. Blood ocular barrier permeability was evaluated by protein concentration in ocular fluids. Immune response to S-Ag was examined by delayed type hypersensitivity, the expression of inflammatory cytokines in lymph nodes, ocular fluids and serum by multiplex ELISA, and in ocular cells by RT-PCR. RESULTS: In vitro, <b>tresperimus</b> significantly reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. In vivo, in the treatment protocol, efficient <b>tresperimus</b> levels were measured in the eye {{but not in the}} plasma up to 8 days after the last injection. <b>Tresperimus</b> efficiently reduced inflammation, retinal damage, and blood ocular barrier permeability breakdown. It inhibited nitric oxide synthase- 2 and nuclear factor ÎºBp 65 expression in ocular macrophages. IL- 2 and IL- 17 were decreased in ocular media, while IL- 18 was increased. By contrast, IL- 2 and IL- 17 levels were not modified in inguinal lymph nodes draining the immunization site. Moreover, cytokine levels in serum and delayed type hypersensitivity to S-Ag were not different in control and treated rats. In the prevention/treatment protocol, ocular immunosuppressive effects were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Locally administered <b>tresperimus</b> appears to be a potential immunosuppressive agent in the management of intraocular inflammation...|$|E
