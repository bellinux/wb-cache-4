5|$|Wealth, like {{income and}} <b>taxes,</b> <b>is</b> highly concentrated; the richest 10% {{of the adult}} {{population}} possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%. According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016. Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value. Since peaking {{in the second quarter of}} 2007, household wealth was down $14trillion, but has since increased $14trillion over 2006 levels. At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8trillion, down from $13.8trillion at the end of 2008.|$|E

50|$|The {{property}} <b>tax</b> most citizens <b>are</b> {{aware of}} {{is known as}} an ad valorem <b>tax.</b> This <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> used to fund general or day-to-day government operations.

The ad valorem <b>tax</b> levy <b>is</b> based upon a millage rate which never varies from parcel to parcel. The foundation principles for ad valorem <b>taxes</b> <b>are</b> that each property is valued according to its market value (equity) and that each property <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> based upon a single millage rate that applies to everyone (uniformity).|$|R

25|$|The levying {{of taxes}} aims to raise revenue to fund {{governing}} and/or to alter prices in order to affect demand. States and their functional equivalents throughout history have used money provided by taxation to carry out many functions. Some of these include expenditures on economic infrastructure (roads, public transportation, sanitation, legal systems, public safety, education, health-care systems), military, scientific research, culture and the arts, public works, distribution, data collection and dissemination, public insurance, and the operation of government itself.

In 2013, Bucharest had a nominal GDP per-capita €20,564 ($27.300), or 122% that of the European Union average and more than twice the Romanian average. After relative stagnation in the 1990s, the city's strong economic growth has revitalized infrastructure and {{led to the development of}} shopping malls, residential estates, and high-rise office buildings.

25|$|Workers {{must pay}} 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no {{tax on income}} in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, {{for people in the}} bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to <b>taxes</b> <b>is</b> almost three times as high as it is for those in the top fifth.|$|E
25|$|Switzerland is {{a federal}} {{republic}} in which {{the sovereignty of the}} constituent states (the cantons) is limited by the enumerated powers delegated to the federal state (the Confederation) through the federal constitution. Consequently, the original authority to levy <b>taxes</b> <b>is</b> vested in the individual cantons of Switzerland through their constitutions. Within the bounds of the authority delegated to them by cantonal law, the municipalities may also levy taxes. The extent of that authority varies from canton to canton. While the formal framework of the most important cantonal direct taxes has been harmonised through the 1990 Federal Tax Harmonisation Law, the cantons (and, as the case may be, the municipalities) remain free to set their tax rates or establish new taxes, except on tax objects already taxed under federal law.|$|E

50|$|A fuel tax (also {{known as}} a petrol, {{gasoline}} or gas tax, or as a fuel duty) <b>is</b> an excise <b>tax</b> imposed {{on the sale of}} fuel. In most countries the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> imposed on fuels which are intended for transportation. Fuels used to power agricultural vehicles, and/or home heating oil which is similar to diesel <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> at a different, usually lower rate. The fuel <b>tax</b> receipts <b>are</b> often dedicated or hypothecated to transportation projects so that the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> considered by many a user fee. In other countries, the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> a source of general revenue. Sometimes, the fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> used as an ecotax, to promote ecological sustainability.

25|$|In 1895 the United States Supreme Court, in its {{ruling in}} Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., held a tax based on {{receipts}} {{from the use}} of property to be unconstitutional. The Court held that taxes on rents from real estate, on interest income from personal property and other income from personal property (which includes dividend income) were treated as direct taxes on property, and therefore had to be apportioned (divided among the states based on their populations). Since apportionment of income <b>taxes</b> <b>is</b> impractical, this had the effect of prohibiting a federal tax on income from property. However, the Court affirmed that the Constitution did not deny Congress the power to impose a tax on real and personal property, and it affirmed that such would be a direct tax. Due to the political difficulties of taxing individual wages without taxing income from property, a federal income tax was impractical {{from the time of the}} Pollock decision until the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (below).|$|E
25|$|Since World War II, {{the federal}} {{constitution}} authorizes the Confederation to levy {{a number of}} taxes, the most significant of which are an income tax, a withholding tax and a value added tax. However, Switzerland is unique among modern sovereign states in that the authority to levy these <b>taxes</b> <b>is</b> limited in duration and extent. The Constitution imposes an upper limit on the federal tax rates and causes the federal authority to levy taxes to expire in 2020. A renewal of that authority requires a constitutional amendment, which must be approved in a popular referendum by both {{a majority of the}} popular vote and the cantons. If that renewal is not approved at the polls (as it has been six times since 1958), the Confederation itself will conceivably dissolve for lack of funds. All attempts to remove this limitation by amending the constitution to provide for a permanent federal authority to levy taxes have been rejected in Parliament or – no less than five times – by popular vote, most recently in 1991.|$|E

500|$|The FairTax {{statutory}} rate, {{unlike most}} U.S. state-level sales <b>taxes,</b> <b>is</b> presented on a tax base {{that includes the}} amount of FairTax paid. For example, a final after-tax price of $100 includes $23 of taxes. Although no such requirement {{is included in the}} text of the legislation, Congressman John Linder has stated that the FairTax would be implemented as an inclusive tax, which would include the tax in the retail price, not added on at checkout—an item on the shelf for five dollars would be five dollars total. The legislation requires the receipt to display the tax as 23% of the total. Linder states the FairTax is presented as a 23% tax rate for easy comparison to income and employment tax rates (the taxes it would be replacing). The plan's opponents call the semantics deceptive. FactCheck called the presentation misleading, saying that it hides the real truth of the tax rate. [...] Bruce Bartlett stated that polls show tax reform support is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate, and called the presentation confusing and deceptive based on the conventional method of calculating sales taxes. [...] Proponents believe it is both inaccurate and misleading to say that an income tax is 23% and the FairTax is 30% as it implies that the sales tax burden is higher.|$|E
