5000|$|First, the header, {{described}} above, {{cuts the}} crop and feeds {{it into the}} <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This consists {{of a series of}} horizontal rasp bars fixed across the path of the crop and {{in the shape of a}} quarter cylinder. Moving rasp bars or rub bars pull the crop through concaved grates that separate the grain and chaff from the straw. The grain heads fall through the fixed concaves. What happens next is dependent on the type of combine in question. In most modern combines, the grain is transported to the shoe by a set of 2, 3, or 4 (possibly more on the largest machines) augers, set parallel or semi-parallel to the rotor on axial mounted rotors and perpendicular Flow" [...] combines.) In older Gleaner machines, these augers were not present. These combines are unique in that the cylinder and concave is set inside feederhouse instead of in the machine directly behind the feederhouse. Consequently, the material was moved by a [...] "raddle chain" [...] from underneath the concave to the walkers. The clean grain fell between the raddle and the walkers onto the shoe, while the straw, being longer and lighter, floated across onto the walkers to be expelled. On most other older machines, the cylinder was placed higher and farther back in the machine, and the grain moved to the shoe by falling down a [...] "clean grain pan", and the straw [...] "floated" [...] across the concaves to the back of the walkers.|$|E

40|$|The {{caryopsis}} {{of naked}} oat {{is sensitive to}} mechanical damage at harvest, especially at high grain moisture content. For producing high quality naked oat seed, {{it is recommended that}} harvesting be carried out at as low grain moisture content as possible. This reduces mechanical damage to the grain and promotes germination. Under northern growing conditions, grains are often harvested at 20 % moisture content or higher. In this study, reduced grain resulted from using gentler settings on the combine harvester. Two naked oat cultivars and one conventional oat were harvested at different grain moisture content using three combine harvester settings: the first setting that recommended for conventional oat, the second a reduced cylinder speed and the third a narrow concave clearance. The greater the grain moisture content of naked oat at harvest, the more damage was caused by <b>threshing.</b> Lower <b>cylinder</b> speeds tended to result in better germination than higher speeds, even under moist conditions.

The objective {{of this paper was}} to obtain the structural variables of a TLFC unit by theoretical modeling and experimentation on a tangential flow <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder</b> unit (TFC unit) and longitudinal axial flow <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder</b> unit (LFC unit). Threshing and separation equations for five types of threshing teeth (knife bar, trapezoidal tooth, spike tooth, rasp bar, and rectangular bar), were obtained using probability theory. Results demonstrate that the threshing and separation capacity of the knife bar TFC unit was stronger than the other threshing teeth. The length of the LFC unit was divided into four sections, with helical blades on the first section (0 - 0. 17 m), the spike tooth on the second section (0. 17 - 1. 48 m), the trapezoidal tooth on the third section (1. 48 - 2. 91 m), and the discharge plate on the fourth section (2. 91 - 3. 35 m). Test results showed an un-threshed grain rate of 0. 243 %, un-separated grain rate of 0. 346 %, and broken grain rate of 0. 184 %. Evidenced by these results, threshing and separation performance is significantly improved by analyzing and optimizing the structure and variables of a TLFC unit.

This work presents an integrated design of multi-functional rice combine harvester that allows grain harvesting and straw baling. This multi-functional combine harvester could reduce the energy consumption required for rice harvesting and simplify the process of harvesting and baling. The transmission schematic, matching parameters and the rotation speed of <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder</b> and square baler were designed and checked. Then the evaluation of grain threshing and straw baling were tested on a transverse threshing cylinders device tes rig and straw square bales compression test rig. The test results indicated that, with a feeding rate of 3. 0 kg/s, the remaining straw flow rate at the discharge outlet was only 1. 22 kg/s, which indicates a variable mass threshing process by the transverse <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Then the optimal diameter, length and rotating speed of multi-functional combine harvester transverse <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder</b> were 554 mm, 1590 mm, and 850 r/min, respectively.

40|$|The {{tailings}} return {{system is}} an important functional part of modern combine harvesters, but published research on tailings return systems is very scarce. The tailings return system is intended to take crop material that is not completely threshed and/or not completely cleaned from the combine cleaning shoe {{back to the main}} <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Returning the tailings is regular practice on modern combine harvesters, but is not necessary and may be detrimental in some crops and conditions. The primary objective of this thesis is to research the function of the tailings return system with emphasis on developing a tailings rethresher. A tailings rethresher rethreshes the material from the cleaning shoe and returns it only to the cleaning section of the combine for re-processing. There are several potential advantages to rethreshing returning the tailings only to the cleaning section of the combine: 1.) Threshed grain in the tailings will not be exposed to the main <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder</b> to be potentially damaged. 2.) The combine could be simplified and reduced in cost. 3) The rethresher will effectively reduce the loading of the main <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder,</b> adding threshing capacity to the combine. 4.) Returning tailings to the cleaning system offers some advantages in distributing the load on the cleaning shoe for more efficient operation.; 5.) With the addition of an innovative bypass system, tailings can be returned to the cleaning system without rethreshing. Rethreshing is not necessary in many crops. This thesis addresses the data collected in the field and its implications. The function of the tailings returns has been further quantified in this study. The information is directed toward development of an improved tailings rethresher/returns system. Fourteen field studies were performed to measure tailings flow rate and composition and grain purity and damage in four different crops and numerous different conditions.

40|$|For naked oat {{the aim is}} to {{maximise}} {{the yield}} free from lemma and palea and minimise threshing loss and grain damage. The fatty grains are, however, soft, and harvest at a high moisture content (in Finland usually harvested at 20 % moisture content or higher) further increases the softness of the grain. Mechanical injuries also reduce germination through making the grains vulnerable to fungal infections that reduce storability. Two naked oat cultivars (Lisbeth and Bullion) and one conventional oat (Salo) were harvested at different grain moisture content using three combine harvester settings: the first setting was that recommended for conventional oat, the second used a reduced cylinder speed and the third used a narrow concave clearance. It was investigated whether grain moisture at threshing and combine harvester settings affected germination and hull content. The greater the grain moisture content of naked oat at harvest, the more damage was caused by <b>threshing.</b> Lower <b>cylinder</b> speeds tended to result in better germination than higher speeds, even under moist conditions. Narrowing the concave clearance did not affect germination. Threshing settings had only limited effects on hull content and degree of hull retention, and the postulated protective nature of hulls was confirmed only for cultivar Lisbeth. Threshing a naked oat crop at a low as possible grain moisture content can reduce harvesting damage. However, if this is not possible, better germination can be ensured by reducing the cylinder speed. Small grains tended to retain hulls more tightly during threshing. This may indicate that the most advanced grains were more completely filled and mature and therefore, also better able to dehull. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelut. Yksikön huom. : KV...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of threshing and classification in size on the physiological quality of popcorn seeds DFT 2 (selection cycle 1), during storage in two different environments. The seeds, with 11 % of initial moisture content (wet basis), were submitted to manual or mechanical threshing, using a stationary <b>thresher</b> with <b>cylinder</b> rotation of approximately 250 rpm. After threshing, the seeds were classified in size using sieves with different meshes and the percentage of retention in the sieves and the weight of 100 seeds were obtained. To evaluate the mechanical damage and the physiological quality of the seeds, we’ve tested the following treatments: seeds retained in oblong-holed sieve number 12 / 64 x 3 / 4 ", seeds retained in round-holed sieves number 13, 14 and 15 / 64 " and the control. The seeds were fumigated with fosfine and stored in conventional store (Seed Processing Unit), in Viçosa-MG, for a period of 10 months. The evaluations of seed physiological quality, as well as the determination of the moisture content, were accomplished in the beginning and after 10 months of storage. The mechanical damage was evaluated by the 4 % iodine dye test, in the beginning of storage. The results showed that mechanical threshing had harmful effect on germination and vigor of seeds. The seeds without size classification were the most damaged mechanically, followed by round seeds that obtained an intermediate result in relation to flat ones. The popcorn seeds had their vigor reduced when stored under the environmental conditions of the conventional store in Viçosa.

40|$|As {{the global}} {{population}} rises, food security {{is among the}} most important grand challenges of our time. While agriculture has significantly developed in parts of the world, other parts are severely underdeveloped, inhibiting agriculture productivity, which is a necessary component of the solution to the food security challenge. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in particular, has seen little growth in productivity, something that has been correlated to its low agricultural mechanization. One barrier to mechanization in SSA, where the average farm size is less than 2 Ha, is the cost of farm equipment. This leaves many farmers with just basic tools to perform farm operations. Threshing is a critical part of processing grains, which are staple crops in most countries. Traditional methods of threshing are time and energy consuming and can result in significant grain losses. Threshers that are available are imported, expensive, or too large for most farms. This thesis investigated a locally appropriate and sustainable multigrain threshing machine as a means of improving the productivity and efficiency of smallholder farmers in SSA. An axial-flow threshing machine was designed for the threshing and cleaning of maize and soybeans. The thresher was 5. 2 ft (1. 6 m) long, 4. 3 ft (1. 3 m) high and 1. 4 ft (0. 4 m) wide. At an engine speed of 3000 rpm, the drum had a peripheral speed of 39 ft/s (12 m/s), the sieve oscillated at 10 Hz, and air speed at the fan outlet was 29 ft/s (8. 9 m/s). To simplify local manufacturing and minimize costs, only basic parts and materials, like rebar, angle iron, and pulleys, were used in the thresher. Tests of the thresher were performed using pre-weighed stalks of soybeans or un-husked corncobs. The crop was run through the thresher, and afterwards, weights of the grain and material other than grain (MOG) were measured in four different locations: on the ground, in the <b>thresher,</b> out the <b>cylinder</b> discharge, and in the grain bin. After initial tests, minor modifications were made to the thresher, and final tests were conducted. The final results showed that 96 % of corn and 94 % of soybeans were collected in the grain bin, with MOG amounts of 1. 3 % and 6. 6 % respectively. The feeding of material into the thresher, not the power or threshing capacity of the machine, restricted the feed rates. Grain feed rates of over 200 kg/h (corn) and over 20 kg/h (soybeans) were achieved. The results have demonstrated strong potential for the machine to be manufactured and used in SSA as a labor saving device for smallholder farmers to increase productivity and decrease losses. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{thresher}} {{was developed}} for threshing, separating, and cleaning millet seeds. The major components of the machine include threshing, separation and cleaning units. The threshing operation is achieved by rotational motion of a cylinder fitted with beater pegs above a stationary grid which results in {{the removal of the}} seeds from the panicles and their separation from the bulk of the straw. After being beating out, the grains fall through a concave grid into the cleaning unit which consists of two sieves that undergo reciprocating motion. Whilst the grains are moving over these sieves, a constant blast of air is being sent through them which blow out materials that are lighter than the grain. The machine was designed to be powered by a 5 hp electric motor. It was tested to thresh, separate and clean the millet seeds. The results showed that the machine had the highest threshing and cleaning efficiencies of 63. 2 and 62. 7 %, respectively, when pearl millet panicles were processed at 13 % moisture content and at an 800 rpm <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder</b> speed. The lowest threshing and cleaning efficiencies of 40. 68 and 50 %, respectively, were obtained when the pearl millet panicle was processed at 17 % moisture content and a 600 rpm <b>threshing</b> <b>cylinder</b> speed, and at 17 % moisture content and 700 rpm. Thus, the optimum operating parameters of the machine were 13 % moisture content (wet basis) of pearl millet panicles and 800 rpm threshing drum speed. The successful development of this machine is expected to reduce drudgery associated with the traditional method of threshing millet and therefore increase productivity of farmers...|$|E

The financial benefits from these control systems were calculated by means of a computer simulation. The research required in developing the models and control systems is discussed in detail.
