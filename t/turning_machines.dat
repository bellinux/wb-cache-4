The deterministic autoregressive moving average (DARMA) model with auxiliary input is introduced to cope with any disturbances of the controlled system. The parameters of the DARMA model are obtained using {{the structure of a}} lattice adaptive control system. The robustness of the proposed controller copes with any changes in depth of cut and/or the cutting speed. These changes are embedded in the linearized model of the CNC machine and are considered as system parameters. Extensive computer simulations are made to prove the applicability of the proposed controller for controlling the cutting force over different operating conditions.

The distinctive simultaneous and parallel processing abilities of <b>turning</b> <b>machine</b> tool increase the complexity of process planning. The operations would not only be sequenced and satisfy precedence constraints, but also should be scheduled with multiple objectives such as minimizing machining cost, maximizing utilization of <b>turning</b> <b>machine</b> tool, and so on. To solve this problem, a hybrid genetic algorithm was proposed to generate optimal process plans based on a mixed 0 - 1 integer programming model. An operation precedence graph is used to represent precedence constraints and help generate a feasible initial population of hybrid genetic algorithm. Encoding strategy based on data structure was developed to represent process plans digitally in order to form the solution space. In addition, a local search approach for optimizing the assignments of available turrets would be added to incorporate scheduling with process planning.

40|$|Abstract This {{paper will}} discuss about CNC <b>turning</b> <b>machining</b> process. One {{of the way}} to {{increase}} productivity in CNC machining process is by tooling process sequencing in processing workpiece feature. Tool sequencing in CNC <b>turning</b> <b>machining</b> process can be made by comparing tool sequencing process model 1 (turning 3. SD 1) with tool sequence process model 2 (turning 1. SD 1), these activity is needed to measure the distance effect from workpiece cutting process with tool in z axis. Comparison between model 1 and model 2 can be a guidance to achieve the optimum processing time. This paper is expected could explain how to increase processing time productivity by feeding tool sequence for cutting process. Another advantage from feeding tool sequence is the short cuting time that directly decrease maximum cutting (Flmax) and also unproper NC machining program.
