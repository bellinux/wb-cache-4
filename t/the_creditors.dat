5|$|Production did not recommence and the Hoover {{production}} line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles {{changed its name}} to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among <b>the</b> <b>creditors,</b> as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute on terms that neither company would reveal.|$|E

5|$|Serving as {{attorney}} general in Governor Adair's administration, Sharp had {{become involved in the}} Old Court – New Court controversy. The conflict was primarily between debtors who sought relief from their financial burdens after the Panic of 1819 (the New Court, or Relief, faction) and <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> to whom these obligations were owed (the Old Court, or Anti-Relief, faction). Sharp, who came from humble beginnings, sided with the New Court. By 1825, the New Court faction's power was on the decline. In an attempt to bolster the party's influence, Sharp resigned {{as attorney}} general in 1825 to run for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. His opponent was Old Court stalwart John J. Crittenden.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the financial Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians in debt and unable to meet their financial obligations. A debt relief movement began in the state, and pro-relief candidates won majorities in the General Assembly in 1820. The Assembly passed a law of replevin that was extremely favorable to debtors. Disgruntled creditors challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} law, appealing their case to the Court of Appeals. The court opined in favor of <b>the</b> <b>creditors.</b> Attempts to remove the anti-relief justices failed. The pro-relief legislature passed a measure abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court, to which pro-relief governor Joseph Desha appointed pro-relief justices who upheld the replevin law.|$|E
5|$|The small American {{merchant}} {{class and}} {{officers of the}} HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund. Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat receipts and scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845. The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers. Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for wheat became flooded from overproduction, causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing wheat as tender.|$|E

5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, and returned to <b>the</b> <b>creditors.</b> The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E
5|$|Boeing {{issued a}} {{petition}} for bankruptcy 22 June 1971, which {{was carried out}} by Oslo District Court the following day. The two remaining Boeing aircraft were re-registered with Aer Lingus on 10 June. By late August the debt in the company had been assessed to NOK30 million, making it the largest bankruptcy till then in Norwegian history. The largest creditor was Boeing, which was owed NOK7 million. <b>The</b> <b>creditors</b> and shareholders lost all of their investments in the company because the airline's limited assets were used to pay outstanding wages. Tjøntveit stated on 8 September that he intended to sue Boeing for damages from the seizure of the aircraft, but by October no writ of summons had been received by the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, lenders {{warned that}} {{time was running out}} for a deal to be agreed on a new bailout plan.

The {{deadline}} for the renewal of Greece's bailout package was also looming at the end of June. On 26 June, an emergency cabinet meeting led to the calling of a referendum on the bailout deal proposed by <b>the</b> <b>creditors.</b> Capital controls and a bank holiday were announced on 28 June, with the Eurozone refusing an extension of the bailout plan and Greece defaulting on its loan to the IMF on 30 June.|$|E

5|$|On 5 November, TPD was {{formally}} liquidated at a creditors' meeting. It was revealed, to {{the anger of}} <b>the</b> <b>creditors,</b> that Sinclair had taken out a £5 million debenture to cover the money that he had put into the company. Ordinary creditors faced little prospect of recovering the £1 million left outstanding. Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly £500,000. The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} debtors and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew <b>the</b> <b>creditors,</b> like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E
5|$|The long {{investigation}} {{time span}} was causing {{problems for the}} prosecutors as {{an increasing number of}} the counts were meeting their statutes of limitations. The police announced in September 1973 that they were working on indictments towards Tjøntveit and two of <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> who placed their representatives on the board after the company was insolvent. The police investigation was concluded in May 1975. By then, the statutes of limitations for the accounting issues had passed, and the police focused on the more serious charge of debt manipulation. Tjøntveit and two board members were indicted in 1976. The managing committee for the winding-up released its report in November 1977; the report concluded that although the company's books showed assets of NOK8.6 million, in reality it only had fifty Norwegian krone. The committee further criticized the company for having too low a share capital, lack of qualified management and insufficient competence in operation and management of large aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|A {{transaction}} is {{an unfair}} preference {{if the company}} and <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> are parties to the transaction and the transaction results in <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> receiving from <b>the</b> company, in relation to an unsecured debt owed to <b>the</b> <b>creditor,</b> a greater amount {{than it would have}} received in relation to the debt in a winding up of the company.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{prolific}} ground of discharge of a guarantor usually arises from <b>the</b> <b>creditor's</b> conduct. <b>The</b> governing principle {{is that if}} <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> violates any rights which the surety possessed when he entered into the suretyship, even though the damage is only nominal, the guarantee cannot be enforced. The surety's discharge may be accomplished (1) by {{a variation of the}} terms of the contract between <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> and <b>the</b> principal debtor, or of that between <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> and <b>the</b> surety; (2) by <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> taking a new security from the principal debtor in lieu of the original one; (3) by <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> discharging <b>the</b> principal debtor from liability; (4) by <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> binding himself to give time to the principal debtor for payment of the guaranteed debt; or (5) by loss of securities received by <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> in respect of the guaranteed debt. The first four of these acts are collectively termed a novation. In general whatever extinguishes the principal obligation necessarily determines that of the surety, not only in England but elsewhere. [...] By most civil codes the surety is discharged by conduct of <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> inconsistent with <b>the</b> surety's rights, although the rule prevailing in England, Scotland, America and India which releases the surety from liability when <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> extends without <b>the</b> surety's consent the time for fulfilling the principal obligation, while recognized by two existing codes civil, is rejected by the majority of them. A revocation of the contract of suretyship by act of the parties, or in certain cases by the death of the surety, may also operate to discharge the surety.|$|R
50|$|Where the {{co-operation}} of <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> {{is necessary}} to enable the debtor to perform his contractual obligation, <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> is obliged so to co-operate. Mora creditoris is the culpable failure of a <b>creditor</b> (<b>the</b> person to whom the performance is owed) to cooperate timeously with the debtor to enable him to perform. <b>The</b> <b>creditor</b> must not have repudiated the contract or rendered performance by the debtor impossible; otherwise the breach renders performance impossible.|$|R
5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E
5|$|Moores {{eventually}} {{sold the}} club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9million. The pair paid £5,000per share, or £174.1m for the total shareholding and £44.8m to cover the club's debts. Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club. Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale. In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of {{the club to}} be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion. The group's creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court {{to force them to}} allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> and {{paved the way for the}} sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal.

5|$|The theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and {{the dancers}} fled the {{building}} as beams fell onto the stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit. With the theatre destroyed, each group laid their own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby Little Theatre, and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O'Reilly to obtain land in Leicester Fields for a new building, which too would require a licence. The two quarrelled, and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other. The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the Oxford Street Pantheon. This too, would burn {{to the ground in}} 1792. Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> of the King's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O'Reilly. A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter. The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, but at this point O'Reilly's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with a troubled debt restructuring, a debtor, with <b>the</b> <b>creditor's</b> approval, sells <b>the</b> collateral (real estate) on a contract for deed for a purchase price, the present value is less than <b>the</b> <b>creditor's</b> net investment in the related loan. <b>The</b> <b>creditor</b> does not release its lien on the property.

The thirdparty purchaser must make the monthly payments directly to <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> {{and not to the}} sellerdebtor. The issue is whether the sale of collateral and related requirement for the purchaser to make payments directly to <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> warrant <b>the</b> <b>creditor's</b> recognition of a loss related to the amount by which the net investment in the loan exceeds the fair value of the payments to be received from the purchaser. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> should recognize a loss on the disposition of the original loan and record an asset for the fair value of the payments to be received from the purchaser.

Some Task Force members commented that <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> should not be able to avoid loss recognition by refraining from legal foreclosure even though <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> has effectively repossessed the original collateral by approving its sale and requiring the purchaser's payments to be made directly to <b>the</b> <b>creditor...</b>|$|R
