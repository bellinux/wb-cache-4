5|$|The redox {{reactions}} catalyzed by oxidoreductases {{are vital}} {{in all parts}} of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD by reduction to NADH, as part of beta oxidation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion (to reduce mitochondrial NAD) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle. The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in turn by the electron transport chain, which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. These shuttle systems also have the same <b>transport</b> <b>function</b> in chloroplasts.|$|E

40|$|The general {{expression}} for the transport coefficients at finite frequency {{is given by}} the spectral function of the autocorrelation of the flux corresponding to the transport phenomenon considered. Because the explicit analytical solution of such a correlation function involves the whole many-body problem for strongly coupled systems, appeal {{must be made to}} a model in order to derive the explicit frequency dependence of the <b>transport</b> <b>functions.</b> In {{the first part of this}} paper, we calculate these functions analytically [i. e. the diffusion D(), the viscosities S() and B(), and the thermal conductivity () ] from the generalized Berne-Boon-Rice model. The frequency dependence of these <b>transport</b> <b>functions</b> becomes significant at high frequencies, i. e. when approaches cc- 1, where c is the collision time, and should be essentially responsible for the departure from classical hydrodynamics. This is shown in Sec. II of this paper, where we present a calculation of the spectral distribution of the light scattered from thermal fluctuations in simple fluids. When the <b>transport</b> <b>functions</b> are introduced in the hydrodynamic equations to replace the usual constant transport coefficients, the spectrum of the scattered light is modified significantly, to second order in k 2, where is essentially a linear <b>function</b> of the <b>transport</b> <b>functions.</b> The second-order spectrum obtained here is in agreement with previous results, but it is shown that the main effect arises from the frequency dependence of the <b>transport</b> <b>functions,</b> which was ignored in previous work. These effects induce a small but significant negative dispersion in the first-sound velocity. This prediction is in qualitative agreement with the recent light scattering experiments by Fleury and Boon on liquid argon, which were initially interpreted as a possible experimental observation of the frequency dependence of the <b>transport</b> <b>functions</b> in simple liquids. © 1970 The American Physical Society.

2500|$|Most {{but not all}} uptake systems {{also have}} an extracytoplasmic receptor, a solute binding protein. [...] Some {{homologous}} ATPases function in non-transport-related processes such as translation of RNA and DNA repair. ABC transporters {{are considered to be}} with the ABC superfamily based on the sequence and organization of their ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domains, even though the integral membrane proteins may have evolved independently several times, and thus comprise different protein families. The integral membrane proteins of ABC exporters appear to have evolved independently at least three times. ABC1 exporters evolved by intragenic triplication of a 2 TMS precursor (TMS= transmembrane segment. [...] a [...] "2 TMS" [...] protein has 2 transmembrane segments) to give 6 TMS proteins. [...] ABC2 exporters evolved by intragenic duplication of a 3 TMS precursor, and ABC3 exporters evolved from a 4 TMS precursor which duplicated either extragenicly to give two 4 TMS proteins, both required for <b>transport</b> <b>function,</b> or intragenicly to give 8 or 10 TMS proteins. The 10 TMS proteins appear to have two extra TMSs between the two 4 TMS repeat units. Like the ABC exporters, {{it is possible that the}} integral membrane proteins of ABC uptake systems also evolved at least 3 times independently, based on their high resolution 3-dimensional structures. ABC uptake porters take up a large variety of nutrients, biosynthetic precursors, trace metals and vitamins, while exporters transport lipids, sterols, drugs, and a large variety of primary and secondary metabolites. [...] Some of these exporters in humans are involved in tumor resistance, cystic fibrosis and a range of other inherited human diseases. High level expression of the genes encoding some of these exporters in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (including human) result in the development of resistance to multiple drugs such as antibiotics and anti-cancer agents.|$|E
40|$|With a DNA {{fragment}} {{from within}} the region encoding the <b>transport</b> <b>functions</b> for K 1 production as a hybridization probe in Southern blot experiments, homologous DNA sequences were detected in the DNA from Escherichia coli strains producing K 5, K 7, K 92, and K 100 capsular polysaccharides. No homology with the laboratory strain LE 392 was detected. The same DNA probe was used to prescreen cosmid libraries in LE 392 by colony hybridization, as a rapid method to isolate clones encoding the genes for K 5, K 7, K 12, and K 92 antigen production. Clones carrying sequences homologous to the probe that also produced capsular material were identified by using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against the K antigen in question and K antigen-specific phages. By restriction enzyme mapping of the appropriate cosmid clones {{it was possible to}} align the genes for the production of different K antigens in terms of common restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. A DNA fragment encoding the postulated <b>transport</b> <b>functions</b> for K 7 antigen production could complement deletion mutations in the <b>transport</b> <b>functions</b> for K 1 antigen production.

40|$|Anisotropic thermoelectrics {{is a very}} {{interesting}} topic among recent research. The <b>transport</b> distribution <b>function</b> plays the central role on modeling the anisotropic thermoelectrics. The methodology of numerical integrations is used in previous literature on anisotropic transport, which does not capture the sharp change of <b>transport</b> distribution <b>function</b> and density of states at band edges.
