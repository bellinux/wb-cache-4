In general, the empirical findings do not reveal a significant re-lationship between establishment growth and several types of local gov-ernment spending...|$|R

In general, richer regions tend to lose and poorer regions gain from federal taxes, but other regional characteristics such as manufacturing/non-manufacturing, or resource/non-resource can be important. ...|$|R

Our analysis employs confidential company-level corporation tax return data in the UK. Our main identification strategy is based on variation in companies’ marginal tax rates due to the existence of kinks in the corporate tax rate schedule. Using a dynamic adjustment model of capital structure, we find a positive and substantial long-run <b>tax</b> <b>effect</b> on companies' financial leverage. We show that there are considerable discrepancies between estimates of taxable profits reported in tax return data and in financial statements and that the estimated <b>tax</b> <b>effect</b> on capital structure using financial statements is likely to be biased downward. We find that companies adjust their capital structures gradually in response to changes in the marginal tax rate. Moreover, we find that the external leverage of domestic stand-alone companies and of multinational companies responds strongly to corporate tax incentives...|$|E
