40|$|This {{thesis is}} study about <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> Magneto-rheological damper using Neural Network and Simulated Annealing method. Five {{different}} values of current {{were used in}} order <b>to</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> MR damper, which are 0. 0 ampere, 0. 5 ampere, 1. 0 ampere, 1. 5 ampere and 2. 0 ampere. In order <b>to</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> MR damper, the graph of simulation damper will {{be compared with the}} experimental damper. The results will get the Square Error for the simulation damper. Then, the Root Mean Square Error will be calculated to get the difference between the simulation damper and experimental damper. The results show that the lowest RMSE for the simulation damper were value 1. 282457, while the highest RMSE is 13. 18909. From the results also, the better current value <b>to</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>the</b> MR damper is using the MR damper with the lowest RMSE...|$|R

5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway <b>to</b> <b>model</b> <b>the</b> behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings {{are determined by the}} configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to {{the point at which the}} worm currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E

Some scenes consisted {{of tens of thousands of}} individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.|$|E
5|$|The Ising {{model is}} used <b>to</b> <b>model</b> <b>the</b> {{behavior}} of magnetic systems. It {{consists of an}} array of cells, the state of each of which represents a spin, either up or down. The energy {{of the system is}} measured by a function that depends on the number of neighboring pairs of cells that have the same spin as each other. Therefore, if a cell has equal numbers of neighbors in the two states, it may flip its own state without changing the total energy. However, such a flip is energy-conserving only if no two adjacent cells flip at the same time.|$|E
