5|$|In 2003 the BBC {{announced}} {{the return of}} Doctor Who, {{as a series of}} webcasts to air on bbc.com. Richard E. Grant was announced as the Ninth Doctor. A webcast, written by Paul Cornell, entitled Scream of the Shalka was completed, and aired on bbc.com. This was followed by an online short story entitled The Feast of the Stone. Work was already well underway on the third webcast, entitled Blood of <b>the</b> <b>Robots.</b> This was to be written by Simon Clark. However, before production began, it was announced that Doctor Who would be returning to television, with Russell T. Davies as Producer. Blood of <b>the</b> <b>Robots</b> was never made. Blood of <b>the</b> <b>Robots</b> synopsis:- A blend of adventure, drama and humour. The Doctor arrives to find a world full of intelligent, sensitive robots that have been abandoned by their human owners, who are too squeamish to 'kill' them when they're obsolete. Now ruthless salvage squads are hunting <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> in order to make room for human settlers forced to migrate from their dangerously over-crowded home planet.|$|E
5|$|Written by Roger Dixon, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} in early 1967. A race of people were wiped out by powerful robots that they created. <b>The</b> <b>robots</b> having become so advanced that they are then {{able to create a}} new race of people. <b>The</b> <b>robots</b> then fear that these new humans will dominate them, and when the Doctor arrives on their planet, they take this as proof of their fears.|$|E
5|$|Ghosts of Onyx {{details the}} {{creation}} of a group of supersoldiers known as the SPARTAN-IIIs to defend humanity against the alien collective known as the Covenant. After the events of Halo 2, the SPARTAN's training world of Onyx is beset by robotic attackers. The SPARTANs and their trainers must fight <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> and the Covenant as they work to uncover the planet's secrets.|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{pointing}} out that <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> is a continuous linear dynamic system when <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> moves only with translational motion, and no parameter uncertainties of the contact radius L_ 0 exist in <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> dynamics. However, <b>the</b> parameter uncertainties in <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> contact radius L_ 0 will appear in <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> dynamics if <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> moves with rotational motion. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> is an autonomous switched nonlinear system in this case [17].|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{developing}} a blind robot {{which focuses on}} the study of continuous and discrete 2 D mapping. Ultrasonic sensors are used to sense the obstacles while <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> is moving. User is also allowed to vary <b>the</b> speed of <b>robot</b> and move forward and backward with <b>the</b> <b>robot.</b> There is a two-dimensional memory map program to track <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> position and obstacles detected by proximity sensor on <b>the</b> <b>robot.</b> <b>The</b> program written is able to control <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> by displaying <b>the</b> two-dimensional map that plots the location of <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> and obstacles, displaying coordinates of <b>the</b> <b>robot,</b> control turning of robot at various degrees and move or stop <b>the</b> <b>robot...</b>|$|R

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the project in 2013, the Air-Cobot robot is dedicated to inspect the lower parts of an aircraft. In the continuation of the project, there is the prospect of coupling with a drone to inspect an aircraft's upper parts. In October 2016, Airbus Group launches its research project on the hangar of the future in Singapour. <b>The</b> <b>robots</b> from the Air-Cobot and Aircam projects are included in it.|$|E
5|$|Written by Robert Holmes and {{submitted}} to Story editor Donald Tosh on 25 April 1965. This four-part story idea involved the Doctor {{and his three}} companions arriving on an uninhabited planet to discover a space craft controlled by robots while its human occupants lie in suspended animation waiting for the additional crew members needed to once again operate their crashed ship. The Doctor and his companions are taken captive and trained up by <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> as the replacement crew members, however only three additional crew members are required, so the member of the Doctor's party that proves least useful is to be callously killed off by the human crew. This was Holmes first story submission for the series, and was primarily rejected due to <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> role being {{similar to that of}} the Mechanoids in The Chase from the previous season. Holmes would later resubmit this story idea to producer Peter Bryant on 20 May 1968 which led to the commissioning of what would become The Krotons.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2014 and took {{fourteen}} {{months to go}} into full production. The concept was contributed by Keiji Inafune, who wished to convey the idea of surviving in a world verging on human extinction. The developers first came up with <b>the</b> <b>robots,</b> whose anatomical design problems would later be solved by the insertion of cores – essentially robot souls – to explain their propulsion. Writer Joseph Staten resolved to create a simple story to enhance an emotional backdrop more grounded in complexity.|$|E
40|$|In human-robot teams, humans often {{start with}} an {{inaccurate}} model of <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> capabilities. As they interact with <b>the</b> <b>robot,</b> they infer <b>the</b> <b>robot's</b> capabilities and partially adapt to <b>the</b> <b>robot,</b> i. e., they might change their actions based on the observed outcomes and <b>the</b> <b>robot's</b> actions, without replicating <b>the</b> <b>robot's</b> policy. We present a game-theoretic model of human partial adaptation to <b>the</b> <b>robot,</b> where <b>the</b> human responds to <b>the</b> <b>robot's</b> actions by maximizing a reward function that changes stochastically over time, capturing the evolution of their expectations of <b>the</b> <b>robot's</b> capabilities. <b>The</b> <b>robot</b> can then use this model to decide optimally between taking actions that reveal its capabilities to the human and taking the best action given the information that the human currently has. We prove that under certain observability assumptions, the optimal policy can be computed efficiently. We demonstrate through a human subject experiment that the proposed model significantly improves human-robot team performance, compared to policies that assume complete adaptation of the human to <b>the</b> <b>robot...</b>|$|R
40|$|Some of the {{greatest}} concerns in robotic designs have been the high center of gravity of <b>the</b> <b>robot,</b> <b>the</b> irregular or flat surface that <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> has to work on, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> that has to handle heavy weights or use heavy forces, {{and the ability of}} <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> to climb straight up in the air. This climbing crawling robot handles these problems well with magnets, suction cups, or actuators. The cables give body to <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> and it performs very similar to a caterpillar. The computer program is simple and inexpensive as is <b>the</b> <b>robot.</b> One of <b>the</b> important features of this system is that <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> can work in pairs or triplets to handle jobs that would be extremely difficult for single <b>robots.</b> <b>The</b> light weight of <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> allows it to handle quite heavy weights. The number of feet give <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> many roots where a simple set of feet would give it trouble...|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>robot</b> {{that was}} {{introduced}} {{early in the}} episode was influenced by Greaney's experiences working with a USA Today themed robot. While at a baseball game with <b>the</b> <b>robot,</b> <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> led <b>the</b> stadium in singing [...] "Take Me Out to the Ball Game". <b>The</b> <b>robot</b> was not well-received, and the spectators threw objects at it. <b>The</b> <b>robot's</b> operator had {{to stay close to}} <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> during <b>the</b> baseball game, and was also teased and bothered {{in the same way as}} the operator in the episode.|$|R
5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E
5|$|The game {{world is}} filled with traps, laser defence {{mechanisms}} and security robots, all of which kill the astronaut on contact, resulting {{in the loss of}} one of his five lives. These defences must be shut down with objects obtained from gravity boxes in order to progress, as the player has no weapon to directly attack <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> with. The jet pack enables the astronaut to travel more quickly, but has a limited supply of nitro fuel. Should this fuel run out then the astronaut will lose a life. The spaceship contains points at which the jet pack can be refuelled, though these can be difficult to locate.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea was to have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank.|$|E

5|$|Rathnavelu {{used the}} 435 Xtreme camera and also wrote a 1,600-page manual, {{in which he}} listed all of the {{possible}} angles from which the characters played by Rajinikanth could be filmed. Legacy Effects and the Hong Kong-based visual effects companies Kinomotive Studios and Menfond Electronics took responsibility for the film's CGI work. To create <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> with Rajinikanth's appearance, a complete scan of his face in 3Ddigital format in all possible lighting conditions was conducted using the Doom Light Stage, so that his face could be replicated on the mannequins. The technique, according to Shankar, was previously used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). The robot Chitti featured in the film was a mannequin made by a Legacy Effects team of 100technicians in Los Angeles. For every robotic mannequin used, six puppeteers were employed to control the mannequin's movements.|$|E
5|$|The robot creator Doctor Light created two human-like robots with {{advanced}} artificial intelligence named Mega and Roll. Following this, he created eight more robots intended for industrial use: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, Elec Man, Time Man, and Oil Man. He received a Nobel Prize for Physics, and his old colleague and rival Doctor Wily has grown bitter {{for not being}} acknowledged {{for his work on}} the project. Wily discovered a prototype robot made by Doctor Light before Mega and Roll called Proto Man, who is in danger of having his energy generator go critical. Wily gave him a nuclear energy supply to extend his life. He later steals and reprograms the eight industrial robots to attempt world domination. Mega volunteered to stop Wily and <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> and was converted into a fighting robot called Mega Man. After defeating all eight robots, Mega Man goes through Dr. Wily's fortress and challenges him. After beating Wily, he surrenders and asks Mega Man to spare him.|$|E
5|$|While {{the comics}} are set during the Sonic X timeline, their plot is original. Eggman imprisons humans inside robots {{and tries to}} use them to kill the animals, but the animals destroy <b>the</b> <b>robots.</b> Eggman uses {{malicious}} Chao to destroy Station Square, but Tikal and Chaos arrive from the past, return the Chao to normal, and bring them back to the past. Soon, Sonic finds a machine in the desert and thinks nothing of it, but after fighting with Eggman in Paris and a bizarre world created by the doctor, Eggman reveals the desert machine was his and it begins to wreck Station Square. Sonic defeats it, but he is accused of working with Eggman, so he and Eggman are both locked up. Nelson bails Sonic out of jail, and he saves Cream and Chris from some ghosts.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, Bart is {{not ready}} for the {{upcoming}} Springfield Elementary science fair. He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all <b>the</b> <b>robots</b> impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to the nursing home.|$|E

30|$|Real {{experiments}} were also made. The {{experiments were}} divided into three cases: static obstacle, moving obstacle towards <b>the</b> <b>robot,</b> and moving obstacle intersecting <b>the</b> <b>robot’s</b> path. For <b>the</b> first set of tests, the modified A* algorithm reached the goal sooner than the normal A*. In the second case, the modifications made much more difference with a moving obstacle. This resulted in a softer path in the both first and second cases. In A* <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> {{had to make a}} second turn so that it would not collide with the obstacle. This made <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> go farther and lose speed. In the last case, <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> had to reach the target avoiding a moving obstacle that intersected <b>the</b> <b>robot’s</b> path. Here, <b>the</b> experiment showed that when using A*, <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> was taken in the obstacles’ movement direction and, while using the modified A*, <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> predicted <b>the</b> collision point and built a suboptimal solution, making <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> pass behind <b>the</b> obstacle to avoid it. This last case showed an even bigger difference {{in the time it takes}} for <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> to reach <b>the</b> target.|$|R
5000|$|Off-line {{programming}} (OLP) is a {{robot programming}} method where <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> program is created independent from <b>the</b> actual <b>robot</b> cell. <b>The</b> <b>robot</b> program is then uploaded to <b>the</b> real industrial <b>robot</b> for execution. In off-line programming, <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> cell is represented through a graphical 3D model in a simulator. Nowadays OLP and robotics simulator tools help <b>robot</b> integrators create <b>the</b> optimal program paths for <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> {{to perform a}} specific task.

30|$|Until recently, most robot {{programs}} were only taught through <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> teach pendant, which required <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> {{system to be}} out of production. Now, programmers are using offline program tools to teach <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> movements. After transferring the program to <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> controller, they use <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> teach pendant to refine the program positions. This greatly improves the productivity of <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> system. But still, calibration is needed between the model and the real work cell. The trend is the development of more intelligent programming, by use of sensors with the ability to scan the workpiece and working environment with high accuracy.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand a sprawling-type quadruped robot has another features. First, <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> has high stability, because <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> can locate its center of gravity at low {{position}} and have a wider supporting leg polygon. Second, <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> has wide range of motion because of its proximal yaw axis, therefore it can choose foot placement widely. Third, since its center of gravity is low, even if <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> falls down, <b>the</b> damage to <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> {{is considered to be}} relatively small. Additionally, it is easy to use the body of <b>the</b> <b>robot</b> as a fifth foot depending on the terrain.|$|R
