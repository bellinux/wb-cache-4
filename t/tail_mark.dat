Two years later, Yusei builds another one and sets out to win back his Dragon. Jack has {{made a name for himself}} and his monster, Red Dragon Archfiend, in New Domino City. Yusei and Jack face each other in a Turbo Duel, and Yusei is able to regain control of Stardust Dragon.

Goodwin also reveals that Jack and Yusei, along with child Duelist Luna and Psychic Duelist Akiza are descendants of them and are destined to face the Dark Signers. The Signers head to the Satellite to face these foes, who consist of Roman, Goodwin's brother, former Signer of the Dragon head mark and leader of the Dark Signers: Kalin, a former friend of Yusei, Jack and their friend Crow Hogan: Devack, who wielded the Ancient Fairy Dragon card until Luna, with Leo's help, won it from him: Misty Tredwell, a model who blamed Akiza for the death of her brother Toby until she discovered the man who recruited Akiza, Sayer, was the true culprit: and briefly Carly, a blogger with feelings for Jack and Greiger, who blamed Goodwin for his village's disappearance until he discovered the Dark Signers were responsible. After their defeat, Goodwin is revealed to have become a Dark Signer and uses his brother's severed arm to become a Signer as well: he then Duels Yusei, Jack and Crow to a Turbo Duel to stop him and the released King of the Netherworld during which Yusei gains the head mark while Crow gains his former <b>tail</b> <b>mark,</b> making him a Signer. With the power of the Seal of the Crimson Dragon and Majestic Star Dragon, Yusei defeats Goodwin who, along with Roman, sacrifice themselves to destroy the King of the Netherworld and revive the Dark Signers.|$|E

40|$|We {{documented}} trackways of free-living Crocodylus acutus on beaches at {{the mouths}} of Tamarindo and Ventanas estuaries, Costa Rica. Our crocodiles had estimated total lengths of 1 – 3 meters or more. Manus prints have five digits, with digits I–III bearing claw marks. Pes prints have four digits, with claw marks on digits I–III. The pes is plantigrade. Claws generally dig into the substrate. Apart from claw marks, digit I and the heel of the pes are usually the most deeply impressed parts of footprints. Trackways are wide-gauge. Pes prints are usually positioned just behind ipsilateral manus prints of the same set and may overlap them. Manus and pes prints angle slightly outward {{with respect to the}} crocodile 2 ̆ 7 s direction of movement. Claw-bearing digits of both the manus and pes may create curved, concave-toward-the-midline drag marks as the autopodium is protracted. The <b>tail</b> <b>mark</b> varies in depth and clarity, and in shape from nearly linear to markedly sinuous. Sometimes the <b>tail</b> <b>mark</b> hugs the trackway midline, but sometimes it is closer to, or even cuts across, prints of one side. American crocodile footprints and trackways are similar to those observed in other extant crocodylian species, indicating substantial trackway conservatism across the group...|$|E

50|$|Colors and markings: All {{colors are}} to be as smooth, clear, and {{saturated}} as possible. The body color is pure white.

50|$|In 1994, a new roundel was introduced, {{featuring}} the national colours in concentric rings.

In all remaining instances only one side could be identified. A total of 267 sides were identified. The natural marks on nine segments of a specific portion of the tail was recorded and compared as codes. For this comparison two methods were employed. Differences of 95. 1 and 100 was found with the respective methods. This is an indication that every crocodile has a unique pattern of natural <b>marks</b> on its <b>tail.</b> The <b>marks</b> can therefore be used to allocate a code to an individual crocodile that partially eliminates the necessity of artificial marking methods...|$|R

Satinettes are shield <b>marked</b> / <b>tail</b> <b>marked</b> birds with white bars or laces on their shield and Moon Spots or laces on their tail.

50|$|Oligodon deuvei is {{a species}} of {{colubrid}} snake. It is found in Cambodia, southern Vietnam, and Laos; {{it is expected to}} occur in northeastern Thailand. The species differs from other known species of its group by the combination of 12-15 maxillary teeth, 17 dorsal scale rows at its midbody, approximately seven supralabials, the absence of dorsal and tail blotches, and the presence of a single vertebral black stripe, which is usually orange or red. O. deuvei is most similar to Oligodon barroni, but differs from the latter by having more maxillary teeth and its absence of dorsal and <b>tail</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|R
