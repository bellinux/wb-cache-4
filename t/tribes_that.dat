5|$|According to this view, {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> were traditional enemies of Rome, had no real loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes were their own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led {{to a decline in}} traditional military discipline, and internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable of defending the empire effectively.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E
5|$|Angered by the French surrender, {{and unhappy}} with British {{policies}} that affected them, an Ottawa chief named Pontiac organized 18 Native American <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> attacked British {{military and civilian}} settlements beginning in April 1763. The tribes captured eight British forts and forced the evacuation of two more. General Amherst ordered the 17th to Albany in June 1763 to assist in combating the outbreak of hostilities.|$|E

5|$|English is a North Sea Germanic {{language}} that was first spoken in early medieval England {{and is now}} a global lingua franca. Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, especially French.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the draft}} treaty of January 1916, apprehensions grew in Delhi of trouble from tribes in the North-West Frontier Province. That spring, Indian {{intelligence}} received rumours {{of letters from}} Habibullah to his tribal chiefs exhorting holy jihad. Alarmed, Hardinge called 3,000 tribal chiefs to a grand Jirga in Peshawar, where aerial bombing displays were held; Hardinge demonstrated the Empire's goodwill by increasing British subsidies to the chiefs. These measures helped convince the frontier <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> Britain's wartime position remained strong and that Indian defences were impregnable.|$|E
5|$|For those reasons, Drusus {{was sent}} to Illyricum with proconsular imperium maius, and would be {{governor}} there from AD 17 to 20. Since Germanicus had left the Rhine in AD 16, the German <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> formerly fought alongside each other against the Romans had turned on each other. The two major forces in the region, the Marcomanni under king Maroboduus and the Cherusci under Arminius clashed and, after an indecisive battle, Maroboduus withdrew {{to the heart of}} his kingdom in the forests of Bohemia. Before that, two tribes (the Semnones and Langobardi) had defected to Arminius.|$|E

5|$|In 681, Constantine IV {{signed a}} {{treaty with the}} Bulgar khan Asparukh, and the new Bulgarian state assumed {{sovereignty}} {{over a number of}} Slavic <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> had previously, at least in name, recognised Byzantine rule. In 687–688, the final Heraclian emperor, Justinian II, led an expedition against the Slavs and Bulgarians, and made significant gains, although {{the fact that he had}} to fight his way from Thrace to Macedonia demonstrates the degree to which Byzantine power in the north Balkans had declined.|$|E
5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, {{ordering}} them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> sought the favor of the heavenly prince.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} Saladin {{to persuade the}} Hejazi Arab <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> joined his army to remain in Palestine, he offered each tribe a cluster of villages {{captured}} from the Crusaders as iqta' (fiefs) to settle in and control. The Bani Zeid were granted the villages of Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima, {{as well as the}} nearby towns of Kafr Ein and Qarawa. However, it was not until 1293, after the Bahri Mamluks under Sultan Baibars conquered the coastal strip of Palestine and expelled the last of the Crusaders, that the Bani Zeid tribe settled in those villages.|$|E

Prior to the American Civil War the United States {{government}} began relocating the Five Civilized Tribes – the five Native American <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> the United States officially recognized via treaty – to Oklahoma. Treaties of 1832 and 1833 assigned the area known today as Norman to the Creek Nation.|$|E
5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{is a list}} of thirty-five <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> was {{compiled}} in Anglo-Saxon England some time between the 7th and 9th centuries. It includes a number of independent kingdoms and other smaller territories and assigns a number of hides to each one. The list of tribes is headed by Mercia and consists almost exclusively of peoples who lived south of the Humber estuary and territories that surrounded the Mercian kingdom, some of which have never been satisfactorily identified by scholars. The value of 100,000 hides for Wessex is by far the largest: {{it has been suggested that}} this was a deliberate exaggeration.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet {{with many of the}} tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E

5|$|Horizon Zero Dawn is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by Guerrilla Games {{and published by}} Sony Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4 and released in early 2017. The plot revolves around Aloy, a hunter and archer {{living in a world}} overrun by robots. Having been an outcast her whole life, she sets out to discover the dangers that kept her sheltered. The character uses ranged weapons and a spear and stealth tactics to combat the mechanised creatures, whose remains can be looted for resources. A skill tree provides the player with new abilities and passive bonuses. The game features an open world environment for Aloy to explore, divided into <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> hold side quests to undertake, while the main story guides her across the entire map.|$|E
5|$|In the {{intervening}} time, through {{contact with other}} <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> had more European contact, the Yavapai began to adopt certain European practices. They raised some livestock and planted crops, also adopting some modern tools and weaponry. In a syncretic way, they adopted elements of Christianity. An estimated 25% of the population {{died as a result}} of smallpox in the 17th and 18th centuries, smaller losses than for some tribes, but substantial enough to disrupt their societies. With the use of guns and other weapons, they began to change methods of warfare, diplomacy, and trade. They used livestock raiding, either from other tribes such as the Maricopa, or from Spanish settlements to their south, to supplement their economy. They often acquired human captives in raids, whom they traded as slaves to Spaniards in exchange for European goods.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Germanicus reached Pannonia, Severus was {{attacked}} in Moesia, but successfully repelled the rebels. By the time Germanicus arrived the rebels had withdrawn to mountain fortresses {{from which they}} launched raids. The Romans were tactically unsuited at countering raids, so Tiberius had to utilize his auxiliary forces and divided his army into small detachments to cover more ground. Tiberius {{appears to have been}} conducting a war of attrition against the rebels who were now occupying strong defensive positions. In addition, the Romans began working to drive the rebels out of the countryside offering forgiveness to any <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> would lay down their arms, and a scorched earth policy was implemented through which Tiberius may have been hoping to starve the enemy out. While most of his detachments saw little action at the time, Germanicus did defeat the Mazaei, a Dalmatian tribe.|$|E

5|$|Rivera {{recommended}} closing Presidio de los Tejas {{and reducing}} the number of soldiers at the other presidios. His suggestions were approved in 1729, and 125troops were removed from Texas, leaving only 144soldiers divided between Los Adaes, La Bahía, and San Antonio. The three East Texas missions which had depended on Presidio de los Tejas were relocated along the San Antonio River in May 1731, increasing the number of missions in the San Antonio area to five. The San Antonio missions usually contained fewer than 300Indians. Many of those who lived at the mission had nowhere else to go, and belonged to small <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> have since become extinct.|$|E
5|$|The Nez Perce {{people lived}} in what today is eastern Washington, Oregon, and western Idaho, where they engaged in {{agriculture}} as well as horse breeding. The Nez Perce first obtained horses from the Shoshone around 1730. They {{took advantage of the}} fact that they lived in excellent horse-breeding country, relatively safe from the raids of other tribes, and developed strict breeding selection practices for their animals, establishing breeding herds by 1750. They were one of the few <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> actively used the practice of gelding inferior male horses and trading away poorer stock to remove unsuitable animals from the gene pool, and thus were notable as horse breeders by the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|After the Gallipoli Campaign, Australian troops {{returned}} to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion, which involved {{the raising of}} another three infantry divisions—the 3rd, 4th and 5th—and {{the establishment of the}} Anzac Mounted Division. In March 1916, the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units stayed in the area and fought Turkish troops and the Senussi Arab <b>tribes</b> <b>that</b> were threatening British control of Egypt. Mounted troops were particularly important in the defence of Egypt and Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the campaign, first seeing combat in the Battle of Romani. Apart from the horsemen, the mounted troops included the 1st Imperial Camel Corps Brigade. This was organised as a mounted infantry brigade. Of its four battalions, the 1st and 3rd were composed of Australians, the 2nd was British, and the 4th was half Australian and half New Zealand. The cameliers participated in most of the fighting in Egypt and Palestine until the brigade was disbanded in July 1918. The Australian and New Zealand components then traded their camels for horses and became the 5th Light Horse Brigade.|$|E
