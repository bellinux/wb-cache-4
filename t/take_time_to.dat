5|$|However, Newcastle and his Lieutenant General, Lord Eythin, {{were opposed}} to any pitched battle and {{possibly}} offended by Rupert's high-handed attitude. Rather than join Rupert immediately they temporised, claiming that it would <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> clear the earth and rubble which {{had been used to}} block the city gates of York during the siege. Newcastle's soldiers in York then refused to fight unless given their delayed payment, a dispute which Eythin may have fomented. A number were also absent, pillaging the abandoned allied siege works and encampments outside the city, and had yet to return.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> develop, {{and as many}} as half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24â€“48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Underoath {{participated in}} the inaugural Taste of Chaos tour, and shortly after, {{embarked}} on their first headlining tour. The band premiered two brand-new songs during {{the length of the}} tour. They played a part of the Warped Tour, but declined to perform for the entirety of the tour in order to <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> record another album. Underoath made their first covers of national magazines appearing on CCM Magazine in July 2005 and then Alternative Press in September, and in October, They're Only Chasing Safety was re-released in a two-disc set with four formerly unreleased songs. Also included was re-mastered album artwork by Jacob Bannon of Converge, and a DVD with over two hours of footage of the band touring in support of the album. As of 2005, They're Only Chasing Safety has sold more than 218,000 copies, with the re-release selling an additional 279,000 copies, making a combined sales of more than 500,000 copies in the US alone.|$|E

5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} {{in activities}} that required physical skills, {{rather than in the}} classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E

25|$|After a {{decision}} process ends, leaders should {{reflect on the}} process and try to derive lessons learned regarding how to manage conflict constructively.

If these relationships are not repaired, trust could be lost which could negatively affect the effort of the next collaboration. Additionally, leaders should celebrate constructive conflict management and help others to remember the success of the process (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
