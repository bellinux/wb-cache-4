Scott wrote short stories furiously <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> but became burned out and depressed. In April 1924, they left for Paris.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the house}} saw {{service as a}} {{depository}} for the evacuated Wallace Collection and a convalescent home. A troop of gunners occupied the decaying service wing, and the park {{was used for the}} inflation of barrage balloons. During this turmoil, the Dashwoods retreated to the upper floor and took in lodgers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> albeit very superior lodgers, who included Nancy Mitford and James Lees-Milne, who was secretary of the Country House Committee of the National Trust and instrumental in the Trust's acquisition of many such houses. In 1943, Sir John gave the house and grounds to the National Trust, on condition that he and his descendants could continue living in the house.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{brothers}} started Ashby Computers and Graphics in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch with Lathbury and Tim's girlfriend, Carole Ward, whom he later married in 1985. They {{worked out of}} a four-room row house next-door to {{the brothers}}' family corner store and ran on a shoestring budget for its first six months, in which they pooled their money <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b> The company did not credit individuals on their releases, though they had individual roles in development: Chris and Lathbury programmed and Tim and Carole designed the graphics. Carole also served as the company's secretary. Ultimate Play the Game, as the company was publicly known, first licensed arcade cabinet conversion kits to companies {{before moving to the}} more profitable British home computer market.|$|E
5000|$|The innkeeper Gaudenzio tries in vain {{to eject}} the Bohemians, who never pay and are {{continually}} up to no good. During the conversation another piece of horseplay on their part is discovered. They sit down to dine, while Musette gaily sings. (Canzonette: [...] "Mimì {{is the name of}} my sweet blonde.") Naturally when they are asked <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> they have no money. A comic fight ensues between them and the innkeeper, who has called his servants to assist him. It is ended by Barbemuche, who offers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|R

5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b> A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
5|$|Half a {{year after}} the Lindisfarne trip, Pete and Jenny have separated. He moves from house to house, {{eventually}} finding a houseshare with a gay landlord. He has a brief fling with Ramona, which is followed by some dates with a teacher (Pooky Quesnel). Jenny begins a relationship with a dotcom millionaire (Ben Miles), who decorates her house with flowers and takes her on a trip to New York. The fling ends when Jenny realises he does not love her. She and Pete reconcile after briefly considering a divorce. David and Karen bring home their newborn twins, and Karen's ex-pat mother (Mel Martin) moves in for a couple of episodes. Karen is reunited with an old boyfriend (Richard Dillane), who is in Manchester for a photography exhibition.

25|$|With {{his novels}} {{providing}} scant income, Thompson turned to {{other forms of}} writing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b> Beginning in 1959, and continuing through the mid-1960s, Thompson also began writing television programs, including episodes of the action/adventure shows Mackenzie's Raiders (1959), Cain's Hundred (1961) and Convoy (1965). TV work seemingly dried up for Thompson after this point, so he turned to writing tie-in novels based on produced TV shows and screenplays: this work paid a flat fee, and could be completed quickly. Thompson's tie-ins include an original novel based on the TV series Ironside (1967), as well as screenplay novelizations of the films The Undefeated (1969) and Nothing But a Man (1970).|$|E
25|$|MEFO was a dummy {{company that}} was formed with {{relatively}} small amounts of capital {{that was used to}} finance German rearmament off the books. It issued bills without backing by its own resources but which were guaranteed redeemable at 1:1 for Reichsmarks for five years by the government. The MEFO bills amounts were considered a state secret and were an important element in the impression that Hitlerian economics was a success. This company essentially created a large amount of Reichsmarks off the books, inflating the currency in secret. Payment was about to come due giving Hitler the option of shifting the German economy to export goods <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> or going to war and paying the debts off from looting profits extracted from conquered states.|$|E
25|$|In that setting, he says, {{providers}} {{almost always}} charged minimal fees for services {{in order to}} improve the chance of being paid. He argues that the emergence of government as a payer for healthcare services in the form of Medicare and Medicaid, along with government policies of the 1970s that led to the expansion of private insurance to cover routine medical services in addition to hospitalization and emergency care, and which required most employers to provide health insurance for their employees, interfered with the traditional physician-patient relationship. The incentive for healthcare providers and patients to keep costs as low as possible was lost. He says that now providers always charge the maximal fees for services, since the government or insurance company can be counted on <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills.</b>|$|E

50|$|In North Korea, where rigid {{social systems}} {{are still in}} place, it is most common for {{the person of the}} highest social standing, such as a boss or an elder figure, <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> This not only applies in a 1 to 1 {{situation}} but also in groups.

25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century the Du Pont Company {{had become one}} of world’s major corporations, {{bringing}} enormous wealth to its owners and providing employment and other opportunities to their native state. One of the three key owners of the company was T. Coleman du Pont, a capable, energetic and ambitious man, who was also Buck’s father-in-law. Du Pont had a vision of a super highway running the length of Delaware, and the ambition, talent, and money to make it a reality. Construction began in 1917 and in that same year a new State Highway Department was established to oversee the work. Nevertheless, du Pont continued <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> amounting to $4 million by 1924. With his engineering education and family connections, Buck was assigned to work on the project, becoming Chief Engineer in 1921 and remaining in the role until 1929.|$|E
25|$|After fleeing Ireland, Hamilton Rowan {{was unable}} to access his fortune and was reduced to {{supporting}} himself by his own labour. He was able to borrow money from William Poole, a prominent Quaker in Wilmington, Delaware, and purchase a calico mill. In Wilmington, Hamilton Rowan led a very public life, enjoying the company of prominent Wilmingtonians such as Poole, John Dickinson, and Caesar A. Rodney, who later became Secretary of State under Jefferson. Living in constant fear of summary deportation under the Alien and Sedition Acts, Hamilton Rowan took pains to socialise with both Federalists and Republicans, and he studiously avoided American politics. On Christmas Day 1797 his cottage on the Brandywine {{burned to the ground}} killing his two dogs, destroying most of his library, and leaving him homeless. The next year his business partner refused to make up the accounts for the calico mill, so Hamilton Rowan was forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> out of pocket, and take over the entire operation himself. But with little knowledge of the operations or business, the press was sold at a loss of $500. Hamilton Rowan then worked for the flour mills hauling grain and flour by wheelbarrow to and from Wilmington.|$|E

5000|$|Enjoying {{lunch or}} dinner with a (male or female) friend will very often end up in Going Dutch (splitting <b>the</b> <b>bill).</b> When invited to a {{lunch or dinner}}, the Dutch will {{make it clear that}} you are their guest and that they intend <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> {{otherwise}} expect <b>to</b> [...] "Go Dutch" [...] and pay your fair share.

When one invites someone, or if one is invited, it is only in corporate situations that the one who gave the invitation is expected <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for dinner. Otherwise bills will be split up, sometimes even when people are on a date. It is a way of showing that one is independent and self-reliant, which is highly valued in Dutch society and insisting <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for <b>the</b> other party might be considered slightly offensive by the other party.
