6000|$|I have {{received}} a most flattering message from the head turnkey of the jail this morning, intimating that [...] "there warn't a genelman in all London he'd be gladder to show his babies to, than Muster Dickins, and let him come wenever <b>he</b> would to <b>that</b> shop <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> welcome."

6000|$|... 'Here's the story,' said Sam. 'Vunce upon a {{time there}} wos a young hairdresser as opened a wery smart little shop vith four wax dummies in the winder, two gen'lmen and two ladies - the gen'lmen vith blue dots for their beards, wery large viskers, oudacious heads of hair, {{uncommon}} clear eyes, and nostrils of amazin' pinkness; the ladies vith their heads o' one side, their right forefingers on their lips, and their forms deweloped beautiful, in vich last respect they had the adwantage over the gen'lmen, as wasn't allowed but wery little shoulder, and terminated rayther abrupt in fancy drapery. He had also a many hair-brushes and tooth-brushes bottled up in the winder, neat glass-cases on the counter, a floor-clothed cuttin'-room up-stairs, and a weighin'- macheen in the shop, right opposite the door. But the great attraction and ornament wos the dummies, which this here young hairdresser wos constantly a runnin' out in the road to look at, and constantly a runnin' in again to touch up and polish; in short, <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> so proud on 'em, that ven Sunday come, <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> always wretched and mis'rable to think they wos behind the shutters, and looked anxiously for Monday on that account. Vun o' these dummies wos a favrite vith him beyond the others; and ven any of his acquaintance asked him wy he didn't get married - as the young ladies he know'd, in partickler, often did - he used to say, [...] "Never! I never vill enter into the bonds of vedlock," [...] he says, [...] "until I meet vith a young 'ooman as realises my idea o' that 'ere fairest dummy vith the light hair. Then, and not till then," [...] he says, [...] "I vill approach the altar." [...] All the young ladies he know'd as had got dark hair told him this wos wery sinful, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> wurshippin' a idle; but them as wos at all near the same shade as the dummy coloured up wery much, and wos observed to think him a wery nice young man.' ...|$|R

He spent {{all his money}} in bears, and run in debt for 'em besides, and there they wos a {{growling}} avay down in the front cellar all day long, and ineffectooally gnashing their teeth, vile the grease o' their relations and friends wos being re-tailed in gallipots in the shop above, and the first-floor winder wos ornamented vith their heads; not to speak o' the dreadful aggrawation {{it must have been}} to 'em to see a man alvays a walkin' up and down the pavement outside, vith the portrait of a bear in his last agonies, and underneath in large letters, [...] "Another fine animal wos slaughtered yesterday at Jinkinson's!"

"An' sayin' <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> sot to agin in {{the other}} lingo, but the king came up an' {{told him that the}} boy had to be killed 'cause he had a devil in him, and had gone and betwitched a number o' other people; an' before he had done speakin', up comes two fellers, draggin' the poor little boy between them.

50|$|Meanwhile, Yang grew ill, {{and faced}} a {{succession}} problem. The natural successor {{would be his}} son Yang Wo, but the Huainan staff members all had low opinions of Yang Wo. When Yang Xingmi brought up the matter with his secretary Zhou Yin (周隱) and told Zhou to issue an order summoning Yang Wo back from Xuan Prefecture, Zhou opposed the idea, stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> viewed Yang <b>Wo</b> as an inappropriate successor due to his love for drinking and games. Instead, Zhou suggested that Yang entrust the circuit to Liu Wei with the direction that after Yang's younger sons grew older that the circuit be given {{to one of them}} — a proposal that Xu Wen and Zhang Hao attacked as unworkable. When Yang again told Zhou to summon Yang Wo, Zhou drafted such an order but then delayed sending it. However, Xu and Zhang found the order and sent it, and Yang Wo arrived in Yang Prefecture in winter 905. Yang Xingmi commissioned him as the acting military governor of Huainan and soon thereafter died. At the Huainan staff members' request, Li Yan issued an order under Tang imperial authority making Yang Wo the new military governor of Huainan and overall commander of the eastern circuits, succeeding Yang Xingmi.|$|R
