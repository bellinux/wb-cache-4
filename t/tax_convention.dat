25|$|The United States Department of the Treasury has {{published}} model IGAs which follow two approaches. Under Model 1, financial {{institutions in the}} partner country report information about U.S. accounts to the tax authority of the partner country. That tax authority then provides {{the information to the}} United States. Model 1 comes in a reciprocal version (Model 1A), under which the United States will also share information about the partner country's taxpayers with the partner country, and a nonreciprocal version (Model 1B). Under Model 2, partner country financial institutions report directly to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the partner country agrees to lower any legal barriers to that reporting. Model 2 is available in two versions: 2A with no Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) or Double <b>Tax</b> <b>Convention</b> (DTC) required, and 2B for countries with a pre-existing TIEA or DTC. The agreements generally require parliamentary approval in the countries they are concluded with, but the United States is not pursuing ratification of this as a treaty.|$|E

40|$|Il {{principale}} obiettivo della tesi è dimostrare come la connessione tra i differenti livelli giuridici che riguardano le relazioni tra Stati membri dell'UE richieda un'interpretazione sistematica delle convenzioni contro le doppie imposizioni intracomunitarie, ed in particolare richieda l'applicazione della clausola della nazione più favorita. The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to demonstrate how the connections between different juridical levels {{in the relationship between}} Member States of the European Union requires a systematic interpretation of the intra-EU double <b>tax</b> <b>conventions,</b> in particular the obligation of the most-favoured-nation treatment. The starting point is a dualistic interpretation of the non-discrimination principle; considered both as an obligation of equal treatment on the national level and an application of the most-favoured-nation clause. These principles are investigated in the context of intra-EU relationships and furthermore {{in the light of the}} main objective of the EU, i. e. to build an Internal Market. The analysis of the above-mentioned principle is considered in relation to the network of intra-EU double <b>tax</b> <b>conventions,</b> which are inspired by reciprocity due to their bilateral nature and other legal levels which operate in such context, namely the EU and the WTO. In fact, the exclusion of the direct taxation from the competences of the EU and, consequently, exclusive competence that the EU Member States have to negotiate and sign double <b>tax</b> <b>conventions,</b> cannot give to them the opportunity to provide every kind of rules. In particular, according to the CJEU case law, EU Member States must comply, on one side, with EU law and especially with the four market freedoms that cannot be restricted by international bilateral agreements based on reciprocity and, on the other side, with international obligations derived from the WTO (whose parties are EU Member States and the EU too). By contextualizing intra-EU double <b>tax</b> <b>conventions</b> in a EU internal market law-logic, this thesis has demonstrated that the existence of a most-favoured-nation clause enforceable to the provisions of such double <b>tax</b> <b>conventions</b> is the obvious consequence of a systematic EU interpretation...|$|R

However, the non-discrimination principle itself is originally based on national treatment.

This is often seen as being aimed at preventing profits being systematically deviated to lowest tax countries, although most countries are also concerned about prices that fail to meet the arm's length test due to inattention rather than by design and that shifts profits to any other country (whether it has low or high tax rates).|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{permanent}} establishment {{emerged in the}} German Empire after 1845, culminating with the German Double Taxation Act of 1909. Initially the objective was to prevent double taxation between Prussian municipalities and this was extended to the entire German federation. In 1889, the first bilateral tax treaty, including the concept of permanent establishment, was concluded between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Prussia, marking {{the first time the}} concept was used in international tax law. After years of preparatory works, in 1928, the League of Nations developed a model to tackle cross-border double taxation and to counter tax evasion. Since then, an extensive network of bilateral tax treaty was gradually established, particularly through the influence of the OECD Model <b>Tax</b> <b>Convention,</b> where this concept persisted.|$|E
50|$|The OECD publishes and updates a model <b>tax</b> <b>convention</b> {{that serves}} as a {{template}} for bilateral negotiations regarding tax coordination and cooperation. This model is accompanied by a set of commentaries that reflect OECD-level interpretation of the content of the model convention provisions. In general, this model allocates the primary right to tax to the country from which capital investment originates (i.e., the home, or resident country) rather than the country in which the investment is made (the host, or source country). As a result, it is most effective as between two countries with reciprocal investment flows (such as among the OECD member countries), but can be very unbalanced when one of the signatory countries is economically weaker than the other (such as between OECD and non-OECD pairings).|$|E

50|$|The OECD Model <b>Tax</b> <b>Convention</b> {{provides}} {{the legal framework}} for governments to have {{their fair share of}} taxes, and for enterprises to avoid double taxation on their profits. The arm's length standard is instrumental to determine how much of the profits should be attributed to one entity and, consequently, the extent of a country's tax claim on such entity. The OECD has developed thorough guidelines on how the arm's length principle should be applied in this context. Under this approach, a price is considered appropriate if it is within a range of prices that would be charged by independent parties dealing at arm's length. This is generally defined as a price that an independent buyer would pay an independent seller for an identical item under identical terms and conditions, where neither is under any compulsion to act.|$|E
50|$|As {{passed by}} Congress, FATCA {{was meant to}} {{form the basis for}} a {{relationship}} between the U.S. Department of the Treasury and individual FFI's. Personnel at some FFIs responded by asserting, however, that {{it was not possible to}} follow for the FFIs to follow their own countries' laws (privacy, confidentiality, discrimination, etc.) and simultaneously to comply with FATCA as is. Discussions from financial industry lobbyists resulted in the creation of Intergovernmental Agreements (IGA's) between the Executive Branch of the United States government with foreign governments. This development resulted in foreign governments to implement the US FATCA requirements into their own legal systems, which in turn allowed those governments to change their privacy and discrimination laws to allow the identification and reporting of US persons via those governments. In an IGA, a government agrees that all of its financial institutions shall comply with FATCA (whereas without the IGA each FFI would have been able to decide if it were to comply with FATCA or not). With the IGA's, the private data of suspected US persons would be collected and handled by the FFI's, whereas the many governments would then collect and store that data for further transmittal. The IGA added the applicable government to the list of handlers of the data. The United States Department of the Treasury has published model IGAs which follow two approaches. Under Model 1, financial institutions in the partner country report information about U.S. accounts to the tax authority of the partner country. That tax authority then provides the information to the United States. Model 1 comes in a reciprocal version (Model 1A), under which the United States will also share information about the partner country's taxpayers with the partner country, and a nonreciprocal version (Model 1B). Under Model 2, partner country financial institutions report directly to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the partner country agrees to lower any legal barriers to that reporting. Model 2 is available in two versions: 2A with no Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) or Double <b>Tax</b> <b>Convention</b> (DTC) required, and 2B for countries with a pre-existing TIEA or DTC. The agreements generally require parliamentary approval in the countries they are concluded with, but the United States is not pursuing ratification of this as a treaty.|$|E
