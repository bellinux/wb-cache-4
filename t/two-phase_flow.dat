50|$|In fluid mechanics, <b>two-phase</b> <b>flow</b> is {{a flow of}} gas {{and liquid}} usually in a pipe. <b>Two-phase</b> <b>flow</b> is a {{particular}} example of multiphase flow. <b>Two-phase</b> <b>flow</b> can occur in various forms. For example, there are transient flows with a transition from pure liquid to a vapor flow {{as a result of}} external heating, separated flows and dispersed two-phase flows where one phase is present in the form of particles, droplets, or bubbles in a continuous carrier phase (i.e. gas or liquid).|$|E
40|$|Study of gas-liquid <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> under reduced gravity {{conditions}} is extremely important. One {{of the major}} applications of gas-liquid <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> under reduced gravity {{conditions is}} {{in the design of}} active thermal control systems for future space applications. Previous space crafts were characterized by low heat generation within the spacecraft which needed to be redistributed within the craft or rejected to space. This task could easily have been accomplished by pumped single-phase loops or passive systems such as heat pipes and so on. However with increase in heat generation within the space craft as predicted for future missions, pumped boiling <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> are being considered. This is because of higher heat transfer co-efficients associated with boiling heat transfer among other advantages. <b>Two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> under reduced gravity conditions also find important applications in space propulsion as in space nuclear power reactors as well as in many other life support systems of space crafts. ^ Two-fluid model along with Interfacial Area Transport Equation (IATE) is a useful tool available to predict the behavior of gas-liquid <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> under reduced gravity conditions. It should be noted that considerable differences exist between <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> under reduced and normal gravity conditions especially for low inertia flows. This is because due to suppression of the gravity field the gas-liquid <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> take a considerable time to develop under reduced gravity conditions as compared to normal gravity conditions. Hence other common methods of analysis applicable for fully developed gas-liquid <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> under normal gravity conditions, like flow regimes and flow regime transition criteria, will not be applicable to gas-liquid <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> under reduced gravity conditions. ^ However the two-fluid model and the IATE need to be evaluated first against detailed experimental data obtained under reduced gravity conditions. Although lot of studies have been done in the past to understand the global structure of gas-liquid <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> under reduced gravity conditions, using experimental setups aboard drop towers or aircrafts flying parabolic flights, detailed data on local structure of such <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> are extremely rare. ^ Hence experiments were carried out in a 304 mm inner diameter (ID) test facility on earth. Keeping in mind the detailed experimental data base that needs to be generated to evaluate two-fluid model along with IATE, ground based simulations provide the only economic path. Here the reduced gravity condition is simulated using two-liquids of similar densities (water and Therminol 59 ® in the present case). Only adiabatic <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> were concentrated on at this initial stage. Such a large diameter test section was chosen to study the development of drops to their full extent (it is to be noted that under reduced gravity conditions the stable bubble size in gas-liquid <b>two-phase</b> <b>flows</b> is much larger than that at normal gravity conditions). Twelve flow conditions were chosen around predicted bubbly flow to cap-bubbly flow transition region. Detailed local data was obtained at ten radial locations for each of three axial locations using state-of-the art multi-sensor conductivity probes. The results are presented and discussed. Also one-group as well as two-group, steady state, one-dimensional IATE was evaluated against data obtained here and by other researchers, and the results presented and discussed. ...|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{probably}} the most commonly studied cases of <b>two-phase</b> <b>flow</b> are in large-scale power systems. Coal and gas-fired power stations used very large boilers to produce steam for use in turbines.

The design of boilers requires a detailed understanding of <b>two-phase</b> <b>flow</b> heat-transfer and pressure drop behaviour, which is {{significantly different from the}} single-phase case. Even more critically, nuclear reactors use water to remove heat from the reactor core using <b>two-phase</b> <b>flow.</b> A great deal of study has been performed on the nature of <b>two-phase</b> <b>flow</b> in such cases, so that engineers can design against possible failures in pipework, loss of pressure, and so on (a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA)).|$|E
