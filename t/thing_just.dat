500|$|Rather {{than being}} {{considered}} a separate sport on its own, ski flying {{is essentially an}} offshoot of ski jumping involving larger hills and longer jump distances. According to former US national ski jumping coach Larry Stone, [...] "It's the same <b>thing,</b> <b>just</b> bigger. You're going faster and flying higher. ... Basically, it's just a real big jump." [...] The competitive standard for distance in ski flying is {{in the range of}} , with 254m being the absolute longest distance reached to date. By comparison, the longest ever distance from a ski jumping hill is , set at Mühlenkopfschanze ("Mühlenkopf hill") in Willingen, Germany. Distances of around [...] are the standard on most ski jumping hills.|$|E
500|$|Germain Lussier of /Film {{wrote of}} the film, [...] "The whole <b>thing</b> <b>just</b> feels perfect or magical, a shining example of what cinema is all about", adding, [...] "The {{performances}} are mindblowing, the writing sharp, and the direction beautiful. It's a very special movie." [...] In Variety, critic Peter Debruge wrote, [...] "the stunning SXSW fest winner puts the recent Park City competition lineup to shame ... this compelling human drama finds fresh energy in the inspirational-teacher genre, constantly revealing new layers to its characters." [...] In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan described Short Term 12 as [...] "a small wonder", [...] "a film of exceptional naturalness and empathy", and [...] "moving and intimate", offering particular praise to the film's honesty and plausibility. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, on the other hand, criticized the film's credibility, describing it as [...] "well intentioned, but somehow inauthentic" [...] with a [...] "too-cute-to-be-true ending".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews among critics. Joel Keller of The Huffington Post expressed mixed {{opinions on the}} episode, putting the emphasis on Yang's development, whom he deemed [...] "transformed" [...] {{by the end of}} the episode. He applauded Torres' evolution throughout the episode, and also praised Heigl's performance and dress. Keller criticized the non-realism of the punishment the interns received, Grey and Shepherd's storyline being tiresome, and the cliffhanger, calling it a [...] "lame cliché". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Maureen Ryan gave a negative review of the episode, stating: [...] "overall, the whole <b>thing</b> <b>just</b> fell a little flat." [...] Though Ryan appreciated the scene of Doc's death, she was critical of Torres' underdevelopment, the lack of chemistry with O'Malley, and her prom dress. Abigail Chao of Television Without Pity was also critical of Torres' dress, but liked Heigl's pink dress. She also applauded Karev's intervening to calm Stevens down, and agreed that Grey's cliffhanger was not good.|$|E
500|$|Critics who {{disliked the}} album cited what they {{viewed as a}} ridiculous concept. Salon remarked in its review that [...] "Musically [...] their 1995 album Clouds Taste Metallic offers the same {{psychotic}} results without all the technological hassle. And conceptually? The same <b>thing,</b> <b>just</b> all at once: stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid." [...] Jason Josephes from Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 0.0 out of 10; in a scathing review, Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible, asking [...] "Do I want to buy three more CD players with which to enjoy Zaireeka or, say, eat?" [...] and derided the band's fans. Further, in October 2009, editor-in-chief of Pitchfork, Mark Richardson, wrote a book titled Zaireeka for the 33 1/3 book series, published by Continuum International Publishing, now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing. In it, Richardson chronicles {{the creation of the}} album, praises it from multiple angles, and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release. The album was included in Pitchforks 2010 list of [...] "ten unusual CD-era gimmicks".|$|E
500|$|By {{crossing}} the lush Wyoming and Salt River Ranges instead of circling via the deserts to the south, the route provided ample wood, grass and {{water for the}} travelers, and cut nearly 7 days off the total travel time for wagon trains going to Fort Hall. Despite the better conditions for livestock, the mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather made passage sometimes difficult and required continuing federally funded maintenance on the mountainous road—not a sure <b>thing</b> <b>just</b> before, {{during and after the}} American Civil War. Funds were appropriated in 1858 and 115 men (hired in Utah) completed the road in Wyoming and Idaho in 90 days, clearing timber and moving about [...] of earth. The Lander's road or cutoff opened in 1859 when it was extensively used. Records after 1859 are lacking and its use after that period are assumed to sharply decrease since the Sublette Cutoff, the Central Overland Route and other cutoffs were just about as fast or faster and were much less strenuous. Today the Lander cutoff road(s) are roughly followed by a series of county and Forest Service roads.|$|E

500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical <b>thing,</b> <b>just</b> this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
500|$|For {{the filming}} of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the {{creature}} would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but {{they had not been}} told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt: [...] "What you saw on camera was the real response. She {{had no idea what the}} hell happened. All of a sudden this <b>thing</b> <b>just</b> came up." [...] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.|$|E
500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] was {{directed}} by Pete Michels and written by Donick Cary, Tim Long and Ron Hauge. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on Halloween,1999. [...] "I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did" [...] was conceived and written by former staff writer Cary. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Cary said that {{he came up with}} the segment after watching the 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer. [...] "I had just seen the movie and I was like, 'Hey, there you go.'" [...] he said. While Flanders serves as the segment's antagonist, the role would originally go to Grampa, who would chase Homer inside a roller disco. While Grampa does not appear in the segment, the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders. Despite serving as writer for the segment, Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated Austin Powers series, which never came to fruition. In his absence, the writing staff rewrote {{the last quarter of the}} segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf. In order to dispose of Ned Flanders' corpse, Homer throws his body into Flanders' house. After he is finished, he says [...] "That's the end of that chapter", a phrase that Cary often uses in his everyday life. [...] "That's just something that comes up a lot in my life is when no matter if it's a good or a bad <b>thing,</b> <b>just</b> move on" [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide praised [...] "David Schwimmer for {{throwing}} himself into this role" [...] as Jared, [...] "this rather unlikable lout." [...] Webb Mitovich also wrote that [...] " [...] party {{in and of}} itself has to be one of 30 Rocks finest and most manic moments." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] " [...] Schwimmer was good as Greenzo" [...] and that [...] "the subplots were some of the most bizarre this season." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that the [...] "cameo from Al Gore {{at the end of the}} show added little to the episode. It was a fine bit, but it wasn't helped by the fact that nearly the entire scene had already aired in the promos leading up to the episode" [...] and that [...] "seeing [...] desperately take on the role of Greenzo and then get carried away with the whole concept could have been hysterically self-referential [...] Instead we got Jerrod as Greenzo and the whole <b>thing</b> <b>just</b> felt flat and forced." [...] Canning rated the episode [...] "8 out of 10" [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen also felt that Al Gore's appearance had been [...] "already given away in [...] promos". He praised the episode's dialogue, saying that Baldwin's line, [...] "you could put on a silly hat and tell the kids how outsourcing means cheaper toys for Christmas" [...] was the sort of dialogue that [...] "makes 30 Rock rock. Hard." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that this episode [...] "was one of the best of season 2" [...] and that [...] "Schwimmer's performance reminded [...] of his most bizarre episodes as Friends Ross Geller, like 'The One With Ross's Sandwich'." [...] The episode of Friends referred to includes Schwimmer's character, Ross, shouting at his boss for eating his special Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.|$|E

[...] Rosemary Cain, whose son was killed, called the project a [...] "slap in the face", and said [...] "I think it's despicable.

It has been suggested that Muldoon saw him as a leadership threat and acted accordingly. Ironically, the subsequent [...] was won by David Lange, and the attention that this got him helped propel him to the leadership of the Labour Party and his landslide victory over Muldoon in the 1984 election.

2500|$|Unlike other bands {{associated}} with the 1990s alternative music movement, Primus emerged from a mostly heavy metal background, with Claypool and LaLonde previously {{a part of the}} 1980s Californian thrash metal underground. Kirk Hammett, guitarist of Bay Area thrash metal band Metallica, stated in an 1991 interview that Primus are [...] "unique, they're a square peg in a round hole". The music of Primus has been described as [...] "thrash-funk meets Don Knotts, Jr." [...] and [...] "the Freak Brothers set to music". Also, Primus has been categorized as alternative rock, alternative metal, experimental rock, funk rock, funk metal, progressive rock, and [...] "thrash-funk". Regarding the band's genre, Claypool has stated [...] "We've been lumped in with the funk metal <b>thing</b> <b>just</b> about everywhere. I guess people just have to categorise you". MTV suggests that Primus is [...] "a post-punk Rush spiked with the sensibility and humor of Frank Zappa". Les Claypool himself once described their music as [...] "psychedelic polka." [...] Spin have labelled Primus as [...] "pranksters" [...] and an [...] "unlikely gold-selling white trash purveyor of hard-ass pinballing funk metal".|$|E
