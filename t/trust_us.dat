25|$|On June 1, 1909, U.S. Steel finally withdrew {{recognition}} of the AA at the 12 remaining unionized mills. While the union's larger locals, such as those at Youngstown Sheet and Tube and the LaBelle Iron Works, disbanded without a fight, most of the union's smaller affiliates fought back. A strike was called. The AFL began a national campaign to publicize dangerous working conditions in the company's plants and the monopolistic nature of the <b>trust.</b> <b>U.S.</b> Steel aggressively countered, breaking up union meetings with hired thugs, driving organizers out of town, bringing in strikebreakers and shifting production to other plants. Although the AA flirted with bankruptcy, donations from other unions kept it afloat. The strike dragged on for 14 months, and was broken in December 1910.|$|E

5000|$|<b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> {{was created}} as a {{financial}} company to serve both institutions and individuals by acting as executor and trustee of their funds. At a time when trusts were rare, the concept was innovative. By 1886 the company had established itself as a reputable and stable financial institution. [...] In the mid-1800s, <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> had a list of wealthy clients and {{played a role in}} major construction projects including railroads and the Panama Canal. Many of the company’s corporate clients issued securities to finance these initiatives, allowing <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> to serve as corporate trustee. The boom in industry and enterprise also helped to grow <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust's</b> business in managing personal trusts. In the 1880s and 90s <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> clients included William Waldorf Astor, Jay Gould and Oliver Harriman.|$|R

5000|$|<b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust,</b> Bank of America Private Wealth Management (formerly {{known as}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation) {{was founded in}} 1853 as the United States Trust Company of New York.

5000|$|<b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> was {{acquired}} in May 2000 for $2.7 billion in stock, {{making it a}} wholly owned subsidiary of Charles Schwab & Co. David Pottruck, CEO of Charles Schwab at the time, pursued the acquisition to broaden the firm’s wealth management platform and stop client outflow to bigger wealth management firms like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Efforts to integrate the exclusive <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> into the discount-broker Schwab yielded a culture clash that ultimately undermined the merger. [...] Schwab agreed to sell <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> to Bank of America for $3.3 billion in cash in November 2006. [...] The acquisition of <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> was completed in 2007 and significantly strengthened Bank of America’s position in the private banking business {{and its ability to}} cater to some of the nation's wealthiest clients.On July 13, 2000 <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation was issued a [...] "cease and desist" [...] order directing <b>U.S.</b> <b>Trust</b> to strengthen money laundering policies relating to the Bank Secrecy Act.

6000|$|If we {{had such}} a Comforter as that, could we not take evil from his hands, as well as good? We have had fathers of our flesh who {{corrected}} us, and we gave them reverence. They chastised us, but we loved and trusted them, because we knew that they loved and <b>trusted</b> us--chastised <b>us</b> to make us better--chastised <b>us</b> because they <b>trusted</b> <b>us</b> to become better. But {{if we can find}} a Father of our spirits, of our souls, shall we not rather be in subjection to Him and live? If He sent us a Comforter, to comfort and guide, and inspire, and strengthen us, shall we not say of that Comforter--"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." ...|$|R

Ebert also praised male leads Striesow and Schoenemann calling the similarities of both characters' physical presences as being [...] "unsettling".|$|R
6000|$|It arrested Mitchy, but his {{ingenuity}} {{could only}} rebound. [...] "In ONE way: that of reducing us {{to feel that}} the desire to 'make up' to her is--well, mainly for OUR relief.

[...] As his friend appeared to wait then to hear, it was presently with positive joy that he showed he could meet the last difficulty. [...] "What she <b>trusts</b> <b>us</b> to do"--oh Mitchy had worked it out!--"is to let HIM off." ...|$|R
