40|$|A {{common problem}} occurs when {{refrigerant}} fluids wick inside the insulation of <b>thermocouple</b> <b>wires</b> through a compressor's casing feedthrough and then leak into the adjacent disconnect box outside the casing. Leaking fluids create an unfavorable situation inside the disconnect box and may contaminate the fluids. To address this problem, NASA Lewis Research Center s Manufacturing Engineering Division developed a customized hermetic feedthrough for {{a bank of}} Worthington compressors. In these compressors, bearing temperatures are measured by internal thermocouples embedded in bearings located inside the compressor casings. The <b>thermocouple</b> <b>wires</b> need to be routed outside the casing and read at another location. These wires are short and are terminated to a disconnect strip inside the casing. The bearings operate at about 170 F, but because the casing is filled with R 12 refrigerant oil, the casing has a maximum temperature of about 100 F. The operating conditions of these compressors {{permit the use of}} an epoxy that is compatible with the R 12 fluid. The desired finished product is a stainless steel tube that has been filled solid with epoxy after <b>thermocouple</b> <b>wires</b> bonded and sealed by epoxy have been inserted through its length. Shrink tubing extends from both ends of the tube. The process that was developed to isolate the <b>thermocouple</b> <b>wires</b> from the R 12 fluid follows. For this application, use an 8 -in. -long piece of 0. 500 -in. 304 stainless steel tube with six pairs of 24 -gauge stranded, PTFE-insulated (polytetrafluoroethylene) type "T" <b>thermocouple</b> <b>wires</b> for each feedthrough. Use shrink tubing to strain relief the insulated wires at their exit from the stainless steel tube. Cut the wire to length and identify the location of the stainless steel tube sleeve with masking tape. Then, remove the outer insulation from a 2 -in. section of wire that will be inside the tube, and carefully strip to bare wire a 1 -in. section {{in the middle of the}} section with the outer insulation removed. For an effective seal, the epoxy must penetrate between the strands when stranded conductors are used. Make the seal with epoxy bond on the bare wire. The bare wire must be encapsulated with a thin layer of the epoxy that leaves only a very low profile. These encapsulated wires must cure before the assembly can be continued. Then, inspect the cured wires for complete encapsulation before going to the next step. Insert the wires in the stainless steel tube and orient them so that the epoxied stripped sections are staggered within the tube; then, apply shrink tubing to one end of the cleaned wires, positioning it inside the edge of the tube. The small gaps between the wires on the other end will be used to inject the epoxy into the tube. Let the epoxy cure inside the tube, free of any voids. Then, continue to fill the tube until the entire 8 -in. length is nearly filled, allowing room for the other strain-relieving shrink tubing. Since this first design, the process has been adjusted to fit many needs and situations. Customized feedthroughs have been assembled from various wire types, wire gauges, and/or stainless steel tube passages. The fittings selected to mount these feedthroughs allow their use in other areas, such as pressure or vacuum systems...|$|R

40|$|Analytical, {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} analyses {{have been performed}} to investigate the effects of <b>thermocouple</b> <b>wire</b> electrical insulation on the temperature measurement of a reference surface. Two diameters of type K thermocouple, 80 μm and 200 μm, with different exposed wire lengths (0 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm) were used to measure various surface temperatures (4 °C, 8 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C and 35 °C).

A brief description of the microfabrication process and chemical analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the vapor deposited alloy constituents for the TFT are reported in this study. K-type (chromel and alumel) <b>thermocouple</b> <b>wires</b> were used as targets for physical vapor deposition of the compo-nent layers of the TFT. The calibration of the TFT using high-speed data acquisition is reported.
