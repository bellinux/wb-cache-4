40|$|Abstract—To better {{understand}} the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process, a 3 D finite element model is established to analyzing the electromagnetic, temperature and flow fields of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>ingot</b> during steady state melting process using ANSYS software. The research {{results show that the}} current flows from the crucible to consumable electrode. The magnetic field induced by current is rotary on axial line, which increases firstly and then decreases from the center to edge of crucible. The buoyancy, self-induced and stirring Lorentz forces are three main motion forces in molten pool. The molten pool is strongly influenced by fluid flows which in turn are driven by buoyancy and Lorentz force created by the melting current without stirring magnetic field. The flow velocity vectors resulted from buoyancy and self-induced Lorentz forces are opposite. The buoyancy dominates the liquid metal flow at lower current, but the self-induced Lorentz force becomes dominant with the increasing current. A transition from the buoyancy to self-induced Lorentz force dominant fluid flow occurs in the molten pool atop the ingot between 1. 6 and 2. 6 kA for size ingots. The stirring Lorentz force leads to a rotary flow of the molten pool in horizontal direction with stirring magnetic field. V Index Terms—VAR, FEM, electromagnetic field, fluid fiel...|$|E
40|$|For many {{continuous}} {{ingot casting}} processes, turbulent heat transfer in the molten pool plays {{a critical role}} which, along with buoyancy and surface tension, {{is responsible for the}} quality of the end products. Based on a modified low Reynolds number k-ε two-equation closure, accounting for the phase change and mushy zone formation, the effect of turbulent heat transfer on the solidification characteristics during <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>ingot</b> casting in an electron beam melting process is investigated. The overall heat transfer rate is enhanced by turbulent transport via two sources, one through the correlated velocity and temperature fluctuations present for both single- and multi-phase flows, and the other through the correlated velocity and release of latent heat fluctuations which are unique to the flows with phase change. The roles played by both mechanisms are identified and assessed. The present turbulence model predicts that although the mushy zone defined by the mean temperature field is generally of substantial thickness {{as a result of the}} convection effect, the actual instantaneous zone thickness varies substantially due to turbulence effect. This finding is in contrast to the traditionally held viewpoint, based on the conduction analysis, of a generally thin mushy zone.

40|$|Continuous {{ingot casting}} is an {{important}} processing technology for many materials. Under most practical circumstances, turbulence plays a critical role which, along with transport mechanisms such as buoyancy, surface tension, and phase change, {{is responsible for the}} quality of the end products. A modified turbulence model based on the standard k-e two-equation closure is proposed and applied to predict the phase change and convection-diffusion characteristics during <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>ingot</b> casting in an electron beam melting process. In conjunction with an adaptive grid computational technique, solutions of the coupled mass continuity, momentum, energy, and turbulence transport have been obtained {{in the context of the}} enthalpy formulation. Effects of casting speed and gravity on solidification and convection characteristics have been investigated and compared to ones obtained previously with a simple zeroequation turbulence model. The present turbulence model predicts that the mushy zone is generally of substantial thickness as a result of the convection effect, that the solidus line has a high curvature, and that the temperature gradient close to the solidus line is higher than elsewhere. Under all conditions, the turbulence structure largely reflects the combined influence of convection and energy input by the electron beam and the superheated feeding material from the top surface. The numerical results have been compared with an experimentally determined pool profile from a casting ingot. © 1992...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 <b>Titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{have turned}} {{strategically}} important in aerospace applications {{due to their}} high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and good strength sustainability at high temperatures. The joining of lightweight materials such as <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> in aerospace industries offer two main benefits of near net shape manufacturing and of reduction in buy to fly ratio. Among the various joining methods, Diffusion Bonding and Friction Stir Welding (FSW) can be combined with superplastic forming, therefore, have been widely accepted technique to join <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> to produce complex sheet structures with reduced weight and fabrication costs compared to mechanically fastened structures. Both the processes are mainly optimized for <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy,</b> Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, to produce defect free sheets of it. The other <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> such as Ti- 6242 and Ti- 54 MFG offer advantages of high temperature sustainability and better machinability over Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. The joining of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> with different properties can improve the utilization of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> and increase the functional properties of joints. However, a very limited {{research has been conducted}} on joining techniques with dissimilar <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Therefore, the current study examines the processes with dissimilar <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> to broaden the application of the process with <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys.</b> The capability of diffusion bonding process for similar and dissimilar <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> was studied with five <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys,</b> Ti- 64 SG, Ti- 64 FG, Ti- 6242 SG, Ti- 54 M, and Beta- 21 S, by maintaining two governing parameters pressure and time constant while the temperature was varied during the formation of joints. The friction stir welding of similar and dissimilar titanium joints was also studied with five <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys,</b> Ti- 64 SG,Ti- 64 FG,Ti- 6242 SG,Ti- 6242 FG, and Ti- 54 MFG, by varying two parameters namely, spindle speed and the feed rate, that control the quality of the process. The bond integrity of both the processes was evaluated with metallographic examination and mechanical testing. The surface and subsurface characteristics were examined to evaluate the surface characteristics and bonding strength. The mechanical strength of diffusion-bonded joints was investigated by conducting flexure testing whereas of the friction stir welded joints were examined by performing tensile tests. The probabilistic theoretical model of estimation of bonding time of dissimilar alloys was developed by computing the surface topography at the joint interface. A combined approach of numerical and experimental methodology was used to investigate the mechanical response of different titanium joints. The numerical model was developed to simulate flexural behavior of dissimilar diffusion bonded titanium joints from the material curves of its parent alloys. Similarly tensile behavior of friction stir welded similar <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> for different process conditions was developed to identify the locations of maximum stress and strain in the joints. The numerical results were compared to experimentally determined behavior characteristics of the joints to gage the validity of the modeling approach. It was found that there was good agreement in the numerical and experimental results of the tensile behavior in titanium FSW joints. The diffusion bonding temperatures lower than the β transus temperature of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> were identified to obtain sound bonds in similar and dissimilar <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys.</b> The quality of bonding was improved as the bonding temperature was increased. In case of friction stir welding, the optimum values of spindle speed and feed rate for the joints formed by similar <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> were 275 RPM/ 100 mm min- 1, whereas it was 325 RPM/ 125 mm min- 1 for the joints formed by dissimilar <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys...</b>|$|R

The rods of TC 21 alloy with the diameter of Φ 20 mm and Φ 90 mm possess good mechanical properties after solution at 900 °C followed by aging at 600 °C...|$|R
50|$|Vanadium stabilizes {{the beta}} form of {{titanium}} {{and increases the}} strength and temperature stability of titanium. Mixed with aluminium in <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys,</b> it is used in jet engines, high-speed airframes and dental implants. The most common alloy for seamless tubing is Titanium 3/2.5, the <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> of choice in the aerospace, defense and bicycle industries. Another common alloy, primarily produced in sheets, is Titanium 6AL-4V, a <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> with 6% aluminium and 4% vanadium.|$|R
