5|$|Sunday, August 9, 1942, {{was a day}} {{of mixed}} {{emotions}} for <b>the</b> <b>congregation.</b> At twelve o'clock noon, one final Mass was said in the old St. Peter Church, which had been the house of <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> for the past thirty-eight years. People cried as the Blessed Sacrament was carried {{out of the church}} by the pastor. <b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> followed the pastor up to the new church.|$|E
5|$|The series {{travels to}} various churches and congregations {{to have a}} single, unsuspecting member of the church {{presented}} with potential suitors. Each episode begins at the setting of a church service, with host Natalie Grant appearing to introduce the show. A single member of <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> is introduced {{to his or her}} surprise, while members of <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> then nominate other single members of <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> as suitors. The number of suitors is immediately narrowed down to four; they are the top three as voted by <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> and a fourth chosen by the pastor or minister.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Beth Elohim allowed {{women to}} become full members, {{granting}} them full voting privileges and {{allowing them to}} hold office. <b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> subsequently elected Jeanette Marks as a trustee. At this time {{the origins of the}} membership began to change, as Jews of Eastern European descent started joining <b>the</b> <b>congregation.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1876, <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> had {{purchased}} {{land on the}} south side of 14th and Webster streets; however, due to a severe recession in California at the time, <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> did not construct a building until 1878.

5|$|Congregation Sons of Israel, {{self-described}} as egalitarian Conservative, was {{the first}} synagogue in Briarcliff Manor. <b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> was formed in 1891 by eleven men in Ossining, and until 1902 services were held in homes and stores. That year, <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> (now twenty-three families) purchased a building on Durston Avenue; the Jewish Cemetery, established in 1900 on Dale Avenue, is still in use. In 1920, the synagogue, numbering forty-five families, established a religious school. After outgrowing its facilities, it purchased a site on Waller Avenue and completed a new synagogue in 1922. During the 1950s <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> purchased the eleven-acre Mead Farm on Pleasantville Road, which it has used since 1960.|$|E

5|$|Etz Ahayem, was {{established}} in 1912 by Ladino speaking Sephardi Jews, particularly from Rhodes. <b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> grew slowly, and completed construction of its first building in 1927. In 1962 <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> {{moved to a new}} building, but by the 1990s it had dwindled, as children of congregants moved away from Montgomery, and the synagogue had difficulty finding rabbis to lead it.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1852 by Rabbi Abraham Ash as Beth Hamedrash, <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> {{split in}} 1859, with the rabbi {{and most of}} the members {{renaming}} their congregation Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. The congregation's president and a small number of the members eventually formed the nucleus of Kahal Adath Jeshurun, also known as the Eldridge Street Synagogue. Rabbi Jacob Joseph, the first and only Chief Rabbi of New York City, led <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> from 1888 to 1902. Rabbi Ephraim Oshry, one of the few European Jewish legal decisors to survive the Holocaust, led <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> from 1952 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|Membership {{peaked in}} the 1920s, {{but with the}} onset of the Great Depression {{declined}} steadily, and by the 1970s <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary. Membership has recovered since that low point; <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> renovated its school/community center in 2004, and in 2008 embarked on a million-dollar capital campaign to renovate the sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|Oberholtzer's {{congregation}} {{was part}} of Franconia Conference, a group of 22 Mennonite congregations located in eastern Pennsylvania.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>congregations</b> {{of simple}} vows, {{especially}} women’s, were increasing dramatically during the 17th and 18th Centuries, {{and in the}} early 19th Century, many of them were seeking papal recognition from Rome. in 1816 the Holy See began to approve <b>the</b> <b>congregations</b> with simple vows but they were still not recognized as religious institutions.|$|R
25|$|The {{boundaries}} between <b>the</b> <b>congregations</b> of Maghera and Tobermore {{were to be}} the Moyola River, from Newforge Bridge to Corrin Bridge. In 1743 however, nineteen families from Ballynahone, which straddles the Moyola River, were transferred from Maghera into <b>the</b> Tobermore <b>congregation.</b> <b>The</b> fourth minister of <b>the</b> Tobermore <b>congregation,</b> <b>the</b> Reverend William Brown, saw {{the need for the}} formation of a new congregation in Draperstown and facilitated its development in 1835 despite meaning losing around 70 families from his Tobermore congregation.|$|R
5|$|Taubenhaus left <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> in 1901, and the {{following}} year Alexander Lyons was hired as the congregation's first American-born rabbi. Lyons went on to serve <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> for 37 years, {{until his death in}} 1939 at the age of 71.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> {{carried out}} {{extensive}} charity campaigns during the Passover season; by 1905 <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> was distributing wagon-loads of matzos to poor Jews {{so they could}} celebrate the holiday. By 1907–1908 membership had risen to 500 (up from 160 in 1900), the Talmud Torah had 250 students, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $25,000 (today $). <b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> ran into financial difficulties of its own in 1908, and in October of that year raised funds by selling a number of its Torah scrolls in a public auction.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> {{decided to}} leave the Conservative {{movement}} in 1995, and for a year had no affiliation. In late 1996, after considering both Reform and Reconstructionist as alternatives, <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> affiliated with the Reconstructionist movement. By 1999, membership had grown to around 370 families.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> hired Marcus Friedlander of Congregation Baith Israel in Brooklyn, New York in 1893. Soon {{after he}} was hired, California {{experienced}} another economic downturn, which hurt the finances of members of <b>the</b> <b>congregation.</b> <b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> sold its property at 13th and Clay (which had become {{the heart of the}} business district) in 1895, and moved to a less expensive location at the northwest corner of 12th and Castro streets, and renovated the building there in 1896. Over 500 people, both Jews and non-Jews, were sheltered in the building for days after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The synagogue had 95 members by 1907, with annual revenues of $6,000 (today $).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> was {{initially}} {{made up of}} only ten families but grew to include 50 members by 1878. By the time their second building was built in 1906, <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> included 82 members, and Meridian as a whole had grown to include 525 Jewish residents by 1927. By the 2000s there were fewer than forty, mostly elderly Jews remaining in the city, however, and <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> no longer has a full-time rabbi. Former rabbis include Judah Wechsler, after whom the Wechsler school was named, and William Ackerman, whose wife Paula Ackerman {{became the first woman}} to perform rabbinical duties in the country after her husband's unexpected death.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> was {{originally}} established in 1860 by Jews of German background. Its primary {{purpose was to}} create a Jewish cemetery, which it immediately did, on State Street. In November 1862 <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> hired a Mr. Oberndorfer as cantor; its next goal was provide a Jewish education for the congregation's children. At the time Jackson had 15 Jewish families.|$|E
50|$|The church {{experienced}} growth {{during the}} 1950 and the 1960s, mainly because <b>the</b> free <b>congregations</b> joined <b>the</b> Old-Reformed <b>Congregations.</b> <b>The</b> number of <b>the</b> 48 <b>congregations</b> that formed <b>the</b> federation increased to over 60. A few Christian Reformed Churches in the Netherlands parishes joined in Leersum, Thorn and Dortrecht.|$|R

5|$|The congregation's first church {{building}} was erected beginning in May 1823 and consecrated {{a few months}} later on 19 November 1823 by the Rt Rev'd John Croes, Bishop of New Jersey. This building was located at the corner of Church and Main streets, on a tract of land conveyed to <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> by William T. Anderson, a local attorney. The Gothic structure was described as small; it accommodated 250 worshipers. Toward the end of Pettit's tenure, <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> was compelled to build a new {{church building}} as their current building had become unstable and unsafe. During the construction, <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> met at the county courthouse and at Rinker's Hall, a building located near the courthouse on the Newton Town Green.|$|E
5|$|The {{membership}} decline {{continued in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s, as older congregants died and moved away, and dwindled {{to the point where}} <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary, and thought they would have to disband. Nevertheless, in 1972 <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> established a nursery school and prozdor (high school).|$|E
5|$|The synagogue's {{fortunes}} {{improved in}} the 1940s, but in 1946, its bank threatened to foreclose on its buildings, {{in anticipation of}} their sale to the local Catholic diocese, as <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> had not paid the mortgage in many years. <b>The</b> <b>congregation</b> succeeded in convincing the bank to re-negotiate its mortgage, and reduce the outstanding loan, and Max Koeppel led a drive to pay it off completely.|$|E
2500|$|In 1830 <b>the</b> <b>congregations</b> merged {{and adopted}} the new {{denomination}} of the Prussian Union. The parish federation with <b>the</b> <b>congregations</b> of <b>the</b> New Church ended then. In 1838 – maybe as reward for adopting the Union – Karl Friedrich Schinkel rebuilt {{the church on}} state expenses and added a new tower top, reaching the height of 72 m.|$|R
50|$|Some survived, however, and the 19th century {{brought a}} revival in the monastic movement. <b>The</b> two <b>congregations</b> were renewed by Pope Leo XIII on 23 August 1889 as <b>the</b> <b>Congregations</b> of Mary and Joseph respectively, and were {{combined}} as <b>the</b> present Austrian <b>Congregation</b> by Pope Pius XI on 8 December 1930.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Congregations</b> {{must make}} certain {{arrangements}} {{in respect of}} the pope's burial, which by tradition takes place within four to six days of the pope's death, leaving time for pilgrims to see the dead pontiff, and is {{to be followed by}} a nine-day period of mourning (this is known as the novemdiales, Latin for [...] "nine days"). <b>The</b> <b>Congregations</b> also fix <b>the</b> date and time of the commencement of the conclave. The conclave normally takes place fifteen days after the death of the pope, but <b>the</b> <b>Congregations</b> may extend <b>the</b> period to a maximum of twenty days in order to permit other cardinals to arrive in the Vatican City.|$|R
