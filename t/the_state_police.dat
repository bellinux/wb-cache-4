5|$|Judge Green {{presided over}} a number of notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police to {{reinstate}} William Bolden, a minority trooper who had been dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in a consent decree that required <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Police</b> to hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Police.</b>|$|E

5|$|Much of {{southern}} Massachusetts, from its border with New York toward Worcester {{and to the}} ocean, experienced flooding. Most streams in western Massachusetts overflowed their banks, and in southeastern Massachusetts, which is largely flat terrain, streams flooded large areas along their channels; these streams moved slowly, while other areas in New England sustained damage due to the fast-moving nature of the floods. Record flooding was reported along 24stream gauges in the state, including ones that surpassed the peak set by the 1938 New England hurricane. Both the Charles and Neponset rivers were among those that flooded. About 40% {{of the city of}} Worcester was flooded during Diane, and in Russell, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>police</b> forced many residents to evacuate. In Weymouth, the floods were considered at least a 1 in 50 year event. The Little River in Buffumville, Massachusetts had a peak discharge of 8,340ft³/s (236m³/s), which was 6.2times greater than the previous peak and 28.5times the average annual flooding. Flooded rivers breached run-of-the-river dams and covered nearby roadways, although dams with reservoirs resulted in less flooding. Nearly all dams along the French River were severely damaged or destroyed. One failed dam in West Auburn washed out a portion of U.S. Route 20, and the same route was washed out near Charlton. An overflown brook also damaged the Massachusetts Turnpike. A train on the Boston and Albany Railroad line plunged into a washed out portion along the Westfield River. Along the same river, floods destroyed roads and tobacco farms. In the state, 97houses were destroyed. Damage in Massachusetts was second worst of the affected states, totaling $110million; the damage was largely due to flooded basements. There were 12deaths in the state.|$|E
