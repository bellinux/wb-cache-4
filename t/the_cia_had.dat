5|$|The attack {{took place}} as the CIA {{expanded}} {{its role in the}} Afghanistan War, increasing paramilitary operations, including drone attacks in Pakistan. To accomplish this, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> built a number of bases in the southern and eastern provinces of Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> become careless out of desperation. According to Ignatius, it would be obvious that the CIA would have been so eager to acquire knowledge about the location of Osama bin Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information. Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E
5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The 1949 Intelligence Survey Group had {{produced}} the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, {{which found that}} <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> failed in its responsibilities in both the coordination and production of intelligence. In response, the U.S. National Security Council accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the report. It remained to implement them. In May 1950, President Truman decided that Smith was the man he needed for the CIA. Before Smith could assume the post on 7 October, {{there was a major}} intelligence failure. The North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which started the Korean War, took the administration entirely by surprise, and it raised fears of a third world war.|$|E
5|$|The various {{agencies}} {{that participated in}} Operation PBHistory had different aims in mind for {{the products of the}} operation. The CIA was most interested in using the information gathered against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the United States Information Agency was to use the documents to release information {{that could be used to}} change international opinion. The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> veto power over any public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, Operation Kufire and Operation Kugown, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSUCCESS.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of an Egyptian agent, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> {{obtained}} a sample of soil from the facility taken in December 1997 showing the presence of O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid (EMPTA), a substance used in the production of VX nerve gas, at 2.5 times trace levels. (Reports are contradictory on whether the soil was obtained from within the compound itself, or outside.) The collected soil was split into three samples, which were then analyzed by a private laboratory. The agent's bona fides were later confirmed through polygraph testing; however, the CIA produced a report on Al-Shifa on July 24, 1998, questioning whether Al-Shifa produced chemical weapons or simply stored precursors, and the agency advised collecting more soil samples. Cohen and Tenet later briefed U.S. senators on intercepted telephone communications from the plant that reputedly bolstered the American case against Al-Shifa. U.S. intelligence also purportedly researched the Al-Shifa factory online and searched commercial databases, but did not find any medicines for sale.|$|E

5|$|Operation PBHISTORY was {{an effort}} by the CIA to analyze {{documents}} from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union. Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> very little real information. A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} force led by Castillo Armas {{attempted to make}} forays towards the towns of Zacapa and Puerto Barrios; however, these were beaten back by the Guatemalan army. The propaganda broadcast by <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> far more effect; it succeeded in leading a Guatemalan pilot to defect, which led to Árbenz grounding the entire air force, fearing its defection. The CIA also used its planes, flown by American pilots, to bomb Guatemalan towns for psychological effect. When the old planes used by the invasion force {{were found to be}} inadequate, the CIA persuaded Eisenhower to authorize the use of two additional planes. Guatemala made an appeal to the United Nations, but the US vetoed an investigation into the incident by the Security Council, stating that it was an internal matter in Guatemala. On 25 June, a CIA plane bombed Guatemala City, destroying the government's main oil reserves. Frightened by this, Árbenz ordered the army to distribute weapons to local peasants and workers. The army refused to do this, instead demanding that Árbenz either resign or come to terms with Castillo Armas.|$|E

5000|$|Under Porter Goss, for {{a variety}} of reasons, {{including}} innovation, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>has</b> proposed moving its National Resources Division, concerned with issues in the U.S., to Denver, letting it work more freely than under Headquarters bureaucracy. [...] Some officers believe this is a bad idea and would hurt information sharing, the critical problem with the FBI. With regard to the prohibition on <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>having</b> any domestic law enforcement powers:... FBI is having significant problems developing its own domestic intelligence branch and <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> is generally viewed across the intelligence community as more experienced and skilled at handling foreign informants who eventually return abroad, where <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> lead in intelligence gathering and operations.|$|R

25|$|On 6 February 2008, CIA {{director}} General Michael Hayden {{stated that}} <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> waterboarded three prisoners during 2002 and 2003, namely Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.|$|E
25|$|Two {{contract}} psychologists {{devised the}} CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques {{and played a}} central role in the operation, assessments, and management of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

25|$|Whether {{waterboarding}} {{should be}} classified {{as a method of}} torture was not widely debated in the United States before it was alleged, in 2004, that members of <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> used the technique against certain suspected detained terrorists.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> {{long been}} dealing with {{terrorism}} originating from abroad, and in 1986 {{had set up a}} Counterterrorist Center to deal specifically with the problem.

25|$|An {{especially}} thorny issue {{concerned the}} interpretation of the secrecy which <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> previously enjoyed. According to its agents, the CIA's mandate included not only access to state secrets, but also the commission of clandestine acts in furtherance of USG policy, as ordered from time to time by the President. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> a primary duty to protect such secrets and to refrain from public discussion of any covert activity. An area of conflict arose when this CIA duty of confidentiality to the President came into direct conflict with the Agency's duty to respond honestly to legislative investigations of the executive branch authorized by the Constitution. Up until then, such potential conflict had been negotiated by quiet understandings between Congress and the CIA.|$|E
25|$|Declassified CIA {{documents}} show that <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>had</b> {{been aware of}} his wartime past since 1945. Information about Waldheim's wartime past was also previously published by a pro-German Austrian newspaper, Salzburger Volksblatt, during the 1971 presidential election campaign, including the claim of an SS membership, but the matter was supposedly regarded as unimportant or even advantageous for the candidate at that time.|$|E
25|$|During the Bosnian War, the CIA ignored signs {{within and}} without of the Srebrenica massacre.
