One of the first priorities is to add a second platform at all stations, which is mandated by the 2003 agreement with Amtrak. New London, Old Saybrook, Guilford, Westbrook, Branford, and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms, while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 2 billion years, star {{formation}} throughout Andromeda's disk {{is thought to}} have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.|$|E

5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a white rot fungus, which use {{cellulose}} as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E

The film co-stars Rose Byrne, January Jones and Oliver Platt. The film also introduces new actors to the series including Nicholas Hoult and Jennifer Lawrence who, like McAvoy and Fassbender, reimagine popular characters from the franchise (Beast and Mystique) <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> established in previous films, namely the original trilogy.|$|E

25|$|A {{concretion}} is a hard, compact mass {{of matter}} {{formed by the}} precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between particles, and is found in sedimentary rock or soil. Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape, although irregular shapes also occur. The word 'concretion' {{is derived from the}} Latin con meaning 'together' and crescere meaning 'to grow'. Concretions form within layers of sedimentary strata <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> deposited. They usually form early in the burial history of the sediment, before the rest of the sediment is hardened into rock. This concretionary cement often makes the concretion harder and more resistant to weathering than the host stratum.|$|E
