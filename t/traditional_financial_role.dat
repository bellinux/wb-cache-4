40|$|Although {{bank loans}} {{themselves}} are illiquid because of inside information, {{most of their}} cashflows are not. Recent financial innovations allow most bank loans to be liquefied via credit derivatives and actual and synthetic securitizations. The loan originating-monitoring bank holds the remaining illiquid residual tranche that contains the concentrated credit risk and information rent. We find that in securitizing a representative commercial loan portfolio, the average residual tranche is about 3 %, which is the "market determined capital" necessary to support the liquefaction. These innovations turn risky bank loans into liquid securities to be funded by institutional investors and non-guaranteed deposits. If we also restrict transaction accounts {{with access to the}} payment system to be backed by 100 % reserve, the banking system is perfectly safe without sacrificing a bank's <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> intermediary <b>role.</b> The idea of " 100 % money", which is known to be advocated by Irvine Fisher in 1930 's, is now revived with the challenge from new financial technologies. The new system is clearly superior to the current disaster-prone convoluted fractional reserve banking system with deposit insurance and moral hazard. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to review the {{microfinance}} scheme and discuss how Islamic banks can participate in such an endeavour without actually compromising the issue of institutional viability and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on an extensive review of microfinance with the objective of building a case for Islamic banking to participate in a microfinance initiative. Findings – As reviewed in this paper, microfinance requires innovative approaches beyond the <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> intermediary <b>role.</b> Among others, building human capacity through social intermediation and designing group-based lending programmes are proven to be among the effective tools to reduce transaction costs and lower exposure to numerous financial risks in relation to providing credit to the rural poor. This paper also suggests the use of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) as one of the possible alternatives for Islamic banks channelling funds to the poor. Research limitations/implications – Islamic banks may benefit from the spectrum of Shariah-compliant sources of funds and offer a wide array of financing instruments catering for different needs and demands of their clients. Furthermore, the use of a bankruptcy-remote entity like SPV can protect Islamic banks from any adverse effect of microfinance activities. Originality/value – The analysis here is valuable in drawing the attention of Islamic banking practitioners to the fact that they can actually practise microfinance without undermining their institutional viability, competitiveness and sustainability. This is evident from the proposed model to incorporate SPV into their microfinance initiatives. Banking, Disadvantaged groups, Financial services, Islam, Poverty...|$|R

30|$|The basic {{logic of}} the changes in mobile Internet finance can be {{characterized}} as follows: Financial products are innovated through mobile Internet. Product innovation spawns a new batch of financial organizations, and new products and organizations induce innovation in the financial system.

Thus, the financialization of mobile Internet enterprises and the internalization of <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> institutions involve processes that are constantly changing and developing. As such, it is important to study the formation processes of mobile Internet finance.|$|R

40|$|Cash {{flow from}} {{operations}} (CFO) {{is an important}} component in the statement of cash flows. It is viewed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and many users of the financial statements as a good indicator of whether a company will be in financial distress (i. e. bankruptcy). Previous studies have explored the bankruptcy predictive ability of CFO to show that the above view is only based on intuition and not empirical study. Therefore, overreliance on CFO rather than <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> ratios will lead creditors and investors to make wrong decisions. The {{purpose of this study is}} to reexamine previous researchers' findings that although CFO can serve as an indicator of whether a firm will be bankrupt, it does not predict bankruptcy as well as <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> ratios. In addition, CFO does not even have marginal predictive ability when included in a prediction model containing <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> ratios. Compared to previous research, this study uses the most recent data. It focuses only on three major industries: manufacturing, wholesaling, and retailing industries. A sample of 36 bankrupt companies and 36 nonbankrupt companies is analyzed using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA). The results indicate that CFO variables - CFO, CFO/CL (Current Liabilities), and CFO/TL (Total Liabilities) are statistically significant different between bankrupt and nonbankrupt firms for the first and the second year prior to bankruptcy. CFO variables can serve as a predictor of whether a firm will be bankrupt; however, their predictive ability is mediocre. They do not predict bankruptcy as accurately as <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> ratios. In fact, their predictive ability with respect to bankruptcy is much worse than that of the financial ratios. This study also finds that CFO variables contribute little or no significant marginal predictive value when used together with <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> ratios for the first and second years prior to bankruptcy. In other words, this study strongly substantiates the findings of previous research...|$|R

The {{result of this}} study supports our prior expectations that failing firms are leaning toward changing auditors more than do healthier firms.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between capital budgeting sophistication and firm performance. Initially, the theoretical relationship is analysed. The <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> view, predicting a positive relationship, {{is presented as a}} starting point for the analysis. Other aspects, based on contingency and behavioural theories, are then brought into the discussion. These aspects shed light on the complexity of the relationship and question the positive relationship advocated by <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> theory. In a second step, a model is constructed in order to measure {{the relationship between}} capital budgeting sophistication and performance empirically. The statistical model used is the regression analysis. Based on theory, variables for capital budgeting sophistication, and performance are constructed. Moreover, relevant explanatory variables are defined. Three different definitions of capital budgeting sophistication, ranging from simple to more complex, are used in order to be able to measure whether the choice of variable affects the findings. For the same reason three different performance measures are used. The final step of this thesis is to test the model constructed empirically on the Swedish market. Due to insufficient data the model is only partially tested. The results obtained are mostly negative and insignificant. These findings do not support <b>traditional</b> <b>financial</b> theory...|$|R
