The Northwest Boundary Survey listed Adams as having an elevation of [...] while a later US Coast and Geodetic Survey gave it an elevation of [...] The height was more closely determined in 1895 by members of the Mazamas mountaineering club, William A.

None of these numbers were used on any map because that same year, 1895, the US Geological Survey (USGS), using a <b>triangulation</b> <b>method,</b> also measured {{the height of}} several mountains in the Cascades and they measured Adams as having an elevation of [...] The USGS further refined their measurement sometime in late 1909 or early 1910 to [...] and again in 1970 to [...] for the release of the Mount Adams East 1:24000 quadrangle.

2500|$|<b>Triangulation</b> <b>method.</b> In {{developed}} countries {{a high proportion}} of cars contain one or more mobile phones. The phones periodically transmit their presence information to the mobile phone network, even when no voice connection is established. In the mid-2000s, attempts were made to use mobile phones as anonymous traffic probes. As a car moves, so does the signal of any mobile phones that are inside the vehicle. By measuring and analysing network data using triangulation, pattern matching or cell-sector statistics (in an anonymous format), the data was converted into traffic flow information. With more congestion, there are more cars, more phones, and thus, more probes. In metropolitan areas, the distance between antennas is shorter and in theory accuracy increases. An advantage of this method is that no infrastructure needs to be built along the road; only the mobile phone network is leveraged. But in practice the <b>triangulation</b> <b>method</b> can be complicated, especially in areas where the same mobile phone towers serve two or more parallel routes (such as a motorway (freeway) with a frontage road, a motorway [...] (freeway) and a commuter rail line, two or more parallel streets, or a street that is also a bus line).

However, this assumption is valid when the light is reflected at one time from a single convex surface. Actual objects often include concave surfaces where points reflect light between themselves. In {{the presence of these}} interreflections, active <b>triangulation</b> <b>methods</b> produce erroneous estimates of shape. In this paper, an approach is proposed to recover the shape of a specular object in the presence of interreflection, with prior knowledge on the shape information of the specular object or not. Both simulation and experiment results proved that the proposed approach was effective...|$|R
