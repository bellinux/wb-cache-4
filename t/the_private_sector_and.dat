5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>and</b> nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E
5|$|Rocco Landesman, {{chairperson}} of the National Endowment for the Arts, has used Citygarden {{as an example of}} a successful foundation-funded art venture. Landesman—a former resident of St. Louis—said that such projects can help urban areas economically, but they cannot be funded solely by the federal government, thus requiring assistance from both <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>and</b> foundations. Michael Van Valkenburgh, principal of a Brooklyn landscape architecture firm, said he was drawn to St. Louis partly because of Citygarden's design and success. Van Valkenburgh was selected in 2010 to renovate the grounds of the Gateway Arch.|$|E

In the hearing Berry stated he supported any effective employee compensation system, but that the federal government had the obligation to give employees with comparable job performances similar pay and treatment. He pledged to preserve veterans preference and supplement it with training programs to prepare veterans for federal jobs, and promised reviews of proposals to improve the security clearance and hiring processes. Berry emphasized the importance for agencies to use all recruitment tools, citing relocation benefits that could keep agencies competitive with <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>and</b> stated he would create a strategic plan and set performance goals for the Office of Personnel Management. Berry had stated support for benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 in <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>and</b> the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts.
