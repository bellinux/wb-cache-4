40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> from <b>the</b> Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation on psychological well-being among healthy participants. In a randomized controlled study, 301 participants completed the same 4 questionnaires on psychopathology. The experimental group additionally answered 21 items of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. The control group answered 19 items on Quality of Life. The experimental group showed a significantly smaller decrease of negative affect compared to the control condition. When analyzing participants with an increase in distress, 80 % were part of the experimental group. For most participants, answering <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide does not affect their mood. A small group of participants did react with some distress to <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide. As <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide were administered immediately before <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> negative affect, <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide could have worked as a negative mood challenge. Future experimental research should further investigate <b>the</b> effect of <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide among healthy participants, especially on the long term. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

In 2004, about {{one third of the}} then church members regularly attended church services. The Slovak Greek Catholic Church is an Eastern rite sui iuris Catholic Church. The pre–World WarII population of the country included an estimated 90,000 Jews (1.6% of the population).

25|$|Kristina Hjartåker was {{a female}} four-year-old fatally wounded in the Hatlestad slide, and died on February 7, 2006, when her {{treatment}} was ended. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> whether to continue her treatment became a cause célèbre, and caused the Liberal Party of Norway to announce their desire for a 'Kristina Law' that, if passed, will require an independent group to consider discontinuing life-prolonging treatment in cases where a dispute exists.

25|$|In Christian Europe, {{people were}} persecuted for heresy, {{especially}} {{in countries where}} the Inquisition was active. Thomas Aquinas' five proofs of God's existence and Anselm's ontological argument implicitly acknowledged the validity of <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> God's existence. Frederick Copleston, however, explains that Thomas laid out his proofs not to counter atheism, but to address certain early Christian writers such as John of Damascus, who asserted that knowledge of God's existence was naturally innate in man, based on his natural desire for happiness. Thomas stated that although there is desire for happiness which forms {{the basis for a}} proof of God's existence in man, further reflection is required to understand that this desire is only fulfilled in God, not for example in wealth or sensual pleasure.|$|E

He doesn't believe <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God's attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these findings, some detractors {{have pointed out that}} the Davis–Bacon Act requirements were rendered moot by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). At the time that Davis–Bacon Act was passed, legal scholars were divided on <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> whether the federal government could regulate labor costs and conditions. The Davis–Bacon Act was seen as a legitimate way to control labor wages and conditions on federal projects since there was clear jurisdiction on those. However, as the Depression rolled on, especially after the West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ruling in 1937, the Roosevelt Administration succeeded in establishing a federal authority to dictate wages, including a federal, universal minimum wage. In the view of some reviewers, this superseded the need for a prevailing wage law specific to federal contracts.|$|E
25|$|Quinn et al. (1998) find {{significant}} correlation between health status and retirement status. They transform answers for question about health status from five levels (“excellent”, “very good”, “good”, “fair” and “poor”) into three levels and report results for three groups of people. 85% of respondents who answered “excellent” or “very good” to <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> their health in 1992 were still working two years after this interview, compared to 82% of those who answered “good”, and 70% of those answered “fair” or “poor”. This fact is also true for year 1996: 73% {{of people from the}} first group were still on the job market, while this is 66% and 55% for other groups of people. However, Dhaval, Rashad and Spasojevic (2006) using data from six waves of Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) show that relationship between retirement and health status can imply the opposite effect in reality: physical and mental health decline after retirement.|$|E

The Polish general Władysław Anders began organizing this army, and soon he requested information about the missing Polish officers.
