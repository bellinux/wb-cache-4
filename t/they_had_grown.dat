5|$|In 1870, Anna Eliza Corwin {{divorced}} Brannan. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> {{apart as}} Eliza lived in Europe {{for quite some}} time while Brannan remained in California. Because of the divorce he lost much of his personal fortune, as it was ruled that his wife was entitled to half of their holdings, payable in cash. Because the vast majority of Brannan's holdings were in real estate, he had to liquidate the properties to pay the full divorce settlement.|$|E
5|$|Dangerous or not, Bache {{soon began}} a lifelong crusade to win {{popularity}} for Liszt's works in England. In 1865 {{he began a}} series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer Gustave Garcia. They began modestly, in Collard's Rooms, Grosvenor Street. As they increased in popularity, they were relocated to the more spacious Beethoven Rooms in Cavendish Square, then to the Queen's Concert Rooms in Hanover Square, and finally to St. James's Hall in Regents Square. At first these concerts were of instrumental and chamber works and piano arrangements. In 1868, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to include choral works, which allowed pieces such as Liszt's Soldatenlied and choruses from Wagner's Tannhäuser and Lohengrin to be programmed. By 1871, the concerts had been changed to an orchestral format.|$|E
5|$|They {{decided on}} Simon & Garfunkel, {{a group that}} had formed in New York City in the 1960s, and {{had been one of}} the most {{successful}} folk rock groups through the late 60s/early 70s. Simon & Garfunkel had broken up at the height of their popularity and shortly after the release of their fifth studio album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, which is deemed to be their artistic peak and which topped the 1970 Billboard charts for ten weeks. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> apart artistically and did not get along well with each other. In the following eleven years, both continued musical careers as solo artists, and worked together only sporadically on single projects. Garfunkel made brief guest appearances at Simon's concerts, which were always successful.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} First Aliyah in 1881, Jews began immigrating {{to the area}} from Eastern Europe in larger numbers, {{particularly}} from Poland and Russia. These Zionist pioneers were motivated both ideologically and by the Mediterranean climate to reject the Ashkenazi cooking styles <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up with, and adapt by using local produce, especially vegetables such as zucchini, peppers, eggplant, artichoke and chickpeas. The first Hebrew cookbook, written by Erna Meyer, and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO), exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking. The bread, olives, cheese and raw vegetables they adopted {{became the basis for}} the kibbutz breakfast, which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels, and in various forms in most Israeli homes today.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Braves did {{not perform}} at the level <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> {{accustomed}} to.

25|$|In 1797, the Spanish {{governor}} of Puerto Rico, Ramón de Castro, ordered {{the expulsion of}} the Irish from the island.

25|$|Under abbot Pius (1630–74) a {{printing}} press was started. In 1712 during the Toggenburg war, {{also called the}} second war of Villmergen, the Abbey of St. Gall was pillaged by the Swiss. They took most of the books and manuscripts to Zürich and Bern. For security, the abbey was forced to request {{the protection of the}} townspeople of St. Gallen.

25|$|In 1642, {{near the}} end of the Ming Dynasty, Kaifeng was flooded by the Ming army with water from the Yellow River to prevent the peasant rebel Li Zicheng from taking over.

25|$|Austrian Poles {{experienced}} an enormous rise in religiosity {{during the late}} 19th century. From 1875 to 1914, the number of Polish nuns increased sixfold in Galicia; at the same time, German Poland had a less marked increase and in Russian Poland it decreased. Historian William Galush noted that many nuns were from the peasant class, and young women choosing marriage were {{faced with the prospect}} of hard farm work. Polish peasants in Galicia were forced to work harder on smaller size farms than those <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> up on as a result of Poland's rapid population growth.|$|E

They took their mostly black congregations with them. They adopted the Methodist Doctrine and elected their first two bishops, William H. Miles of Kentucky and Richard H.

25|$|Years later, {{the elderly}} Beowulf {{is married to}} Wealtheow. Over the years <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> apart, husband and wife in name alone. Beowulf takes a mistress, Ursula, but his tryst with Grendel's mother has left him sterile. One day, Unferth's slave Cain finds the golden {{drinking}} horn in a swamp near Grendel's cave and brings {{it back to the}} kingdom. That night, a nearby village is destroyed by a dragon, which then transforms into a golden figure, who leaves Unferth alive to deliver a message to his father, King Beowulf: as the dragon is Beowulf's son born to Grendel's mother. Removing the horn has voided the agreement between Beowulf and Grendel's mother, who has now sent their son, the dragon, to destroy his kingdom.|$|E

At {{the same time they}} thought that Nash was dead. On the morning of June 27th they met the Richthofen Staffel near Courtrai, and this time Collishaw found himself engaged with the bright-green Albatros of Allmenröder – though he was not aware at the moment that he was fighting the conqueror of Nash. It was one of the classic dogfights of the war, like Barker against Linke, like Hawker against Richthofen – two skilled and experienced fighters, who knew every trick, had met.|$|E

25|$|A new Latina group, called Soluna, {{had just}} lost a member and {{was looking for a}} replacement. T Lopez quickly auditioned, and was whisked away on tour. T Lopez {{explained}} that touring with Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias was a crazy roller coaster ride for her because everything happened so fast. But she had a great time, T Lopez said. Latina group Soluna released their 2002 debut album, For All Time, under the Dreamworks Records label. Paramount and UPN quickly took interest in the group and developed a TV pilot based on their lives, co-starring Mario Lopez & Tony Plana. After filming the pilot, Soluna reconvened for a second album but realized <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> apart musically. The group said that they wanted it to work so bad that they were forcing it and they finally just gave up and wished each other well in their individual journeys.|$|E
500|$|Lilly's first {{innovation}} was gelatin-coated {{pills and}} capsules. Other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made medicines easier to swallow. Following {{his experience with}} the low-quality medicines used in the Civil War, Lilly committed himself to producing only high-quality prescription drugs, {{in contrast to the}} common and often ineffective patent medicines of the day. One of the first medicines he began to produce was quinine, a drug used to treat malaria, that resulted in a [...] "ten fold" [...] increase in sales. Lilly products gained a reputation for quality and became popular in the city. At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 ($ in 2015 chained dollars), and by 1879 <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> to $48,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars).|$|E

[...] DuBose also stated that the band did not need their faces on the cover because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> significantly in popularity; however, he originally intended to include their faces.
