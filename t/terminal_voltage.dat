25|$|A battery's {{capacity}} {{is the amount}} of electric charge it can deliver at the rated voltage. The more electrode material contained in the cell the greater its capacity. A small cell has less capacity than a larger cell with the same chemistry, although they develop the same open-circuit voltage. Capacity is measured in units such as amp-hour (A·h). The rated capacity of a battery is usually expressed as the product of 20 hours multiplied by the current that a new battery can consistently supply for 20 hours at , while remaining above a specified <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> per cell. For example, a battery rated at 100 A·h can deliver 5 A over a 20-hour period at room temperature. The fraction of the stored charge that a battery can deliver depends on multiple factors, including battery chemistry, {{the rate at which the}} charge is delivered (current), the required <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage,</b> the storage period, ambient temperature and other factors.|$|E

After many upgrades the 14UD is capable of running <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> of up 16.7 MV. Charging is via three inductive charging chains. In 1996 a superconducting RF linac was installed that is used as an energy booster for the 14UD enabling higher energies to be reached.|$|E
25|$|Many simple DC power {{supplies}} regulate the voltage using either series or shunt regulators, but most apply a voltage reference using a shunt regulator {{such as a}} Zener diode, avalanche breakdown diode, or voltage regulator tube. Each of these devices begins conducting at a specified voltage and will conduct as much current as required to hold its <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> to that specified voltage by diverting excess current from a non-ideal power source to ground, often through a relatively low-value resistor to dissipate the excess energy. The power supply is designed to only supply a maximum amount of current that is within the safe operating capability of the shunt regulating device.|$|E

3000|$|... 2) The {{power flow}} {{distribution}} of the SPTD system is analyzed. This helps reveal {{the characteristics of the}} PP on the HWACT line. PP is much more related to <b>terminal</b> <b>voltages</b> than the supplied power. The active PP is linearly related to the square error of amplitudes of the <b>terminal</b> <b>voltages</b> whereas the reactive PP is highly determined by the phase angle difference of the <b>terminal</b> <b>voltages.</b> Little difference of the voltage amplitude and phase angle will lead to a large PP. Thus we can infer that different control methods should be adopted in the HWACT system. In addition, the accuracy and reliability of the control is demanding, and the terminal locations of the HWACT lines need to be selected carefully.|$|R

2500|$|The {{electrical}} {{driving force}} or [...] across the terminals {{of a cell}} {{is known as the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> (difference) and is measured in volts. The <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> of a cell that is neither charging nor discharging is called the open-circuit voltage and equals the emf of the cell. Because of internal resistance, the <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> of a cell that is discharging is smaller in magnitude than the open-circuit voltage and the <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> of a cell that is charging exceeds the open-circuit voltage. An ideal cell has negligible internal resistance, so it would maintain a constant <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> of [...] until exhausted, then dropping to zero. If such a cell maintained 1.5 volts and stored a charge of one coulomb then on complete discharge it would perform 1.5 joules of work. In actual cells, the internal resistance increases under discharge and the open circuit voltage also decreases under discharge. If the voltage and resistance are plotted against time, the resulting graphs typically are a curve; the shape of the curve varies according to the chemistry and internal arrangement employed.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> {{across an}} {{operating}} lamp {{varies depending on}} the arc current, tube diameter, temperature, and fill gas. A fixed part of the voltage drop {{is due to the}} electrodes. [...] A general lighting service [...] T12 lamp operates at 430mA, with 100 volts drop. High output lamps operate at 800 mA, and some types operate up to 1.5A. The power level varies from 33 to 82 watts per meter of tube length (10 to 25 W/ft) for T12 lamps.|$|E
2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage</b> will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its <b>terminal</b> <b>voltage,</b> which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E
40|$|The ac-side <b>terminal</b> <b>voltages</b> of parallel-connected {{converters}} {{are different}} if the line reactive drops {{of the individual}} converters are different. This could result either from differences in per-phase inductances or from differences in the line currents of the converters. In such cases, the modulating signals are different for the converters. Hence, the common-mode (CM) voltages for the converters, injected by conventional space vector pulsewidth modulation (CSVPWM) to increase dc-bus utilization, are different. Consequently, significant low-frequency zero-sequence circulating currents result. This paper proposes a new modulation method for parallel-connected converters with unequal <b>terminal</b> <b>voltages.</b> This method does not cause low-frequency zero-sequence circulating currents and is comparable with CSVPWM in terms of dc-bus utilization and device power loss. Experimental results are presented at a power level of 150 kVA from a circulating-power test setup, where the differences in converter <b>terminal</b> <b>voltages</b> are quite significant...|$|R

In this paper, a synchronous reference frame based analysis is presented to estimate the grid current distortion in interleaved, grid-connected converters with unequal <b>terminal</b> <b>voltages.</b> Influence of carrier interleaving angle on rms grid current ripple is studied theoretically as well as experimentally. Optimum interleaving angle to minimize the rms grid current ripple is investigated for different applications of parallel converters. The applications include unity power factor rectifiers, inverters for renewable energy sources, reactive power compensators, and circulating-power test set-up used for thermal testing of high-power converters. Optimum interleaving angle is shown to be a strong function of the average of the modulation indices of the two converters, irrespective of the application. The findings are verified experimentally on two parallel-connected converters, circulating reactive power of up to 150 kVA between them...|$|R

2500|$|An {{electrical}} ballast is {{a device}} which limits the current through an electrical load.

[...] If such a device were connected to a constant-voltage power supply, it would draw an increasing amount of current until it will be destroyed or caused the power supply to fail. To prevent this, a ballast provides a positive resistance or reactance that limits the current. The ballast provides for the proper operation of the negative-resistance device by limiting current.|$|E
