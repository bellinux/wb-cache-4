However, {{as soon as the}} PT-76 tanks of the 198th Tank Battalion turned up at Bane Houei Sane, the Laotian soldiers and their families panicked and retreated into South Vietnam. After Bane Houei Sane was captured, the 24th Regiment prepared for another attack which targeted the U.S. Special Forces Camp at Lang Vei, manned by Detachment A-101 of the 5th Special Forces Group. On 6 February, the North Vietnamese 24th Regiment, again supported by the 198th Tank Battalion, launched their assault on Lang Vei. Despite fighting with air and artillery support, the U.S.-led forces conceded ground and the North Vietnamese quickly dominated their positions. By the early hours of 7 February the command bunker was the only position still held by allied forces, but they were besieged by North Vietnamese soldiers above ground. During the entire ordeal, U.S. and indigenous Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) forces trapped inside the command bunker had to endure North Vietnamese harassment, which {{came in the form of}} fragmentation and tear gas grenades. To rescue the American survivors inside the Lang Vei Camp, a counter-attack was mounted, but the Laotian soldiers, who formed the bulk of the attack formation, refused to fight the North Vietnamese. Later on, U.S. Special Forces personnel were able to escape from the camp, and were rescued by a U.S. Marine task force.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{dipping tube}} {{hydropneumatic}} tank {{is one of}} the most efficient equipments to prevent water hammer in water distribution and long distance transmission pipe systems. Due to its low costs and easy to maintain features, dipping tube hydropneumatic tank has many irreplaceable advantages, however it is difficult to determine the correct size and gas volume for real world engineering applications. This paper presents a robust method to solve the problems from theory and application. Based on the Method of Characteristics (MOC) equations, this paper derives the equations for modeling dipping tube hydropneumatic tanks in water distribution systems to prevent water hammer. The equations include MOC, differential orifice head loss equation, gas law, air mass, air velocity and etc. The IBM’s scientific subroutine package (SSP) is applied to solve the equations by deriving to the form of X=f(X). The method has been integrated into HAMMER. This paper also presents an example to illustrate the methods of determining the tank size, and the comparison results with sealed hydropneumatic tank and surge <b>tank</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method has}} been developed to model a high speed planing craft in waves with particular emphasis on the non-linearfties associated with high speed motion. These non-linearities include, amongst others, hydrodynamic impact loading, bottom emergence and forces due to large changes in wetted surface area and wetted length. The method consists of a 2 D time simulation model based on a modified stop theory approach. The hydrodynamic coefficients are usually considered to be constant for most linear applications. For planing craft in waves, the draft and wetted lengths are very time dependent and so the equations of motion are solved in the time domain. The benefits of a two-dimensional method include the ability to provide accurate solutions without the need to solve the full 3 D fluid problems. The method is flexible enough to include an added resistance solution and investigation into hydroolastic responses. In order to validate the theoretical model, a high speed planing craft of simple prismatic geometry has been tested and the dynamics analysed {{through the use of}} standard towing <b>tank</b> <b>equipment.</b> However, in order to measure such effects as change in wetted area and length and spray sheet generation, a different technique is required. A new technique in data acquisition is presented whereby the data is acquired using a computer vision system. Computer vision is a technique involving the manipulation of digital pictures and object properties within the image measured and defined. The use of computer vision to analyse video footage of the high speed test provides a non-contact form of measurement; allows the experiment to be carried out repeatedly with emphasis on specified parameters with simultaneous visual observation of particular phenomena allowing cross correlation of the identified fature...|$|E

The objective of this study was to develop a conceptual approach for tank removal along with estimates for select decision criteria in the event that tank removal is selected as the preferred option for closing the 241 -C tank farm. The overall concept developed for <b>tank</b> and ancillary <b>equipment</b> removal involves construction of large temporary buildings or enclosures over the <b>tanks</b> and <b>equipment</b> followed by demolition and excavation of soil, rubble, and debris using heavy commercial equipment modified for remote operation. All rubble, debris, and soil from the excavation would be placed into waste boxes suited to the material type and estimated contamination levels.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of the selected cleaners and sanitizers in killing spore-formers by preventing, treating or reducing the effects of problem spores in the dairy export industry. The chemicals used in this experiment to test against the spore-forming bacteria were Chlorine (Kem-Tek chlorinating liquid), Mandate Plus (Ecolab Clean-in-Place acid sanitizer), HD Acid PL- 10 (Ecolab acid detergent for pipeline and bulk <b>tank</b> <b>equipment),</b> and Principal (Ecolab chlorinated mechanical and CIP cleaner for protein soils). The Bacillus licheniformis concentrated solution was provided by the Dairy Products Technology Center at California Polytechnic State University. Data on the effectiveness of selected cleaners and sanitizers were derived from 1 : 1 concentrations and 10 - 1 solutions that were isolated and put onto the 3 M Petrifilm for observation and records. A series of dilutions were made of the sanitizers and cleaners from 1 : 1 to 1 : 10, 000, but the 1 : 1 and 10 - 1 were selected to test the optimum effectiveness of each chemical. A One-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) was used to analyze the results, and test for differences in the 3 M Petrifilm counts of 1 : 1 Chlorine, 10 - 1 Chlorine, 1 : 1 Mandate Plus, 10 - 1 Mandate Plus, 1 : 1 HD Acid PL- 10, 10 - 1 HD Acid PL- 10, 1 : 1 Principal and 10 - 1 Principal; statistically significance difference was set at P 3 ̆c. 05. There was no statically significant difference between all samples. The effectiveness of Chlorine, Mandate Plus, HD Acid PL- 10 and Principal at 1 : 1 10 - 1 and 10 - 2 was, although significant, inconclusive due to there being to many microorganisms to count. The effectiveness of the four selected chemicals at 10 - 1, with further dilutions of 10 - 1 and 10 - 2, contained positive results with the Bacillus licheniformis, indicating which of the four chemicals was the most effective against a spore-forming bacteria. After an incubation period, the 3 M Petrifilms showed results of chlorine 10 - 1 having no visible growth on either dilutions of 10 - 1 or 10 - 2, denoting that Chlorine (sodium hypochlorite 10. 0...|$|E
40|$|Garra rufa inhabits the biotopes of the rivers, small streams, {{reservoirs}} {{and lakes}} {{and it does}} not belong to the popular ones. Its original occurrence is in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The fish lives at the bottom of streams and rivers, where the adhesive body sticks to the tissue to the bottom and rocks. Due to its low sexual dimorphism, its reproduction in captivity is more complicated. For its more effective reproduction, it is appropriate to prepare the spawning tank and induce suitable conditions (similar to conditions in the natural environment), like for example the rainy season. Garra rufa has currently become very popular, thanks to its use in ichtyotherapy and also that it is performed in so-called "fish pedicure". In some countries, this therapy is prohibited due to insufficient hygiene and poor rearing conditions. I have chosen the topic of my Bachelor thesis to focus and collect scientific evidence of information to improve the opinion of this type of therapy. In the work I cite use of the appropriate technical equipment used in the tanks, which increase the safety and quality of procedures for the fish as well as for people who pass through the general or local therapy with the help of Garra rufa fish. I processed the study also {{from the point of view}} of the risk of treatment when scientific teams tested the water in the tanks for the presence of bacteria, such as Mycobacterium marinum, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. And said possible modes of transmission of infection to the person undergoing the therapy. Not all uses of this fish are the only negative. Some may on the contrary be very useful. For example: Ichtyotherapy, the treatment of persons suffering from Psoriasis, Atopic Dermatitis, or Acne. The results of these therapies are very good and in compliance with the necessary health and safety recommendations are safe This fish is also beneficial in the field of aquarium hobby, especially for removing algae. According to one study, mentioned in my Bachelor thesis, Garra rufa positively affects the treatment of different species of fish incaset of an outbreak of infection in the tank. The work discusses about the current situation in the breeding and safety of the above-mentioned procedures in the Czech Republic. I processed this issue based on Ing. Jaroslav Macenauer experiences.
