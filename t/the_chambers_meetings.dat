50|$|The {{building}} is built in yellow brick with details and basement in light gray granite. It {{is a combination}} of several styles, including inspirations from France and Italy. A characteristic feature of Stortingsbygningen is the way <b>the</b> plenary <b>chamber</b> is located in the semi-circular section {{in the front of the}} building, as opposed to the building's centre.

A collection of ancient arms was hung over the great chimneypiece. In the centre of the floor stood a round table of solid oak. A bad room for confidences this, in which the slightest whisper awoke curious echoes. The King noticed Brand's hesitation, and divined its cause.|$|R
50|$|In November 1837, Anson Jones {{assembled}} Masons {{living near}} Houston in <b>the</b> Senate <b>Chamber</b> of <b>the</b> original Capitol building (the {{site of the}} Rice Hotel and currently the Rice Lofts) and opened Holland Lodge regularly at this location until October 27, 1838.

This convention occurred on December 20, 1837 in <b>the</b> Senate <b>Chamber</b> <b>meeting</b> place, presided over by Sam Houston, and included representatives of Milam No. 40 and McFarland No. 41. The Grand Lodge's first session was opened on April 24, 1838 at which time Texas lodges were renumbered according to the dates of dispensation. Thus was established Holland Lodge No. 1, Milam Lodge No. 2, and McFarland Lodge No. 3.

5000|$|During the 19th-century {{town hall}} {{buildings}} often included [...] "reading rooms" [...] to provide free {{education to the}} public, and it eventually became customary for the town or city council {{to establish and maintain}} a library as part of its service to the community. <b>The</b> grand <b>chamber</b> or <b>meeting</b> place, <b>the</b> [...] "town hall" [...] itself, became a place for receptions, banquets, balls and public entertainment. Town halls, particularly during the 19th century, were often equipped with large pipe organs to facilitate public recitals.|$|R
60|$|Malcolm {{was sure}} that such a {{gathering}} {{could only have been}} summoned by Wallenstein upon some matter of the most vital importance, and he determined at all hazards to learn what was taking place, in order that he might enlighten Oxenstiern as to the real sentiments of the duke. Learning that <b>the</b> principal <b>chamber</b> in <b>the</b> castle had been cleared, and that a meeting of the officers would take place there in the evening, he told Thekla when he went home to his meal at midday that she must not be surprised if he did not return until a late hour. He continued his work until nearly six o'clock, the time at which the meeting was to begin, and then extinguishing his light, he made his way through the passages of the castle until he reached <b>the</b> council <b>chamber,</b> <b>meeting</b> with no interruption from the domestics, who were by this time familiar with his person, and who regarded him as one rising in favour with their master. He waited in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> until he saw an opportunity for entering unobserved, then he stole into the room and secreted himself behind the arras beneath a table standing against the wall, and where, being in shadow, the bulge in the hanging would not attract attention.|$|R
50|$|On June 26, 2006 the 10 {{members of}} <b>the</b> Quality <b>Chamber</b> were officially presented. Antwerp local {{government}} architect Kristaan Borret and ir.

50|$|The Sabha Prakash (Illumination Meeting) {{used to be}} <b>the</b> formal <b>chambers</b> for <b>meetings</b> and {{for holding}} court to {{interact}} with citizens. Many critical decisions for welfare and dispute settlement were delivered from the main hall. The hall itself is decorated exquisitely and is adorned with polished walls strewn with semi-precious pebbles and shingles that are intricately inlaid. The decoration of the Sabha Prakash was deliberately done, keeping in mind the exhaustive exposure {{it would have to}} the public eye. The decoration shifts towards the Shekhavati style. However, most of the decoration is unique to the Kuchaman Fort.|$|R
2500|$|The fierce {{fighting}} between the City of Glasgow Police and protesters began while a Clyde Workers' Committee deputation was in <b>the</b> Glasgow City <b>Chambers</b> <b>meeting</b> with <b>the</b> Lord Provost of Glasgow. On hearing the ensuing riot that {{was taking place}} in George Square, CWC leaders David Kirkwood and Emanuel Shinwell moved outside {{in an effort to}} quell the riot. Before they could reach the crowds outside however, Kirkwood was knocked to the ground by police and he, William Gallacher and Shinwell were arrested and charged with [...] "instigating and inciting large crowds of persons to form part of a riotous mob". Sheriff MacKenzie's attempts to read the Riot Act proved unsuccessful as the crowd tore his copy of the Act from him as he {{was in the process of}} reading it.|$|R
2500|$|The rest of {{the main}} floor of the {{building}} was given to offices and meeting rooms.

[...] At the rear of the building were dining rooms for members and senators and for 'strangers'. [...] On the basement level were service areas and some offices; on the top floor were more offices and the facilities of the parliamentary press gallery.|$|R

Hutch smuggles Campion into <b>the</b> Council <b>Chamber,</b> a <b>meeting</b> place for a local organisation of dignitaries known as the Masters of Bridge, which is built into caves in a hill overlooking the town. Bluffing his way through an investigation of the site, Campion finds an agenda for a meeting which mentions Minute Fifteen, and Anscombe's sudden retirement from the order. Exploring further, he finds a vast cavern filled with hundreds of trucks.|$|R
25|$|Lowestoft Town Hall {{stands on}} the High Street. Various forms of local {{government}} have met or been based on this site since {{the establishment of a}} Town House and Chapel here in 1570. In 1698 a new Town House was built, incorporating a 'corn cross' on the ground floor with <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>chamber</b> and chapel above. This in turn was replaced by the present building, designed by architect J. L. Clemence, in 1857. The building houses the town clock and the curfew bell, which dates from 1644 and is rung each evening at 8pm. The building is a Grade II listed building.|$|R

40|$|A pattern {{recognition}} and track reconstruction procedure {{based on the}} Kalman filter technique has been developed for a straw tube tracking detector for lepton flavor violation experiments (µ → e conversion, µ → e+γ, µ → 3 e). The proposed tracking detector consists {{of a set of}} identical chambers. A simple reconfiguration of <b>the</b> <b>chambers</b> allows <b>meeting</b> requirements for all three experiments. The {{pattern recognition}} proceeds in two stages. At the first stage only hit straw tube center coordinates, without drift time information, are used to reduce the background to a manageable level. At the second stage the drift time information is incorporated and a deterministic annealing filter is applied to reach the final level of background suppression. The final track momentum reconstruction is provided by a combinatorial collapse filter which is effective in hit-to-track assignment. The momentum resolution of the tracker in measuring monochromatic leptons is found to be σp = 0. 17 and 0. 26 MeV for the µ → e conversion and µ + → e + + γ processes, respectively. The tracker reconstruction resolution for the total scalar lepton momentum is σp = 0. 33 MeV for the µ → 3 e process. ...|$|R
