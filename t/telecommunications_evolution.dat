40|$|Abstract. The <b>telecommunications</b> <b>evolution</b> in {{the next}} ten years or so will be steered more and more by what is {{happening}} “outside of the network”. Since its birth, innovation in the network provided the “clock ” for the evolution of services and the communications as perceived by the users. This is already changing and it will change even more in the coming years. Stretching it a bit, in twenty years time, we may be communicating without a communications network, at least what we are used to call “network ” today. This paper aims at presenting a number of technology evolutions suggesting the type of impact they may have on our business, as operators, and on our way to communicate as human beings. Some of the technology evolutions will lead to a sharp change in the “market”: these are called disruptions and a number of them will be addressed {{in the second part of}} the paper. No claim is being made that what is forecasted will, actually, come to pass; however it may be as much important to foresee what “might be ” as would be to “know ” what it will be. Indeed assuming one knows what “will be ” one would have nothing to say or do about it. Understanding what “might be ” generates action and eventually may contribute to make it happen or to hamper its happening. In the last part some considerations will be given to the challenges facing developed and developing countries. Evolution in technology and market provides plenty of opportunities …and threats. Out of these evolutions we can imagine changes in the service offering and impacts on many “ambients”. Country wide policies and enterprise strategies are often taking different paths. Five main challenges will be outlined to better emphasize the different perspectives of these constituencies 2...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the new site development process for a <b>telecommunications</b> carrier. <b>Evolutions</b> in cellular technologies {{have led to}} an exponential increase in the need for network resources. This has translated into rising development costs for the industry, mainly due to the increasing negotiating power of landlords and to stricter regulations by government bodies. The existing new site development process {{was found to be}} missing return on investment (ROI) analysis and validation of the value provided by locations for new sites such as towers, rooftops and monopoles acquired by the real estate department. This paper proposes an updated process, to be adopted by the implementation team that would address these deficiencies and would guarantee that every installation carried out by the team would provide positive value for the organization...|$|R

It is suggested that there are five major forces that together drive the evolution of this industry: specialisation, competition, financial markets. endogenous consumer demand and permeable industry boundaries. An important research task is to further elaborate on the boundaries of not only the industry but of the industrial system taken as a whole. product life cycle, industrial <b>evolution,</b> <b>telecommunications,</b> specialist suppliers, industry boundaries, appreciative theorising, J.

40|$|Software defined {{networking}} {{allows the}} separation of the control plane and data plane in networking. It provides scalability, programmability, and centralized control. It will use these traits to reach ubiquitous connectivity. Like all concepts software defined networking does not offer these advantages without a cost. By utilizing a centralized controller, a single point of failure is created. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed controller failover. This failover will provide a mechanism for recovery when controllers are not located in the same location. This failover mechanism is based on number of hops from orphan nodes to the controller in addition to the link connection. This mechanism was simulated in Long Term <b>Evolution</b> <b>telecommunications</b> architecture...|$|R
40|$|Fully-integrated {{multi-mode}} multi-band (MMMB) reconfigurable {{power amplifier}} (PA) is implemented using single PA-cores for high-and low-frequency bands, respectively. This PA has five output paths and covers quad-band Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying/Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution and penta-band Universal Mobile <b>Telecommunications</b> System/Long Term <b>Evolution</b> mode operation with band combination {{in a small}} form-factor. To optimize the PA, the proposed structure reconfigures the PA-core cells {{as well as the}} interstage/output matching network. When compared with the single-mode single-band dedicated PAs, the fabricated PA showed comparable RF performance for all modes and bands, except for PAE degradations of 3. 1 % and 1. 9 % for high-and low-band, respectively, thus validating the usefulness of the proposed structure for MMMB PA applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{this is an}} era of drastic <b>evolution</b> <b>Tele{{communication}}s,</b> packet {{data communication}} has gained paramount attention due to increased internet multimedia usage. One of the challenges faced by telecom companies is to provide robust and powerful network components that are capable to handle the tremendous load of traffic and data on it. Companies evaluate their products performance before releasing them to the market by applying {{a large amount of}} generated traffic in order to measure their capability under traffic load; powerful solutions are hence needed for generating traffic and modeling various telecom protocols. The performance is also need to be evaluated for other scenarios that exists in the real network. The scenarios include capacity tests, busy hour call loads, rainy day scenarios, and different types of handoffs. Hence there is a requirement of a simulator tool which evaluates the product’s performance. Packet Load Generator (PLG) is a tool developed to evaluate Network Controller...|$|R
40|$|High-speed train (HST) is revitalizing {{the train}} as a {{preferred}} mid-range transportation system. The provision of broadband Internet connectivity onboard trains {{is one of}} the key challenges in the competition among train operators. Unprecedented spectral efficiency and data rates (up to 100 Mbps in high mobility) of the Universal Mobile <b>Telecommunications</b> System long-term <b>evolution</b> (LTE) are expected to offer the solution for high-speed Internet access onboard in HSTs. Massive wireless access and frequent handovers (HOs) of a large number of users might potentially cause service interruptions, and this, in turn, degrades intolerably the quality of experience (QoE) of users' onboard Internet access. In this paper, we propose a solution based on distributed antenna system that combines directional and omni-directional antennas as train-to-ground radio-access terminals (T-RATs) and LTE femtocells in each carriage. Directional antennas are deployed at both ends of the HST to provide multi-cell access by diversifying the HOs over multiple LTE cells. This mechanism virtually elongates the train size by connecting the front and rear carriages' T-RATs to the faraway eNodeBs and augmenting the number of cells the HST can be simultaneously connected to. An ad hoc distributed load-balancing mechanism that consists in offloading backlogged packets to the on-service T-RATs is mandatorily paired with multi-cell access scheme to tie up with the request of seamless onboard Internet service at high QoE level...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} way of handling spectrum for cellular wireless wide area networks and metropolitan area networks arose about 90 years ago based on the capabilities of radio transceivers and the regulatory requirements. Spectrum divided in chunks of certain bandwidth is exclusively licensed to operators by public auctions [4] {{for a decade or}} more duration. Furthermore, one radio access technology is assigned to the spectrum bands, e. g., global system for mobile communications, universal mobile <b>telecommunications</b> standard, long-term <b>evolution</b> (advanced), or high-speed packet access. Economists have long argued that market mechanisms should be applied to radio spectrum [20]. This trend to more flexible and market-oriented use of spectrum is supported by novel developments in radio technology, e. g., multiple antenna systems, multi-carrier techniques, and multi-user decoding. Following the development from intra-operator spectrum sharing to orthogonal interoperator spectrum sharing, the most promising yet most complex way of sharing spectrum is non-orthogonal inter-operator spectrum sharing in which several transmitters are active on the same frequency band and on the same time. On the physical layer, this leads to the classical interference channel model. Depending on the radio access technology and the transceiver structure, this type of sharing leads to a conflict situation between the transmitters (potentially belonging to different wireless network operators) because of interference on the same resource [10]...|$|R
40|$|The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{represents}} the current position {{in about a}} hundred years of evolutionary growth of the worldwide <b>telecommunications</b> infrastructure. This <b>evolution</b> {{is by no means}} complete and the next few years will see the emergence of a "Broad-band" ISDN as the next stage of evolutionary development. It is important to appreciate the evolutionary nature of the telecommunications infrastructure if one is to properly understand much of the thinking that lies behind the current ISDN proposals. This book therefore begins with a number of chapters devoted to a study of the various developments which have eventually led to the concept of an integrated digital network. These include the development of digital transmission of speech using PCM and the development of digital switching techniques based on stored program control. The book then turns to a consideration of those features of the existing telecommunications network which need to be modified in order to make ISDN a realizable practicality. Of particular importance is the digitization of transmission over the links between the user and the local exchange. Next we look at the current practice and proposals for ISDN based on the technology presently in use in the telephone network. Finally, we look at the proposals for a broadband ISDN likely to become widely available {{by the turn of the}} century...|$|R
40|$|The {{revolution}} of Internet and its popularity among millions of users {{has resulted in}} {{significant increase in the}} data traffic carried by today's <b>telecommunications</b> networks. The <b>evolution</b> of optical networks, along with its ingenious technologies like Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), has {{played a critical role in}} coping with that huge data traffic. However, the unusual growth in the number of users has been paralleled by a similar growth in the size of the networks. The latter has complicated the task of network management and mandated the need to segregate huge networks into several administrative units, each controlled by a unique organization, known as Autonomous Systems (ASes). For routers in different ASes to communicate with each other, reachability information should be available at each router for it to know the optimal path to reach its targeted router. The latter task is handled in IP-based electronic networks by the de facto inter-domain routing protocol known as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). In order to achieve efficient inter-domain routing in optical networks, we better benefit from the experience gained from the extensive deployment of BGP in electronic IP-based networks. In this thesis, we study the problem of achieving inter-domain routing in optical networks using BGP. We incorporate some modifications in standard BGP and introduce a new version of it, called the eXtended BGP for Optical Networks (xBON), which can be deployed in optical networks. We build a model for xBON and simulate it using OPNET Modeler platform. Finally, simulation results are presented and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The use and {{management}} of Geospatial Information (GI) is very broad and applicable in cases such as: management and administration {{of natural resources and}} the environment; disaster prevention; land use; planning of infrastructure (transport, roads, basic sanitation, buildings, etc.); citizen security; cadastre; etc. All this type of information that is delivered is vital importance to aid in decision making both for public administrations as well as in other sectors (private company, non-governmental sector and international agencies, academia etc.), in order to promote the sustainable development of a region and the improvement of their social and economic welfare. This vision along with the development of <b>telecommunications</b> and the <b>evolution</b> of the Web, has been a specific jump Geographic Information Technologies (TIGs). The use of the Internet multiplies the possibilities to share, distribute, exchange and access to the data. In many countries, increasingly the decision-making is served of the use of geographical information and the tools provided to manage, given a great impetus to the public administration in regard to the planning {{and management}} of their territories. A wide variety of tools and services on the Web we offer the possibility to adapt and adopt these technologies as tools GIS (Geographic Information Systems) that allow inter alia geolocalizar or georeference our territories as instruments for the proper management of the same. At present, a large number of public and private institutions are striving to offer IG through the service of geoportals whose motivation should be what the community demand, its efforts to rejuvenate the geographic information portals of a new concept based on the “real needs of its end-users”. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{high-power}} {{radio frequency}} (RF) devices {{have become increasingly}} common due in part, to the high-speed <b>telecommunications</b> industry. The <b>evolution</b> of mobile devices drives {{to the use of}} wireless applications which will require different work frequencies and therefore the implementation of new and miniaturized devices. Moreover, passive intermodulation requirements at high-power levels, power handling of transmitting filters, thermal stability behaviour of duplexers, interference blockers, etc. are some examples of the increasing interest in characterizing passive devices such when they are driven by high power signals. Nowadays, there exist devices that use the above-mentioned power requirements. For example, a radar protection circuit of jamming signals incorporating frequency-selective auto-limiting devices must keep the low-signal performance while dealing with high power signals. The high-power components used in these applications must be characterized for both linear and nonlinear operation. Therefore, complex calibration procedures must be done and the calibration standard must be able to handle the power without changing their parameters or alternatively, using previously characterized power standards. Feed-forward techniques have been shown very useful to measure passive intermodulation (PIM) without using narrowband filters. The objective in PIM measurements is cancelling the high-power tone before going into the spectrum analyzer. Since no filters are required, there are no restrictions between the separation of tones and the system is not-specific to a given narrowband bandwidth. This master thesis is focused {{in the study of the}} interference problem in high-power transmitted signals and out-of-band transmissions through the design of different feed-forward cancellation algorithms with the aim of measure and characterize high-power components as well as study the nonlinear behaviour caused by thermal effects of Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) resonators due to the use of high-power signals...|$|R
40|$|VoIP {{technology}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important as they gain market share in PSTN technology. In the short run, {{it is likely that}} VoIP technology will dominate the <b>telecommunications</b> market. This <b>evolution</b> towards VoIP technology makes sense for improving the VoIP technology efficiency {{under the auspices of the}} internet. However, the PSTN still provide voice quality better than the VoIP technology voice quality. This would be due to many contributing factors such as delay and packet loss. Apart from internet hardware infrastructure, the VoIP transfer protocols cause the delay and packet loss problems as well. Typically, the Real-time Media Transfer Protocols (RTMTPs), such as the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), are working in conjunction with the transport layer protocols (TLPs) to carry the VoIPapplications data. However, some of the TLPs protocols are transfer the VoIP applications data by themselves. The aim of this paper is to present the capability of the TLPs protocols to transfer the VoIP applications data, and the obstacles face these protocols to do so. For easier comparison and discussion, we have divided TLPs protocols into three groups, the Reliable Transport Layer Protocols (RTLPs), Unreliable Transport Layer Protocols (UTLPs), and Reliable and Unreliable Transport Layer Protocols (RUTLPs). We have studied the three groups from VoIP point of view. In addition, we have showed that the UTLPs group needs to work with the RTMTPs to be able to transfer the VoIP applications data. Finally, we have showed the problems caused by each group to the VoIP applications. As result, a comparison among the transport layer protocols is presented according to the problems resulting from theses protocols when transferring the VoIP applications data. The comparison can help to choose the suitable protocols to carry the VoIP data. However, after studied all the TLPs protocols, the paper recommend to use the UTLPs group in conjunction with the RTMTPs, in order to transfer the VoIP applications data...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{economic}} and political transition dominated Thailand’s economy since the 1990 s; with the great change from economic and trade victory to widespread financial slump, the political crossroads in 1992 and the reform of political democracy, Thailand drew up a preliminary version of a new constitution and pledged significant political and economic improvement. In the context of the reconstitution of the Thai telecommunications policy from the beginning of 1990 to the end of 2001, this study presents the progress of restructuring Thai telecommunications industry and examines key forces determining the policy-making process of its Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). In order to investigate the role of manifold policy factors {{and the role of the}} Thai State in ICT policy formulation, the study applies political model of policy process and is based on the conceptual framework of J. P. Singh (1999) ’s factors in determining the nature of the telecommunications restructuring in developing country and the State’s role in the decision-making process. While the primary impelling force for restructuring was Thailand’s ambition to become the economic centre of Southeast Asia, a vast number of secondary forces are discovered to have been involved in the restructuring of <b>telecommunications</b> industry and <b>evolution</b> of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) policy. Economic cooperation and a global liberalisation programme enforced by the WTO and the IMF have had an explicit effect on Thailand’s policymaking. Internally, in the collocation of the advanced development of parliamentary democracy and intensifying money politics, business interests became steadily stronger in ICT policymaking through the more direct political manipulation of the situation to gain some advantage at the top levels. There was also a growing impact from public interest groups and the Senate. The diversity of interests in the policy process limited the power of the State to direct policy decisions. In a system in which policy-making was plagued by political infighting among groups seeking to control the social system and the activities from which they derived private benefit, the policy-making function of the State was seriously impaired and the progress of Thai telecommunications reform and its ICT policy underwent a major crisis in consequence. The thesis seeks to answer: how the ICTs policymaking developed during the telecommunications industry reform, and the interplays among the policy forces; and what role the State played in the policy-making process. It argues that the Thai State’s weakness to create a regulatory regime to implement the ICTs policy of telecommunication liberalisation represents essentially a problem of institutional change. The thesis demonstrates that the State role in policymaking was phenomenon, and even facilitated particular group’s interest and idea, and that it was ill-suited implementation for society at large.
