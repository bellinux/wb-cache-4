5|$|Cicadas use {{a variety}} of {{strategies}} <b>to</b> <b>evade</b> predators. Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed. Many are extremely well camouflaged <b>to</b> <b>evade</b> predators such as birds that hunt by sight. As well as being coloured like tree bark, they are disruptively patterned to break up their outlines; their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. The wings are antireflective, avoiding the typical shine of insect cuticle, which would break the cicada's camouflage. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.|$|E

FRELIMO militants were able <b>to</b> <b>evade</b> pursuit and surveillance by employing classic guerrilla tactics: ambushing patrols, sabotaging communication and railroad lines, and making hit-and-run attacks against colonial outposts before rapidly fading into accessible backwater areas. The insurgents were typically armed with rifles and machine pistols, and the attackers took full advantage of the monsoon season in order <b>to</b> <b>evade</b> pursuit.|$|E

Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them <b>to</b> <b>evade</b> potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E

Mutations in the different genes that regulate actin production in humans can cause muscular diseases, variations in the size and function of the heart as well as deafness. The make-up of the cytoskeleton is also related to the pathogenicity of intracellular bacteria and viruses, particularly in the processes related <b>to</b> <b>evading</b> the actions of the immune system.|$|R
