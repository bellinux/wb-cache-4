However, the policy choice to provide a <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> often results in adverse consequences, including the violation of other legal rules. For this reason, the policy choice to offer a <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> (‘tax amnesty policy’) is often controversial. The <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> policy and resulting program offered by the Government of Indonesia has been criticized both because it {{is considered to be}} unfair and because it favors the perpetrators of tax evasion. In particular, the <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> law offered special treatment to taxpayers who participated in the program, such as no checking of the source of funds, no checking of the financial statements reported by law enforcers, protection from punishment on the financial reports provided to the Director General of Taxation, and the requirement to pay only a small penalty. <b>Tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> programs also provide the potential for money laundering. This is certainly the case in Indonesia. In addition, <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> programs weaken law enforcement in Indonesia; in particular, in the areas of corruption and money laundering. This is because law enforcement officers cannot investigate the perpetrators of white-collar crime that benefit from the <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> program.

40|$|The tax {{compliance}} literature on <b>tax</b> <b>amnesties</b> does not explicitly consider the underlying motivational influences on taxpayers’ self-correction decisions.

The existence of these events certainly contain an {{information that can be}} interpreted by investors to conduct transactions on the capital market. The <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> policy of Indonesia is assumed to have information content capable of responding to capital market actors. The reaction of capital market actors can be measured by the abnormal return and increased trading volume of activity. So it is necessary to do research on the reaction of the capital market to the <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> policy of Indonesia on LQ 45 stock index. The population in this study were 45 companies included in LQ 45 during the study period taken by purposive sampling technique.

In the third period of <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> policy shows that there is a difference in average abnormal return is positive but trading volume activity does not show significant difference at the time before and after the announcement period III <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty.</b> The results explained that the <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> information was not responded by investors in the first period of <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> policy.

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>amnesties</b> are {{government}} programs that typically allow {{a short period}} of time for tax evaders to voluntarily repay previously evaded taxes without being subject to penalties and prosecution that discovery of such tax evasion normally brings. <b>Tax</b> <b>amnesties</b> differ widely in terms of coverage, tax types, and incentives offered. A state’s Voluntary Disclosure Programme is another avenue available to taxpayers to assist them in resolving their state tax delinquencies. This programme is an on-going programme as compared to a <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty,</b> which is there for a limited time period only. The main goal of the research was to describe the <b>tax</b> <b>amnesty</b> and the voluntary disclosure programmes in South Africa and to assess their advantages and disadvantages. This thesis also discussed another form of voluntary disclosure programme, referred to as an Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Programme, which allows taxpayers with unreported foreign bank accounts, and presumably unreported foreign income, to voluntarily disclose their affairs. The study found that, due to <b>tax</b> <b>amnesties,</b> Government raises more tax revenue not only in the short run from collecting overdue taxes but also by bringing former non-filers back into the tax system for the long run. It was also found that, initially short-run revenue brought in from overdue taxes will be positive for the first amnesty and then decline each time the amnesty is offered repeatedly. The reason for the decline in revenue might be that <b>tax</b> <b>amnesties</b> provide incentives for otherwise honest taxpayers to start evading taxes because they will anticipate the offering of future <b>amnesties,</b> thereby weakening <b>tax</b> compliance. The costs associated with amnesty programmes include negative long run revenue impact and also that amnesty programmes reduce compliance by taxpayers in the long-run.

The legal norm must be clear so that in the future there will be no overlap cases with other national legal norms as well as with international legal norms. 2.)
