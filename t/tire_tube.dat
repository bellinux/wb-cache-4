One of the wastes generated in engineering and transportation sector is scrap tire and it poses serious environmental problem, worst when it is burnt. This Paper presents study the effect of waste rubber materials on shear strength of residual soils. Series of laboratory direct shear tests were carried out on soil reinforced with randomly distributed rubber strips. The soil was collected from the university premises and rubber strips were obtained from scraped tire tubes. 20 mm × 5 mm <b>tire</b> <b>tube</b> strip sizes were used as the reinforcement of the residual soil and 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, 2. 0 %, 2. 5 %, 3. 0 % increments were used until reached to the optimum rubber percentage. According to the tests results, the soil type was identified as CVG according to the BS 5930 1990 and the optimum rubber content is 2. 0 % for the maximum shear strength...|$|E
40|$|Recent experiments([1]) {{revealed}} {{many new}} phenomena of the macroscopic domain {{patterns in the}} stress-induced phase transformation of a superelastic polycrystalline NiTi tube during tensile loading. The new phenomena include deformation instability {{with the formation of}} a helical domain, domain topology transition from helix to cylinder, domain-front branching and loading-path dependence of domain patterns. In this paper, we model the polycrystal as an elastic continuum with nonconvex strain energy([2]) and adopt the non-local strain gradient energy to account for the energy of the diffusive domain front. We simulate the equilibrium domain patterns and their evolution in tire tubes under tensile loading by a non-local Finite Element Method (FEM). It is revealed that the observed loading-path dependence and topology transition of domain patterns are due to the thermodynamic metastability of <b>tire</b> <b>tube</b> system. The computation also shows that the tube-wall thickness has a significant effect on the domain patterns: with fixed material properties and interfacial energy density, a large tube-wall thickness leads to a long and slim helical domain and a severe branching of the cylindrical-domain front...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this mechanical design project was to improve the current design of large and heavy solar concentrators. The three main design goals were: making the system compact, making the system lightweight, and minimizing expenses. The main approach to achieving these design parameters was to use the plastic film Mylar in its aluminized form to create a paraboloid serving as a solar concentrator. The scope of design was limited to designing and prototyping the solar concentrator, and neglecting to design and prototype the container in which it should be kept while in its compact form. Two designs-the tube design and the rim design-are examined, although the rim design is emphasized because of its advantages over the tube design. The tube design included a bicycle <b>tire</b> <b>tube</b> serving as the structural element of the solar concentrator, while the rim design utilized a bandsaw blade (without teeth) as the structural element of the solar concentrator. The prototype of the rim design proved to work well as a mirror, although further work, such as improving the seal around the rim, must still be done due to the time frame and resources allowed for this project. by Gabriel J González.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that an {{ablation}} cloud drifts to the lower field side in tokamak plasmas, which leads to a good performance on fueling in tokamak. Such a good performance, however, has not been obtained yet in the planar axis heliotron; Large Helical Device (LHD) experiments, even if a pellet has been injected from the high field side. The purpose of the study is to clarify the difference on the cloud motion between tokamak and LHD plasmas by using the MHD simulation including ablation processes. It is found in tokamaks that the drift motion is induced by a <b>tire</b> <b>tube</b> force and 1 /R force in the major radius direction, and that the pressure and density of the plasmoid have oscillation due to fast compressional Alfven wave. The first trial simulations on the motion of the plasmoid in a straight helical and LHD plasmas also show that the plasmoid drifts to the lower field side similarly to tokamaks. However, an plasmoid drifts inward or outward of the flux surfaces depending on the location along the magnetic field lines, since the plasmoid expands along the magnetic field with time, the magnetic field strength and the direction of the magnetic curvature change along the magnetic field lines due to both toroidicity and helicity of the helical coils, and the rotational transform is greater than that in tokamaks in the plasma periphery. Thus, it is suggested that the difference of the pellet injections between the high field and the low field sides is reduced in helical plasmas. ...|$|E
