5|$|In early 1891, Berlin society {{erupted in}} scandal {{after a series}} of {{anonymous}} letters circulated to prominent members of the court, including Wilhelm and his wife Dona.

Wilhelm ordered an investigation, but <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> (or writers) were never identified. Some contemporaries speculated that Charlotte, known for her sharp tongue and love of gossip, may have been responsible. Historians have since suggested that <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> may have been Dona's brother Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein in collaboration with his mistress.
