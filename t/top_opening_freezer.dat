50|$|You {{can also}} convert a <b>top</b> <b>opening</b> chest <b>freezer</b> into a beer {{dispenser}} {{with the use}} of a thermostat control unit. This setup is known as a keezer. The advantage of a keezer is that you are assured it will get cold enough to dispense beer at the proper temperature range (32-38 degrees Fahrenheit) and it usually has more interior floor space than a refrigerator, allowing it to store and dispense more kegs. The disadvantage is that it requires the thermostat to be overridden to ensure you don't freeze your kegs and you have to lift the heavy kegs up and over the freezer wall. You can accomplish this conversion with a tower kegerator conversion kit or build an extension on top of the freezer to mount the door and taps onto.|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} {{phase of a}} test site in Indonesia {{computational}} fluid dynamics {{has been used to}} design the construction of the plastic greenhouse. Greenhouses in Indonesia are built to protect the crop from heavy rain and insects. The climate in four different greenhouse designs is calculated without insect gauze and with two types of insect gauze in the openings. Two designs consist of greenhouses with a <b>top</b> <b>opening</b> at one side of the ridge, with different dimensions of the <b>top</b> <b>opening.</b> The third design has no <b>top</b> <b>opening,</b> and the fourth design is the conventional Indonesian design consisting of three spans with an opening {{on one side of the}} ridges. The walls of the greenhouses are open or covered by insect gaze. The ground area in the greenhouse is equal for all designs. The ventilation rate and the maximum temperature in the greenhouse have been used to evaluate the designs. The influence of the wind speed and direction has been investigated. The design without an <b>opening</b> in the <b>top</b> has the highest ventilation rate and the lowest maximum temperature in case of wind due to aerodynamics. In case of no wind the climate in the design without top ventilation is slightly worse than in the other designs. Increasing the length of the greenhouse reduces the ventilation for this design. The insect gauze reduces the ventilation by more than 50 %. Based on these results a new design has been developed with an aerodynamic <b>top</b> <b>opening.</b> This design proved to function with and without wind. This design is currently being tested in Indonesia...|$|R
