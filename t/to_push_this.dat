25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play {{is coming from the}} corner {{to the front of the}} net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready <b>to</b> <b>push.</b> <b>This</b> works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} photography, Brodovitch had a {{distinct}} {{feel for what}} the magazine needed. He favored on-location fashion photography {{as opposed to the}} studio shots normally used in other fashion publications. He urged his photographers to look for jarring juxtapositions in their images. One such spread features a woman in a full-length Dior gown posed between two circus elephants. The cinematic effect, a trademark characteristic of his layouts, involved using photographs as if they were stills from a film. He would repeat a pose or a dress several times across a spread to give a narrative, temporal feeling. At times, Brodovitch would arbitrarily take a series of photographs and adopt a story line to go with them, as though recapping a movie. He was known <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>this</b> idea even further by adding film sprocket borders to photographs at times. Brodovitch also often emphasized spatial illusions, using type and photographs to create multiple perspectives within a space. The notion of mirroring and doubling also interested him, {{as can be seen in}} how he paired similar pictures on a spread or dividing halves of one image across the gutter of the page.|$|E
500|$|Part II, [...] "Administration", however, {{was more}} contentious. Haig was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} an entirely new system, where the manual would cover the whole organisation of a field army, including base and lines-of-communication troops as well as field units. This was strongly opposed by the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General staff, who {{felt that it was}} unnecessary, and resented such an imposition on their 'territory' by what they saw as an outsider. However, with Haldane's support, Haig was able <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>this</b> through and ensure its adoption.|$|E

West had brought a majority of his usual production crew onto the project, the same crew that had assisted in the creation of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. One of the main exceptions was producer No I.D., who felt that the two artists weren't pushing forward enough with the music. In an interview with Complex, No I.D. commented about the project that [...] "you're going to sell, because you're already big. But you guys are important <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>this</b> forward. Push intelligence and decadence and all of the above forward in a creative manner." [...] While his advice was acknowledged to a degree, he ultimately had very little part in the finished project. In January 2011, they regrouped and rented a block of rooms at the Mercer Hotel in New York City and invited a select group of producers and recording artists. Chauncey [...] "Hit-Boy" [...] Hollis, who produced the track [...] "Niggas in Paris", said of recording at the hotel, [...] "There was music going on in every room. I had a room where I was cranking out beats, and then I'd go into the main room with Jay and [...] and play beats for them. Kanye is really hands-on. I would come in with a beat and he'd be like, 'Take this out, slow it down.' It would make it sound 100 times better. Jay would then mumble different flows to the beat".|$|E
2500|$|Meeting for Sufferings was {{originally}} established {{to assess the}} persecution of Friends and attempt to obtain redress. Morning Meeting, a now-obsolete body of London Quakers, agreed in October 1675 to commission certain local Friends to meet {{four times a year}} for this purpose. Their efforts were mainly directed towards the suffering of imprisoned Quakers, but they also lobbied Parliament to reduce the burden of tithes and oaths. (The refusal of Friends to take oaths, based on Jesus Christ's words [...] "Swear not at all" [...] (Matthew 5:33 [...] 37), caused great difficulties with the government and courts.)

2500|$|The {{original}} {{plan for the}} operation, codenamed Gibraltar, was prepared {{as early as the}} 1950s; however it seemed appropriate <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>this</b> plan forward given the scenario. Backed by then foreign minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and others, the aim was an [...] "attack by infiltration" [...] by a specially trained irregular force of some 40,000 men, highly motivated and well armed. It was reasoned that the conflict could be confined only to Kashmir. In the words of retired Pakistani General Akhtar Hussain Malik, the aims were [...] "to defreeze the Kashmir problem, weaken Indian resolve, and bring India to the conference table without provoking general war." [...] As a result, groundwork and intelligence gathering for execution of the plan was laid by launching [...] "Operation Nusrat", the purpose of which was to locate gaps in the Cease Fire Line (CFL) that were to serve as entry points for the mujahideen, and to gauge the response of the Indian army and the local population.|$|E

I like that every chair should be a throne, and hold a king. I prefer a tendency to stateliness, to an excess of fellowship. Let the incommunicable objects of nature and the metaphysical isolation of man teach us independence. Let us not be too much acquainted. I would have a man enter his house through a hall filled with heroic and sacred sculptures, that he might not want the hint of tranquillity and self-poise.[423] We should meet each morning, as from foreign countries, and spending the day together, should depart at night, as into foreign countries. In all things I would have the island of a man inviolate. Let us sit apart as the gods, talking from peak to peak all round Olympus. No degree of affection need invade this religion. This is myrrh and rosemary to keep the other sweet. Lovers should guard their strangeness. If they forgive too much, all slides into confusion and meanness. It is easy <b>to</b> <b>push</b> <b>this</b> deference to a Chinese etiquette;[424] but coolness and absence of heat and haste indicate fine qualities. A gentleman makes no noise: a lady is serene Proportionate is our disgust at those invaders who fill a studious house with blast and running, to secure some paltry convenience. Not less I dislike a low sympathy of each with his neighbors's needs. Must we have a good understanding with one another's palates? as foolish people who have lived long together, know when each wants salt or sugar. I pray my companion, if he wishes for bread, to ask me for bread, and if he wishes for sassafras or arsenic, to ask me for them, and not to hold out his plate, as if I knew already. Every natural function can be dignified by deliberation and privacy. Let us leave hurry to slaves. The compliments and ceremonies of our breeding should recall,[425] however remotely, the grandeur of our destiny.|$|E
