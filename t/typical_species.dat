5|$|In the reserve, this climatic {{transition}} {{leads to}} increased biodiversity. For example, common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) is a <b>typical</b> <b>species</b> of the Atlantic areas, while the common butterbur (Petasites hybridus) is more continental.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the <b>typical</b> <b>species</b> in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5|$|The reserve {{was created}} to protect fifteen plants of {{regional}} interest and three plant communities listed in the Habitats Directive. Its flora are linked to calcium present in marl. It {{is located in a}} transition zone between the oceanic and semi-continental climates and that gives increased biodiversity, with <b>typical</b> <b>species</b> of the atlantic areas and others more continental. The reserve also plays a role in a wildlife corridor.|$|E
40|$|Many <b>species</b> {{that are}} <b>typical</b> of calcareous, {{semi-natural}} grasslands (“typical grassland species”) are declining in Europe {{as a result}} of habitat-loss and -fragmentation. Whereas populations of these species are expected to be largest in old semi-natural grasslands, these species may also occur in successional grasslands on previously arable fields. We used a space-for-time approach to analyse changes in the frequencies of <b>typical</b> grassland <b>species,</b> and changes in soil properties, over a 280 -year arable-to-grassland succession within a Swedish landscape. Our study revealed that a number of <b>typical</b> grassland <b>species</b> had higher frequencies in mid-successional (50 – 279 years) than in old (≥ 280 years) grasslands. Mid-successional grasslands also contained many of the <b>typical</b> grassland <b>species</b> that were present in old grasslands, but at lower frequencies, and had soil conditions similar to those of old grasslands. Early-successional (5 – 14 and 15 – 49 years) grasslands contained few <b>typical</b> grassland <b>species.</b> In highly fragmented landscapes, mid-successional grasslands provide additional habitat for many <b>typical</b> grassland <b>species,</b> and can function as temporary refugia (“substitute habitat”) for these species until old grasslands are “restored”. The overall population sizes of some <b>typical</b> grassland <b>species</b> and red-listed species are likely to be substantially increased by the presence of mid-successional grasslands within the landscape. Our study suggests that, rather than focussing solely on old grassland fragments, conservation strategies for <b>typical</b> grassland <b>species</b> should adopt a dynamic, landscape-based perspective that recognizes the role of successional grasslands. Ensuring a continuous development of mid-successional grasslands is expected to be beneficial for populations of many <b>typical</b> grassland <b>species...</b>|$|R

A <b>typical</b> Rhipicephalus <b>species</b> is Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the tropical dog tick, specialized to feed only on dogs. It is distributed globally throughout the warm countries, wherever humans with their dogs live. <b>Typical</b> Rhipicephalus <b>species</b> that feed on cattle in Africa are R. appendiculatus, the brown ear-tick, and R. evertsi evertsi, the red-legged tick. Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus {{is the most important}} tick of cattle in many tropical and subtropical countries to where it spread from Southeast Asia on transported cattle.|$|R
5|$|Maple {{and lime}} forests {{are found in}} gulleys. These forests are only present in {{isolated}} areas and {{are at risk of}} extinction. Downy oak woods are more common in the Aosta Valley area than in the Piedmont area because of its higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Oak is not a <b>typical</b> <b>species</b> in the park and it is often found mixed with Scots pine. The park's chestnut groves have been affected by human cultivation for wood and fruit. It rarely grows above 1,000 metres (3,280ft), and the most important chestnut forests are in the park's Piedmontese side. The park's conifer woods include Scots pine groves, spruce forests dominated by the Norway spruce, often mixed with larch. Larch and Swiss stone pine woods are found up to the highest sub-alpine level (2200–2300 metres (7,217-7,546ft)).|$|E
25|$|<b>Typical</b> <b>species</b> of the Trinity Alps region include Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, red fir, white fir, black oak, canyon live oak, Pacific madrone, bigleaf maple, California Buckeye, incense cedar, and Jeffrey pine.

25|$|Through evolution, species arise {{through the}} process of speciation—where new {{varieties}} of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche—and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition. The relationship between animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established. A <b>typical</b> <b>species</b> becomes extinct within 10 million years of its first appearance, although some species, called living fossils, survive with virtually no morphological change for hundreds of millions of years.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the loss}} of habitat, more and more species of fauna have started to venture into human {{habitation}} causing a conflict between humans and fauna. A <b>typical</b> <b>species</b> affected by this is the elephant which ventures out of the forest into human cultivations thereby eating or destroying the crops. In some cases, the elephants have also caused human deaths like an incident that happened in Hassan district where a villager was trampled to death. Precautionary measures (sometimes illegally) taken up by humans to prevent such mishaps like electric fencing have also led to disastrous consequences like electrocution of fauna.|$|E
25|$|Bagnall was a noted field bryologist. As {{mentioned}} above, one of {{his earliest}} publications, in 1874, was a moss Flora of Warwickshire. His most widely distributed work is his Handbook of Mosses, a contribution to The Young Collector Series published in London by Swan Sonnenschein, etc. The handbook was published and reprinted in at least six editions between 1886 and 1910, and is now available online. It describes how to study mosses, including the apparatus needed and the preparation and storage of specimens; their development, habitats (including descriptions of <b>typical</b> <b>species)</b> and geographical distribution; and their classification. It also includes chapters on cultivation and use.|$|E

The upper Salmon River Reservoir contains both largemouth and smallmouth bass, in addition to some walleye, brown trout, brook trout and rainbow trout; black crappie, yellow perch and bluegill are also present in the reservoir.

25|$|Within Iraq, Annandale {{collected}} his specimens from a sandy lake-bed deposit, in {{the vicinity}} of Nasiriyah on the Euphrates. Eames and Wilkins found the species in borings made in the Hammar Marshes, and Plaziat and Younis found it in other localities of the Hammar Formation; they described it as a <b>typical</b> <b>species</b> of this formation. The deposits in Iraq where the species has been found are in brackish habitat (although Annandale believed the deposits to be freshwater, this was due to reworking), toward the outer edge of tidal influence in the Euphrates and Tigris. Much of the species' former habitat, as evidenced by subfossil remains, is now less brackish than it was when the fossils were deposited, meaning it is less likely to be extant in such places.|$|E
