5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired <b>turn</b> <b>direction,</b> {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the <b>turn</b> <b>direction.</b> The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effect of walkway length and <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> on the {{distance}} covered in the 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT) in healthy adults aged ≥ 50 years. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based rehabilitation centre. Participants: Twenty-five healthy adults aged ≥ 50 years. Outcome measures: Distance covered in the 6 MWT (6 MWD) was recorded in metres. Number of turns during the test using walkways of various lengths (10, 20 and 30 m) and different <b>turning</b> <b>directions</b> (<b>turning</b> towards dorminant and non-dorminant side), rate of perceived exertion and heart rate were recorded before and after the test. Results: The 6 MWD and the number of turns differed significantly with walkway length (P < 0. 05). The greatest 6 MWD and the lowest number of turns were recorded in the 30 -m walkway. Significant increases in heart rate and rate of perceived exertion (P < 0. 05) were found between the pre-test and post-test for all testing conditions. No significant difference was found between the two <b>turning</b> <b>directions</b> for any distance covered. Conclusion: The length of the walkway had a significant effect on the 6 MWD, but the <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> did not. This suggests that subjects can <b>turn</b> in either <b>direction</b> without significantly affecting the results when using a standard walkway in the 6 MWT.

40|$|Seven {{mouldboard}} ploughing {{experiments were}} conducted to systematically investigate the effect of different tillage directions on soil redistribution on hillslopes. The present study included tillage directions other than parallel to the gradient or along the contour, that is, in our experiments the slope gradient changed simultaneously in tillage and in <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> Using physical tracers we developed {{a model of the}} two-dimensional tracer displacement as a function of topography and tillage variables. The displacements in tillage and in <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> were separately described as 2 nd degree polynomials in both tillage and in <b>turning</b> <b>directions.</b> This model fully accounted for the directionality of tillage. Displacement in <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> additionally depended on tillage depth, while that in tillage direction was affected by tillage speed and soil bulk density. We found a large effect of tillage directionality on soil redistribution, and tillage at 45 to the gradient turning soil upslope was the least erosive tillage direction. We obtained non-linear relationships between soil redistribution and profile curvature, instead of the linear relationships reported previously. Consequently tillage erosivity varied in tillage direction and a unique tillage transport coefficient could not be obtained for all tillage directions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Objectives To examine (1) {{the effect}} of {{different}} walkway distances, and (2) <b>turning</b> <b>directions</b> on the six-minute walk test (6 MWT) in subjects with stroke. Design A cross-sectional study. Setting University-based rehabilitation center. Participants Subjects (N= 26) with chronic stroke. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Total distance covered and number of turns in the 6 MWT with different walkway lengths (10 -, 20 -, and 30 -m walkway distances) and <b>turning</b> <b>directions</b> (<b>turning</b> to affected side and unaffected side); rate of perceived exertion (RPE) using Borg Scale, and heart rate (HR) using handheld pulse oximeter recorded before and immediately after the test. Results The distance covered {{and the number of}} turns in the 6 MWT were significantly different between different walkway lengths (P<. 05), with the longest distance covered and lowest number of turns in the 30 -m walkway distance. For all walkway lengths, turning to the affected or unaffected side did not result in significant differences in the distance covered and the number of turns in the 6 MWT. Significant increases were found between the pretest and posttest for the HR and RPE (P<. 05) in all testing conditions. There was no significant effect of walkway distance and <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> on the change in HR and RPE between the 6 conditions of the 6 MWT. Conclusions Different walkway distances {{have a significant effect on}} the distance covered in the 6 MWT, whereas <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> did not significantly affect the distance covered in the 6 MWT.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} chair seat height and <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> on the Timed Up and Go scores of patients after stroke. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. Setting: A geriatric day hospital in Hong Kong. SUBJECTS: Twenty-five patients with sub-acute stroke. METHODS: The time taken to complete the Timed Up and Go test with various chair seat heights (65 %, 90 % and 115 % of each subject’s leg length – distance from lateral knee joint line to ground in sitting) and <b>turning</b> <b>directions</b> (toward the affected and unaffected side) was recorded using a stopwatch with randomized test order. RESULTS: There were significant differences in Timed Up and Go scores between the 3 levels of chair seat height (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), with the lowest Timed Up and Go scores recorded when the seat height was 115 % of the subject’s leg length and the highest at a seat height of 65 % of the subject’s leg length. Turning toward the affected side {{was found to be}} significantly quicker than turning toward the unaffected side (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Chair seat height and <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> significantly influence the Timed Up and Go scores of patients after sub-acute stroke. Optimizing chair seat height with reference to subject’s leg length and <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> is essential when using the Timed Up and Go test as an outcome measure in stroke rehabilitation.

40|$|Turning bias is the {{tendency}} to turn towards a given direction. Conflicting results from previous studies suggest {{that a number of}} factors may influence <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if biomechanical asymmetries influence turning bias. A total of 100 able-bodied participants, and 30 trans-tibial amputees who, by definition, possess a functional asymmetry, volunteered to participate in the study. The right hand and right foot were significantly dominant for the able-bodied sample. Able-bodied participants showed a significant turning preference towards the left, which was opposite to the dominant hand and foot. The amputees were significantly right-hand dominant and the side of the amputation influenced foot dominance. The amputee sample showed no preferred <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> <b>Turning</b> bias indices in the amputee sample were not significantly associated with handedness, footedness, side of amputation, or dominance prior to amputation. The lack of a preferred <b>direction</b> of <b>turn</b> in the amputee sample suggests that biomechanical asymmetries can influence turning bias...|$|R

Foremost, {{we are interested in}} the influence that language has on the conceptualization of <b>turn</b> <b>directions.</b> Two experiments are presented that contrast the way people group turns into similarity classes when they expect to verbally label the turns, as compared to when they do not. We are particularly interested in the role that major axes such as the perpendicular left and right axis play—are they boundaries of sectors or central prototypes, or do they have two functions: boundary and prototype? Our results support a) findings that linguistic and nonlinguistic categorization differ and b) that prototypes in linguistic tasks serve additionally as boundaries in nonlinguistic tasks, i. e. they fulfill a double function. We conclude by discussing implications for cognitive models of learning environmental layouts and for route-instruction systems in different modalities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} EEG-based Brain-computer interface (BCI) {{that uses}} error related brain activity to im-prove {{the prediction of}} driver’s intended <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> In experiments while subjects drive in a realistic car simulator, we show a directional cue before reaching intersection, and analyze error related EEG potential to infer if the presented direction coincides with the driver’s intention. In this protocol, the directional cue provides an initial estimation of the driving direction (based on EEG, environmental or previous driving habits), and {{we focus on the}} recognition of error-potentials it may elicit. Experiments with 7 healthy human subjects yield an average classification 0. 69 ± 0. 16, which confirms the feasibility of decoding these signals to help estimating driver’s <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> This study can be further exploited by intelligent cars to tune their driving assistant systems to improve their performance and enhance the driving experience.

40|$|Determining {{where another}} person is {{attending}} {{is an important}} skill for social interaction that relies on various visual cues, including the <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> {{of the head and}} body. This study reports a novel high-level visual aftereffect that addresses the important question of how these sources of information are combined in gauging social attention. We show that adapting to images of heads turned 25 ° to the right or left produces a perceptual bias in judging the <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> of subsequently presented bodies. In contrast, little to no change in the judgment of head orientation occurs after adapting to extremely oriented bodies. The unidirectional nature of the aftereffect suggests that cues from the human body signaling social attention are combined in a hierarchical fashion and is consistent with evidence from single-cell recording studies in nonhuman primates showing that information about head orientation can override information about body posture when both are visible...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, robot {{navigation}} {{using the}} Particle Filter based FastSLAM approach for obstacle avoidance {{derived from a}} modified Velocity Potential Field method was investigated. A switching controller was developed to deal with robot’s efficient <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> when close to obstacles. The determination of the efficient <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> {{is based on the}} local map robot derived from its on board local sensing. The estimation of local map and robot path was implemented using the FastSLAM approach. A particle filter was utilized to obtain estimated robot path and obstacles (local map). When robot sensed only obstacles, the estimated robot positions was regarding to obstacles based the measurement of the distance between the robot and obstacles. When the robot detected the goal, estimation of robot path will switch to estimation with regard to the goal in order to obtain better estimated robot positions. Both simulation and experimental results illustrated that estimation with regard to the goal performs better than estimation regarding only to obstacles, because when robot travelled close to the goal, the residual error between estimated robot path and the ideal robot path becomes monotonously decreasing. When robot reached the goal, the estimated robot position and the ideal robot position converge. We investigated our proposed approach in two typical robot navigation scenarios. Simulations were accomplished using MATLAB, and experiments were conducted with the help of both MATLAB and LabVIEW. In simulations and experiments, the robot successfully chose efficiently <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> to avoid obstacles and finally reached the goal...|$|R
