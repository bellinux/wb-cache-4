25|$|Faced {{with the}} lack of {{reliable}} basic flight instrument readings, constant contradictory warnings from the aircraft's flight computer (some of which were valid and some of which were not) and believing that they were at a safe altitude, 58-year-old Captain Eric Schreiber Ladrón de Guevara, a veteran pilot who had logged almost 22,000 flight hours, and 42-year-old First Officer David Fernández Revoredo, who had logged almost 8,000 flight hours, decided to begin descent for the approach to the airport. Since the flight was at night over water, no visual references could be made to convey to the pilots their <b>true</b> <b>altitude</b> or aid their descent. As a consequence of the pilots' inability to precisely monitor the aircraft's airspeed or vertical speed, they experienced multiple stalls, resulting in rapid loss of altitude with no corresponding change on the altimeter. While the altimeter indicated an altitude of approximately 9,700 feet, the aircraft's <b>true</b> <b>altitude</b> was in fact much lower.|$|E
25|$|The {{air traffic}} {{controller}} had instructed a Boeing 707 to take off and help guide the 757 back in to land, but before the 707 could take off, the 757's left wingtip struck the water, approximately 25 minutes after the emergency declaration, revealing to the crew the <b>true</b> <b>altitude</b> of the airliner; the pilots struggled with the controls and managed to get airborne again for 17 seconds, but the aircraft crashed inverted into the water. All 70 passengers and crew died. The official accident report concluded that the flight crew, distracted by the conflicting warnings, did not heed the radar altimeter reading after descending through 2,500 feet.|$|E
500|$|On 5 February 1952, a Spitfire 19 of 81 Squadron {{based at}} Kai Tak in Hong Kong reached {{probably}} the highest altitude ever achieved by a Spitfire. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant Edward Ted Cyril Powles, {{was on a}} routine flight to survey outside-air temperature and report on other meteorological conditions at various altitudes {{in preparation for a}} proposed new air service through the area. He climbed to [...] indicated altitude, with a <b>true</b> <b>altitude</b> of [...] The cabin pressure fell below a safe level and, in trying to reduce altitude, he entered an uncontrollable dive which shook the aircraft violently. He eventually regained control somewhere below [...] and landed safely with no discernible damage to his aircraft. Evaluation of the recorded flight data suggested that, in the dive, he achieved a speed of , (Mach0.96), which would have been the highest speed ever reached by a propeller-driven aircraft, but it has been speculated this figure resulted from inherent instrument errors.|$|E

40|$|The remote map‑making {{technique}} and results of field investigations made {{possible for the}} first time to reveal a great number of rock glaciers within the area of the Suntar‑Khayata Range (North‑East Asia). A total of 540  formations were identified. Among them, 47 rock glaciers were classified as corrie (cirque) tongue‑shaped formations and 493 ones – as niche lobe‑shaped (single‑ and multi‑lobe) rock glaciers. Occurrence of such formations is 8. 4 / 100 km 2, that is the largest in the North‑East Asia. The rock glaciers in this region are found within a range of <b>true</b> <b>altitudes</b> from 1297 up to 2402 m asl. The majority of active features, however, are confined to the interval between 1500 and 1900 m asl. Rock glaciers occur in the altitudinal range of 1297 to  2402 m asl. The majority of active features, however, are confined to the interval between 1500 and 1900 m asl, and the main part of active formations is located within the range of 1500 ‑ 2500 m. The frequency analysis of <b>true</b> <b>altitudes</b> of the rock‑glacier occurrence indicates that their formation can be caused by the hypsometry of the region relation to morphoclimatic zonality. </p...|$|R

50|$|Both the {{civilian}} SSR {{and the military}} IFF have become much more complex than their war-time ancestors, but remain compatible with each other, not least to allow military aircraft to operate in civil airspace. Today's SSR can provide much more detailed information, for example, the aircraft altitude, as well as enabling the direct exchange of data between aircraft for collision avoidance. Most SSR systems rely on Mode C transponders, which report the aircraft pressure altitude. The pressure altitude is independent from the pilot's altimeter setting, thus preventing false altitude transmissions if altimeter is adjusted incorrectly. Air traffic control systems recalculate reported pressure <b>altitudes</b> to <b>true</b> <b>altitudes</b> {{based on their own}} pressure references, if necessary.|$|R
25|$|The pilots {{liked the}} Fw 190 {{very much as}} far as handling, {{performance}} and armament was concerned. Compared with the Bf 109 series of the time, the Fw 190 was superior, but this did not hold <b>true</b> at <b>altitudes</b> above 8,000 metres (25,000 feet). Especially against bombers the Fw 190 was by far superior because of its heavy armament, its lower vulnerability, and its better protection for the pilot. All these features were favourable for bomber and schlachtflieger operations.|$|R

50|$|The radio {{altimeter}} gave a true {{reading of the}} airplane's altitude {{when it was over}} the sea. Over land, the {{radio altimeter}} only gave the altitude over the land below. Without knowing the elevation of the land, it wasn't possible to know the <b>true</b> <b>altitude.</b> The pressure altimeter gave the same readings over land or sea, but it could not distinguish between a change in air pressure caused by a change in altitude and a change in air pressure caused by a change in barometric pressure. Therefore, the pressure altimeter was only accurate to a range of altitudes. By using both altimeters together over the ocean, it was possible to determine the <b>true</b> <b>altitude,</b> the true air pressure at that altitude and the pressure at other altitudes at that point.|$|E

5000|$|The {{flight crew}} {{may have been}} {{confused}} about their <b>true</b> <b>altitude,</b> due to misinterpretation of the aircraft's drum-type altimeter after descending through 0 feet (relative to the airport altitude), or {{they may have had}} their hands full controlling the plane in severe weather and simply failed to notice the readings on the altimeter.|$|E
50|$|During 1956 the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) {{worked on}} {{equipment}} testing to provide single Mk-15 and Mk-21 capabilities for the B-52.

The group also began testing the TX-28 with the swept-wing F-84F “Thunderstreak.” Aircraft modifications included pylon and weapon loading and compatibility, proper functioning of the units, clearances, and complete electrical checks of the special weapons control. Flights determined aerodynamic loads, vibration, stability and control affects in straight and level, flight dive and LABS maneuvers. A new technological innovation in the early 1950s, LABS was a component of the flight control system; it controlled an aircraft automatically during low-altitude bombing. These testmaneuvers were made at various <b>true</b> airspeeds, <b>altitudes,</b> and release and dive angles.|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{has been}} developed for using the reflection of solar radiation in the oxygen A-band to determine cloud-top altitude. Because of multiple scattering and molecular absorption inside the cloud, the reflection of clouds is substantially modified in comparison with a mirror cloud, which is assumed to have a 100 percent reflection. To infer <b>true</b> cloud-top <b>altitude,</b> therefore, {{it is necessary to}} accurately estimate the amount of 'photon penetration'. Theoretical calculations indicate that the amount of photon penetration depends on the altitude, the scaled volume scattering coefficient, and the scaled optical thickness of the cloud. Algorithms using the reflection in the oxygen A-band to determine the cloud-top pressure have been applied to an aircraft field experiment in conjunction with CCOPE, 1981. Results of this study are very encouraging, especially for extended clouds...|$|R
50|$|The flight {{envelope}} is {{a plot of}} various curves representing {{the limits of the}} aircraft's <b>true</b> airspeed and <b>altitude.</b> Generally, the top-left boundary of the envelope is the curve representing stall speed, which increases as altitude increases. The top-right boundary of the envelope is the curve representing critical Mach number in true airspeed terms, which decreases as altitude increases. These curves typically intersect at some altitude. This intersection is the coffin corner, or more formally the Q corner.|$|R
50|$|On {{the horizon}} {{refraction}} is slightly {{greater than the}} apparent diameter of the Sun, so when {{the bottom of the}} sun's disc appears to touch the horizon, the sun's <b>true</b> <b>altitude</b> is negative. If the atmosphere suddenly vanished at this moment, one couldn't see the sun, as it would be entirely below the horizon. By convention, sunrise and sunset refer to times at which the Sun’s upper limb appears on or disappears from the horizon and the standard value for the Sun’s <b>true</b> <b>altitude</b> is &minus;50&prime;: &minus;34&prime; for the refraction and &minus;16&prime; for the Sun’s semi-diameter. The altitude of a celestial body is normally given for the center of the body’s disc. In the case of the Moon, additional corrections are needed for the Moon’s horizontal parallax and its apparent semi-diameter; both vary with the Earth-Moon distance.|$|E
5000|$|Landing of the {{aircraft}} in the attitude indicated under the then existing conditions of water surface and weather, was due to Cramer's having misjudged his <b>true</b> <b>altitude</b> and his failure to correct his attitude for a normal landing. # At {{the time of the}} accident Captain Cramer was not wearing glasses as required by his pilot certificate.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{approximation}} is {{to consider}} that a mountain's apparent altitude at your eye (in degrees) will exceed its <b>true</b> <b>altitude</b> by its distance in kilometers divided by 1500.

40|$|The {{effects were}} studied of visual display {{dynamics}} on pilot tracking {{performance in a}} simulator.

Vertical position of these aircraft {{with respect to the}} horizon indicated the altitude of the subject's aircraft, which was disturbed by atmospheric turbulence. Various bandwidths of second-order dynamics were interposed between the <b>true</b> aircraft <b>altitude</b> and the displayed altitude, whereas no dynamics were interposed in the attitude display.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a technique for the estima-tion of the translational and rotational velocities of a miniature helicopter using the video signals {{from a single}} onboard camera. For every two consecutive frames from the camera, point correspondences are identified and Epipolar Geometry based algorithms are used to find the likely estimates of the absolute rotations and relative displacements. Images from onboard camera are often corrupted with various types of noises; SIFT descriptors {{were found to be}} the best feature descriptors to be used for point correspondences. To speed up the processing, we introduce a new representation of these descriptors based on compressive sensing formalisms. To estimate the absolute displacement of the helicopter between frames, we use the measurements from a simulated IR sensor to find the <b>true</b> change in <b>altitude</b> of the body frame, scaling other translational dimensions accordingly, and later estimating the velocities. Experiments conducted using data from a real helicopter in an indoor environment demonstrate promising results. I...|$|R
