5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, {{there should not be}} a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E

25|$|Some events held {{as part of}} the {{national}} championships did not have Olympic qualifying status (due to those events not being contested at the Olympics), while some Olympic qualifying events were held separately from the Trials proper and did not in all cases have national championship status.

25|$|This {{was similar}} to tests {{previously}} used in Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania. It enabled immigration officials to exclude individuals on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> without explicitly saying so. After 1903 the passage chosen was not important in itself as it was already decided the person could not enter Australia and so failure was inevitable. Although the test could theoretically be given to any person arriving in Australia, in practice it was given selectively on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> and others considered undesirables. Between 1902 and 1909, only 59 people passed the test out of 1,359 who were given it. After 1903 passes were largely due to early immigration officers not understanding their role in this fraud or being unable to choose a language other than English. No-one passed the dictation test after 1909.|$|E

25|$|The next {{significant}} steps towards resolution {{were the}} Repeal of the Population Registration Act, {{the repeal of}} the Group Areas and the Native Land Acts and a catch-all Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act was passed.
