25|$|When Bianca is {{jailed for}} attacking Connor Stanley (Arinze Kene) in 2011, Ricky struggles {{to support his}} children, so he accepts a job in Dubai where he is arrested for indecency after being caught {{swimming}} naked in the sea. He is fined and deported, leaving him with no money upon his return to Walford. From prison, Bianca blames her family's money problems on Ricky, and Ricky seeks comfort from Mandy who has returned to Walford. After reliving their youth and taking drugs, Ricky and Mandy have sex again. Later, Mandy confesses that their one-night stand in 1994 left her pregnant, but their baby daughter, Kira, died shortly after birth. Ricky immediately regrets having sex with Mandy and decides not to tell Bianca upon her release from prison; however, Bianca discovers the truth on New Year's Day 2012, the same night the Butchers are left distraught by Pat's death from cancer. Following Pat's funeral, Bianca realises she cannot forgive Ricky's latest infidelity; she ends their marriage, forcing Ricky to leave Walford. He returns in June for Janine's wedding to Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), along with Tiffany, Morgan and Diane. Janine goes into premature labour and Ricky sits with his newborn niece, Scarlett Moon, as she fights for survival. Later, he argues with Morgan's biological father, Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), about their parenting methods, but <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> truce. He becomes Scarlett's godfather at her baptism before leaving with the children again.|$|E

The Nayanar first clashes with his own Dalit brethren. They oppose his devotion for the Lord of Chidambaram, whom <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> Brahmin god. The Dalit elders— headed by Pariyakilavan— define his duties as a pariah and advise him to not confront caste rules. They tell him to worship the folk deities of the pariah, instead of Shiva, the god of Brahmanical Hinduism.

In May 2011 the WMF and the Turkish Ministry of Culture {{launched}} what <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> conservation project focusing on the cathedral and the nearby Church of the Redeemer. The project is funded by the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation of the U.S. State Department. Before the project a steel structure was installed around the cathedral, said to prevent its cracked sandstone walls from collapsing. The WMF and its Turkish partner, the NGO Anadolu Kültür, say they will work on [...] "stabilization and protection" [...] of the cathedral. Turkey's Minister of Culture Ertuğrul Günay stated [...] "We hope that giving new life to the remains of once-splendid buildings, such as the Ani Cathedral and church, will bring new economic opportunities to the region." [...] Armenian officials responded with skepticism. According to Gagik Gyurjyan, president of ICOMOS-Armenia, the Turkish Ministry of Culture rejected the preliminary agreement between Anadolu Kültür and the Armenian side to engage Armenian experts in restoration works. Osman Kavala, president of Anadolu Kültür, stated {{that the lack of}} formal bilateral relations between Armenia and Turkey may have prevented Armenian experts from being included in the project. Kavala stated in a 2011 interview that an estimated $1 million would be spent on the project, which was scheduled to start in 2012 and end in 4 years. Yavuz Özkaya, an architect who participated in the projects carried out in Ani, stated in March 2014 that studies on preservation and restoration of the cathedral were completed and they had begun to be implemented. These works included clearing the roofs, installing a temporary structure at the separation point between the western and southern walls, strengthening, proper completion of roof tiles and taking preventative measures.|$|E
