5|$|The United States National Weather Service {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Guam as Tropical Storm Saomai approached the island on August 6. Military bases in northern Guam entered Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 1, meaning <b>that</b> <b>winds</b> of 50 knots or higher were expected within 12hours. The rest of the island was placed under Condition of Readiness 2, meaning that such winds were possible within 24hours. Several bases were temporarily closed.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, {{the storm}} weakened rapidly {{as it began}} to move west-northwest. Later that morning, MFR downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. By April 15, MFR downgraded the system into a tropical depression. That very day, the JTWC reported <b>that</b> <b>winds</b> of Helisaonia had fallen below hurricane-force. During the morning hours of April 17, the JTWC downgraded Helisaonina into a depression. Shortly thereafter, MFR stopped monitoring the system. After re-curving just east of Madagascar, Helisanonina dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18. While the storm was weakening, it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{strongly}} influenced many early civilizations. Greeks {{believed that they}} were battles waged by Zeus, who hurled lightning bolts forged by Hephaestus. Some American Indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the Thunderbird, who they believed was a servant of the Great Spirit. The Norse considered thunderstorms to occur when Thor went to fight Jötnar, with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer Mjölnir. Hinduism recognizes Indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms. Christian doctrine accepted the ideas of Aristotle's original work, called Meteorologica, <b>that</b> <b>winds</b> were caused by exhalations from the Earth and that fierce storms were the work of God. These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century.|$|E

It is rather the other way around, {{as suggested by the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>wind</b> doesn’t need windmills to exist, while windmills need wind to rotate. Wind can be observed in places where there are no windmills or non-rotating windmills—and there are good reasons to believe <b>that</b> <b>wind</b> existed before the invention of windmills.|$|R

5|$|Traveling {{towards the}} northeast, Conson headed towards Okinawa where schools {{were closed and}} local {{transportation}} was disrupted due to the storm. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned residents about the threat of heavy rains and high winds resulting from the storm. A United States naval base located in Okinawa was placed under a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCR) Four as Typhoon Conson was approaching. As the storm neared the islands, the naval base was put under TCCR Three, indicating <b>that</b> <b>winds</b> of 92km/h (57mph) were anticipated within 48hours. Ahead of the storm, upwards of 254mm (10in) fell across the islands, which were indirectly related to the storm. In southern Japan, several airlines canceled flights due to poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|While {{crossing}} eastern Cuba, {{the circulation}} of Arlene became ill-defined, although re-strengthening over water was considered possible. When it reached open waters, Arlene was already a depression, and there was considered little likelihood of redevelopment, with strong shear pushing the convection far east of the center. Nevertheless, a NOAA reconnaissance mission found <b>that</b> <b>winds</b> briefly increased to 60mph (95km/h), or tropical storm strength, located over the southeastern Bahamas in a large convective band extending of the center. When the thunderstorms dissipated, the winds again dropped, and Arlene returned to tropical depression status. Early on May9, the depression was absorbed by an advancing trough. Late the next day, the combined systems reorganized and resembled having some subtropical characteristics, although it weakened further by May11.|$|E
5|$|Elsa {{plans to}} give Anna a {{surprise}} birthday party {{with the help}} of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf; but while Anna is led on a party treasure hunt by a string <b>that</b> <b>winds</b> through the kingdom, Elsa has caught a cold, and unknowingly produces a group of small living snowmen with each sneeze, who begin to dismantle the birthday party's decorations while Kristoff tries to stop them. While Elsa takes Anna on the hunt, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf try to control the snowmen and fix the decorations in time for Anna and Elsa's return. After Elsa nearly falls off a clock tower, Anna convinces her to take rest. While Anna enjoys the party, Elsa sneezes a giant snowball through an alphorn, inadvertently stunning Hans overseas; whereupon Elsa rests in bed under Anna's care. Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven escort the small snowmen to Elsa's ice palace, where they stay with her snow-giant doorkeeper Marshmallow.|$|E

5|$|Late on June21, Celia turned due west as {{it moved}} around {{the south side of}} the ridge {{previously}} steering the hurricane to the west-southwest. A secondary eyewall was noted as it made the turn, indicating that the storm would further intensify once this feature further developed. Several hours later, the storm intensified into a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After briefly developing a prominent central dense overcast, the storm's structure began to degrade for unknown reasons. By the evening of June22, Celia was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane and the eye was no longer apparent on satellite imagery, mainly due to cirrus clouds over the system. The following morning, the eye reformed and the storm became more vertically aligned, allowing Celia to re-attain Category2 status. Throughout the day, Celia became increasingly organized and intensified, nearly attaining major hurricane status during the afternoon. Operationally, the hurricane was thought to have reached this intensity but post-storm analysis indicated <b>that</b> <b>winds</b> did not exceed 110mph (175km/h).|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{brought a}} storm surge of 10–12 ft (3–3.5 m) to Tampa Bay. The highest rainfall total in Tampa was at 8.53 in (23.5 mm). However, the observer noted <b>that</b> <b>winds</b> probably blew {{water out of}} the gauge. The barometric pressure fell to , breaking a previous record set in 1910. The hurricane also brought sustained winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) and a storm tide of 10.5 ft (3 m). Damage from the wind was generally minor, while most of the impact wrought by the storm was due to abnormally high tides in Tampa and elsewhere in the area. Much of the city was flooded, with the worst along Bayshore Boulevard, where some of the most expensive properties were located. At Hyde Park, dwellings were inundated about halfway up the first story, prompting several people to be rescued by boat. Electrical poles and wires were washed away near the intersection of Bayshore Boulevard and Howard Avenue. The latter was also left impassible by car. In the Palmetto Beach neighborhood, much of the section was inundated. A group of about 40 volunteers rescued a number of women and children. A total of 50 homes were destroyed by cedar logs used to construct cigar boxes at the Tampa Box Company on 22nd Street.|$|E
5|$|Very minimal impact {{occurred}} {{as a result}} from Hurricane Alberto. Dakar, Senegal, received 25mm (1in) of rain as the pre-Alberto tropical wave passed over the city. A discussion was issued on August 9 advising residents in Bermuda to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm until it safely passed. Also, from August 12 to August 14, public advisories were issued advising people from Azores to monitor the progress of Hurricane Alberto. This stopped when Alberto began to slow its motion and began to turn to the south, away from the Azores. Some swells were reported along the east coast of the United States {{a few days after the}} storm's recurvature. No reports were available on the impact of Alberto on Iceland, but it was estimated <b>that</b> <b>winds</b> of at least tropical storm force were experienced there. Otherwise, there were no known reports of damage or casualties as a result of Hurricane Alberto.|$|E
