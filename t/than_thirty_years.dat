Expeditions {{during the following}} two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making {{the exact number of}} individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E

One of his early aims was to force an opening for the Dutch to trade in China — something which had eluded them since they arrived in East Asia in the early 17th century. To further this goal, he took the Chinese trade negotiator Zheng Zhilong hostage and refused to release him until he agreed to give the Dutch trading privileges.

5|$|George's {{marriage}} to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, {{not on the}} grounds that either of them had committed adultery, but {{on the grounds that}} Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her husband. With the agreement of her father, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in Ahlden House in her native Celle, where she stayed until she died more <b>than</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> later. She was denied access to her children and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard.

Melusine von der Schulenburg acted as George's hostess openly from 1698 until his death, and they had three daughters together, born in 1692, 1693 and 1701, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, {{only five}} years after its passage, the Act was repealed. Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants {{following}} the execution of King Charles I of England and {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion. Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more <b>than</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>years,</b> until 1692.|$|E
5|$|In Ratner's view, {{the most}} {{important}} of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment. The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions. The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards. The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more <b>than</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> earlier. It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment. Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance. The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.|$|E

40|$|Background: Unicompartmental and {{patellofemoral}} joint replacements {{are proven}} solutions for arthritis {{limited to one}} compartment of the knee. Bicompartmental replacement has been considered lately as an alternative for combined medial and patellofemoral arthritis. The main idea behind these resurfacing solutions is tissue preservation with conservation of bone stock and both cruciate ligaments. Tricompartmental replacement with selective resurfacing of all three compartments with different modular implants is exceptional. Methods: The authors present a case with more <b>than</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>year</b> follow-up both clinically and radiographically. Results: Excellent function and patient satisfaction are observed at 30. year follow-up. Radiographs show no osteolysis or loosening of components. Conclusions: Conservation of both anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments seems to protect against polyethylene wear at long-term follow-up. Level of evidence: IV. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the prevalent effect of organochlorines insecticide residues on randomized population sample from El-Hosh Town community, South Gezira. 36 human urine samples such as 12 from male, 12 from female and 12 from children were collected from randomized population samples. Residues of organochlorine pesticides were extracted by hexane and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The results revealed that, only DDE was detected. DDE was detected in four out of 12 (33 %) female and 3 out of 12 (25 %) male urines in concentrations ranging between 4. 64 – 5. 31 ppm. No detectable residues of DDE were found in children. DDE concentrations in females (5. 17 ppm) were higher than those in male urines (4. 18 ppm). The results indicated that the DDE residues level were not associated with age or weight. Although the use of most of these compounds has been severely restricted more <b>than</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>year</b> ago, the presence of their residues indicate their characteristic of long term persistence...|$|R
