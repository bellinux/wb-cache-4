25|$|On 23 February 1960 the Ministry of Public Works and Transport <b>transferred</b> <b>Air</b> France's {{domestic}} monopoly to Air Inter.

25|$|While many Luftwaffe units {{returned}} to Germany to replace losses, Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleets 2 and 3) sent {{small numbers of}} bombers against British sea communications, attacking ships and laying mines. In July, the Luftwaffe <b>transferred</b> <b>air</b> units to the European coast from Hamburg to Brest in Brittany on the French Atlantic coast. By 17 July, the two air fleets had reached their intended strength for operations against southern England and the Midlands, with 1,200 medium bombers, 280 dive-bombers, 760 single-engine fighters, 220 twin-engine fighters, 50 long-range reconnaissance aircraft (90 of the medium bombers could fly bomber-reconnaissance sorties against shipping and ports) and 90 short-range reconnaissance aircraft. Luftflotte 5 in Norway, with 130 medium bombers, 30 twin-engine fighters and 30 long-range reconnaissance aircraft, exerted an indirect effect on the Kanalkampf, by making the RAF keep fighters in the north.|$|E

25|$|Most {{contemporary}} diving {{regulators are}} single-hose two-stage regulators. They {{consist of a}} first-stage regulator, and a second-stage demand valve.

Other intermediate-pressure hoses supply optional additional components.|$|R
50|$|Other {{airlines}} that joined the British Caledonian Commuter scheme at its inception included Brymon Airways and Guernsey Airlines. The former operated the feeder routes from Gatwick to Birmingham, East Midlands and Plymouth, while the CAA had <b>transferred</b> <b>Air</b> UK's Gatwick—Guernsey licence {{to the latter}} following numerous passenger complaints about the service Air UK had previously provided since it had assumed the former BIA operation on that route.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the consolidations of the 1970s, Air Training Command assumed {{responsibility}} in 1978 for two additional functions: Air University and cryptologic training. Air Force <b>transferred</b> <b>Air</b> University to ATC effective 15 May 1978. This consolidation brought all professional military education {{under the same roof}} as basic military, technical, and flying training. However, Air Force officials soon became concerned this arrangement lowered the visibility and diminished the importance of Air War College and the other schools.|$|E
50|$|The {{approaching}} era of jet travel, and {{a series}} of midair collisions (most notable was the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision), prompted passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. This legislation gave the CAA's functions to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Agency. The act <b>transferred</b> <b>air</b> safety regulation from the CAB to the new FAA, and also gave the FAA sole responsibility for a common civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control. The FAA's first administrator, Elwood R. Quesada, was a former Air Force general and adviser to President Eisenhower.|$|E

5000|$|Conversely, when air is {{compressed}} to {{fill the}} tank, its temperature increases. If the stored air is not cooled while the tank is being filled, then when the air cools off later, its pressure decreases and the available energy decreases. To mitigate this, the tank may be equipped with an internal heat-exchanger in order to cool the air quickly and efficiently while charging. Alternatively, a spring {{may be used to}} store work from the air as it is inserted in the tank, thus maintaining a low pressure difference between the tank and recharger, which results in a lower temperature raise for the <b>transferred</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1982 {{was also}} the year the CAA <b>transferred</b> <b>Air</b> UK's Gatwick—Guernsey licence to Guernsey Airlines, a newly formed {{regional}} operator, following numerous passenger complaints about the service Air UK had been providing ever since it had assumed the former BIA operation on that route. That year also saw Air UK joining forces with British Midland to form Manx Airlines, a new, jointly owned regional subsidiary based on the Isle of Man. Air UK parent B&C owned 25% of Manx Airlines, making it the new joint venture's junior partner. (British Midland, which owned the remaining 75%, was the senior partner.) Air UK and British Midland hoped that transferring their loss-making Isle of Man operations to a dedicated, lower cost subsidiary would eventually make these services profitable.|$|E
50|$|In September 1998, Canadian Regional sold Inter-Canadien to Canadian Investors Group, a Toronto-based {{investment}} company owned by Robert Myhill and his partners. At the same time, Canadian Airlines International cancelled its code-share agreement with Air Atlantic and <b>transferred</b> <b>Air</b> Atlantic's routes in Atlantic Canada to Inter-Canadien. It also transferred {{a number of}} Canadian Regional Airlines routes in Ontario. As a result, Inter-Canadien almost doubled in size, increasing its fleet from ten ATR 42 to 16 ATR propjets and three Fokker F28 Fellowship twin jets operating on a route network that reached from St, John's, Newfoundland in the east to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario in the west. In July 1999, the airline announced an order for six new Embraer ERJ-135 regional jets. However, these Embraer twin jets were never operated by the airline.|$|E

50|$|Since 1995, Air Station Traverse City has {{controlled}} and manned Air Facilities throughout southern Lake Michigan. On April 1, 1995, Air Station Chicago transitioned to Air Facility Glenview {{at the former}} Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois and fell under operational control of Air Station Traverse City. However, its colors were retired soon after on November 15, 1996, and the facility ceased operations concurrent with the closure of NAS Glenview due to BRAC action. On April 1, 1997, Air Facility Muskegon was established and was manned with one HH-65A from Traverse City. But on May 25, 2000, Air Facility Waukegan was established, and Air Station Traverse City slowly transferred operations there. On September 30, 2001, Air Station Traverse City completely <b>transferred</b> <b>Air</b> Facility Muskegon to Air Station Detroit at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan and took control of Air Facility Waukegan. Both Air Facilities operate from Memorial Day to Labor Day. The Air Station transitioned from four MH-65D to three MH-60T in April 2017.|$|E
