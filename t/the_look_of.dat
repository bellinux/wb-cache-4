5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> the series.|$|E
5|$|Make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore created <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> the Bynars, {{who were}} four women in extensive make-up. The musical score was scored by Ron Jones. Reviewers praised the Bynars themselves, {{and the response}} to the episode was generally positive, with one critic calling it the best of the season. It was awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} filmed on sets that are an exact {{replica of the}} house. Details such as Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows, and {{hammered}} bronze light fixtures, were re-created to preserve <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> the house. The house became available for rent on Airbnb for six months, beginning February 2016, before being unlisted.|$|E
5|$|After World of Motion {{had closed}} on January 2, 1996, {{everything}} inside the ride building was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track. Work inside the building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> a test car {{that is used to}} go through multiple safety tests.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E

5|$|Blue Shift {{returns the}} player to Half-Lifes Black Mesa {{timeline}} once more, {{this time as}} Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option to update <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue Shift content. Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> {{the film}} with the Coens during pre-production. They {{told him that}} they wanted {{some parts of the}} film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Contracting out to {{independent}} studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three {{games for the}} CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> the characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets. Philips insisted that the development studios utilize {{all aspects of the}} CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the PlayStation 2, Sony {{reported}} that the new system had compatibility issues with the Final Fantasy V half of Final Fantasy Anthology. The game experienced a bug where if players attempted to save their games, a graphical error would occur. Square then released a statement that only <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> the save screen was corrupted, and saving was still possible, and if players wished, repeatedly going {{into and out of the}} save screen would make a normal screen eventually appear. This incompatibility was fixed for the PAL and Greatest Hits releases of Final Fantasy Anthology.|$|E
5|$|Green {{also took}} photos of a {{prepared}} list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E

5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} and feel of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on The Wrath of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> the Enterprise on a scale not seen since The Wrath of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E
5|$|Music {{journalist}} Stephen Davis {{claims the}} influences of the style {{can be traced back}} to acts like Aerosmith, Kiss, Boston, Cheap Trick, and The New York Dolls. Kiss and to a lesser extent Alice Cooper, were major influences on the genre. Finnish band Hanoi Rocks, heavily influenced themselves by the New York Dolls, have been credited with setting a blueprint for <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> hair metal.|$|E
5|$|Nolan {{worked with}} {{production}} designer Nathan Crowley to create <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> Gotham City. Crowley built {{a model of}} the city that filled Nolan's garage. Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. The Narrows was based on the slummish nature of the (now demolished) walled city of Kowloon in Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{known as}} the Rothbury or Rodbury Terrier, the name Bedlington Terrier was not applied to the breed until 1825, but some dogs have pedigrees that {{can be traced back}} as far as 1782. The first dog shows with a class for Bedlington Terriers was held in 1870 at Bedlington. Bedlington Terriers shown at early shows were {{frequently}} dyed to improve <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> their fur. In 1948, a Bedlington Terrier known as Rock Ridge Night Rocket won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The breed has a high instance of copper toxicosis, but with the exception of eye problems, it is mostly free from health complaints.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} Mumbai on 6 December 2008. The art direction was handled by Nitin Chandrakant Desai, Piyush Shah did the cinematography, and Ballu Saluja edited the film. Before the filming began, several rehearsals were done {{to choose the}} right look for the characters. Neeta Lulla {{was brought in to}} design Chopra's clothes, while a non-film hair stylist named Asha Harirahan was chosen to design twelve different hair styles and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> each character. It had a single start-to-finish schedule and was filmed at 65 different locations across Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Frazier Park, California, with a budget of $45,000. It began in September 2008 and lasted 20 days, {{most of which were}} spent on Ron Trost's property. Scenes set in BLT's house were filmed at the Trosts' childhood home, while <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> his basement was designed using the inside of a shipping container. Many set pieces were taken either from items Ron had collected or from other film sets. The Trost brothers split directorial duties between themselves; Brandon focused on visuals and Jason focused on the performances and story. Valmassy directed a driving scene featuring himself and Folley when the Trosts were briefly unavailable.|$|E
