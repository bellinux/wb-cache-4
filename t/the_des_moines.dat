5|$|US136 was {{designated}} nationally in 1951. In the Keokuk area, it was overlaid upon US61 from west of Alexandria, Missouri, over <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> River into Iowa, and into downtown Keokuk. South of downtown, it replaced Iowa161, which crossed the Mississippi River on the Keokuk Rail Bridge. Since its designation, the route has largely remained the same.

5|$|In 1990 Myron entered Dewey into {{a charity}} pet {{photograph}} contest {{as a way}} to promote the library; Dewey won the contest after receiving more than 80% of the votes. Dewey's win was covered in <b>The</b> <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> Register, which led to increased local and state publicity in print and on television, and the library never again made an effort to increase Dewey's publicity outside of the local area. An appearance in the June/July 1990 issue of Country magazine took Dewey's story national, after which eleven people claimed to have been the person who left Dewey in the book drop {{as a way to}} protect him from the cold.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{artifacts}} {{found in}} Iowa are Clovis points, large lanceolate points found occasionally {{in all parts}} of the state except for <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> <b>Moines</b> Lobe. Possible sources of game were giant Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, mastodon, and giant forms of bison, all of which are now extinct. While widespread, only two Clovis sites have been excavated in Iowa. The Rummells-Maske site is a Clovis site in Cedar County; unfortunately, this site was damaged by plowing, although 20 points and point fragments were recovered. The Carlisle Clovis Cache Site in Warren County contained 38 unfinished stone tools that appear to date to the Clovis period, but these results have not yet been published.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{directors}} of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., declared {{the need for a}} new building. Paul Mellon, a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant J. Carter Brown (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the Library of Alexandria.
