In this paper, a new instrument named photo total station system has been adopted and meanwhile based on this new instrument, a flexible and efficient digital <b>terrestrial</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> method has been developed. Photo Total Station System (PTSS) is a completely novel surveying system, which installs metric digital camera on total station to compose an integration system together with digital photogrammetry software.

40|$|The {{stability}} of man-made rock slopes is {{greatly influenced by}} {{the orientation of the}} discontinuities in the rock mass. To determine kinematic and kinetic {{stability of}} rock slopes, discontinuity orientations must be measured safely and precisely with cost effectiveness and time efficiency. ^ Several methods exist for taking field measurements of discontinuity orientations. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the traditional method of hand measuring discontinuity orientations using a Brunton compass against hand measurements from a smartphone with inclinometer application software and the remote sensing techniques <b>terrestrial</b> digital <b>photogrammetry</b> and ground based LiDAR. The field site was a rock outcrop along Stroubles Creek Road on Price Mountain, Virginia. The Price Mountain structure is a doubly plunging anticline window in the Pulaski Thrust Sheet. The rock outcrop consists of the Upper Price Formation, a Mississippian sandstone with interlayered coal seams. The site features bedding planes that dip steeply into the slope face, yielding toppling failures. In addition, several distinct sets of joints exist creating both planar and wedge failures. In this study rock slope stability analyses considered a hypothetical excavation in the Upper Price Formation for the purpose of open pit coal mining. ^ In order to compare the methods, three surveys were performed at this site. The first was a window mapping method in which discontinuity orientation measurements are made using both a Brunton compass and a smartphone with an inclinometer application. The second survey utilized was a <b>terrestrial</b> digital <b>photogrammetry</b> survey, which produced unusable results due to lighting problems, and was subsequently abandoned. Finally, a ground based LiDAR survey was conducted. ^ Stereographic analysis of the discontinuities was used to evaluate discontinuity sets, the average orientation of these sets, and the kinematic stability of possible planar, wedge, and toppling failures. The average orientations of the sets along with field observations were then used in probabilistic factor of safety analyses using Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the probability of planar, wedge, and toppling failure for each survey method. Results were then compared to assess the relative accuracy of the methods, as well as their relative time efficiency, cost effectiveness, and safety. These results show that while remote sensing techniques can be conducted faster and more safely than hand measurements, they must be calibrated with field observation in order to ensure the best results. Remote sensing techniques, while very practical and effective, cannot completely replace traditional geologic field observations and experience. ...|$|R

The rig was used in a field campaign at the Remningstorp forest test area in southern Sweden. Ground truth was collected manually by surveying and manual measurements. Initial results show estimated tree stem diameters within 10 % of the ground truth. This suggest that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> is a viable method to measure tree stem diameters on circular field plots...|$|E

Over recent years, two avalanche paths have been used routinely to release avalanches and study avalanche dynamics and interactions between avalanches and obstacles. Avalanche flows are generally dense and dry, sometimes with a powder cloud on top. Main avalanche path no. 2 is dedicated to studies on avalanche dynamics. Within the flow of the avalanche, flow height and vertical profiles of pressure and velocity are measured along a 3. 5 m tripod.

Avalanche path no. 1 is smaller in size and particularly well-suited to experiments on structures exposed to small to medium-size avalanches (b 1000 m 3).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Lautaret {{full-scale}} avalanche {{test site}} in the southern French Alps {{has been used by}} IRSTEA (Cemagref) Research Institute since 1973. Over the recent years two avalanche paths are used to release small to medium avalanches 3 or 4 times each winter. Avalanche flows are generally dense, whether wet or dry, sometimes with a powder part. Main path n° 2 (track length 800 m) is dedi-cated to avalanche dynamics. Within the flow of the avalanche, flow height and vertical profiles of pressure and velocity are measured along a 3. 5 m tripod. The snow volume released in the starting zone is quantified by a differential analysis of laser scanning measurements set before and after trig-gering. A high rate positioning of the avalanche along the track is determined from <b>terrestrial</b> oblique <b>photogrammetry.</b> Above the dense layer, the saltation layer and the powder part are characterized by particles and air fluxes measurements. In path n° 1 smaller in size, medium-size avalanches (track length 500 m) make this track of particular interest for experiments on structures. A macroscopic sen-sor-structure is set nearly 150 m downhill from the starting zone, that is, in the area where avalanches generally reach their maximum velocity. It consists is a one square-meter plate supported by a 3. 5 m high steel cantilever fixed in the ground, facing the avalanche. Impact pressures are reconstructed from the cantilever deformations, while avalanche velocity is measured from optical sensors. Seismi...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} elements that can contribute to elaborate a proper methodology for 3 D content model generation: the availability of advanced surveying technologies (<b>Terrestrial</b> Laser Scanner, <b>Photogrammetry,</b> Multispectral data integration) can have a great potential in generating knowledge, especially if integrated by historical documentation on the ancient constructive technologies. In this sense the use of technological constructive analysis could better orient 3 D Informative Object reconstruction. Such approach has been here applied to the vault structures: the main contribution was the investigation of maintenance analysis and of structural stability, supporting the comprehension of the behaviour of architectural elements within the overall framework of the artefact. The logic of Building Information Models (BIM) approach, such as Object Content Model, has opened interesting scenarios to be investigated for the future, and that could become more useful for the sites’ monitoring and for the life cycle management within planned conservation processes...|$|R
