25|$|The Coronary Drug Project was {{intended}} to study the safety and effectiveness of drugs for long-term treatment of coronary heart disease in men.

25|$|Nearly all studies {{conducted}} find benefit in <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> group. For example, Khan published a meta-analysis {{of studies of}} investigational antidepressants and found a 30% reduction in suicide and attempted suicide in <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> groups and a 40% reduction in the treated groups. However, studies generally do not include an untreated group, so determining the actual size of <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect, compared to totally untreated patients, is difficult.|$|E

As to the effect within 5 minutes after injection, Dilospan was significantly superior to <b>the</b> <b>placebos.</b> <b>The</b> effective rate within 30 minutes was 75 % in Dilospan, 63 % in <b>the</b> active <b>placebo,</b> and 52 % in <b>the</b> inert <b>placebo.</b> Dilospan will be valuable {{in order to control}} pain in an emergency state...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the changes in gingival health in patients treated with probiotic containing mouth rinse. Thirty volunteers between 20 and 35 years were randomly divided into two groups. While one group was given <b>placebos,</b> <b>the</b> other was given probiotic mouth rinse for 14 days. The volunteers were instructed to swish the mouth rinse for 60 s twice a day. Intergroup comparison of the plaque scores (baseline- 14 days) showed there was statistically significant difference in the mean plaque scores between <b>the</b> <b>placebos</b> group (0. 14) (P ≤ 0. 05) and the test group (0. 42) (P ≤ 0. 05) and a statistically significant difference in the mean gingival scores from baseline- 14 days between <b>the</b> <b>placebos</b> group (0. 9) (P ≤ 0. 05) and the test group (0. 38) with (P ≤ 0. 05). Despite the short period for which the probiotics mouthwash was used by the patients, substantial improvement in gingival health of patients was observed in the study...|$|R
25|$|Motivation may {{contribute}} to <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect. The active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues. Motivation may link to the meaning through which people experience illness and treatment. Such meaning {{is derived from the}} culture in which they live and which informs them about the nature of illness and how it responds to treatment. Research into <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers shows that this varies widely with society. <b>The</b> <b>placebo</b> effect in treating gastric ulcers is low in Brazil, higher in northern Europe (Denmark, Netherlands), and extremely high in Germany. However, <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect in treating hypertension is lower in Germany than elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Placebos do {{not work}} for everyone. Henry K. Beecher, in a paper in 1955, {{suggested}} placebo effects occurred in about 35% of people.

40|$|It {{remains an}} open {{question}} whether placebo/sham acupuncture, in which the needle tip presses the skin, {{can be used as a}} placebo device for research on pain. We compare the analgesic effect of <b>the</b> skin-touch <b>placebo</b> needle with that of <b>the</b> no-touch <b>placebo</b> needle, in which the needle tip does not touch the skin, in a double-blind crossover manner including no-treatment control in 23 healthy volunteers. The subjects received painful electrical stimulation in the forearm before and during needle retention to the LI 4 acupoint and after the removal of the needle and rated pain intensity using a visual analogue scale. We found no significant difference in analgesic effects among <b>the</b> skin-touch <b>placebo</b> needle, no-touch placebo needle, and no-treatment control at every point before, during, and after the treatments (p> 0. 05).

25|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> group is {{to account for}} <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect, that is, effects from {{treatment}} that do {{not depend on the}} treatment itself.

25|$|Another {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} 79% of depressed patients receiving placebo remained well (for 12 weeks {{after an initial}} 6–8 weeks of successful therapy) compared to 93% of those receiving antidepressants.

40|$|Background: Bright light {{therapy is}} the {{recommended}} treatment for winter {{seasonal affective disorder}} (SAD). However, the studies with <b>the</b> best <b>placebo</b> controls {{have not been able}} to demonstrate that light treatment has a ben-efit beyond its placebo effect. Methods: Ninety-six patients with SAD completed the study. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treat-ments for 4 weeks, each 1. 5 hours per day: morning light (average start time about 6 AM), evening light (average start about 9 PM), or morning placebo (average start about 6 AM). The bright light (< 6000 lux) was produced by light boxes, and <b>the</b> <b>placebos</b> were sham negative-ion gen-erators. Depression ratings using the Structured Inter-view Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, SAD version (SIGH-SAD) were performed weekly...|$|R
