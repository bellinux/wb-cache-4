5|$|On July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan {{underwent}} a colonoscopy, during which a villous adenoma (a pre-cancerous lesion) was discovered. When told by his physician (Dr. Edward Cattau) {{that he could}} undergo surgery immediately or in <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> Reagan elected to have it removed immediately.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks {{of the higher}} altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> off work to recover.|$|E

5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> to complete. The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest for <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto {{the floor of the}} nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{sometimes}} assign {{characters to}} particular writers; for example, Cogman {{was assigned to}} Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they spend another <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline is created, {{with each of the}} writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took {{a month and a half}} to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries.|$|E

The unit {{was responsible for}} the base defense and force protection of Camp Cropper until 18 February 2007 when they transferred authority to the 198th FA out of the KY NG. C Battery was responsible for three perimeter towers, four quick reaction force (QRF) patrols and two entry control points (ECP). C Battery also performed area security and escorts for Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) outside the Victory Base Complex.

50|$|The first {{prototype}} finished 13th in the World Gliding Championships in Waikerie in January 1974 but it performed impressively. (The low placing {{was caused}} by a poor decision {{on the first day of}} the competition.) The glider was then produced at the rate of <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> per <b>week.</b>|$|R
5|$|By 1896, {{the company}} {{produced}} one new car every <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> and built vehicles on order for $2,000. As the orders increased, the company formally incorporated as Haynes-Apperson on May 5, 1898, with $25,000 in capital from stock issued to Portland and Kokomo businessmen. At {{the end of}} that year the company relocated to a large factory it had built in Kokomo. Two new models were designed and the workforce expanded as production increased. Haynes-Apperson ran advertisements in area newspapers and demonstrated cars at county fairs and other exhibitions. Demand for the vehicles grew rapidly from five cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899, 192 in 1900, and 240 in 1901. The work kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep the factory running at capacity by 1902. Sales totaled over $400,000 that year.|$|E
5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E
5|$|Dams {{interrupt}} {{the migration of}} anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams {{in which they were}} born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of salmon die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate. In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge. The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam.|$|E
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} only every two years, if successful; studies on Adams Island in the 1990s found an annual {{breeding}} {{success rate of}} 67%. Albatross pairs return to their breeding islands from November, with the older males the first to arrive. A raised mud nest is built for a single chick, with the egg laid in late December or early January. The nest is built mainly by the female, with the male gathering most of the material. The egg is incubated alternately by both parents in long, <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>week</b> shifts, {{the first of which}} is undertaken by the male, while the non-incubating bird is away foraging, often in the Tasman Sea up to 1000-1500 km away from the nesting site.|$|R
40|$|Numerous parvovirus-like particles, 18 to 26 nm in diameter, were {{detected}} by electron microscopy in the intestinal contents of <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>week</b> old piglets with mild to severe diarrhea, in six Quebec pig herds. Hemagglutination of guinea pig and African green monkey {{red blood cells}} was obtained with clarified intestinal contents. Two isolates {{were found to be}} antigenically related to porcine and canine parvoviruses, while another differed from the porcine parvovirus using the hemagglutination-inhibition test. Three isolates could be cultivated in cell cultures as demonstrated by the development of a cytopathic effect, hemagglutination activity, immunofluorescence and identification of the virions in the cell culture fluids by electron microscopy. The possibility of a primary etiological role for these parvoviruses in diarrhea of unweaned piglets is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{patients}} with hypercalcaemia and known malignant disease were randomly allocated to receive 60 mg 3 -amino- 1 -hydroxypropylidene- 1, 1 -bisphosphonate (APD) intravenously {{as a single}} dose or as consecutive daily doses of 30 mg (two days) or 15 mg (four days). The rate of infusion was the same for each regimen (7. 5 mg/hour). Calcium concentrations fell in all patients and returned to normal in all but two. Relapse of hypercalcaemia occurred after a mean of 21 days in each group. Urinary calcium excretion fell in all groups and symptoms were greatly improved. After relapse patients were retreated with APD (30 mg as a single infusion) and normocalcaemia maintained by regular infusions at <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>week</b> intervals...|$|R
5|$|Torres made a scoring {{start to}} the 2008–09 Premier League season with a 25-yard shot into the bottom {{right-hand}} corner away at Sunderland, which was the only goal in a 1–0 win on 16 August 2008. He suffered a hamstring tear in a 0–0 draw against Aston Villa, which would keep him out for <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> Torres made his return in a 2–1 victory against Marseille in the Champions League {{and went on to}} score two goals in the Merseyside derby against Everton on 27 September 2008 to give Liverpool a 2–0 win. He followed this up with another two goals the following weekend against Manchester City in a 3–2 win away at the City of Manchester Stadium as Liverpool came back from a two-goal deficit. The first of these was the thousandth Liverpool goal to be scored in the Premier League. Torres picked up a hamstring injury during a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, meaning he was likely to miss three games for Liverpool. On 22 October 2008, Liverpool played Torres' former club Atlético in the Champions League at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, but his injury meant he missed out on the game. Atlético president Enrique Cerezo had given him a VIP invitation to watch the game, but he declined this to continue his rehabilitation from injury in Merseyside. He was named in the FIFPro World XI team for the 2007–08 season on 27 October 2008.|$|E

50|$|In 1707, the Treaty of Union between Scotland and England gave Scottish merchants {{access to}} the English {{overseas}} territories, especially in North America. Glasgow's position on the River Clyde, where the trade winds first hit Europe, gave its merchants a <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>week</b> advantage over other ports in Britain and Europe. This position was enhanced by the French monarchy granting it a monopoly for the importation of tobacco into French territories (1747) and later by the deepening of the Clyde in 1768. Glasgow ships were American-built specifically for the Atlantic crossing and were generally bigger than those of other ports. However, the main advantage of the Glasgow merchants {{seems to have been}} their extensive and personally supervised networks across Britain, Europe and the Americas.|$|R

40|$|In September 1995, 225 spring-born calves were weaned on pasture at the McNay Memorial Research and Demonstration Farm {{to explore}} {{procedures}} necessary {{to conduct a}} successful pasture-weaning program. In the <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>week</b> post-weaning period, average daily gains (ADG) {{for the two groups}} weaned that year were 1. 06 and 3. 06 pounds; there were no health problems.

40|$|This {{research}} report {{is a case}} study, the aim {{of which is to}} describe and analyse the methods used by a non-profit organization in teaching Grade Seven (7) learners with reading difficulties in an Alexandra Township school, by using a combination of the whole language and phonics approaches. It involves Phenduka Literacy Project facilitators immersed in a <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>week</b> literacy intervention with an average of 30 - 35 Grade 7 learners at Dr Knak Primary School. The aim of the Phenduka programme is to improve learners’ levels of reading so that they can meet the demands of high school education. Data was collected by analysing the teaching material, carrying out semi-structured interviews with Phenduka facilitators, and observing the facilitators at work. The findings revealed that there is no one suitable method for teaching reading; rather, using an integrated approach would bear much fruits. It is envisaged that {{the findings of this study}} would enlighten teachers in disadvantaged communities in South Africa who face the same scenario of dealing with poor readers and using limited teaching/learning resources...|$|R
