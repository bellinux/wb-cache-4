500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was <b>told</b> <b>I</b> should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I have to ask for forgiveness." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} Liberal leadership, Macdonald {{travelled}} the province on speaking tours helping organize party support in every constituency. As Liberal leader, he {{proved to be}} an effective platform speaker. According to biographer John Hawkins, Macdonald's [...] "plain talk and simplicity" [...] persuaded audiences of his honesty. He developed the ability to explain political issues with a [...] "clarity that every voter could understand". When the legislature was in session, he led the Liberals from the public galleries because he had no seat in the House. There were six vacancies, but the Conservatives refused to call by-elections fearing they would lose their five-seat majority. Macdonald publicly criticized Premier Gordon Harrington for depriving so many Nova Scotians of representation. He deplored what he called [...] "the loss of responsible government." [...] It was a message that struck a chord in the province that had been the first in Canada to achieve responsible government in 1848 thanks to the efforts of the great liberal Reformer Joseph Howe. Privately however, Macdonald rejoiced that the government couldn't risk calling a by-election telling one supporter years later, [...] "If the truth must be <b>told,</b> <b>I</b> was sometimes afraid that they would open up a seat and deprive me of this sort of ammunition".|$|E

500|$|On 7 January 2009, Barton was {{questioned}} by the Indian media on why she chose to sign on the project to which she responded [...] "I'm interested {{in all kinds of}} things, I did this film for moral reasons. Also, I felt the story needed to be <b>told,</b> <b>I</b> feel {{that this is going to}} be an important film." [...] Benjamin Wallfisch, an Emmy and Ivor Novello-nominated composer, composed music for the movie Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain. The film was slated to release in 2010 but the lack of response from the distributors delayed the release. On the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh attended the film's premiere in Bhopal and after watching the film he announced that the state government would not charge any tax on the film's earning. Chouhan called the film [...] "very sensitive" [...] and praised the [...] "heart-rending" [...] performance given by actors. To promote awareness about the tragedy a NGO The Bhopal Medical Appeal and the film's director collaborated with mobile commerce portal Paytm and the online shopping website Snapdeal. As part of the partnership Paytm and Snapdeal offered their customers a chance to donate money in form of online coupons to the disaster victims.|$|E

2500|$|In {{interviews}} in 2002 and 2011, Depp claimed he has Native American ancestry, and that “I was <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was Cherokee {{as a kid}}. I was <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was Creek Indian as a kid and Chickasaw.” He has also claimed that his [...] "great-grandmother was {{quite a bit of}} Native American." [...] He has no evidence for these claims, only personal belief and Kentucky lore among non-Natives. Depp's genealogy has since been done by third-party researchers, who discovered the ancestors he believed to be Native actually had very distant African-American ancestry. Despite this discovery, Depp has continued to claim or imply he is Native. Depp's claims came under question when Indian Country Today Media Network stated that Depp has never inquired about his heritage nor does the Cherokee Nation recognize him as a member. This has led to criticism from the Native community, including of his choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in The Lone Ranger. Critical response to his claims from the Native community also included satirical portrayals of Depp by Native comedians.|$|E

Nothing else was happening for me at the time.

2500|$|In late 1988, Yorke left Oxford {{to study}} at the University of Exeter, which put On a Friday on hiatus aside from holiday break rehearsals.

Oxford University would have eaten me up and spat me out. It's too rigorous." [...] At Exeter, {{he worked as a}} DJ, performed experimental music with a classical ensemble, and played with the band Headless Chickens, performing songs including future Radiohead material.

2500|$|Cohen {{was born}} on September 21, 1934, into a middle-class Canadian Jewish family {{residing}} in Westmount, Quebec, an English-speaking suburb of Montreal. His mother, Marsha (Masha) Klonitsky, {{was the daughter of}} a Talmudic writer, Rabbi Solomon Klonitsky-Kline, and emigrated to Montreal in 1927 from Lithuania. His paternal grandfather, whose family had moved from Poland to Canada, was Lyon Cohen, the founding president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. His father, Nathan Cohen, owned a substantial clothing store and died when Cohen was nine years old. The family observed Orthodox Judaism, and belonged to Congregation Shaar Hashomayim, to which Cohen retained connections all his life. On the topic of being a Kohen, Cohen told Richard Goldstein in 1967, [...] "I had a very Messianic childhood. I was <b>told</b> <b>I</b> was a descendant of Aaron, the high priest." ...|$|E

[...] "I can't imagine how that must feel. I definitely think we should all {{have the right to}} love, and love publicly, the people that we want to love."

2500|$|Slocum {{agreed to}} a request by the Brazilian {{government}} to deliver the Destroyer to Pernambuco, Brazil. His motive was also financial. As Slocum describes, his contract with the commander of government forces at Pernambuco was, [...] "to go against the rebel fleet, and sink them all, if we could find them – big and little – for a handsome sum of gold …" [...] In addition, Slocum saw the possibility of getting even with the [...] "arch rebel" [...] Admiral Melo (whom he writes as [...] "Mello"): [...] "Confidentially: I was burning to get a rake at Mello and his Aquideban.

2500|$|Speaking of the [...] "ripple effect," [...] Rouse {{explains}} that, to {{a certain}} extent, it was dictated {{by a sense of}} narrative logic; [...] "it's really crucial that Carmen treats you differently depending on whether you killed her or not. It doesn't make sense that she'd still be loving toward you if you killed her in cold blood." [...] However, it was also important that the player never feel locked into one morality; they could begin the game with bad morality and finish with good morality; [...] "you can travel down different moral paths, and both the beginning you started with and the choices you make during Ties that Bind will affect your final outcome. So there are really a surprising number of possible stories to be <b>told.</b> <b>I</b> want every player to have their own unique version of Torque's story.

2500|$|Bloom has {{appeared}} in numerous roles on television such as her portrayal of Lady Marchmain in Brideshead Revisited (1981). In 1996, she wrote, [...] "I still find it puzzling when I am <b>told</b> <b>I</b> played a manipulative and heartless woman; that is not how I saw her. Lady Marchmain is deeply religious, and her dilemma includes trying to raise a willful brood of children on her own, while instilling them with her rigid observance of the Catholic code. Sebastian is both an alcoholic and a homosexual, and from her point of view, {{he lives in a}} state of mortal sin. She has to fight for his soul by any means in her power, with the knowledge that her efforts may lead to his destruction. A born crusader, the Marchioness confronts her difficult choices head on; her rigidity of purpose, which I don't in any way share, is understandable in context. The aspect that rings most true is her sense of being an outsider, a Catholic in Protestant England. Not such a leap from being a Jew in Protestant England as one would imagine." ...|$|E
