5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of <b>the</b> <b>gondola,</b> {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in <b>the</b> <b>gondola,</b> drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below the rear of <b>the</b> <b>gondola,</b> was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> within a pyramid of steel tubing {{that was designed to}} protect <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> and the propellers during landing.|$|E
5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} {{mounted to}} the inside of <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> makes its way up the tower, the LED lights {{at the top of the}} tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED lights on <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> remains lit. When <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> comes back down, the lights at the top of the tower come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED lights at the top of the tower remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the more}} unusual chase {{sequences}} include <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> sequence from Moonraker, which leaves the canals of Venice {{to continue on}} land, and the cello case chase in The Living Daylights, {{as well as a}} double-decker bus in Live and Let Die.|$|E
50|$|The Schwarzkopf {{versions}} of the Enterprise have either 16 or 21 gondolas, thus having a different diameter of <b>the</b> wheel. <b>The</b> <b>gondolas</b> are also smaller than the HUSS version. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>gondolas</b> were produced in-house; they were later replaced by gondolas manufactured separately by Reverchon.|$|R
50|$|Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom {{consists}} of two brothers, Derek and Ximena that is free fall drop attractions, with each mounted to a lateral flank of the Superman: Escape From Krypton structure. Both rides feature a single floorless gondola seating eight-abreast. Riders are harnessed in by over-the-shoulder restraints. Catch cars hoist <b>the</b> <b>gondolas</b> up <b>the</b> tower for approximately 95 seconds before reaching a dynamic height of 400 ft. As <b>the</b> <b>gondolas</b> reach <b>the</b> apex, riders are greeted with a pre-recorded audio spiel from a voice representing the fictional DC comic book character Lex Luthor. <b>The</b> <b>gondolas</b> are then released into 5-second free fall descent, attaining a terminal velocity of 85 mph. Mass of <b>the</b> <b>gondolas</b> is 600 kg without any riders.|$|R
50|$|Riptide {{is mainly}} {{made up of}} 4 parts. The first parts are the two {{supports}} that hold the entire ride up. The second parts are the two arms that hold and move <b>the</b> <b>gondolas</b> {{up and down in}} a circular rotation. The third parts are <b>the</b> tow <b>gondolas.</b> This is where the riders are seated for <b>the</b> ride. Each <b>gondola</b> holds a maximum of 20 riders meaning that the ride can operate with a maximum of 40 riders per cycle. <b>The</b> <b>gondolas</b> also spin freely on a circular rotation just like the arms that hold <b>the</b> <b>gondolas.</b> <b>The</b> fourth parts are the fountains. The fountains {{at the bottom of the}} ride can shoot as high as the ride itself and are a part of the ride to soak riders while riding (only during hot days).|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> made its way back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down <b>the</b> <b>gondola.</b> Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The area {{also has}} many {{opportunities}} for both alpine and Nordic skiing. The bowl of Tuckerman Ravine {{is famous for its}} extremely steep backcountry skiing. Long lines are common during the peak spring-skiing season of April and May. Wildcat Mountain offers groomed ski trails and lifts, and is a better choice for less-experienced skiers. The centerpiece of the ski-area is <b>the</b> <b>gondola,</b> which runs during the summer, and offers views of the Presidentials with no expended effort.|$|E
5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E

5|$|Top Hat began filming on April 1, 1935 {{and cost}} $620,000 to make. Shooting ended in June {{and the first}} public previews were held in July. These led to cuts of {{approximately}} ten minutes, mainly in the last portion of the film: the carnival sequence and <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> parade which had been filmed {{to show off the}} huge set were heavily cut. A further four minutes were cut before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall, where it broke all records, went on to gross $3 million on its initial release, and became RKO's most profitable film of the 1930s. After Mutiny on the Bounty, it made more money than any other film released in 1935.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, {{the tower}} for Falcon's Fury was shipped from Spain in nine sections, {{arriving}} at the park {{near the end of}} October; the ride's smaller parts had been delivered earlier from several European countries. Installation of one of the nine tower pieces was planned for every other night, with the last piece in place by New Year's Eve. Construction was done by the Adena Corporation, and on November 18 the first piece was installed. The ride's second piece was installed on December 2, and two more were installed by December 6. The fifth section was placed by December 21, and the sixth was erected by New Year's Day. The seventh tower piece was installed by January 3, 2014, and the eighth by January 5, reaching a height of about , and Falcon's Fury's gondola was seen at the park on January 12. The ride's counterweight was installed on January 22, and the tower was capped during the weekend of February 1. Work on the ride's electrical components then began. Assembly of <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> was completed by the end of March. Testing was originally scheduled to begin in February, but due to construction delays the first drop tests were not made until April 15. Tower painting began in June, with its sunset motif estimated to take 60 hours over a three-week period.|$|E
25|$|In six-engined {{configuration}} the R-class zeppelins had single pusher {{engines in}} the rear of the front control gondola and two engine cars either side amidships, with a further three engines {{in the rear}} gondola. Of the rear gondola engines, one drove a pusher propeller direct at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> and two more in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>gondola</b> drove propellers, via gearboxes and transmission shafts, mounted on framework either side of <b>the</b> <b>gondola.</b> Five-engined R-class zeppelins omitted the rear gondola direct-drive centre engine.|$|E
