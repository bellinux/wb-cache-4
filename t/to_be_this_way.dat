500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why does it have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> <b>way?</b> Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> <b>way...</b> just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm going to miss you, Mr. Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E
500|$|Mike Ryan of Uproxx {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, writing [...] "Newt Scamander {{is nothing like}} Harry, but it has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> It all has to be different. And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to make us feel like we are at home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} later rewritten and {{expanded}} when Lynch decided to {{transform it into}} a feature film. Describing the transition from an open-ended pilot to a feature film with a resolution of sorts, Lynch said, [...] "One night, I sat down, the ideas came in, {{and it was a}} most beautiful experience. Everything was seen from a different angle... Now, looking back, I see that [...] always wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> It just took this strange beginning to cause it to be what it is." [...] The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts was relieved that the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward. Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7million from French production company StudioCanal.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{development}} of Kingdom Hearts II, Nomura had more creative freedom due to advances in technology. Port Royal, Space Paranoids, and Pride Lands, in particular, benefited from these advances. In Port Royal and Space Paranoids, the character models were generated from live-action pictures using a new program. Nomura had wanted to include a world based on The Lion King in the first game, but could not since its engine could not process quadrupedal character models properly, a feature which was resolved for Kingdom Hearts II. A sub-world of Disney Castle is Timeless River, meant to be the [...] "past" [...] of Disney Castle, shortly before it was built. The world is portrayed in black and white; Nomura had intended it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> {{from the beginning of}} development. The world has many throwback effects including intentionally poor sound quality to imitate old cartoons. In this grayscale world, Sora's character model is simplified to the style of early cartoons, while Goofy and Donald Duck revert to their original designs from when they first appeared in Disney cartoons.|$|E

50|$|A {{native of}} Bealach, near Duntulm, Skye, Martin {{was thought to}} have {{authenticity}} in his work because {{he was raised in}} Gaeldom.

25|$|Dealing {{does not}} have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{strictly}} <b>this</b> <b>way</b> and may <b>be</b> done quite differently based on house rules.
