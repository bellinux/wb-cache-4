While significant {{progress has been made}} concerning early warning systems (as examples from Indonesia and Sri Lanka show), there is still a severe lack of well-designed systems in many tsunami-exposed regions (Løvholt et al. 2014). Some authors argue for a “people centered” tsunami early warning system (Gebert and Post 2010) that links technological aspects of a warning with the social response system. Bottlenecks have been identified for various countries related to evacuation routes and disaster zoning as part of urban planning (Suppasri et al. 2015). Tasks such as evacuation reveal the need to firmly link the improvements in <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> with capacity building to ensure the maintenance of devices for communication (for example mobile phones, radios, loudspeaker systems), the sharing of responsibilities for their operation {{in the case of a}} disaster, and reflection on the appropriateness and acceptance of proposed <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> and procedures. A transdisciplinary approach for implementing <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> that involves researchers of different disciplines (engineers, social as well as natural scientists) and small and medium enterprises was discussed during the seminar. This transdisciplinary approach is recommended as an important step for improving the sociotechnological nexus of humanitarian aid and long-term vulnerability reduction.|$|R

30|$|<b>Technological</b> <b>measures</b> induce {{costs to}} society because {{reducing}} the energy consumption {{of cars and}} the uptake of alternative fuels and vehicles both require high investments by car and fuel industries {{in research and development}} of new technology. Households then carry the costs in increased fuel and car prices, although government may decide to subsidise new technologies in order to speed up the uptake. However, great emission reductions may be achieved through technology and the emission reduction target can be achieved through solely <b>technological</b> <b>measures.</b> This would require a rapid uptake of alternative energy vehicles, but the society would not receive the great benefits, such as health benefits, energy savings and fixed car cost savings, associated with measures affecting urban form, modal split and social car use. In addition, the <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> shift emissions from the transport sector to the energy sector. Hence, the emissions caused by transport in the energy sector may almost double due to the vehicles using alternative energy sources.|$|R

40|$|Information {{technology}} {{has given rise}} to the problem of controlling the use of copyrighted works of authorship from their unauthorized use. In this context, one of the effective solutions is the application of <b>technological</b> protection <b>measures,</b> which are aimed at a more efficient application of the protection measures prescribed by the law. <b>Technological</b> protection <b>measures</b> imply the use of any technology, device or component which may be aimed at preventing or restricting an unauthorized use of a protected work of authorship, which has not been approved by the author or holder of some related right. Generally, all these measures may be classified into three basic groups: <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at controlling access, <b>technological</b> <b>measured</b> aimed at controlling exploitation, and <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at protecting the integrity of the work of authorship. Considering their technical characteristics and mode of application, they may be hardware-based measures, software-based measures, or a combination thereof. Modern {{technology has}} enabled the development of digital systems which entail a controlled use of copyrighted works and facilitate obtaining licences for their exploitation. They are commonly known as digital rights management (DRM). The DRM system should provide for a compromise between safeguarding the intellectual property rights of the copyright holder, the end user privacy, and system costs. The envisaged goals are achieved by employing various cryptographic measures. The process of developing <b>technological</b> protection <b>measures</b> is accompanied by concurrent attempts to circumvent the application of these measures. Thus, the effectiveness of these measures primarily depends on their legal protection, which has been recognized by a vast majority of legal systems, we now know the most modern legal system. However, the normative solutions are not uniform. The observed differences actually reflect problems in finding adequate forms of protection, which mostly stem from the fact that sanctions for evasion of <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> call into question the ultimate purpose of copyright law in general. Yet, the regulation of <b>technological</b> protection <b>measures</b> must be approached with great caution. Envisaging relevant legal protection for these measures should contribute to providing a comprehensive and stable system of copyright protection. Moreover, it is essential to ascertain the necessary balance of interest of all relevant subjects involved in that process. <b>Technological</b> <b>measures</b> for controlling the use of copyrighted works of authorship should primarily protect the authors' rights and interests; however, they certainly must encompass the legal and legitimate interests of the end-users as well as the general public, particularly considering the statutory limitations to authorship rights in favour of third parties...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{exploitation}} of works often exceed the limit {{to which the}} holder can control the {{exploitation of}} their intellectual creations, and the protection provided by legal norms are, {{in the era of}} a fast exchange of information, may prove to be insufficiently effective. For these reasons, the rights holders are increasingly opting for preventive care through placement of physical obstacles to the exploitation of copyright works, generic called <b>technological</b> protection <b>measures</b> (known as digital right management (DRM)). Simultaneously with the development of the application of these measures flows the process of finding ways to circumvent them. Therefore, the effectiveness of <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> depends on exactly the question of their legal protection, which now exists in most of modern legal systems. However, in the normative solutions there are differences, which reflect the problems in finding adequate forms of protection. They mostly stem {{from the fact that the}} sanctioning of circumvention (or preparatory actions) of <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> put into the question the purpose of copyright protection in general. Hence, in this paper we tried to point out the normative solutions accepted in modern legal systems and practical implications of what they have. Conclusion that arises is that the legal shaping of <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> is not completed and that further technological developments open new dilemmas...|$|R

40|$|Digitisation had a {{profound}} impact on the creation, reproduction, and dissemination of works protected by copyright. Works in digital format are vulnerable to infringement, and <b>technological</b> protection <b>measures</b> are accordingly applied as protection. <b>Technological</b> protection <b>measures</b> can, however, easily be circumvented, and additional legal protection against circumvention was needed. Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (the WCT) obliges Member States to provide adequate legal protection against the circumvention of <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> applied to works protected by copyright. Contracting parties must refine the provisions of Article 11 and provide for exceptions on the prohibition. Article 11 does not specify whether it pertains to only certain types of <b>technological</b> <b>measures,</b> nor does it prohibit the trafficking in circumvention devices. The United States implemented the provisions of Article 11 of the WCT through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the DMCA). Section 1201 of the DMCA prohibits the circumvention of <b>technological</b> <b>measures.</b> It is detailed and relates to two categories of <b>technological</b> <b>measures</b> - access control and copy control. It prohibits not only the act of circumvention, but also the trafficking in circumvention devices. Article 6 of the EC Directive on the Harmonisation of Certain Aspects of Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society of 2001 implements Article 11 of the WCT. Article 6 seeks to protect Aeffective technological measures@. It prohibits both the act of circumvention and circumvention devices. Although Article 11 of the WCT is silent on the issue of access control, it seems as if the international trend is to provide legal protection to access controls, thus indirectly creating a right to control access. South Africa has not yet implemented Article 11 of the WCT. The South African Copyright Act of 1979 does not protect <b>technological</b> protection <b>measures.</b> The Electronic Communications and Transactions Act of 2002 (the ECT Act) provides protection against the circumvention of <b>technological</b> protection <b>measures</b> applied to digital data. The definition of Adata@ is such that it could include protected works. If applied to protected works, the anti-circumvention provisions of the ECT Act would be detrimental to user privileges. As developing country, it seems to be in South Africa's best interest to the implement the provisions of Article 11 in such a manner that it still allows users access to and legitimate use of works protected by copyright.
