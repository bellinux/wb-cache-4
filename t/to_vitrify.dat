40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} simple successful porcine cryopreservation protocol that prevented contact between embryos and liquid nitrogen, avoiding potential contamination risks. In vivo-derived blastocysts were collected surgically from donor pigs, and two porcine embryo vitrification protocols (one used centrifugation to polarize intracytoplasmic lipids, whereas the other did not) were compared using the Cryologic Vitrification Method (CVM), which used solid surface vitrification. The CVM allowed embryos <b>to</b> be <b>vitrified,</b> without any contact between embryos and liquid nitrogen. Both protocols resulted in similar in vitro survival rates (90 % and 94 %) and cell number (89 ± 5 and 99 ± 5) after 48 h in vitro culture of vitrified and warmed blastocysts. The protocol that did not use centrifugation was selected for continued use. <b>To</b> protect <b>vitrified</b> embryos from contact with liquid nitrogen and potential contamination during storage, a sealed outer container was developed. Use of this sealed outer container did not affect in vitro survival of cryopreserved blastocysts. In vivo blastocysts (n = 151) were collected, vitrified, and stored using the selected protocol and sealed container. These embryos were subsequently warmed and transferred to six recipients; five became pregnant and farrowed a total of 26 piglets.

50|$|Cryo-electron {{microscopy}} in STEM (Cryo-STEM) allows specimens {{to be held}} in {{the microscope}} at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures. This is useful for imaging specimens that would be volatile in high vacuum at room temperature. Cryo-STEM has been used <b>to</b> study <b>vitrified</b> biological samples, vitrified solid-liquid interfaces in material specimens, and specimens containing elemental sulfur, which is prone to sublimation in electron microscopes at room temperature.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> allowing <b>vitrified</b> biological samples <b>to</b> be imaged, cryo-EM {{can also}} be used to image material specimens that are too volatile in vacuum to image using standard, room temperature electron microscopy.

50|$|For {{established}} {{methods of}} cryopreservation, the solute must penetrate the cell membrane {{in order to}} achieve increased viscosity and decrease freezing temperature inside the cell. Sugars do not readily permeate through the membrane. Those solutes that do, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, a common cryoprotectant, are often toxic in intense concentration. One of the difficult compromises of vitrifying cryopreservation concerns limiting the damage produced by the cryoprotectant itself due to cryoprotectant toxicity. Mixtures of cryoprotectants and the use of ice blockers have enabled the Twenty-First Century Medicine company <b>to</b> <b>vitrify</b> a rabbit kidney to −135 °C with their proprietary vitrification mixture. Upon rewarming, the kidney was transplanted successfully into a rabbit, with complete functionality and viability, able to sustain the rabbit indefinitely as the sole functioning kidney.|$|E
50|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the cytoplasm behaves like a glass-forming liquid approaching the glass transition. In this theory, the greater the concentration of cytoplasmic components, the less the cytoplasm behaves like a liquid and the more it behaves as a solid glass, freezing larger cytoplasmic components in place (it is thought that the cell's metabolic activity is able to fluidize the cytoplasm to allow the movement of such larger cytoplasmic components). A cell's ability <b>to</b> <b>vitrify</b> {{in the absence of}} metabolic activity, as in dormant periods, may be beneficial as a defence strategy. A solid glass cytoplasm would freeze subcellular structures in place, preventing damage, while allowing the transmission of very small proteins and metabolites, helping to kickstart growth upon the cell's revival from dormancy.|$|E
50|$|When used at high concentrations, cryoprotectants {{can stop}} ice {{formation}} completely. Cooling and solidification without crystal formation is called vitrification. The first cryoprotectant solutions able <b>to</b> <b>vitrify</b> at very slow cooling rates while still being compatible with whole organ survival {{were developed in}} the late 1990s by cryobiologists Gregory Fahy and Brian Wowk {{for the purpose of}} banking transplantable organs. This has allowed animal brains to be vitrified, warmed back up, and examined for ice damage using light and electron microscopy. No ice crystal damage was found; remaining cellular damage was due to dehydration and toxicity of the cryoprotectant solutions. Large vitrified organs tend to develop fractures during cooling, a problem worsened by the large tissue masses and very low temperatures of cryonics.|$|E

The main difference between the Wilmot and Edwards styles is that Wilmot maintained the area’s traditional decorative styles, focusing on images of suns, birds, eagles, lions and flowers. He also founded a new school of ceramic production which remains to this day, using a traditional green-gray background with images made of small dots, often of double headed eagles, lions and multicolored suns.

Workshops from both traditions create elaborate bowls, jars, flower vases, and decorative pieces such as fish figures from miniatures to those measuring fifty centimeters.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the modern}} house-burning {{experiments}} include those done by Arthur Bankoff and Frederick Winter in 1977, Gary Shaffer in 1993, and Stevanovic in 1997. In their experiment, Bankoff and Winter constructed {{a model of a}} partially dilapidated Neolithic house, and then set it on fire {{in a way that would}} replicate how an accidental fire would have perhaps started from an untended cooking-hearth fire. They then allowed the fire to burn unchecked for over thirty hours. Although the fire rapidly spread to the thatched roof, destroying it in the process, in the end less than one percent of the clay in the walls was fired (turned into ceramic material), which is counter to the large amount of fired-clay wall rubble that is found in the Cucuteni-Trypillian settlement ruins. Additionally, the experimental burning left the walls almost entirely intact. It would have been relatively easy for the roof to have been repaired quickly, the ash cleared away, and the house reoccupied. These results are typical for all {{of the modern}} experiments that have been done to try to recreate these ancient house burnings. Stevanovic, an expert archeological ceramicist, describes how in order to produce the large amount of fired clay rubble found in the ruins, that enormous quantities of extra fuel would have had to be placed next to the walls to create enough heat <b>to</b> <b>vitrify</b> the clay.|$|E

40|$|The {{vitrification}} of {{a liquid}} occurs when ice crystal formation is prevented in the cryogenic environment through ultrarapid cooling. In general, vitrification entails a large temperature {{difference between the}} liquid and its surrounding medium. In our droplet vitrification experiments, we observed that such vitrification events are accompanied by a Leidenfrost phenomenon, which impedes the heat transfer to cool the liquid, when the liquid droplet comes into direct contact with liquid nitrogen. This is distinct from the more generally observed Leidenfrost phenomenon that occurs when a liquid droplet is self-vaporized on a hot plate. In the case of rapid cooling, the phase transition from liquid <b>to</b> <b>vitrified</b> solid (i. e., vitrification) and the levitation of droplets on liquid nitrogen (i. e., Leidenfrost phenomenon) take place simultaneously. Here, we investigate these two simultaneous physical events by using a theoretical model containing three dimensionless parameters (i. e., Stefan, Biot, and Fourier numbers). We explain theoretically and observe experimentally a threshold droplet radius during the vitrification of a cryoprotectant droplet {{in the presence of}} the Leidenfrost effect...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} how the Focused Ion Beam (FIB) has been applied <b>to</b> <b>vitrified</b> {{materials}} obtained from chromium wastes. Due to the issues arising during conventional Ar+ ion milling, {{it was necessary to}} thin these samples using FIB. Difficulties came from the heterogeneous size between chromium spinels and the residual glass phase. The FIB was applied to obtain thin foils from vitrified materials. These brittle and heterogeneous samples result in specimens with many perforations and chipping when using conventional thinning below 100 nanometers. Alternatively, FIB allowed thinning in the range of 60 - 80 nanometers from specifically selected areas such as the areas containing spinel crystals Mg(Al,Cr) 2 O 4 in order to facilitate the final Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observations. In this paper, FIB is shown to be a very powerful microtool as a brittle samples preparation method as well as providing an alternative way for performing conventional ceramography and Ar+ ion milling. FIB is a much less destructive method with greater observed capacity in the quantity and analysis of microcrystalline phases. Peer reviewe...|$|R

It introduced lustreware manufacture to Europe and from the start was widely exported to the elites of Christian kingdoms. The first centre was Málaga, producing wares in traditional Islamic styles, but from the 13th century Muslim potters migrated to the reconquered Christian city of Valencia, outlying suburbs of which such as Manises and Paterna became the most important centres, manufacturing mainly for Christian markets in styles increasingly influenced by European decoration, though retaining a distinct character. The potters were mostly still Muslim or Morisco. In a rare manuscript from Kashan compiled by Abulqassim in 1301, there is a complete description of how faience production was carried out.
