The rolls of foil are heated until the degree of softness is reached, which may be up to 340 C for 12 hours. During this heating, the lubricating oils are burned off, leaving a dry surface. Lubricant oils may not be completely burnt off for hard <b>temper</b> <b>rolls,</b> which can make subsequent coating or printing more difficult.|$|R

The study included the assessment of work hardening and bake hardening, the latter at 170 oC for 20 minutes and 90 oC for 30 minutes. The procedure followed to achieve the objectives was: the <b>temper</b> <b>rolled</b> specimens were pre-strained to simulate the forming in the real automotive industry's practice and heated to different temperatures {{similar to those used}} for paint stoving for varying period of time.

40|$|Abstract. Texture {{formation}} through strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) was investigated. Temper rolling reduction before final annealing for SIBM was {{varied between}} 0 and 26 % and grain sizes and textures were measured using EBSD. In the specimen which was <b>temper</b> <b>rolled</b> to 5 %, in which grain growth by SIBM occurred most efficiently, a strong Goss component (which {{was a minor}} component after rolling), developed during annealing. From the EBSD image quality analysis, {{it was found that}} stored energy increased significantly in the Goss component with strain (from 5 to 9 %), whereas it was always relatively small in the D-Cube component ({ 001 }), compared to Goss and γ-fibre components. Based on these results, a mechanism of grain growth by SIBM was suggested. Texture evolution during annealing could thus be explained by the hypothesis, speculated from the analysis of orientation stability, that D-Cube grains are associated with more homogeneous dislocations distributions than Goss grains, in which the co-existence of high and low dislocation density zones could favour grain growth by SIBM...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal {{grain growth}} was studied in an Fe- 1 %Si alloy using {{automated}} Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD). Industrially processed samples were <b>temper</b> <b>rolled</b> to reductions of 0 %, 1. 5 % and 8 % and then annealed {{in a range}} of atmospheres for various times followed by quenching in water. Abnormal grain growth was observed regardless of atmosphere although a moist hydrogen-nitrogen mixture resulted in slower kinetics than air and some strengthening of the Goss texture component. The matrix grains remained essentially static and did not coarsen. Analysis of the grain boundary character of the interfaces between abnormal grains and the matrix showed only general high angle boundaries with no special boundary types present at high (or low) frequencies; this suggested that grain boundary character was not a factor in controlling the AGG. The influence of stored energy was evaluated by examining intragranular orientation gradients; this showed drastic reductions in orientation spread associated with large growing grains. This suggests that variations in stored energy are present, even in the material that was not subjected to temper rolling and that differences in stored energy were the main driving force for AGG...|$|R
40|$|Hot rolled low Si (silicon) non-grain {{oriented}} {{electrical steel}} was cold rolled to different reductions. Cold rolled material was subsequently recrystallized, 650 degreesC and 2 h, and then <b>temper</b> <b>rolled</b> (to 7 % reduction) {{for the final}} grain growth annealing and decarburization treatment at 850 degreesC for 2 - 24 h. The development of texture, grain size and magnetic properties were characterized {{at different stages of}} processing. Effect of texture on magnetic properties (watt loss and permeability) was observed to be best represented by the ratio of volume fractions of (I 1 1) /(0 0 1) fibers, as estimated by convoluting X-ray ODFs (orientation distribution functions) with respective model functions. Such a ratio was termed as generalized texture factor (if) for the non-grain oriented electrical steel. An effort was made to delink effects of grain size and texture, as represented by respective tf, on watt loss and permeability by careful analysis of experimental data. In general, low if and/or high grain size were responsible for low watt loss and high permeability. However, individual effect of grain size or if on magnetic properties was less significant at low tf or large grain size, respectively. An attempt was made to fit regression equations, namely-linear, exponential and power, relating magnetic properties with if and grain size, limiting the fitting parameters to 3. Least standard deviations, between experimental and predicted values, were obtained by power regression equations for both magnetic properties. (C) 2003...|$|R
40|$|Roll forming is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry to form High Strength Steel (HSS) and Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for structural components. Because of the large variety of applications of roll forming in the industry, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{is increasingly}} utilized for roll forming process design. Bending is the dominant deformation mode in roll forming and sheet materials used in the process are often <b>temper</b> <b>rolled</b> (skin passed), roller- or tension-levelled. These processes introduce residual stresses into the material, and {{recent studies have shown}} that those affect the material behaviour in bending. A thickness reduction rolling process available at Deakin that leads to material deformation similar to an industrial temper rolling operation was used in this study to introduce residual stresses into a dual phase, DP 780, steel strip. The initial and thickness reduced strips were then used in a 5 -stand experimental V-section roll forming set-up to identify the effect of residual stress on the final shape. The influence of residual stress and the effect of plastic deformation on the material behaviour in roll forming are separately determined in numerical simulation. The results show that the thickness reduction rolling process decreases the maximum bow height while the springback angle and end flare increase. Comparison with experimental results shows that using material data from the conventional tensile test in a numerical simulation does not allow for the accurate prediction of shape defects in a roll forming process if a residual stress profile exists in the material. On the other hand including the residual stress information leads to improved model accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Distribution of {{residual}} stress in hot rolled low carbon martensite high-strength steel strip {{was measured by}} means of blind-hole method in the steel before and after <b>tempering.</b> The hot <b>rolled</b> low carbon martensite high-strength steel strip was tempered at 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C or 600 °C. Before tempering, {{the value of the}} residual stress along the width direction is maximum at the edge, intermediate at the center, minimum at the 1 / 4 of the strip. The figure of the residual stress distribution along the width direction is like the shape of the letter “M”. Residual stress of the strip is reduced after tempering. When tempering at 450 °C or 500 °C, evolution {{of residual}} stress is caused by changes of thermal stress. Distribution of residual stress becomes gentle. With tempering temperature increasing, distribution of residual stress is reversed, because evolution of thermal stress and phase transition stress changes in different time...|$|R
