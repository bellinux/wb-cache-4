5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the evolution of the tetrapod limb from fins in lobe-finned fishes is related to expression of the HOXD13 gene or the loss of the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2, which are involved in fish fin development. Robot simulations suggest that the necessary nervous circuitry for walking evolved from the nerves governing swimming, utilizing the sideways oscillation of the body with the limbs primarily functioning as anchoring points and providing limited thrust. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> as well as changes to the pectoral girdle are similar to those seen in the fossil record can be induced in bichirs by raising then out of water.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{considered}} arboreal quadrupeds, {{with the most}} common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical clinging, and suspensory behavior, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving from tree to tree, ruffed lemurs will look over the shoulder while clinging, launch themselves into the air, and twist mid-air so that their ventral surface lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior {{is more common in}} ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, running with bounding hops and the tail held high.|$|E

25|$|Joints, {{especially}} synovial joints {{allow the}} body a tremendous range of movements. Each movement at a synovial joint {{results from the}} contraction or relaxation of the muscles that {{are attached to the}} bones {{on either side of the}} articulation. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> that can be produced at a synovial joint is determined by its structural type.|$|E
25|$|The {{working group}} 'Structure', led by Chieti University and coordinated by Chieti and Rome-III University, {{constructed}} a structural {{map of the}} Majella mountain. This structural framework is accompanied by five structural cross-sections of the anticline, which together {{provide an overview of}} the internal structure of the Majella mountain. The Working Group furthermore performed a systematic analysis of kinematic data collected on fault surfaces (indications for <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> and timing of the fault network). This resulted in a detailed framework for the deformation history of the Majella anticline, which shows the style of movement on various sets of faults and their relationships in time. In order to obtain a constraint on the type of stress field responsible for the deformations observed, a paleostress analysis using numerical inversion techniques was performed on the same kinematic data, and a palaeo-stress map was constructed.|$|E

For instance, ikkyō can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ura <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an omote-waza version). Specific aikido kata are typically referred to with the formula [...] "attack-technique(-modifier)". For instance, katate-dori ikkyō refers to any ikkyō technique executed when uke is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as katate-dori ikkyō omote, referring to any forward-moving ikkyō technique from that grab.|$|E

50|$|Amoeboid {{movement}} {{is the most}} common mode of locomotion in eukaryotic cells. It is a crawling-like <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> accomplished by protrusion of cytoplasm of the cell involving the formation of pseudopodia and posterior uropods. The cytoplasm slides and forms a pseudopodium in front to move the cell forward. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> has been linked to changes in action potential; the exact mechanism is still unknown. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> is observed in amoeboids, slime molds and some protozoans such as Naegleria gruberi, as well as some cells in humans such as leukocytes. Sarcomas, or cancers arising from connective tissue cells, are particularly adept at amoeboid movement, thus leading to their high rate of metastasis.|$|E
