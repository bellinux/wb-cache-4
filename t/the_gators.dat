5|$|Because {{of the hot}} autumn {{weather in}} Gainesville, <b>the</b> <b>Gators</b> had begun {{practicing}} at night. In a closely contested game, <b>the</b> <b>Gators</b> defeated coach Gus Tebell's North Carolina State Wolfpack 14–7 in Jacksonville, Florida, {{in front of an}} audience of 13,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gators</b> later {{drove to}} the 4-yard line before they were held on downs. After Dodd's punt to midfield, the Gators' {{engineered}} their final scoring drive. A 27-yard pass from Brumbaugh to Van Sickel got <b>the</b> <b>Gators</b> out of bounds at the 1-yard line. Crabtree ran it in for the touchdown, but Brumbaugh's place kick for the extra point was wide and short. Some sources, such as Peter Golenbock's Go Gators!, claim it was blocked.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} week, Florida crushed the {{mismatched}} Sewanee Tigers 71–6 in Jacksonville despite Sewanee's highly publicized aerial attack. Clyde Crabtree and Tommy Owens {{had to sit}} out with injuries. Goof Bowyer, Red Bethea, and Broward McClellan were seen as {{the stars of the}} game. <b>The</b> <b>Gators</b> played substitutes throughout the second half, putting the first stringers back in {{by the middle of the}} fourth quarter. Florida's center, Frank Clark, also drew praise for his play on the line. This score placed <b>the</b> <b>Gators</b> in first place for scoring within the Southern Conference, and still remains one of the seven highest single-game scoring totals in Gators team history.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 college {{football}} season, the Atlantic Coast Conference had an automatic bid to <b>the</b> <b>Gator</b> Bowl. By contract, <b>the</b> <b>Gator</b> Bowl Association—which produces the game—possessed {{the first pick}} of bowl-eligible ACC teams after {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game was given a spot in a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game. This was the final year that <b>the</b> <b>Gator</b> Bowl had first pick of eligible ACC teams, as contract renegotiations later resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Gator</b> Bowl slipping to the third selection, beginning with the 2006 {{college football}} season. Virginia Tech, losers of the 2005 ACC Championship Game, were chosen by <b>the</b> <b>Gator</b> Bowl Association to participate as the ACC's representative to <b>the</b> 2006 <b>Gator</b> Bowl.|$|R

5|$|After her {{freshman}} season, Andrews {{transferred to}} the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for coach Randy Reese's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition in 1982 and 1983. As a Gator, she was an eleven-time SEC champion, including the 50-yard backstroke (twice), 100-yard backstroke (twice), 200-yard backstroke, and six relays. She was a three-time NCAA champion (twice in the 400-yard medley relay, and once in the 200-yard medley relay), and received a total of eighteen All-American honors. <b>The</b> <b>Gators</b> won the 1982 NCAA women's team championship, and the Gators' winning 400-yard medley relay team of Andrews, Amy Caulkins, Michele Kurtzman and Kathy Treible set a new American national record {{in the event of}} 3:40.99. Andrews, together with teammates Kurtzman, Treible and Tracy Caulkins, won the NCAA 400-yard medley relay event again in 1983, and <b>the</b> <b>Gators</b> placed second overall at the NCAA championship tournament.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1928 Florida–Georgia game, Georgia fans trumpeted {{the return}} of center Ike Boland to bolster its defense. Florida's defense, however, {{rendered}} the Georgia Bulldogs' running game, including that of fullback Herdis McCrary, ineffective {{en route to a}} 26–6 victory. This was Florida's first victory over Georgia in seven match-ups and solidified <b>the</b> <b>Gators</b> as legitimate contenders for their first-ever conference title. Two Bulldogs' fumbles, and two Gators pass plays, accounted for Florida's four touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Clemson scored {{first on}} a 30-yard pass, leading 6–0 {{after the first}} quarter. From then on <b>the</b> <b>Gators</b> dominated, winning 27 to 6.

5|$|Florida {{honored the}} American {{alligator}} in 1987, but <b>the</b> <b>Gators</b> have titled the University of Florida's teams since 1911.

5|$|In {{what was}} the first meeting as {{opposing}} head coaches between Nick Saban and his former assistant coach from both LSU and the Miami Dolphins, Will Muschamp, the Crimson Tide defeated the Florida Gators, 38–10 at The Swamp.

Alabama's Marquis Maze then returned the ensuing kickoff 70-yards to the Florida 29-yard line and the Crimson Tide tied the game at 10–10 seven plays later on a five-yard Trent Richardson touchdown run.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps Cody's finest {{moment as}} the Gators' head coach was the 7–0 upset of coach Frank Leahy's then-undefeated, second-ranked Boston College Eagles at Fenway Park {{in his final}} season.

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, one person is chosen to be <b>the</b> first <b>Gator,</b> and treads water {{on one side of the}} playing area. The remaining players stand on the pool deck on the side opposite <b>the</b> <b>Gator.</b> These players are prohibited to enter the water until <b>the</b> <b>Gator</b> says <b>the</b> word [...] "gator". Once the word has been said, the players are free to enter the water whenever they wish. Once they enter the water, they must swim to the other side. If <b>the</b> <b>Gator</b> touches (more commonly [...] "tags") any part of the player's body before he touches the other side, he is caught. After all players have crossed to the other side safely or have been caught by <b>the</b> <b>Gator,</b> <b>the</b> round is over. The free players get out of the water and <b>the</b> <b>Gator</b> and whomever he caught swim to the opposite side of the playing area. The caught players become <b>Gators</b> for <b>the</b> next round. In this way, the game gets progressively harder for the players, who have to face increasing numbers of <b>Gators.</b> Then <b>the</b> next round begins.|$|R
5|$|Alabama {{extended}} their lead to 24–10 at halftime {{with a pair}} of second-quarter touchdowns.
