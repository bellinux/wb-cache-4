5|$|In the 1933 film, {{directors}} Cooper and Schoedsack {{appear in}} cameos as {{the pilot and}} rear-gunner who shoot Kong during the film's climax atop <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building.</b> In the 2005 film, Jackson plays one of the gunners.|$|E
5|$|These {{top stories}} are very narrow with low, sloped ceilings, and are useful only for holding {{radio-broadcasting}} and other mechanical and electrical equipment. Television station WCBS-TV (Channel 2) originally transmitted {{from the top}} of the Chrysler starting in 1938. The installation continued through the early 1950s, when it moved to <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> due to competition from RCA's transmitter at the latter tower. For many years, WPAT-FM and WTFM (now WKTU) also used the Chrysler Building as a transmission site, but they also moved to <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> by the 1970s. Since then, there have not been any commercial broadcast stations located at the Chrysler Building.|$|E
5|$|Chrysler {{realized}} that his tower's height would exceed <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> as well, having ordered Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to the narrow steel spire. However, <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State's</b> developer John J. Raskob reviewed the plans and {{realized that}} he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building, and subsequently acquired the nearby plots needed to support that building's height extension. Two days later, <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> co-developer, former Governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.|$|R

Nonetheless, Barclay {{recalled}} the staff often having cocktails together at Longchamps, <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> ground-floor restaurant, and found Timely [...] "a pleasant place to work".|$|R
5000|$|In the Looney Tunes cartoon [...] "Much Ado About Nutting", a {{squirrel}} {{has so much}} difficulty opening a coconut he carries it to <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> observation deck and tosses it over the edge. While the street is damaged by the impact, the coconut remains intact.|$|R

The courier looks back while leaving with the vials, to see that Dr. Vargas has vanished.|$|E
5|$|When {{early in}} the film {{newspaper}} clippings {{from around the globe}} are shown, in the Japanese newspaper the iconic silhouette of Godzilla is clearly visible. Similarly, during the New York sequence when Sky Captain deploys a bomb to stop a giant robot, the shape of King Kong can be seen on <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> in the background.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{panelling}} from {{a room in}} the Crown & Treaty {{public house}} was sold in 1924 to an American businessman, who installed it in his office in <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> in New York. It was returned in 1953 as a gift to the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II and returned to the house, although the monarch retained ownership.|$|E
50|$|The new 81-story building, when completed, {{will have}} a total height of 1340 ft. In comparison, <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> roof at <b>the</b> 102nd floor is 1250 ft tall, 1454 ft with its antenna, and the {{original}} 2 World Trade Center (referred to as the South Tower) was 1362 ft.|$|R

5|$|Benchley's return yielded {{two more}} short films, and his {{high-profile}} prompted negotiations for sponsorship of a Benchley radio program and numerous appearances on television shows, {{including the first}} television entertainment program ever broadcast, an untitled test program using an experimental antenna on <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building.</b> The radio program, Melody and Madness, was more a showcase for Benchley's acting, as he {{did not participate in}} writing it. It was not well received, and was removed from the schedule.|$|E
5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries {{and a more}} traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|Promotions for the DVD release {{occurred}} {{across the}} United States. <b>The</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> was illuminated yellow, {{the first time}} the building had ever been used as part of a film promotion.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> opening {{coincided with}} the Great Depression in the United States, {{and as a result}} much of its office space was vacant. In the first year, 23% of the {{available}} space was rented; by contrast, during the 1920s, the average building would be 52% rented upon opening and 90% rented within five years. The lack of renters led New Yorkers to deride the building as the [...] "Empty State Building".|$|R
5000|$|Another {{high-profile}} {{project for}} a large-scale building Juengling {{was involved in}} was being on the design team {{for the release of}} <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building's</b> new lighting as of 2012.

5|$|The {{temperature}} of {{a lightning bolt}} can be five times hotter than {{the surface of the}} sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot, some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E

Gem Razors also created thousands of free Voice-O-Graph records during wartime for the troops to send home to their families.|$|R

The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s.

Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days. Carney chose to film in Manhattan's lesser known neighborhoods {{that would be more}} recognizable to locals than tourists. Specific locations included Greenwich Village, the East Village, Times Square, and Washington Square Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors sang to pre-recorded tracks. In order to save money on hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late at night with a handheld camera. The rooftop location near <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E

By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of <b>the</b> <b>Empire</b> <b>State</b> <b>Building</b> and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.|$|E
