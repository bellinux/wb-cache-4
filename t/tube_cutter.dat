50|$|It {{is a good}} {{practice}} to:Install a plug {{that is the same}} as or a compatible material to the tube and tube sheet. Puncture the leaky tube using a one revolution <b>tube</b> <b>cutter</b> to relieve back pressure. Some contractors weld the tube plugs to the tube sheet after they are installed to permanently secure the plugs in place.|$|E
50|$|Tube Cutters- Tube Cutters {{are used}} to {{internally}} cut from the inside {{to the outside of}} the tube behind the tube sheet on one end. This lessens the force required to pull a tube. To eliminate tube cutting chips in the vessel, tubes should be scored and not totally cut through. The <b>tube</b> <b>cutter</b> needs to have sufficient reach to cut behind the tube sheet. Proper lubrication and cutting speed will increase cutting blade life.|$|E

25|$|The company I. G. Farben began {{manufacturing}} polystyrene in Ludwigshafen, about 1931, {{hoping it}} would be a suitable replacement for die-cast zinc in many applications. Success was achieved when they developed a reactor vessel that extruded polystyrene through a heated <b>tube</b> and <b>cutter,</b> producing polystyrene in pellet form.|$|R
50|$|Annular cutters {{can also}} be best used to make holes in pipes and <b>tubes.</b> Annular <b>cutters</b> help make holes in pipe and tubes without {{dimpling}} and deburring. Unlike the conventional method of bringing the workpiece to machine, {{with the help of}} portable magnetic core drilling machines, you can now bring the machine to the workpiece. This makes the drilling process on tubes very easy.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the sliding {{compound}} miter saw was introduced which combined all the best features of the {{compound miter saw}} with sliding <b>tubes</b> allowing the <b>cutter</b> head to traverse for a much wider cut. Since then {{it has become the}} primary cross cut saw for woodworking, largely supplanting the radial arm saw.Manufacturers warn of possible electrocution when used near water or other related saws in a close proximity.|$|R
50|$|Remedial {{measures}} for impingement attack include {{modifications to the}} system to reduce the average water velocity, e.g. by using larger diameter tubes or, if appropriate, to lower the pump speed, and/or to redesign {{the part of the}} installation concerned to eliminate the cause of local turbulence, e.g. by using slow or swept bends and tee fittings rather than elbows and square tees. It is important to minimise the possibility of any local turbulence occurring by ensuring that the ends of tubes cut with a <b>tube</b> <b>cutter</b> are deburred and that the tubes are inserted fully to the stops in the fitting before the joints are made, as referred to earlier in this section. In some cases, where the above approaches are not possible, the length of copper tube affected can sometimes be replaced by materials more resistant to corrosion-erosion, e.g. 90/10 copper-nickel (BS Designation CN102) using appropriate fittings, or stainless steel to BS 4127:1994.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unusual}} for the general water {{velocity}} in a system to be so high that impingement attack occurs throughout {{the whole of the}} copper pipework. More commonly, the velocity is just sufficiently low for satisfactory protective films to be formed and to remain in position on most of the system, with impingement damage more likely to occur where there is an abrupt change in the direction of water flow giving rise to a high degree of turbulence, such as at tee pieces and elbow fittings. It is not generally realised how great an effect small obstructions can have on the flow pattern of water in a pipe-work system {{and the extent to which}} they can induce turbulence and cause corrosion-erosion. For example, it is most important, as far as possible, to ensure that copper tubes cut with a <b>tube</b> <b>cutter</b> are deburred before making the joint. Also a gap between the tube end and the stop in the fitting, due to the tube not having been cut to the correct length and fully inserted into the socket of the fitting, can also induce turbulence in the water stream.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} in the art that metal tubes used in heat {{transfer}} devices are susceptible to wear, erosion and other degradations which may create weaknesses or other potential failure points. One typical prior art method to determine the cause of damage to a tube involves making a circumferential cut on the tube wall and removing the entire section of the tube having a damaged portion thereon. This method is useful where a straight length portion of the tube has been affected. However, access to more constricted areas and removal of relatively large sections of tubing is limited where the cutting procedure is performed from the interior of the tube. A <b>tube</b> <b>cutter</b> tool is insertable into a tube for cutting a coupon from a damaged site on the exterior of the tube. Prior to using the tool, the damaged site is first located from the interior of the tube using a multi-coil pancake eddy current test probe. The damage site is then marked. A fiber optic probe is used to monitor the subsequent cutting procedure which is performed using a hole saw mounted on the <b>tube</b> <b>cutter</b> tool. Prior to completion of the cutting procedure, a drill {{in the center of the}} hole saw is drilled into the coupon to hold it in place...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} goal of {{this project}} was to complete the design and building of a disc brake energy conversion project started by a former senior project team, and then spend {{a majority of the}} year performing testing in order to see if the device could be used to accurately calculate the Joule 2 ̆ 7 s constant. However, due to unforeseen complications and obstacles, the design and manufacturing portion of the project ended up taking much longer than anticipated. A majority of this time was spent designing the hydraulic plumbing system that would actuate the brakes. The previous team purchased some hydraulic parts and left them unassembled with no hydraulic schematic, and in order to save money, one of our goals was to use as many of the previous team 2 ̆ 7 s purchased parts as possible. This led to us attempting to complete their hydraulic design using the few parts they had left behind. However, after some time we discovered that the parts they had purchased would not work with the system we were trying to create. After discussion with multiple professors and shop techs, we discovered a hydraulic schematic created by W. C. Branham that would be perfect for our device. After making a few changes to the design, we were able to start manufacturing the hydraulic system using hand-held tube benders and <b>tube</b> <b>cutters.</b> Once the tubing was assembled, we bled the air out of the hydraulic portion of the system and filled it with hydraulic fluid. Then, in order to measure the temperature of the thermistor in the copper brake pads, we programmed an Arduino read the thermistor and collect data. This left us with only three weeks to test; however, through our testing and analysis, we were able to calculate a Joule 2 ̆ 7 s constant within 35...|$|R
50|$|The {{head tube}} of a bicycle is {{sometimes}} {{designated by the}} fork steerer column it accepts. This can lead to confusion, since head tube inside diameters are dependent on the headset standard. For example, frames that take one inch (25.4 mm) steerer columns can have three different inside diameters for threaded and threadless headsets (not including integrated-type headsets). The wide variety of integrated and non-standard, proprietary headsets that some frame manufacturers have created (and abandoned in some cases) makes listing all current and past head tube dimensions problematic. The following table includes the most common sizes; nominal head tube diameters are assuming a 0.1-0.2 mm interference fit, which is what most head <b>tube</b> reaming <b>cutters</b> are designed to bore. Adequate press fits are typically between 0.1 and 0.25 mm of interference.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} {{model for the}} steady-state axial cutting of circular <b>tubes</b> by a <b>cutter</b> with multiple blunt blades and without/with {{the presence of a}} curved surface profile deflector was developed. Experimental observations have indicated that there exist six different dissipation mechanisms. These include the outward bending of cut sidewalls, the formation of cylindrical flaps in the transient and stable cutting regions, circumferential membrane stretching, chip formation and friction. In the {{analytical model}} development, rigid-perfectly plastic material behaviour obeying the von Mises yield criterion was employed to determine the steady-state stresses and fully plastic bending moments for each deformation zone which were assumed to be uncoupled to each other. The effect of the friction force was included to the proposed solution and the total axial cutting force was determined through use of the principle of virtual power. The proposed analytical model was validated by comparing the predicted cutting force to experimental data and the effects of tube wall thickness, number of cutter blades, and extrusion diameter were investigated. A good correlation was found between the theoretical predictions and experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{situation}} is the straight <b>tube</b> <b>cutter,</b> that provides Luvata’s line of large recoolers with copper tubes, manually operated. To prevent damages and facilitate mounting the tubes must be properly arranged when they leave the machine. This report aims to investigate and present an automated solution where the operator {{does not need to}} participate in the process. A number of theories have been drawn up and tests have been done. The results show that the in principle best solution is to have a leaning carrier that’s automatically height-adjusted by two lift tables underneath. The height adjustment keeps a constant distance between the top tube layer and rollover protection bars on the machine. That is done to allow the carrier to have a high enough angle to ensure that the tubes roll down even if they aren’t completely straight, but without rolling over the previous tubes. To evaluate the solutions Ulrich and Eppingers method for Concept scoring was used. This method means that the various solutions are scored and weighted based on a number of criteria’s, and the output is measurable results...|$|E
