5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended {{to report a}} ratio of around five Japanese killed for every one Australian, with the Australians estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated <b>the</b> <b>casualties</b> they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that <b>the</b> <b>casualties</b> were more even, although still favouring the Australians. For the Australians, casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the Japanese {{are thought to have}} lost 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>casualties</b> at Fort Donelson were heavy, {{primarily}} because of the large Confederate surrender. Union losses were 2,691 (507 killed, 1,976 wounded, 208 captured/missing), Confederate 13,846 (327 killed, 1,127 wounded, 12,392 captured/missing).|$|E

50|$|In the {{technique}} taught by BSAC, the rescuer faces <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> and uses <b>the</b> <b>casualty's</b> buoyancy compensator to provide buoyancy for both divers as the rescuer makes a controlled ascent. If <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> is not breathing, the ascent will be urgent. If the two divers separate during the ascent, {{the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>casualty's</b> buoyancy is intended as a failsafe causing <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> to continue to the surface where there is air and other rescuers can help.|$|R

5|$|During June and July 1945 the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade saw combat against Australian {{forces in}} the Borneo Campaign. Its units were greatly under-strength at this time due to <b>the</b> <b>casualties</b> {{suffered}} while moving across Borneo, and the elements which engaged Australian forces were rapidly defeated. The remainder of the brigade withdrew into central Borneo, and surrendered to the Australians {{following the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, concerted {{efforts were}} made by the Luftwaffe to destroy the main {{manufacturing}} plants at Woolston and Itchen, near Southampton. The first bombing raid, which missed the factories, came on 23 August 1940. Over the next month, other raids were mounted until, on 26 September 1940, both factories were destroyed, with 92 people killed and a large number injured. Most of <b>the</b> <b>casualties</b> were experienced aircraft production workers.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> is {{not capable}} of making an ascent, due to injury or unconsciousness, or <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> cannot make a safe and {{controlled}} ascent, perhaps due to the loss or damage of the diving mask, the rescuer must control <b>the</b> <b>casualty's</b> ascent. This may be done by using the Controlled buoyant lift. As <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> is totally dependent on the rescuer, it is important if the two were to separate underwater <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> should continue to ascend to the surface in a failsafe way.|$|R

5|$|Following Deadstick, the engineers, glider {{pilots and}} 'B' Company men were {{returned}} to their parent formations. 'D' Company played their part in the 6th Airborne Division's defence of the Orne bridgehead, and advance to the River Seine. On 5 September, when the division was withdrawn to England, {{all that remained of}} the company were 40 men under the only remaining officer, Howard; the other officers, sergeants, and most of the junior NCOs having been among <b>the</b> <b>casualties.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of , Duke (Channing Tatum) has become {{the leader of the}} G.I. Joe unit, which is framed for {{stealing}} nuclear warheads from Pakistan by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce). The unit is subsequently eliminated in a military air strike with Duke as one of <b>the</b> <b>casualties.</b> The only survivors are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki).|$|E
5|$|HMS Glasgow {{suffered}} one {{killed and}} three wounded, a low number which some {{consider to be}} evidence of poor quality in the Continental fleet's gunnery; all of <b>the</b> <b>casualties</b> were due to musket fire. Four were killed and seven wounded aboard Cabot; USS Alfred had six killed and six wounded, and Andrew Dorias drummer was wounded.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> {{is found}} seated but a spine trauma is {{suspected}} (e.g. <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> sat upright after an accident, or fellin this position). In this case, <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> must be transported lying; a long spine board is put against his/hers back {{to support it}} while he/she is laid down. When <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> is on a chair, then the board is slid between the back of <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> and <b>the</b> back of the chair, and the chair is laid down; {{the use of an}} extrication splint (KED) is particularly interesting in this context.|$|R
50|$|At {{the order}} of <b>the</b> chief, <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> is lifted {{and put on the}} lifted knees of the first responders. Then, <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> is {{flattened}} against the chests, and the first responders stand up. They move towards the stretcher; there, they put one knee on the ground (the closest to <b>the</b> <b>casualty's</b> feet), lay <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> on his/her back, and move <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> from their knees to the stretcher. For this last movement, additional first responders can be placed at {{the opposite side of the}} stretcher to help the landing.|$|R
5|$|In 1949, the Japanese Economic Stabilization Agency {{calculated}} that the Allied naval bombardments {{and other forms of}} attack other than bombing had caused 3,282 casualties, representing 0.5 percent of all casualties inflicted by the Allies in the Japanese home islands. <b>The</b> <b>casualties</b> attributed to naval bombardments and other causes included 1,739 fatalities, 46 persons who were still classified as missing and 1,497 people who were wounded.|$|E
5|$|In a court hearing, Vaseegaran is {{sentenced to}} death for <b>the</b> <b>casualties</b> and damages caused by the robot army, but Chitti {{explains}} that it was Bohra who caused its deviant behaviour and shows the court video footage of Bohra installing the red chip. The court releases Vaseegaran, while ordering that Chitti be dismantled. Left with no choice, Vaseegaran asks Chitti to dismantle itself. While saying goodbye, Chitti apologises to Vaseegaran and Sana before dismantling itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} <b>the</b> <b>casualties</b> to his brigade, Porter decided {{to isolate the}} Pocket with two infantry companies while a heavy artillery barrage was fired into the area over several days. An attempt to capture the Pocket would only be made once it was judged that the Japanese were no longer capable of resisting effectively. As part of this plan, the 2/12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons of shells into the Pocket between 15 and 20 June.|$|E
50|$|The method with a {{flexible}} stretcher {{was inspired by}} the method used to change the sheets of an impotent patient at the hospital. The flexible stretcher is placed beside <b>the</b> <b>casualty,</b> and a sheet is put on it. The third of the stretcher that is the closest to <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> is folded on the middle third. <b>The</b> <b>casualty</b> is first rolled away from the stretcher, and the stretcher is slid against the back of <b>the</b> <b>casualty.</b> Then <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> is put on his/her back and rolled on the other side; the stretcher and the sheet are unfolded. <b>The</b> <b>casualty</b> is wrapped into the sheet, and can be lifted with the handles of the flexible stretcher.|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} method of lifting <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> using a rope is {{to pass the}} rope under an arm, around the back and under the other arm. <b>The</b> <b>casualty</b> is lifted vertically. There is a risk of spine damage by bending if <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> is positioned {{with his or her}} back to the vertical surface and the rescuers pull <b>the</b> <b>casualty's</b> shoulders in board before lifting {{the lower end of the}} torso over top of the vertical surface.|$|R
5|$|Salah {{planned to}} attempt another attack against Budapest on October 8, and al-Mezahi, whose {{battalion}} would {{carry out the}} second attempt, took the necessary preparations. The attack was canceled however, due to heavy Israeli aerial attacks against Port Said throughout the night of October 7/8. The Sa'iqa company continued to hold its positions east of Budapest for four days, until Salah decided to withdraw it due to <b>the</b> <b>casualties</b> it had sustained.|$|E
5|$|Ship – Ships {{can be used}} as {{hospital}} ships, mostly {{operated by}} national military services, although some ships are operated by charities. They can meet the definition of ambulances as they provide transport to the sick and wounded (along with treatment). They are often sent to disaster or war zones to provide care for <b>the</b> <b>casualties</b> of these events.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle for}} Montbrehain raged until 20:00 that night, {{during which time}} the line had been linked up and consolidated. <b>The</b> <b>casualties</b> of the 24th Battalion had been so high that two {{companies}} of the 27th Battalion had to be attached for support; the 24th Battalion left the frontline {{for the last time}} on 6 October.|$|E
50|$|Now rarely used, but {{for many}} years {{the only way to}} move a {{disabled}} vehicle without using a low loader or trailer. Chains were attached, usually around <b>the</b> <b>casualty's</b> suspension, and some form of packing (often a seat squab or tyre) was inserted between the lifting frame and <b>the</b> <b>casualty.</b> This frame was lifted by means of a pulley until <b>the</b> <b>casualty’s</b> wheels were clear of the ground. An 'A' frame was normally used to keep <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> from running into the tow vehicle on braking.|$|R
50|$|Rope rescue {{methods are}} to recover {{casualties}} who have fallen or are stuck on cliffs.
