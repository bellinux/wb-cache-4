5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as <b>the</b> <b>textile</b> industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent {{as it did in the}} rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in <b>the</b> <b>textile</b> industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. <b>The</b> <b>textile</b> industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E

50|$|The Nazca {{are also}} known for their {{technically}} complex <b>textiles.</b> <b>The</b> <b>textiles</b> were most likely woven by women at habitation sites from spun cotton and wool. <b>The</b> <b>textiles</b> would have been made using a backstrap loom. This is similar to <b>the</b> way <b>textiles</b> are made in <b>the</b> region today. <b>Textiles</b> were woven with the common motifs earlier than they appeared painted on pottery.

5|$|Faisalabad is {{recognised}} as {{the centre}} of <b>the</b> <b>textile</b> industry in Pakistan, contributing to half of Pakistans total textile shipments. At the end of June 2012, textile mills employed 20% of the nation's workforce, and generated 1.3trillion rupees ($13.8billion) in textile products, {{most of which were}} exported to the US and Europe. While Punjab's economy is driven primarily by agriculture, <b>the</b> <b>textile</b> industry along with leather products and light engineering goods play an important role, with more than 48,000 industrial units spread across Punjab. In an effort to boost bilateral trade, Romania and Turkey have honorary-consulates in Faisalabad which enable trade links with the city.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. With increasing attention on segmentation, more and more bases for segmenting markets have been suggested {{in the past few}} decades. However, no studies on segmentation issues in <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> industry have been found. This study explored the segmentation strategies and bases used in <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> industry by collecting data using an empirical survey of <b>the</b> UK <b>textiles</b> industry. This empirical study also investigated confusing issues affecting successful implementation of a segmentation strategy in <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> industry so that it can provide guidelines and a framework for marketing practitioners and for future research.

5|$|Lurgan has {{historically}} been an industrial town in which the linen industry predominated {{as a source of}} employment during the Industrial Revolution, and is said to have employed as many as 18,000 handloom weavers {{at the end of the}} 19th century, a figure significantly higher than the town's resident population at the time. That particular branch of <b>the</b> <b>textile</b> industry declined as consumer tastes changed, but other textiles continued to be produced in the town providing a major source of employment until the 1990s and 2000s when <b>the</b> <b>textile</b> industry across the UK suffered a major decline as a result of outsourcing to low wage countries.|$|E

40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> {{production}} industry it is {{more and}} more common to advertise new textiles, especially for sportswear, by claiming their ability to emit IR radiation in the long wave band at a higher degree with respect to normal clothes, that is highly beneficial to improve sporting performances. Three textiles are compared, one normal and two “special,” with Ag+ ions and carbon powder added, with different colors. The emissivity of <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> has been measured to determine if it is increased in <b>the</b> “special” <b>textiles</b> with respect to the normal one. No substantial increase has been noticed. Nonetheless, the test implied some nonstandard procedures due to the semitransparent nature of <b>the</b> <b>textiles,</b> in comparison with the normal procedure that is commonly used on opaque surfaces...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the economic impact of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> and apparel industry in Kenya and South Africa, and answers three consecutive questions. First, has AGOA been successful in reinforcing Kenya and South Africa’s reform efforts? Second, has AGOA been successful in facilitating the integration of Kenya and South Africa’s economy into the global economy? Finally, has AGOA been successful in promoting employment and poverty reduction in Kenya and South Africa? Using <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> and apparel industry of the two countries as a case study, it was realised that AGOA has achieved much success in contributing to the reformation and integration of the economy of Kenya and South Africa into the global economy. However, it was found that AGOA’s success in promoting poverty reduction through economic activities such as trade, investment and employment in the two countries has been mixed. While AGOA has contributed positively to the promotion of economic activities in <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> and apparel industry in Kenya, the economic problems facing <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> and apparel industry in South Africa has been exacerbated by AGOA. This study is important because it draws attention to the economic achievements of AGOA in <b>the</b> <b>textiles</b> and apparel industry in Kenya and South Africa...|$|R
5|$|In 1821, Francis C. Lowell's {{business}} associates, {{looking to}} expand the Waltham textile operations, purchased land around the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack River in East Chelmsford.

5|$|In 1825, Talbot {{joined a}} weaving firm {{established}} by {{his older brother}} Charles in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, where he was first employed as a carder and finisher, and quickly rose to become superintendent. His brother moved to Lowell in 1838, selling the Williamsburg mill, and began processing dyewoods in rented space at a local mill, while Thomas remained in western Massachusetts, working in area mills and continuing his education at an academy in Cummington. In 1840, the two brothers established C.P. Talbot & Co., a business partnership that lasted until Charles died in 1884. The business started out processing dyewoods for use in <b>the</b> <b>textile</b> industry, but expanded into other industrial chemical processing in 1849. The brothers acquired the Concord River water rights of the defunct Middlesex Canal Corporation in 1851, and in 1857 they established Talbot Mills in North Billerica, Massachusetts, {{in partnership with the}} Belvidere Mill Company. The business was successful, and the brothers acquired full control of that business in 1862. Thomas focused on <b>the</b> <b>textile</b> business while Charles continued to manage the dye and chemical interests, expanding the facilities in 1870 and again in 1880.|$|E
