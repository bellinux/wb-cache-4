50|$|Conjoined {{twins are}} at high risk to being {{stillborn}} or dying shortly after birth. In some cases, a healthy twin and a parasitic twin are born. The parasitic twin has no hope for survival and dies and is then surgically separated from its twin. Depending upon how the twins are attached and what is shared among them, complications can arise from surgically separating the live twin from the dead twin. In Ischiopagus cases, the children share a pelvic region along with the gastrointestinal tract and genital region. Most Ischiopagus <b>twins</b> <b>will</b> need reconstruction surgery of the genitals and the gastrointestinal tract tract so that the <b>twin</b> <b>will</b> be able to perform normal bodily functions.|$|R

30|$|The {{results also}} {{allow us to}} assess any {{involvement}} of genetic differences between MZ twins {{in the development of}} schizophrenia using a threshold model [18]. It assumes that both members of the monozygotic discordant MZD <b>twins</b> <b>will</b> carry family specific genetic predisposition for the disease and rare ontogenetic additional changes in the affected <b>twin</b> <b>will</b> add to the predisposition that will be sufficient for the onset of the disease. This model is testable given near complete coverage of genetic changes in the affected as well as unaffected members of the two MZD twin pairs. It begins with development of a list of all genes that are affected by a variety of mutational mechanisms in four members of the two MZD twin pairs. This list is rather comprehensive and includes all variants, some validated and others not validated. We have used this list to assess the effect of these differences using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). It moves the analysis from a focus on affected genes to affected pathways.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{doctoral}} thesis, prime <b>twins</b> <b>will</b> be investigated. Prime twins are, {{in the narrow}} sense, pairs of prime numbers with a constant difference 2, i. e. (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13) and so forth. It is an unsolved problem, if there are infinitely many prime twins or not. However, using heuristical arguments, in 1923 Hardy and Littlewood discovered a conjecture {{on the distribution of}} prime twins, which implies the infinity of the set of prime twins. Hardy and Littlewood arrived at their conjecture by applying their circle method, which later led to the solution of the famous ternary Goldbach problem. No one was able to prove the Hardy-Littlewood-Conjecture, but at least weaker results on generalized prime twins, so-called almost-all-results, were derived by employing the circle method. In the second chapter, {{the most important part of}} the doctoral thesis, such almost-all-results will be proven in a principle new manner avoiding the circle method. The method used here is based on a recent approach to the prime twins problem, which was developed in 1982 by Pan Chengdong. Further, deep theorems of analytic number theory on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions will be applied. In the first chapter, Pan Chengdong's original result on prime <b>twins</b> <b>will</b> be improved by utilizing estimations for Kloosterman sums. Hua's similar result on prime <b>twins</b> <b>will</b> be generalized in the third chapter for pairs of natural numbers with a bounded number of prime factors. This generalization leads to an asymptotic conjecture on the distribution of such pairs, which contains the above-mentioned Hardy-Littlewood-Conjecture for prime twins as a special case. </DIV...|$|R

For instance genes affecting voting behavior would have no effect in females if females are excluded from the vote. More generally, the logic of sex-difference testing can extend to any defined sub-group of individuals. In cases such as these, the correlation for same and opposite sex DZ <b>twins</b> <b>will</b> differ, betraying the effect of the sex difference.|$|R

50|$|One {{research}} design used in behavioural genetic research are variations on family designs (also known as pedigree designs), including twin studies and adoption studies. Quantitative genetic modelling {{of individuals with}} known genetic relationships (e.g., parent-child, sibling, dizygotic and monozygotic twins) allows one to estimate to what extent genes and environment contribute to phenotypic differences among individuals. The basic intuition of the twin study is that monozygotic twins share 100% of their genome and dizygotic twins share, on average, 50% of their segregating genome. Thus, {{differences between the two}} members of a monozygotic twin pair can only be due to differences in their environment, whereas dizygotic <b>twins</b> <b>will</b> differ from one another due to environment as well as genes. Under this simplistic model, if dizygotic twins differ more than monozygotic twins it can only be attributable to genetic influences. An important assumption of the twin model is the equal environment assumption that monozygotic twins have the same shared environmental experiences as dizygotic twins. If, for example, monozygotic twins tend to have more similar experiences than dizygotic twins—and these experiences themselves are not genetically mediated through gene-environment correlation mechanisms—then monozygotic <b>twins</b> <b>will</b> tend to be more similar to one another than dizygotic twins for reasons {{that have nothing to do}} with genes.|$|R
