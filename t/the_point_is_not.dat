25|$|The {{good deed}} {{is a key}} {{component}} of the law and promise. Baden-Powell felt this is the main duty God asks for, and fulfilling our duty to others makes us happy, which fulfills the duty to ourselves. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> so much the deed itself, which could be minor, but to teach the Scout to always pay attention and recognise if he could help someone.|$|E
25|$|In {{relation}} to this interpretation, William Empson suggests that Katherina was originally performed {{by an adult}} male actor rather than a young boy. He argues that the play indicates on several occasions that Katherina is physically strong, and even capable of over-powering Petruchio. For example, this is demonstrated off-stage when the horse falls on her as she is riding to Petruchio's home, and {{she is able to}} lift it off herself, and later when she throws Petruchio off a servant he is beating. Empson argues that <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> that Katherina is, as a woman, weak, but that she is not well cast in the role in life which she finds herself having to play. The end of the play then offers blatant irony when a strong male actor, dressed as a woman, lectures women on how to play their parts.|$|E
500|$|Valve {{does not}} release any sales figures for its Steam service; it only {{provides}} {{the data to}} companies with games on Steam, which they cannot release without permission because of a non-disclosure agreement with Valve. However, Stardock, the previous owner of competing platform Impulse, estimated that as of 2009, Steam had a 70% share of the digital distribution market for video games. In early 2011, Forbes reported that Steam sales constituted 50–70% of the [...] market for downloaded PC games and that Steam offered game producers gross margins of 70% of purchase price, compared with 30% at retail. Steam's success has led to some criticism because of its support of DRM and for being an effective monopoly. Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman commented on the issue following the announcement that Steam would come to Linux; he said that while he supposes that its release can boost GNU/Linux adoption leaving users better off than with Microsoft Windows, he stressed that he sees nothing wrong with commercial software but {{that the problem is}} that Steam is unethical for not being free software and that its inclusion in GNU/Linux distributions teaches the users that <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> freedom and thus works against the software freedom that is his goal.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2004, Kalle Lasn, {{author of}} [...] "Culture Jam" [...] {{and founder of}} Adbusters, two {{influential}} and widely read anti-globalization texts, generated controversy when he wrote an editorial entitled [...] "Why won't anyone say they are Jewish?". In it he stated [...] "Drawing attention to the Jewishness of the neocons is a tricky game. Anyone who does so can count on automatically being smeared as an anti-Semite. But <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> that Jews (who make up less than 2 percent of the American population) have a monolithic perspective. Indeed, American Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat {{and many of them}} disagree strongly with Ariel Sharon’s policies and Bush’s aggression in Iraq. The point is simply that the neocons seem to have a special affinity for Israel that influences their political thinking and consequently American foreign policy in the Middle East." [...] The editorial suggested that Jews represent a disproportionately high percentage of the neo-conservatives who control American foreign policy, and that this may affect policy with respect to Israel. Lasn included a list of influential neo-conservatives, with dots next to the names of those who were Jewish.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} The Future of Freedom, {{journalist}} and author Fareed Zakaria argued that the Guggenheim's motorcycle exhibition, and other populist shows, were indicative of the downfall of American civilization in general, due to the undermining of traditional centers of authority and intellectual leadership. [...] Zakaria writes that Thomas Krens' [...] "gimmicks are flamboyant and often upstage the art itself," [...] and that <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to get the public {{to look at the}} art anyway, but only to get them into the museum. [...] While not rejecting that modern and commercial work should be included in modern art shows, Zakaria says, with The New Republic's Jed Perl, that the show fails to [...] "define a style or period" [...] and instead merely parrots current taste, giving the public validation. [...] Due to the overly dependent relationship with BMW, the show is driven by non-aesthetic criteria, and is too politically correct and uncontroversial. [...] Zakaria goes on to point out that, indeed, the Guggenheim gave up plans for a show [...] "Picasso and the Age of Iron" [...] because it was too old-fashioned to attract a sponsor, and that BMW turned down a request to sponsor a show [...] "Masterworks from Munich" [...] because Munich isn't sexy.|$|E
2500|$|Editors Bryant and Springer suggest {{perception}} {{is a central}} theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: [...] "All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks" [...] — and Ahab is determined to [...] "strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall" [...] (Ch. 36, [...] "The Quarter-Deck"). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in [...] "The Doubloon" [...] (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab [...] "discover no sign" [...] (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. In the British edition, Melville changed the word [...] "discover" [...] to [...] "perceive", and with good reason, for [...] "discovery" [...] means finding what is already there, but [...] "perceiving", or better still, perception, is [...] "a matter of shaping what exists by {{the way in which}} we see it". <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making.|$|E

2500|$|The Sudanese Möbius {{band in the}} three-sphere S3 is geometrically a {{fibre bundle}} over a great circle, whose fibres are great semicircles. [...] The most {{symmetrical}} image of a stereographic projection of this band into R3 is obtained by using a projection point that lies on that great circle {{that runs through the}} midpoint of each of the semicircles. Each choice of such a projection point results in an image that is congruent to any other. But because such a projection point lies on the Möbius band itself, two aspects of the image are significantly different from the case (illustrated above) where <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> on the band: 1) the image in R3 is not the full Möbius band, but rather the band with one point removed (from its centerline); and 2) the image is unbounded – and as it gets increasingly far from the origin of R3, it increasingly approximates a plane. [...] Yet this version of the stereographic image has a group of 4 symmetries in R3 (it is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group), as compared with the bounded version illustrated above having its group of symmetries the unique group of order 2. (If all symmetries and not just orientation-preserving isometries of R3 are allowed, the numbers of symmetries in each case doubles.) ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{the session}} notes and date {{attribution}} in the 1995 compilation The Beatles Anthology 1 are correct, a faster-tempo version sans harmonica was recorded at Abbey Road on 11 September, the only session in which session drummer Andy White was present. The up-tempo track, No. 24 on Anthology 1, {{was believed to}} have been wiped until its rediscovery in 1994 during the Anthology production, with Anthology notes seeming to indicate that it features session drummer Andy White instead of Ringo Starr. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> addressed in the Mark Lewisohn-researched Anthology notes, although author Lewisohn's 1988 The Beatles Recording Sessions quotes session engineer Ron Richards as saying, [...] "Ringo didn't play drums at all that evening." [...] However, recording technician Geoff Emerick later wrote that, following White's departure, he witnessed Beatles roadie Mal Evans set up Starr's kit and the group record [...] "Please Please Me" [...] with Starr on drums. The unexpected rediscovery of the 11 September up-tempo recording raises the questions of when the Orbison-inspired slow version was played for Martin and whether a tape of that version might also still exist in the Abbey Road vaults, inasmuch as Lewisohn's 1988 quote from Martin [...] "We didn't keep outtakes then [...] " [...] was later contradicted. In a 2012 BBC interview, Andy White claimed that the drumming on the hit single was his: ...|$|E
