5|$|Chetwode {{ordered the}} {{continuation}} of the XX Corps' attacks; the 10th Division was to capture Nablus, the 53rd Division was to advance towards <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> north and north east of Nablus, {{in the direction of the}} Wadi el Fara road, to capture and control this line of retreat to the Jordan Valley.|$|E
5|$|Hackett {{decided the}} brigade would advance between the railway {{line and the}} Ede–Arnhem road, in order to capture their three objectives, first <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> {{overlooking}} Johanna Hoeve farm, next the woods near to Lichtenbeek House and finally <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> at Koepel. The delay in England meant it was 17:00 before the brigade started moving. With {{the element of surprise}} gone and no intelligence on the German dispositions, 156 Para headed for the first objective. Followed by 10 Para slightly behind and to their left. Bringing up the rear was the brigade reserve 4th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, acting in an infantry role.|$|E

5|$|At 10:05, {{the leading}} {{troops of the}} 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade; not to be {{confused}} with the 7th Mounted Brigade near Ras Ghannam to the south of Beersheba), were seen approaching Tel el Sakaty. By 11:17, they reported their advance was increasingly difficult due to hostile units defending <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> south of Sakaty. An Ottoman convoy of 10 wagons was seen leaving Beersheba on the road to Jerusalem, and the regiment was ordered to cut the road before the convoy escaped. Through heavy shell and shrapnel bombardment and point-blank machine-gun fire, they galloped to a position just south of the road. While an artillery battery got into position to support the light-horse regiment's attack on Tel el Sakaty, at 11:40 the 5th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was ordered to engage the Ottoman left flank. As they crossed the Wadi Khalil and the road to Jerusalem, the 5th Light Horse Regiment was also heavily shelled by artillery and fired on by machine guns from <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> north and northwest overlooking the area. Five minutes later, the 7th Light Horse Regiment cut the road and captured the convoy (47 prisoners, eight horses and eight wagons loaded with forage). However, the regiment was pinned down just beyond, in a small wadi in the rough country north of Wadi Khalil by the gun battery and machine guns located on Tel el Sakaty (above the road). With the arrival of the 5th Light Horse Regiment, by 13:30 the two regiments (supported by artillery) were advancing to attack <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> northeast of Sakaty. At 14:45, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade reported that three Ottoman guns appeared to have been put out of action by EEF artillery fire. While they continued to hold the road to Jerusalem, the 5th and 7th Light Horse Regiments found cover in the Wadi Aiyan (although targeted from <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> north of Sakaty by five Ottoman machine guns) where they remained until evening. The 1,100-strong Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division defended this hilly area north of Beersheba.|$|E
5|$|At Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines held <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground,</b> {{and their}} {{artillery}} forced the North Vietnamese {{to use their}} own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at Điện Biên Phủ, the French artillery (six 105mm batteries and one battery of four 155mm howitzers and mortars) was only sporadically effective;Furthermore, by 1968, the American military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous technological advances such as effective helicopters.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on September 1, a tank-led relief {{force of}} C Company {{headquarters}} troops cleared {{the road to}} Sibidang-san and resupplied the 2nd Platoon, B Company, with ammunition {{just in time for}} it to repel another North Korean assault, killing 77 and capturing 21 North Koreans. Although Fisher's 35th Infantry held all its original positions, except that of the forward platoon of G Company, 3,000 North Korean soldiers were behind its lines. The farthest eastern penetration reached <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> just south of Chirwon overlooking the north-south road there.|$|E

5|$|Both {{airborne}} divisions began {{landing at}} the same time, 10:00 on 24 March 1945. The 6th Airborne were to protect {{the northern part of}} the landing area; they had six drop zones around the town of Hamminkeln. The plan was for them to secure the town, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> east of the village of Bergen, and bridges across the river IJssel. The 5th Parachute Brigade would land on the northernmost DZ, DZ-B, and hold the area east of the Wesel railway line.|$|E
5|$|Currie {{regarded}} {{control of}} either Hill 70 or Sallaumines Hill as tactically {{more important than}} control {{of the city of}} Lens. Merely to occupy the city while the Germans held <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground,</b> would place the attackers in an unfavourably lower and more exposed position than the ones they occupied. At a conference of corps commanders, Currie persuaded the First Army commander General Henry Horne to make Hill 70, not Lens, the main objective of the limited offensive. Controlling Hill 70 would provide excellent observation over the German lines, in preparation for more offensives. Currie believed the Germans would attempt to counter-attack if Hill 70 were captured, largely because of its observational importance. Nevertheless, Currie believed that the advantageous observational position of Hill 70 would permit well directed artillery to effectively deal with any counter-attacks. The plan was therefore to occupy <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> quickly, establish defensive positions and utilize combined small arms and artillery fire to repel expected counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British {{captured}} the fort in the Siege of Fort Mackinac, the first {{battle of the}} conflict, because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> behind Fort Mackinac. In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second battle {{on the north side}} of the island. The American second-in-command, Major Andrew Holmes, was killed and the Americans failed to recapture the island.|$|E

The two German corps were tasked with crossing the river, breaking through the 7th Guards Army and covering the right flank of the 4th Panzer Army. The 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion, equipped with 45 Tigers, was also attached to the III Panzer Corps, with one company of 15 Tigers attached {{to each of the}} corps' three panzer divisions.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{resistance}} was encountered that {{day as the}} 2/2nd Infantry Battalion advanced towards <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> around Oivi. They were held up {{for a number of}} days until outflanking moves by the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, temporarily detached to the 25th Brigade, pushed the Japanese back and enabled the brigade to continue its advance. Gorari was taken and by mid-November the brigade, having suffered 471 battle casualties since the being committed to the fighting around Kokoda, finally reached Wairopi, where the swollen Kumusi River was forded.|$|E
5|$|In early July the 2/31st {{commenced}} {{operations to}} the north of Jezzine with the aim of securing <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> around Amatour and Badarane.

In the meantime, some of the 2/6th Independent Company's signallers and headquarters personnel gathered together what ammunition they could, and delivered it to C Platoon at around 07:00. C Platoon then fixed bayonets and continued its advance.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on Hill 677 the Canadians {{had spent}} the night of 23/24 April in their pits {{listening}} to the sounds of the fighting on the Australian front. However, by early morning Chinese activity increased and, with the situation deteriorating on the Patricia's right flank, Stone withdrew B Company from their position forward of the feature's summit to strengthen this flank if the Australians were forced to withdraw. Under the command of Major Vince Lilley the company subsequently moved to occupy positions east of Battalion Headquarters on <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> overlooking the valley road.|$|E
