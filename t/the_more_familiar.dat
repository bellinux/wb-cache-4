5|$|A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is {{any member}} of the group of {{eukaryotic}} organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> mushrooms. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} quantity compliance, {{which is}} the inverse of stiffness, can be used instead of stiffness to give a more direct correspondence to capacitance, but stiffness {{is used in the}} table as <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> quantity.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{there was}} a break in {{tradition}} when the Echo title-piece appeared reversed out in white on a red background, instead of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> red or black lettering. The new title-piece was designed to give a greater impact to the colourful front page. It {{was the first in}} a series of changes which included dropping Sunderland from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming The Echo. This change was reversed in 1997, with a return to the name Sunderland Echo.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, Pyron and Burbrink {{have argued}} that <b>the</b> short-tailed snake, <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> as Stilosoma extenuatum, should be {{included}} with Lampropeltis.|$|R
5|$|The Rhondda Leader one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> {{local papers}} of the region, was first {{published}} in 1899 and nine years later became the Rhondda Leader, Maesteg, Garw and Ogmore Telegraph. The Porth Gazette was published from 1900 to 1944 and during that period there was a newspaper called the Rhondda Socialist. Rhondda Gazette was in circulation from 1913 to 1919 while the Rhondda Clarion was available in the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Australia played Pakistan at Karachi in {{the first}} Test between the two {{countries}} on a matting pitch, rather than <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> grass pitch. Miller top-scored {{in the first}} innings with 21, as Australia fell for 80. He took 2/40 and then scored 11 in the second innings as Australia fell to defeat. It was the last Test of his career, as his knee injury deteriorated to the point that he could not play in the three Tests against India, and retired upon his return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{reception}} of the first edition was mixed, but within three years a second was made. The second edition used <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> term Testamentum instead of Instrumentum. In the second edition (1519) Erasmus also used Minuscule 3 (entire NT except Revelation; 12th century). The text was changed in about 400 places, with most—though not all—of the typographical errors corrected. Some new erroneus readings {{were added to the}} text. In this edition the text of Jerome's Vulgate Erasmus replaced by his own more elegant translation. The Latin translation had a good reception. After this edition, Erasmus was involved in many polemics and controversies. Particularly objectionable were the annotations from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.|$|E
50|$|The Tubulinea {{are a major}} {{grouping}} of Amoebozoa, including most of <b>the</b> larger and <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> amoebae like Amoeba, Arcella, and Difflugia.|$|R
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, <b>the</b> much <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} <b>the</b> even <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|R

25|$|A {{distinct}} SI mechanism {{exists in}} heterostylous flowers, termed heteromorphic self-incompatibility. This mechanism {{is probably not}} evolutionarily related to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> mechanisms, which are differentially defined as homomorphic self-incompatibility.|$|E
25|$|Alvarezsaurus, the namesake {{member of}} the group, was named for the {{historian}} Gregorio Álvarez, not <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> physicist Luis Alvarez, who proposed that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event was caused by an impact event.|$|E
50|$|These deeply-formed rocks were uplifted, eroded, {{and exposed}} for eons. By 600 million years ago, North America had been beveled {{off to a}} remarkably smooth surface. It is on this {{crystalline}} rock surface that <b>the</b> younger, <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> layered rocks of the Colorado Plateau were deposited.|$|R

5000|$|Hits, Rarities & Remixes is a {{compilation}} album by A Tribe Called Quest. It features two previously unreleased songs ("Mr. Incognito" [...] and [...] "The Night He Got Caught") {{as well as}} remixes and some of <b>the</b> group's <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> songs. It also contains songs that were featured in movie soundtracks.|$|R
25|$|Counting in binary {{is similar}} to {{counting}} in any other number system. Beginning with a single digit, counting proceeds through each symbol, in increasing order. Before examining binary counting, {{it is useful to}} briefly discuss <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> decimal counting system as a frame of reference.|$|E
25|$|When first built traffic could {{circulate}} {{around the}} central island in both directions. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> {{rules of the}} road for roundabouts were not adopted until the 1920s. Roundabouts remain a feature of the Garden City's road network, which has only two sets of true traffic lights (discounting those on pedestrian crossings).|$|E
25|$|The tomb {{held the}} remains of one person outside the Scipio family: the poet Ennius, of whom there was a marble statue in the tomb {{according}} to Cicero. None of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> Scipios (Africanus, Asiaticus and Hispanicus) were buried here, but according to Livy and Seneca were buried in their villa at Liternum.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 4½ stars and states [...] "This set {{is even a}} bit better than the In Europe album due to <b>the</b> {{stronger}} (if <b>more</b> <b>familiar)</b> material".|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} formal analogies {{that can be}} made between electricity, which is {{invisible}} to <b>the</b> eye, and <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> physical notions, such as the flowing of water or the motion of mechanical devices.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, Medellín, Antioquia, was a middle-sized {{city in a}} fast {{process of}} industrialization. Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were the first ambassadors of American rock music. The society of <b>the</b> region, <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> {{with one of the}} main folk musics of Colombia, bambuco, {{received}} it with mixed opinions until it became established as part of youth culture.|$|R
25|$|In {{pines and}} other {{conifers}} the sex organs are conifer cones and have {{male and female}} forms. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> female cones are typically more durable, containing ovules within them. Male cones are smaller and produce pollen which is transported by wind to land in female cones. As with flowers, seeds form within the female cone after pollination.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> {{landmarks}} in {{the city}} is the Artesia water tower. Not much is known about its active past or when it was constructed. The City of Artesia is currently trying to have the tower declared as a Historical Landmark and is asking its citizens for historical information and photos of the tower.|$|E
25|$|The Beige Brigade is a {{group of}} {{colourful}} and passionate New Zealand sport fans who identify themselves by wearing beige colours. A version of this uniform was worn by the New Zealand limited overs cricket team during the early 1980s (in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> black, which is worn by almost all New Zealand sports teams, including the current cricket team).|$|E
50|$|The spinet-regals {{are usually}} quite compact, {{especially}} {{compared to their}} larger harpsichord cousins. The spinet is often of the smaller Italian style in a square case, as opposed to <b>the</b> perhaps <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> Bentside shape popular in Britain. The organ is usually a small regal, with the bellows perpendicular to the keyboard, and pipes with tiny resonators.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though the}} duff and Aravana are two {{different}} types of arts, the word duff is used interchangeably for Aravana, because <b>the</b> duff is <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> than <b>the</b> Aravana. This art is nowadays the basis for competitions in Kerala.|$|R
25|$|Eventually, the Doctor {{began to}} enjoy his travels through time and space, taking people {{along for the}} ride and was always {{reluctant}} and sad to see them go, even when he knew it was for their own good. The Doctor's personality mellowed {{around the time of the}} serial Marco Polo, and he evolved into <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> grandfatherly figure that children loved.|$|E
25|$|A few {{indicators}} {{suggest that}} there may have existed, in the same location, another structure, likely a temple to the goddess Nabia (as yet undiscovered). The figure in the toga could represent the god Asclepius. Francisco Sande Lemos, suggests that the fountain was paired with the sanctuary of Fragas de Panóias in Vila Real, one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> monuments of Roman rock-art epigraphy in the Iberian northwest.|$|E
25|$|Replacing <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>familiar</b> {{landing gear}} found on airplanes, the Aeroscraft is {{equipped}} with landing cushions that aid the vehicle's unique functionality. They aid landing on unimproved surfaces, even water, and perform like a hovercraft during taxi by pushing air through them. In addition, the landing cushions are equipped with very powerful gripping/suction capabilities that ensure the vehicle stays grounded and in place when not in flight. This reversible airflow helps hold the vehicle to the ground, even when the Aeroscraft arrives at destination for cargo offloading, allowing it to operate in heavier wind conditions.|$|E
