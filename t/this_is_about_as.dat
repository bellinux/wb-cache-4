The fact that Shelby had been hired to form a second glee club at McKinley, however, was greeted with derision by both reviewers—Urban called it [...] "mind-bogglingly idiotic"—and others as well. Reiter found the idea incomprehensible, and Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, [...] "Given Will's ongoing struggles to fill his own crooning baker's dozen, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> realistic a plan as Michele Bachmann starting a rival chapter of PFLAG at Liberty University."

6000|$|The best {{books are}} not read even {{by those who}} are called good readers. What does our Concord culture amount to? There is in this town, with a very few exceptions, no taste for the best or for very good books even in English literature, whose words all can read and spell. Even the college-bred and {{so-called}} liberally educated men here and elsewhere have really little or no acquaintance with the English classics; and as for the recorded wisdom of mankind, the ancient classics and Bibles, which are accessible to all who will know of them, there are the feeblest efforts anywhere made to become acquainted with them. I know a woodchopper, of middle age, who takes a French paper, not for news as he says, for he is above that, but to [...] "keep himself in practice," [...] he being a Canadian by birth; and when I ask him what he considers the best thing he can do in this world, he says, beside this, to keep up and add to his English. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> much as the college-bred generally do or aspire to do, and they take an English paper for the purpose. One who has just come from reading perhaps one of the best English books will find how many with whom he can converse about it? Or suppose he comes from reading a Greek or Latin classic in the original, whose praises are familiar even to the so-called illiterate; he will find nobody at all to speak to, but must keep silence about it. Indeed, there is hardly the professor in our colleges, who, if he has mastered the difficulties of the language, has proportionally mastered the difficulties of the wit and poetry of a Greek poet, and has any sympathy to impart to the alert and heroic reader; and as for the sacred Scriptures, or Bibles of mankind, who in this town can tell me even their titles?

6000|$|May 22d.--Yesterday, {{while we}} were at dinner, Mr. ------ called. I never saw him but once before, and {{that was at the}} door of our little red cottage in Lenox; he sitting in a wagon with {{one or two of the}} Sedgewicks, merely exchanging a {{greeting}} with me from under the brim of his straw hat, and driving on. He presented himself now with a long white beard, such as a palmer might have worn as the growth of his long pilgrimages, a brow almost entirely bald, and what hair he has quite hoary; a forehead impending, yet not massive; dark, bushy eyebrows and keen eyes, without much softness in them; a dark and sallow complexion; a slender figure, bent a little with age; but at once alert and infirm. It surprised me to see him so venerable; for, as poets are Apollo's kinsmen, we are inclined to attribute to them his enviable quality of never growing old. There was a weary look in his face, as if he were tired of seeing things and doing things, though with certainly enough still to see and do, if need were. My family gathered about him, and he conversed with great readiness and simplicity about his travels, and whatever other subject came up; telling us that he had been abroad five times, and was now getting a little home-sick, and had no more eagerness for sights, though his [...] "gals" [...] (as he called his daughter and another young lady) dragged him out to see the wonders of Rome again. His manners and whole aspect are very particularly plain, though not affectedly so; but it seems as if in the decline of life, and the security of his position, he had put off whatever artificial polish he may have heretofore had, and resumed the simpler habits and deportment of his early New England breeding. Not but what you discover, nevertheless, that he is a man of refinement, who has seen the world, and is well aware of his own place in it. He spoke with great pleasure of his recent visit to Spain. I introduced the subject of Kansas, and methought his face forthwith assumed something of the bitter keenness of the editor of a political newspaper, while speaking of the triumph of the administration over the Free-Soil opposition. I inquired whether he had seen S------, and he gave a very sad account of him as he appeared at their last meeting, which was in Paris. S------, he thought, had suffered terribly, and would never again be the man he was; he was getting fat; he talked continually of himself, and of trifles concerning himself, and seemed to have no interest for other matters; and Mr. ------ feared that the shock upon his nerves had extended to his intellect, and was irremediable. He said that S------ ought to retire from public life, but had no friend true enough to tell him so. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> sad as anything can be. I hate to have S------ undergo the fate of a martyr, because he was not naturally of the stuff that martyrs are made of, and it is altogether by mistake that he has thrust himself into the position of one. He was merely, though with excellent abilities, one of the best of fellows, and ought to have lived and died in good fellowship with all the world.|$|E

Sadly, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> good as it got for Fever; they leaked goals everywhere else they went, losing 5-0 to Michigan Bucks, 4-1 to Toronto Lynx, and losing 2-1 in three consecutive games at home to Chicago, new boys Kalamazoo Outrage, and the resurgent Cleveland Internationals, who scored an 87th-minute winner to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Fever's only other win of the season was actually a pretty comprehensive 4-1 revenge victory over Toronto Lynx in which Gary Boughton scored a hat trick, but they reverted to form quickly thereafter.
