5|$|In New York, Sumner {{and several}} police detectives seized 865 copies of The Well from the publisher's offices, and Friede {{was charged with}} selling an obscene publication. But Covici and Friede had already moved the {{printing}} plates out of New York {{in order to continue}} publishing the book. By the time the case came to trial, it had already been reprinted six times. Despite its price of $5– twice <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> average novel– it sold more than 100,000 copies in its first year.|$|E

5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new forms were impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were achieved at <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if {{the cost of the}} ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E
5|$|Three {{publishers}} praised The Well {{but turned}} it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to Jonathan Cape who, though cautious about publishing a controversial book, saw {{the potential for}} a commercial success. Cape tested the waters with a small print run of 1500 copies, priced at 15 shillings– about twice <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> average novel– to make it less attractive to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, Compton Mackenzie's Extraordinary Women, was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to have little in common, Hall and Cape saw Extraordinary Women as a competitor and wanted to beat it to market. The Well appeared on 27 July, in a black cover with a plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines he thought would handle the subject matter non-sensationally.|$|E

25|$|Termite colonies are {{examples}} of eusocial insects. Eusocial insects are animals that develop large, multigenerational cooperative societies that assist {{each other in the}} rearing of young, often at <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual’s life or reproductive ability. Such altruism is explained in that eusocial insects benefit from giving up reproductive ability of many individuals to improve the overall fitness of closely related offspring. Hamilton’s rule is the key to explaining this phenomenon, where altruism is justified evolutionarily when the benefit to the individual receiving the help, weighted by the relatedness to said individual, outweighs the cost to the organism being altruistic.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{spends more}} than other {{countries}} for the same things. Drugs are more expensive, doctors are paid more, and suppliers charge more for medical equipment than other countries. Journalist Todd Hixon reported on a study that U.S. spending on physicians per person is about five times higher than peer countries, $1,600 versus $310, as much as 37% of the gap with other countries. This was driven by a greater use of specialist doctors, who charge 3-6 times more in the U.S. than in peer countries. The OECD reported that in 2013 the U.S. spent $1,026 per capita on pharmaceuticals (drugs) versus an OECD average of around $515. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MRI in Canada is approximately $300, versus $1,000 in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{arbitrarily}} {{many elements}} may be inserted into a linked list, {{limited only by}} the total memory available; while a dynamic array will eventually fill up its underlying array data structure {{and will have to}} reallocate— an expensive operation, one that may not even be possible if memory is fragmented, although the cost of reallocation can be averaged over insertions, and <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> insertion due to reallocation would still be amortized O(1). This helps with appending elements at the array's end, but inserting into (or removing from) middle positions still carries prohibitive costs due to data moving to maintain contiguity. An array from which many elements are removed may also have to be resized in order to avoid wasting too much space.|$|E
