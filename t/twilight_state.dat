Psychiatrists commented on how to treat the judge vested with judicial immunity as follows: [...] "While knowing that the person in <b>twilight</b> <b>state</b> is dangerous and may kill or maim people nearby, the psychiatrist should provide this information to the regional court so that three judges of the court within 10 days can send to the Supreme Court of the country a petition for the removal of immunity from the judge.

50|$|Ghosts {{are what}} remains {{of a person who}} refused to move on after death because of some {{unfinished}} business.

An anchor can be any person, place, or thing that held great significance to the ghost in life. A ghost can have many anchors or only one. When the last of these are gone, either from being destroyed or simply disappearing with time, and the ghost has not resolved their unfinished business, they are sent to the Underworld. Sin-eaters can attempt to help a ghost move on, either from the Twilight or from the Underworld, by resolving whatever business the ghost has left. Most ghosts do not understand their own condition, many are far less than coherent, and some simply don't want to move on, so they often try to fight any sin-eaters that are trying to help them.|$|E

40|$|In the {{evolution}} of the cerebral cortex, the sophisticated organization in a steady state far away from thermodynamic equilibrium has produced the side effect of two fundamental pathological network events: ictal epileptic activity and spreading depolarization. Ictal epileptic activity describes the partial disruption, and spreading depolarization describes the near-complete disruption of the physiological double Gibbs-Donnan steady state. The occurrence of ictal epileptic activity in patients has been known for decades. Recently, unequivocal electrophysiological evidence has been found in patients that spreading depolarizations occur abundantly in stroke and brain trauma. The authors propose that the ion changes can be taken to estimate relative changes in Gibbs free energy from state to state. The calculations suggest that in transitions from the physiological state to ictal epileptic activity to spreading depolarization to death, the cortex releases Gibbs free energy in a stepwise fashion. Spreading depolarization thus appears as a <b>twilight</b> <b>state</b> close to death. Consistently, electrocorticographic recordings in the core of focal ischemia or after cardiac arrest display a smooth transition from the initial spreading depolarization component to the later ultraslow negative potential, which is assumed to reflect processes in cellular death.

500|$|Abrams's {{inspiration}} for Fringe {{came from a}} range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the film Altered States, films by David Cronenberg, and the television series The X-Files and The <b>Twilight</b> Zone. Orci <b>stated</b> that Fringe is a [...] "new kind of storytelling", combining procedural shows such as Law & Order, and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series like Lost. The procedural aspect was chosen because, {{at the time of its}} premiere, six of the ten top shows were procedural in nature; Orci stated that [...] "you have to be a fool not to go study what it is that they're doing".

Instead, the co-creators studied crime procedurals, such as the American series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and the franchise Law & Order, in an attempt to merge that genre with a more mythology-based show without creating only standalone episodes. Orci explained, [...] "We studied procedurals specifically to try and merge the two. Very against our instincts to do that, but when nine of the top TV shows are called Law & Order and CSI, you have to study them a little bit and figure out what it is that they're doing."

2500|$|Micro-series was an idea {{born out}} from comic writer Thom Zahler. At {{the time of}} the main comic series {{announcement}} at the 2012Comic-Con, Zahler had interest in doing cover art for the series, and approached IDW editor Bobby Curnow at the Con about his interest. Curnow later contacted Zahler and asked him to pitch stories for a smaller series; one such pitch included a crossover with Mars Attacks! penned during a convention panel in Baltimore. Though Zahler had pitched stories for all the main characters, he ultimately was the author for the <b>Twilight</b> comic. Zahler <b>stated</b> that prior to the comics he had seen a few episodes, and considered the characters as developed by Faust to be [...] "wonderfully represented" [...] and that the show itself had [...] "a very classic cartoon element" [...] that made cross-generational writing easy to do. Cook herself wrote the third micro-issue featuring Rarity, and saw the single-issue format as more like [...] "episodes of the TV show" [...] compared to the larger arcs of the main series, and can be [...] "slice-of-life stories that really explore the character" [...] without bringing in the full cast.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Acute viral {{encephalitis}} is {{an infectious}} disease, which {{is characterized by}} sudden onset, serious clinical picture and with an uncertain outcome. Disturbances of consciousness are common {{in the course of}} acute viral encephalitis. Consciousness is the highest form of psychic life and consciousness disturbances may include quantitative (somnolentia, sopor, coma) and qualitative symptoms (convulsions, <b>twilight</b> <b>state).</b> Material and methods. We investigated 63 patients with acute viral encephalitis. The youngest patient was 15, and the oldest one 69 years of age. We examined the state of consciousness in all patients. Results Of all examined patients, 54 (85. 72 %) patients had disturbances of consciousness, 9 (14. 25 %) patients had no consciousness disturbances, 11 (17. 46 %) patients had sopor and 24 (38. 09 %) patients were in coma. The highest percentage of lethal outcomes was recorded in coma patients (12. 5 %). The longer the duration of consciousness disturbances, the higher the mortality among these patients. Discussion Subjective and objective factors cause different grades and duration of consciousness disturbances. The highest percentage of patients who recovered without consequences was established in the group of patients (81. 82 %) with somnolence. The highest percentage of patients who recovered with consequences (20. 8 %) and patients (12. 5 %) with lethal outcome was recorded in the group of patients in coma. These findings are in correlation with literature data. ...|$|E

The goal was to release films of varying genres that had never been released on home video in the United <b>States.</b> <b>Twilight</b> Time's initial focus was on films of the 1950s and 1960s in what Redman called [...] "the Cinemascope period, those gorgeous widescreen entertainments that had it all—beauty, glamour, drama." [...] But, he added, [...] "We will also be selectively tackling the earlier years—the 1930s and 40s—and sampling every genre, presenting, hopefully, something for everyone." [...] Ultimately, according to Jamieson, [...] "Twilight Time will be serving both the collectible drive of film enthusiasts, and, in a larger sense, the cause of cinema literacy." [...] Their first title, The Kremlin Letter, was scheduled to be release on January 25, 2011, but for unknown reasons, the release was pushed back by two months.|$|R

40|$|According to {{objectification}} theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997), {{mass media}} may encourage girls to self-objectify, {{described as the}} tendency to evaluate oneself with an observer’s perspective focusing exclusively on physical appearance. This appearance-focused self-perception can lead to various negative consequences, such as body shame, appearance anxiety and eating disorders (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). The present study investigated {{the effect of a}} popular, but sexually objectifying teenage movie on adolescent girls’ state self-objectification. We sought to investigate this specific effect for three reasons. First, although scholars, such as Tiggemann (2010), have suggested that self-objectification can occur among adolescent girls, empirical research among this specific age group is lacking. Adolescent girls gradually develop secondary sex characteristics and will for the first time become {{aware of the fact that}} others, especially males, look at and evaluate their bodies (Gordon, 2008). Adolescence has been described as a critical period of identify formation possibly causing that even a low level of self-objectification is harmful (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997; Tiggemann, 2010). The present study on self-objectification will therefore focus on adolescent girls. Second, popular mass media have been criticized for sexually objectifying the female body, thus increasing self-objectification among female media users (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). In line with this criticism, one cross-sectional (Grabe & Hyde, 2009) and one longitudinal study (Aubrey, 2006) have shown that consuming sexually objectifying media is related to self-objectification among adolescent girls. However, no research has yet explored the short-term effect of exposure to sexually objectifying media on adolescents’ level of self-objectification. To understand more fully the causal order of sexually objectifying media effects and to add empirical evidence to the hypothesis that media may affect adolescent girls’ self-concept, the present study used an experimental design to examine the short-term effect of exposure to sexually objectifying media on state self-objectification. Third, scholars have suggested that media effects are moderated by media users’ involvement in media content (e. g., Brown et al., 2005). More specifically, the level of identification with media content has been described as an important moderator for media effects as viewers who identify with media characters may be more likely to endorse the promoted attitudes and behaviors (Brown et al., 2005). The proposed moderating role of identification has not yet been explored in media research on self-objectification. Building on Drench hypothesis (Greenberg, 1988) and prior research (Brown et al., 2005), the present study examines the role of identification as a possible moderator in the relationship between sexually objectifying media and state self-objectification. To address our research aims, an experiment was conducted among 70 adolescent girls (n= 70, Mean age= 15. 07, SD= 1. 71). The movie “Twilight” was selected as sexually objectifying media stimulus because of its popularity among adolescent girls and its sexually objectifying focus on the female body (McGeough, 2010). Since 2005, research has suggested that a substantial number of adolescent girls are fan of the Twilight Saga described in novels and movies. The Twilight Saga featuring a romantic love story between a teenage vampire and a “human” adolescent girl has been categorized as a sexually objectifying media content, since the movie tends to promote the view that appearance according to narrowly defined beauty standards is an essential condition for engaging in true love (McGeough, 2010). Thirty-five girls in the experimental condition and 35 in the control condition completed a survey two weeks prior to exposure and directly after exposure to the experimental stimulus (Twilight movie versus control movie “Ice Age”). Mixed design ANCOVA’s were used to test the expected relationships. Results showed a main effect of the movie Twilight on self-objectification: Girls exposed to Twilight scored significantly higher on self-objectification in the posttest compared to the pretest. Also, the posttest measurements of self-objectification among girls who saw Twilight were significantly higher than viewers who saw the neutral movie Ice Age. Furthermore, the results revealed an interaction effect of exposure to Twilight and identification. In the Twilight condition, girls with higher levels of identification scored significantly higher on self-objectification than girls with lower levels of identification. Taken together, the findings showed that exposure to the sexually objectifying movie <b>Twilight</b> triggers <b>state</b> self-objectification and that this effect is moderated by adolescent girls’ level of identification. Discussion interprets these findings in light of objectification theory and sets an agenda for future research. status: publishe...|$|R
6000|$|The {{heat from}} the {{dropping}} sun, not far now above the moorline, struck full into the ferns and long grass of the bank where I was sitting, and the midges rioted on me in this last warmth. The wind was barred out, so that one had the full sweetness of the clover, fast becoming hay, over which the swallows were wheeling and swooping after flies. And far up, as it were the crown of Nature's beautiful devouring circle, a buzzard hawk, almost stationary on the air, floated, intent on something pleasant below him. A number of little hens crept through the gate one by one, and came round me. It seemed to them that I was there to feed them; and they held their neat red or yellow heads {{to one side and}} the other, inquiring with their beady eyes, surprised at my stillness. They were pretty with their speckled feathers, and as it seemed to me, plump and young, so that I wondered how many of them would in time feed me. Finding, however, that I gave them nothing to eat, they went away, and there arose, in place of their clucking, the thin singing of air passing through some long tube. I knew it for the whining of my dog, who had nosed me out, but could not get through the padlocked gate. And as I lifted him over, I was glad the postman could not see me--for I felt that to lift a dog over a gate would be against the principles of one for whom the connection of sheep with good behaviour had been too strange a thought. And it suddenly rushed into my mind that the time would no doubt come when the conduct of apples, being plucked from the mother tree, would inspire us, and we should say: [...] "They're really very good!" [...] And I wondered, were those future watchers of apple-gathering farther from me than I, watching sheep-shearing, from the postman? I thought, too, of the pretty dreams being dreamt about the land, and of the people who dreamed them. And I looked at that land, covered with the sweet pinkish-green of the clover, and considered how much of it, through the medium of sheep, would find its way into me, to enable me to come out here and be eaten by midges, and speculate about things, and conceive the sentiment of how good the sheep were. And it all seemed queer. I thought, too, of a world entirely composed of people who could see the sheen rippling on that clover, and feel a sort of sweet elation at the scent of it, and I wondered how much clover would be sown then? Many things I thought of, sitting there, till the sun sank below the moor line, the wind died off the clover, and the midges slept. Here and there in the iris-coloured sky a star crept out; the soft-hooting owls awoke. But still I lingered, watching how, one after another, shapes and colours died into twilight; and I wondered what the postman thought of <b>twilight,</b> that inconvenient <b>state,</b> when things were neither dark nor light; and I wondered what the sheep were thinking this first night without their coats. Then, slinking along the hedge, noiseless, unheard by my sleeping spaniel, I saw a tawny dog stealing by. He passed without seeing us, licking his lean chops.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to deepen the {{understanding}} of nursing care for seriously ill patients {{on the edge of}} life in intensive care unit (ICU) and nursing home when questions were raised whether to withhold or withdraw curative treatment. Method: All studies were conducted in a qualitative frame of reference with interviews of nurses in two contexts in Norway; group interviews of 14 nurses in an ICU (study I, III), and individual interviews of 14 nurses in two nursing homes (study II, IV). Data were analysed with interpretative phenomenology (I, III, IV) and phenomenography (II). Findings: The nurses’ descriptions of the patients on the edge of life were interpreted as ‘being in a <b>twilight</b> zone’, a <b>state</b> between living and dying. The patients’ situation were understood to be very burdensome as they were mostly ‘voiceless’ and unable to call for, or refuse help and totally surrendered to other people’s devices. Their state was strained by extensive suffering; pains and bodily afflictions, loneliness, confusion and without control and dignity (I). Their need for nursing care was comprehensive (I, II) with an overall need for dignity (II), which included having the needs for preparedness, human relationship, comfort and safety met (II). The patients’ inabilities to express themselves clearly involved major challenges for nursing care (I - IV). Good nursing care was described as caring for the individual patient based on his/her situation and needs. The nurses experienced themselves to be of imperative importance for the patient’s living or dying (III, IV) and their interpretation of the patient’s condition was crucial (III). Their commitment and drive to help was high, they knew what good nursing care was for the patients (I - IV), and they were proud when they succeeded in their care (III, IV). An outstanding finding was the nurses’ experiences of ambiguity of both certainty and uncertainty. Being certain mostly seemed to concern nursing care related to the patient’s needs and situation (I, II), and uncertainty to what was ‘right’ to do with regards to withholding or withdrawing treatment (III, IV). They often experienced loneliness, too much responsibility, a vulnerable professional pride, and being pulled between opposite poles when they struggled to give good nursing care (I - IV), but too often they failed (II, IV). This demanding situation sometimes led to the nurses’ use of several self-protecting strategies. Whether the patients could receive good nursing care or not did not only depend on the single nurse, but was also anchored in opportunities and hindrances on a relational and an organisational level (I – IV). There were many congruities in patterns in the experiences of ICU - and nursing - home - nurses with regards to the situation and needs of patients on the edge of life, and good nursing care. Congruities were also found regarding being a nurse when caring for these patients, and nurses’ opportunities and hindrances for carrying out good nursing care. Conclusion: This thesis shows that nursing care was experienced as being of crucial importance to the patients on the edge of life, and the nurses knew very well what good nursing care was for them. However, the nurses’ opportunities to perform good nursing care depended on several preconditions and were restricted by hindrances on different levels, which have to be overcome in order to fulfil patients’ needs and nurses’ ambitions of giving good nursing care. As such, this thesis highlights a wide-ranging understanding of nursing care for these patients, which should challenge individual nurses, but also other health care workers, leaders and politicians...|$|R
