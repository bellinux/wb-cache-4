5000|$|Several {{companies}} now offer hand-painted finishes for metalwork, {{as well as}} a more permanent look that can be achieved with powder-coated finishes. For {{the low end of the}} market, imitation panels are pressed from plastic or aluminum. Tin is now fashionably used for art work, back splashes, cabinet faces, wainscoting and much more. For over 100 years the tin panel was made with nail rails around the outside of the panel, designed to overlap each other. Panels were nailed into wood furring strips which were prevalent prior to the invention of plywood. Today, nail up panels can be easily brad nailed or hand nailed, into plywood without the need for the original 1 x 2 in furring strips. There is also a patented interlocking tin panel that will screw directly into existing drywall/popcorn/plaster ceilings, without the need for extensive plywood installation. Tin panels today are made in 24 x 24 in and 24 x 48 in sizes for easier handling and one-person installation. Today, most tin ceiling manufacturers actually use recycled blackplate steel in a thickness of only [...]010 or 1/100th of an inch. There are some manufacturers who also use actual <b>tin</b> <b>plated</b> steel, which is simply the blackplate steel with a thin coating of bright tin plate adhered to the base metal.

40|$|The {{fretting}} wear behavior of <b>tin</b> <b>plated</b> copper alloy contacts {{and its influence}} on the contact resistance are addressed in this paper. Based on {{the change in the}} area of contact zone as well as the wear depth as a function of fretting cycles, a model was proposed to explain the observed low and stable contact resistance. The extent of wear of tin coating and the formation of wear debris as a function of fretting cycles were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Energy dispersive X-ray line scanning (EDX), X-ray mapping, and EDX spot analysis were employed to characterize the nature of changes that occur at the contact zone. The study reveals that the fretted area increases linearly up to 8000 cycles due to the continuous removal of the tin coating and attains saturation when the fretting path length reaches a maximum. The observed low and stable contact resistance observed up to 8000 cycles is due to the common area of contact which provides an electrically conducting area. Surface analysis by SEM, EDX, and X-ray elemental mapping elucidate the nature of changes that occurred at the contact zone. Based on the change in contact resistance as a function of fretting cycles, the {{fretting wear}} and fretting corrosion dominant regimes are proposed. The interdependence of extent of wear and oxidation increases the complexity of the fretting corrosion behavior of <b>tin</b> <b>plated</b> contacts.

40|$|APPLICATION NOTE Tin {{whiskers}} are {{a potential}} concern with high-tin (Sn) content lead finishes (this includes alloys such as SnBi, and SnCu). SnPb alloys {{introduced in the}} 1950 's {{have been the most}} successful in controlling whiskers. It is widely accepted that whiskers are a stress relief mechanism for a compressive stress that builds in the tin film after plating. There are two main models accounting for the stress: the intermetallic model and the recrystallization model. • The intermetallic model requires intermetallic growth (Cu 6 Sn 5) that occupies more volume than the amount of tin consumed thus generating a compressive stress in the plating. This stress is then relieved when whiskers grow through small defects in the native tin oxide. This model is probably valid for <b>tin</b> <b>plated</b> on copper lea...|$|E

40|$|Though it is {{generally}} known that whisker often springs from tin, the <b>tin</b> <b>plated</b> film on nickel does not provide the tin whisker growth under high temperature storage. But under thermal shock stress tin whisker grows even if the nickel film is formed under <b>tin</b> <b>plated</b> film. Then we have investigated the trend of growth and reliability evaluation about the tin whisker under thermal shock stress. As a result, we confirmed that the tin whisker under thermal shock stress did not cause short-circuit failure in field. Key words: tin whisker, thermal shock stress, lead-free. 1. troduction With the promotion of lead-free solder in these years, the conversion of solder-plating technology of electronics components from current methods to pure Sn or Sn-system plating is widely pursued. It {{is generally}} said that Sn is a metal easily generating whiskers in high temperature atmosphere, and each concerned manufacturer, etc. has made research about this type whickers 1). We have also conducted the 50 °C high temperature storage test of products with Sn plate on Ni under-plate and confirmed {{that this type of}} whiskers are not generated on our products for a time period of 18 years 2). However, it has been lately found that, if a thermal stress shock is charged on a product with Sn plate on Ni under-plate, it generates lint-like deposition products (i. e. we call them “whiskers ”) 3). As these whiskers have lint-like sinuous shape, some of which grow to few score micrometers, there is a concern that they may cause short-circuit failure between electrodes on electronics components. Therefore, we have performed stress analyses in order to investigate, in what conditions, these whiskers generated under the thermal shock stress grow and how they affect product reliability, and estimated the reliability level of electronics components used in the market environment in respect of the whisker generation.
