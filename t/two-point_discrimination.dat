40|$|Objectives. We {{evaluated}} {{the results of}} digital lengthening by distraction and second-stage bone graft. Methods. We treated finger deficiency of 201 digits in 104 patients (68 males, 36 females) by digital distraction and second-stage bone graft. The distraction was performed with a rate of 1 [*]mm/day (for the first ten days) and 0. 5 [*]mm/day followed by using a self-designed bilateral tubal-helical external fixator. The mean follow-up period was 42 months (range 6 to 60 months). Results. The mean lengthening was 29. 2 [*]mm (range 25 to 40 [*]mm) and 18. 7 [*]mm (range 12 to 32 [*]mm) for metacarpal bones and phalanges, respectively. The mean elongation rate was 174. 4 % (range 145 % to 202 %) and 184. 8 % (range 115 % to 283 %) for metacarpal bones and phalanges, respectively. The static <b>two-point</b> <b>discriminations</b> and SpO 2 showed no significant differences before and after distraction. Four complications were observed (two skin ruptures and two phalangeal splitting). No pin tract infection or tendon rupture showed. Digital lengthening improved functions of the hand. Conclusion. Digital distraction and second-stage bone graft is an effective method to compensate disabilities caused by lack of finger length. It could be an alternative plan for patients with thumb deficiency instead of toe-to-thumb transplant and patients with finger deficiency instead of ray resection...|$|R
50|$|The {{absence of}} {{proprioception}} or <b>two-point</b> tactile <b>discrimination</b> {{on one side}} of the body suggests injury to the contralateral side of the primary somatosensory cortex. However, depending on the extent of the injury, damage can range in loss of proprioception of an individual limb or the entire body. A deficit known as cortical astereognosis of the receptive type describes an inability to make use of tactile sensory information for identifying objects placed in the hand. For example, if this type of injury effects the hand region in the primary somatosensory cortex for one cerebral hemisphere, a patient with closed eyes cannot perceive the position of the fingers on the contralateral hand and will not be able to identify objects such as keys or a cell phone if they are placed into that hand.|$|R
5000|$|Although it is {{very popular}} in tactile {{research}} labs, the GOT is admittedly less practical for clinical use, as it requires specialized pre-constructed stimulus objects, which span a fixed spatial range, rather than a single continuously adjustable calipers. The comparative simplicity and flexibility of the 2PD test have encouraged the continuation of its use by clinicians, despite the test's acknowledged flaws. To remedy this situation, <b>two-point</b> orientation <b>discrimination</b> (2POD) has been proposed as a test that combines the convenience of 2PD with {{the validity of the}} GOT. [...] In the 2POD task, the patient attempts to discern the orientation (e.g., along or across the finger) created by two sharp points of contact on the skin; the 2POD threshold is the distance between the points at which the participant performs with some specified level of accuracy (e.g., 75% correct).|$|R

40|$|International audienceNeurosensory tactile {{functions}} {{were investigated}} in human subjects by two different and complementary experimental approaches. First, a conventional psychophysical method (<b>two-point</b> gap <b>discrimination)</b> {{was used to}} determine the tactile discrimination threshold by analyzing the subjects' ability to detect a gap of variable width between two contact points when a series of stimuli was applied to the skin. Using this method we confirmed the marked degradation of tactile spatial acuity with age and showed that skin discriminative function was partially restored after hydration of the skin with a moisturizer. The second approach consisted of a microneurographic recording of tactile afferent fibers in response to two types of mechanical stimuli applied reproducibly to the corresponding receptive fields. With this method, we found that the afferent messages were depressed following hydration of the skin surface. Thus, partial restoration of tactile spatial acuity after hydration appears to be due to both a softening of the stratum corneum permitting better localization of the stimulus and a weaker transfer of the stimulus toward the sensory receptors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResearch on single striate {{cortical}} neurons {{has often}} concentrated on {{their responses to}} stimuli defined by <b>two-point</b> correlations. Texture <b>discrimination</b> studies using a relatively small palette of isotrigon textures have indicated that we are sensitive to third and higher-order spatial correlations. To further evaluate the underlying mechanisms of texture discrimination subjects discriminated random binary noise patterns from ten new isotrigon texture types. Factor analysis revealed that as few as three mechanisms may govern the detection of fourth and higher order image structure. This supports the findings of previous studies using different isotrigon textures. The computation of higher-order correlations by the brain is neurophysiologically plausible. The mechanisms identified in this study may represent some short range nonlinear combination of recursive and/or rectifying processes...|$|R
40|$|Paired {{associative}} stimulation (PAS), {{which combines}} repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation with {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS), may induce neuroplastic changes in somatosensory cortex (S 1), possibly by long-term potentiation-like mechanisms. We used multichannel median nerve somatosensory evoked potential (MN-SSEP) recordings and <b>two-point</b> tactile <b>discrimination</b> testing to examine the location and behavioural significance of these changes. When TMS was applied to S 1 near-synchronously to an afferent signal containing mechanoreceptive information, MN-SSEP changes (significant at 21 - 31 ms) {{could be explained by}} a change in a tangential source located in Brodmann area 3 b, with their timing and polarity suggesting modification of upper cortical layers. PAS-induced MN-SSEP changes between 28 and 32 ms were linearly correlated with changes in tactile discrimination. Conversely, when the near-synchronous afferent signal contained predominantly proprioceptive information, PAS-induced MN-SSEP changes (20 - 29 ms) were shifted medially, and tactile performance remained stable. With near-synchronous mechanoreceptive stimulation subtle differences in the timing of the two interacting signals tended to influence the direction of tactile performance changes. PAS performed with TMS delivered asynchronously to the afferent pulse did not change MN-SSEPs. Hebbian interaction of mechanoreceptive afferent signals with TMS-evoked activity may modify synaptic efficacy in superficial cortical layers of Brodmann area 3 b and is associated with timing-dependent and qualitatively congruent behavioural changes...|$|R

Participants and methods: We obtained and compared the LFO amplitude from 25 right-handed discogenic LBLP patients (13 males; mean age 55. 16 ± 1. 83  years) and 27 well-matched healthy controls (15 males; mean age 52. 96 ± 1. 63  years). The LFO amplitude was examined using the voxel-wise amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs), and partial correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the regions with altered ALFF values and clinical parameters in discogenic LBLP patients. Results: Compared with healthy controls, the patients with discogenic LBLP showed a significant increase in ALFF in the affective system of the pain matrix (left anterior cingulate cortex, right anterior insula/frontal operculum, and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex) and information-processing regions (middle occipital/temporal gyrus). In addition, a significant decrease in ALFF was observed in the default mode network (DMN; inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC]) and the processing system of the pain matrix (basal ganglia/thalamus/midbrain, postcentral gyrus [PoCG], and fusiform gyrus). Several regions with altered ALFF were associated with disease duration, visual analog scale scores, Barthel index, and fine sensory modality measurements (<b>two-point</b> tactile <b>discrimination</b> of the left and/or right leg). Further operating characteristic curves analysis suggested that the mean ALFF values in the right IPL, left IPL/PoCG, left anterior cingulate cortex, and left mPFC could serve as markers to separate individuals with discogenic LBLP from healthy subjects. Conclusion: Our results revealed widespread abnormalities in ALFF in the pain matrix and information-processing regions as well as a decrease in ALFF in the DMN. These results open up an important new avenue to better understand the nature of the link between intrinsic activity and peripheral pain and sensory impairment in discogenic LBLP patients.

40|$|The deep {{inferior}} epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap {{is considered}} the definitive standard for autologous breast reconstruction because {{of its ability to}} restore shape, its consistency, and its static and dynamic symmetry, but the degree of spontaneous sensory recovery is still widely discussed. To clarify the real need for sensitive nerve coaptation, return of sensibility in DIEP flaps was investigated using a pressure-specifying sensory device. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients with breast cancer scheduled for modified radical mastectomy, axillary node dissection, and immediate reconstruction with cutaneous-adipose DIEP flaps without nerve repair were enrolled in the study. Sensibility for one and two points, static and moving, was tested preoperatively on the breasts and abdomen, and postoperatively at 6 and 12 months on the DIEP flaps. A t test was used for comparison of paired data and to investigate which factors affected sensory recovery. RESULTS: Preoperative healthy breast and abdomen pressure thresholds were lower for <b>two-point</b> than one-point <b>discrimination</b> and for moving discriminations compared with static ones at 6 and 12 months. Although they were significantly higher than those for contralateral healthy breasts (p < 0. 05), pressure thresholds in DIEP flaps at 12 months were lower than at 6 months, showing a significant progressive sensory recovery (p < 0. 05). At 12 months postoperatively, the best sensibility recovery was found at the inferior lateral quadrant, the worst at the superior medial quadrant. Age and flap weight were factors related to the performance of sensory recovery. CONCLUSIONS: DIEP flap transfer for immediate breast reconstruction undergoes satisfactory progressive spontaneous sensitive recovery at 6 and 12 months after surgery, and operative time spent dissecting sensitive perforator branches and their coaptation in recipient site could be spared...|$|R

50|$|<b>Two-point</b> <b>discrimination</b> (2PD) is {{the ability}} to discern that two nearby objects {{touching}} the skin are truly two distinct points, not one. It is often tested with two sharp points during a neurological examination and is assumed to reflect how finely innervated an area of skin is.In clinical settings, <b>two-point</b> <b>discrimination</b> is a widely used technique for assessing tactile perception. It relies on the ability and/or willingness of the patient to subjectively report what they are feeling and should be completed with the patient’s eyes closed. The therapist may use calipers or simply a reshaped paperclip to do the testing. The therapist may alternate randomly between touching the patient with one point or with two points on the area being tested (e.g. finger, arm, leg, toe). The patient is asked to report whether one or two points was felt. The smallest distance between two points that still results in the perception of two distinct stimuli is recorded as the patient's two-point threshold. Performance on the two extremities can be compared for discrepancies. Although the test is still commonly used clinically, it has been roundly criticized by many researchers as providing an invalid measure of tactile spatial acuity, and several highly regarded alternative tests have been proposed to replace it.|$|E

5000|$|On July 29, 1977, H.F., a 51-year-old teacher, was {{attempting}} to remove a casserole dish from her new 600-watt microwave oven. The oven signaled {{the end of the}} heating cycle, but the light and the cooking blower were on. During retrieval of the dish, she inserted two thirds of her bare forearms into the oven, for a total time of about five seconds. The oven was still operating. She felt [...] "hot pulsating sensation" [...] and burning in fingers and fingernails and a sensation of [...] "needles" [...] over the exposed areas. Jabbing pain, swelling, and red-orange discoloration of dorsal sides of both hands and forearms appeared shortly afterwards. The next day she sought medical help. Since then, she has undergone treatment with oral and topical cortisone, Grenz rays, ultrasound, and later acupuncture, without relief. Symptoms persisted, including high sensitivity to radiant heat (sun, desk lamp, etc.) and growing intolerance to pressure of clothes and to touch in hands and forearms. Neurological examinations in 1980 and 1981 did not yield a definite diagnosis. Neuronal latencies were within norm. Electromyography discovered denervation in the median nerve, ulnar nerve, and radial nerve on both arms. Severe reduction of number of sweat glands in the finger pulps, in comparison with a random control, was also found. The injury was determined to be caused by the full power of the magnetron; the pulsating sensation was caused either by the stirrer (a mechanical mirror distributing the microwave beam across the oven space to prevent formation of hot and cold spots), or by the arterial pulsation in combination with increased nerve sensitivity. Damage to the A beta fibers, A delta fibers, and group C nerve fibers was the cause of the burning sensation. The increased hypersensitivity to radiant heat is caused by the damage to the A beta, A delta, and polymodal nociceptors (the group C fibers); this damage is induced by a single-time overheating of the skin to 48.5-50 °C, and the resulting sensitivity persists for a long time. Degeneration of the alpha motor neurons is also caused by the exposure to heat and radiation. Most of the major nerve trunks were not affected. Damage to the A beta fibers (located in the skin), discovered by the <b>two-point</b> <b>discrimination</b> test, is permanent; the Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner corpuscles, and Merkel nerve endings, which degenerated after denervation, do not regenerate. The sympathetic nervous system was involved as well; the reduction in active sweat glands was caused by destruction of their innervation, the initial edema and reddening was also caused by sympathetic nerve damage.|$|E
