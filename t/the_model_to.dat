5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>to</b> add information to the forecast. While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans {{may no longer be}} needed in the forecast process {{at some point in the}} future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E
5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>to</b> add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E

This paper presents an automated approach to efficiently articulate digital dental <b>models</b> <b>to</b> maximum intercuspation (MI). There are two steps in our method.

The second step is <b>to</b> finally position <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MI position based on our novel approach of using iterative surface-based minimum distance mapping with collision constraints. Finally, our method was validated using 12 sets of digital dental <b>models.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that using our method <b>the</b> digital dental <b>models</b> can be accu-rately and effectively articulated to MI position...|$|R
