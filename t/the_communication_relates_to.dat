40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 Examined in 35 {{parent-child}} dyads how {{parents and}} their children receiving treatment for cancer perceive their parent-child communication about the cancer experience, how demographic/social/medical variables relate to the communication, and how <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> child, parent, and family functioning. Patterns of communication are described for various aspects of communication. Parents and children were found to be more open than closed and more frequent than infrequent in their communication. Differences between informational and emotional communication were found, suggesting parents and children do distinguish between these two types of communication. Few differences were evident between children's styles and parents' styles of communication and between child report and parent report of communication, suggesting considerable congruence within dyads and across reporters. Demographic variables did not relate to communication; social variables showed primary relationships with emotional communication and medical variables showed primary relationships with informational communication. Openness and frequency of communication accounted for significant variance in family functioning and in social functioning but showed surprisingly little relationship with individual functioning. Results underscore the clinical importance of communication and effects of the aspect examined, reporter, and subject person on communication. Clinical implications and future directions for further study of communication about the cancer experience are discussed...|$|E

As well as the communication, the communication should also be considered. Because <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> the media used to express ideas and concepts {{in order to support}} the implementation of the duties and responsibilities given to the Regional Working Units (SKPD). In addition, organizational commitment should not be forgotten, because the organizational commitment related to the ability {{to take responsibility for the}} things entrusted to someone. The population consists of 31 managers who work at the Department of Religious Affairs of Surabaya City. The sample used is a census technique in which each member of the population has an equal chance to be sampled. The data used are primary data and secondary data. While the analysis techniques used are Linear Regression analysis. Later in the analysis of the results of the analysis with the tested classical assumption, F test and t test.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a runtime library for asynchronous <b>communication</b> in <b>the</b> Cell BE processor. The runtime library implementation provides with several services that allow the compiler to generate code, maximizing the chances for overlapping <b>communication</b> and computation. <b>The</b> library implementation is organized as a Software Cache and the main services correspond to mechanisms for data look up, data placement and replacement, data write back, memory synchronization and address translation. The implementation guarantees that all those services can be totally uncoupled when dealing with memory references. Therefore this provides opportunities to the compiler to organize the generated code in order to overlap as much as possible computation with <b>communication.</b> <b>The</b> paper also {{describes the}} necessary mechanism <b>to</b> overlap <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> write back operations with actual computation.

40|$|Communication is {{fundamental}} to the ongoing function of an organisation. Its study is important in order for communication managers to refine internal communication processes and achieve employee engagement, particularly with change communication. To gain a comprehensive understanding of <b>the</b> way <b>communication</b> is experienced in an organisation, {{it is necessary to}} examine it from the communicators' perspectives. An interpretive research approach seeks to understand phenomena from subjects‟ perspectives and so provided an ideal research framework for this study. This thesis reports on a study of the sense frontline staff within a large public health organisation made of <b>the</b> change <b>communication</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the change initiative Making Time for Caring (MT 4 C) and presents the conceptual model of sensemaking about change communication that emerged from this study. In so doing, it provides a rich picture of participants‟ sensemaking behaviour and a conceptual framework that could assist communication managers refine their internal communication management practices during change in similar organisations. Participants were selected from two primary hospitals within the chosen District Health Board. Both had implemented MT 4 C and the subsequent Fast Track Rollout (FTR) change initiatives that aimed to improve ward efficiency so staff had increased time to spend with patients. Using an interpretive approach, participants‟ accounts of their engagement with <b>the</b> associated change <b>communication</b> were gathered through three data collection phases, and analysed in order to develop a model that accounted for their engagement with <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> these two change initiatives.

40|$|Abstract Background Commercial food {{marketing}} has considerably shaped consumer food choice behaviour. Meanwhile, {{public health}} campaigns for healthier eating have had limited impact to date. Social marketing suggests that successful commercial food marketing campaigns can provide useful lessons for public sector activities. The {{aim of the}} present study was to empirically identify food marketing success factors that, using the social marketing approach, could help improve public health campaigns to promote healthy eating. Methods In this case-study analysis, 27 recent and successful commercial food and beverage marketing cases were purposively sampled from different European countries. The cases involved different consumer target groups, product categories, company sizes and marketing techniques. The analysis focused on cases of relatively healthy food types, and nutrition and health-related aspects in <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> food. Visual as well as written material was gathered, complemented by semi-structured interviews with 12 food market trend experts and 19 representatives of food companies and advertising agencies. Success factors were identified by a group of experts who reached consensus through discussion structured by a card sorting method. Results Six clusters of success factors emerged from the analysis and were labelled as "data and knowledge", "emotions", "endorsement", "media", "community" and "why and how". Each cluster subsumes two or three success factors and is illustrated by examples. In total, 16 factors were identified. It is argued that the factors "nutritional evidence", "trend awareness", "vertical endorsement", "simple naturalness" and "common values" are of particular importance in <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> of health with regard to food. Conclusions The present study identified critical factors for the success of commercial food marketing campaigns <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the issue of nutrition and health, which are possibly transferable to the public health sector. Whether or not a particular factor contributes to future success depends on the specific context of use, the combination of factors and the environment. Consideration of the specific applicability of the success factors identified in this study during the design of marketing activities could benefit public sector food and health-related campaigns. </p...|$|R
