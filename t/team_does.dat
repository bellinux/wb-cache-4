5|$|The Scotland {{national}} football team represents Scotland in inter{{national football}} and {{is controlled by}} the Scottish Football Association. It competes in the two major professional tournaments, the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. Scotland, as a constituent country of the United Kingdom, is {{not a member of the}} International Olympic Committee and therefore the national <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not compete in the Olympic Games. The majority of Scotland's home matches are played at the national stadium, Hampden Park.|$|E
5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi Arabia women's {{national}} football {{team would be}} the national team representing the kingdom in inter{{national football}}. However, the <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not yet exist because of influence of religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, systematic discrimination against women's sport, and active opposition of political leaders and sport administrators. International pressure has come {{to bear on the}} country to field a women's team, and FIFA now allows the hijab to be worn in competition. A meeting at the College of Business Administration in Jeddah was seen as a possible first step in a team eventually being created.|$|E

50|$|The 1932 team didn't {{have the}} {{dominating}} record that the 1931 <b>team</b> <b>did,</b> finishing 19-7 (7-4). But this <b>team</b> <b>did</b> {{something that the}} previous year's <b>team</b> could not <b>do</b> in winning the Southern Conference tournament defeating Mississippi State, Virginia, Duke, and North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} {{of having the}} players' last names added to {{the backs of their}} jerseys became universal. The old NFL <b>teams</b> <b>did</b> not have names on the back prior to this season, whereas the AFL <b>teams</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
25|$|Chad women's {{national}} football <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not officially exist, lacking any FIFA recognition, having not played in any FIFA recognised matches {{and failing to}} have competed in major regional and international competitions.|$|E
25|$|Closers {{are often}} the highest paid {{relievers}} on their teams, making money on par with starting pitchers. In the rare cases where a <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not have one primary pitcher dedicated to this role, the team {{is said to have}} a closer by committee.|$|E
25|$|If the fielding <b>team</b> <b>does</b> {{not start}} to bowl their 20th over within 75 minutes, the batting side is {{credited}} an extra six runs for every whole over bowled after the 75-minute mark; the umpire may add {{more time to}} this if he believes the batting team is wasting time.|$|E

50|$|In sports {{where only}} two teams play each other, most Division I <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> {{not have a}} single Division III team on their schedules, and most Division III <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not have a single Division I team on their schedules.|$|R
50|$|The second season, 1979, was {{disrupted}} by a players' strike which forced McCreadie {{out of retirement}} for a time. The <b>team</b> <b>did</b> worse on the pitch, finishing last, and worse at the box office, with 7,137 a match, with three <b>teams</b> <b>doing</b> worse.|$|R
25|$|Spirit Day is Kent's fall {{athletic}} day. All athletic {{teams have}} home games that weekend {{and the traditional}} opponent on Spirit Day is Loomis Chaffee. In fact, the day was called Loomis Day until league rules limited Kent from playing Loomis in football. Because the football <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not play Loomis, it is now called Spirit Day.|$|E
25|$|Another, however informal, tennis {{format is}} called Canadian doubles. This {{involves}} three players, with one person playing a doubles team. The single player gets {{to utilize the}} alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team. Conversely, the doubles <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not use the alleys when executing a shot. The scoring {{is the same as}} a regular game. This format is not sanctioned by any official body.|$|E
25|$|The Array Team is {{responsible}} for creating the solar array that is {{the primary source of}} the vehicle's power. The Array <b>Team</b> <b>does</b> not just attach the solar cells to the car, but must also research encapsulation techniques to protect the fragile solar cells.

25|$|The Kerry {{branch of}} the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded in the year 1888. Gaelic {{football}} is the dominant sport in the county, with both the men's and women's teams among the strongest {{in the country at}} senior level. In hurling, the men's side compete in the sport's premier inter-county competition, the Liam MacCarthy Cup, while the camogie <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not compete at senior level.|$|E
25|$|The captain opts to bat second {{if he is}} {{confident}} that his team can successfully chase any total. Once the target is known, the <b>team</b> <b>does</b> {{not have to worry}} about setting a winnable score. The team just has to limit the opposition to a low score, and bat well to successfully chase the target. If the pitch does not deteriorate, batting second is usually a better option.|$|E
25|$|While Canada is not sanctioned to play Test matches, the <b>team</b> <b>does</b> {{take part}} in One Day International matches and also in {{first-class}} games (in the ICC Intercontinental Cup) against other non-Test-playing opposition, with the rivalry against the United States cricket team being as strong in cricket {{as it is in}} other team sports. The match between these two nations is in fact the oldest international fixture in cricket, having first been played in 1844.|$|E

Busch did not comment on {{whether or not he was}} preparing for Indianapolis 500. In January 2014 he insisted that he is interested in competing at the Indianapolis 500.|$|E
25|$|A {{non-directional}} marker {{indicates the}} presence of a diver or team beyond a point and is mainly useful for that team. They may be used to indicate the direction the team came from and intend to exit by when the intersection is already marked by arrows, particularly if there are alternatives available which the <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not want to use. To avoid confusing other divers, these temporary markers are removed on the way out.|$|E
25|$|The drop-kicking team might {{attempt to}} gain {{possession}} by executing a short kick {{and have their}} players attempt to reach the ball before the other <b>team</b> <b>does,</b> but this carries {{the risk that the}} other team could gain possession very close to the try-line. The drop-kicking team might also attempt to gain possession by kicking the ball so that it bounces before going into touch, in that event they would be awarded head and feed at the resulting scrum.|$|E

25|$|The <b>team</b> <b>does</b> {{not take}} part in any {{international}} competitions (the 1998 Commonwealth Games tournament being an exception), but rather in inter-regional competitions in the Caribbean, such as the Carib Beer Cup and the KFC Cup, and the best players may be selected for the West Indies cricket team, which plays international cricket. Jamaica has won the domestic first class competition eight times, and they have also won the one-day competition six times – and shared the title once.|$|E
25|$|The Afghan {{national}} cricket <b>team</b> <b>does</b> {{not play}} its home matches inside Afghanistan {{due to the}} ongoing security situation {{and the lack of}} international standard facilities. Afghanistan played their 'home' Intercontinental Cup fixture against Ireland at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Sri Lanka. Following Afghanistan's World Twenty20 qualifying campaign they played two One Day Internationals against Canada at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in the UAE, after which the stadium was named the 'home' ground of Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|When {{the school}} board rejects her request to play boys's soccer, Gracie files an appeal. Citing the newly passed Title IX, Gracie argues that since a girls's soccer <b>team</b> <b>does</b> not exist, she {{should be allowed to}} play on the boys's varsity soccer team. The school board allows her to try out for the team. After a very rough tryout, she makes the junior varsity team and has to decide if she is willing to settle for playing at that level. She decides {{to make the most of}} playing on junior varsity.|$|E
