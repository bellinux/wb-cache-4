5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist teachings {{describe}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> manifests {{moment to}} moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing. The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream {{has been described as}} happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain. The manifestation of the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.|$|E

Yet, paradoxically, when shooting with his rifle he was a well below average shot – a trait he shared with some other successful pilots. MacKellar was a keen sportsman. He believed physical fitness was a critical attribute in aerial combat; fitness, he believed, would ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> and body were always at their peak of alertness, and enable a pilot to react swiftly within a fluid battle situation.|$|E

5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> {{control device}} turns people's fears into paranoid delusions. Mulder tries to contact Dr. Stroman with no success. He traces Dr. Stroman's location {{to an empty}} hotel room where he finds cigarettes in the ash tray. Using the phone log for the room Mulder tracks Stroman to a house where he spots him meeting with the cable repairman. However, by the time Mulder enters, shots ring out, and Mulder finds both men dead, with X (Steven Williams) responsible for their murders. X used a third party to inform Mulder, knowing he had orders to kill the men, but Mulder {{was not able to}} piece things together in time. Mulder calls him a coward but X tells Mulder that Mulder needs him. Later, X meets in a car with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis).|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E

Armstrong offers this view as a true account of <b>the</b> <b>mind.</b> It is more fully developed in Belief, Truth and Knowledge (1973), ch. 2, sect. 2.|$|R
50|$|As in Aristotelianism then, Kantianism claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> human <b>mind</b> must itself have {{characteristics}} {{which are}} beyond nature, metaphysical, in some way. Specifically, Kant argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> human <b>mind</b> comes ready-made with a priori programming, so to speak, which {{allows it to}} make sense of nature.|$|R
5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world {{can be thought of as}} either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.|$|E
25|$|Following from Ajaan Mun's {{reported}} insight <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> precedes mental fashionings, Ajaan Mun further asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> sheds its {{attachments to}} its preoccupations yet is not itself annihilated during the Nirvana experience. The mind {{of one who}} has attained Nirvana (Pali: arahant, meaning “perfected person”) continues.|$|E
25|$|Many modern {{philosophers}} of mind adopt {{either a}} reductive or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> {{is not something}} separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. {{in the fields of}} sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences. Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position which challenges the notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is a purely physical construct.|$|E
60|$|As a {{clear idea}} is <b>that</b> whereof <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> has such a full and evident perception, as it does receive from an outward object {{operating}} duly on a well-disposed organ, so a DISTINCT idea is <b>that</b> wherein <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> perceives a difference from all other; and a CONFUSED idea is such an one as is not sufficiently distinguishable from another, from which {{it ought to be}} different.|$|R

25|$|Dualism and monism are the {{two major}} schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the {{position}} that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It {{can be traced back}} to Plato, Aristotle and the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, but it was most precisely formulated by René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is an independently existing substance, whereas Property dualists maintain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance.|$|E

25|$|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the New Catholic Encyclopedia give two {{possible}} replies to these objections. The first reply is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> {{may influence the}} distribution of energy, without altering its quantity.

25|$|In three short papers {{published}} in the early sixties, Feyerabend sought to defend materialism against the supposition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> cannot be a physical thing. Feyerabend suggested that our commonsense understanding of the mind was incommensurable with the (materialistic) scientific view, but that nevertheless we ought to prefer the materialistic one on general methodological grounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} an empirically {{identifiable}} meeting point between the non-physical mind and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism and many modern philosophers of mind maintain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is not something separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly {{in the fields of}} sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology, and the neurosciences.|$|E

25|$|Mind–body dualism, or mind–body duality, {{is a view}} in the {{philosophy}} of mind that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> and body are distinct and separable.

25|$|Other theorists in {{developmental}} psychology {{have suggested that}} religiosity comes naturally to young children.
