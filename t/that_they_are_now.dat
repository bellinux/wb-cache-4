5|$|At {{the same}} time, Wilhelmina (Vanessa Williams) is {{in a coma}} from being shot by Tyler (Neal Bledsoe). Claire Meade (Judith Light) is the only witness and a {{possible}} suspect. When she wakes up, she is visited by Connor Owens (Grant Bowler), who tells her that he cannot live without her. Upon leaving the hospital, Wilhelmina holds a press conference and tells the reporters that she shot herself accidentally. Claire thanks her for not mentioning Tyler and Wilhelmina tells her <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> good. Daniel later tells Wilhelmina that he is stepping down as editor of MODE and gives her his job.|$|E
5|$|In the subplot, Bart cuts {{school on}} the day {{students}} were choosing their physical education classes. By the time he shows up, the only option left is ballet. Despite being reluctant at first, he soon discovers {{that he has a}} talent for the dance form, and is invited to star in a school ballet performance. After his performance, school bullies attempt to beat him up, and he runs away. Bart attempts to escape by jumping a trench, but fails to make it and takes a nasty fall. The bullies leave, while Lisa tells Bart how proud she is of him, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> kindred spirits.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{languages}} of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area exhibit similar classifier systems, leading to {{speculation about the}} origins of the Chinese system. Ancient classifier-like constructions, which used a repeated noun rather than a special classifier, are attested in Old Chinese as early as 1400 BCE, but true classifiers did not appear in these phrases until much later. Originally, classifiers and numbers came after the noun rather than before, and probably moved before the noun sometime after 500 BCE. The use of classifiers did not become a mandatory part of Old Chinese grammar until around 1100 CE. Some nouns became associated with specific classifiers earlier than others, the earliest probably being nouns that signified culturally valued items such as horses and poems. Many words that are classifiers today started out as full nouns; in some cases their meanings have been gradually bleached away so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> used only as classifiers.|$|E
5|$|Scully is {{approached}} by the Dark Figure, who is {{revealed to be}} a Seraph, an angel who descended from the heavens and fathered four children with a mortal woman. God sent the Seraph to return the girls to Heaven {{in order to keep}} the Devil from claiming them as his own. Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but the women are confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly lets go of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder they should have been protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> in a place where they were meant to be.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} foundation {{ancestors of}} the Colorado Ranger were two stallions brought to the United States and given to US president Ulysses S. Grant by the Turkish Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1878. The first horse was a gray Barb named Linden Tree, foaled in 1874. The second was a desertbred Arabian, also gray, named Leopard, foaled in 1873. The two stallions reached Virginia in 1879, after their voyage from Turkey. Upon reaching Virginia, they spent 14 years in the breeding herds of Randolph Huntington, a noted breeder of trotting and roadster horses. In 1896, Randolph leased Leopard and Linden Tree {{to a friend of}} Grant's, named General Colby, who used to stallions to breed a number of mares on his ranch in Nebraska. These breedings were successful at producing high-quality ranch horses, and a few years later several ranches in Colorado collaborated to buy a group of horses, including one stallion, from the Colby Ranch. All of the mares were sired by one of the two imported sires, and the stallion, a few-spot leopard Appaloosa, was a grandson of Leopard on both sides of his pedigree. The influence of Linden Tree and Leopard on American horse breeding was such <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> listed in the studbooks for the Arabian Horse Association and the Jockey Club (which registers Thoroughbreds), both major breed associations in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many waterfowl, mallards {{have benefited}} from human {{alterations}} to the worldso much so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> considered an invasive species in some regions. They are a common sight in urban parks, lakes, ponds, and other man-made water features in the regions they inhabit, and are often tolerated or encouraged in human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours. While most are not domesticated, mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk they pose comes {{from the loss of}} genetic diversity among a region's traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area. Mallards are very adaptable, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous waterfowl. These non-migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations.|$|E

25|$|Next is Aristophanes, {{the comic}} playwright. Aristophanes tells a fantastical, mythological {{story about how}} humans were at one time twice the people <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> but this was seen as {{threatening}} to the gods, so Zeus to cut everyone in half. And ever since, humans go about in search of their other half, {{in order to become}} whole. Agathon, the host, follows Aristophanes, and his speech sees Eros as youthful, beautiful, and wise; and as the source of all human virtues.|$|E
25|$|Shatner has {{appeared}} in advertisements for many companies and products. In the early 1980s he appeared in print and television ads endorsing the Commodore VIC-20 home computer. Since the late 1990s he has done a series of commercials for the travel web site priceline.com, in which Shatner plays a pompous, fictionalized version of himself. Although he received stock options for the commercials, Shatner says that reports <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> worth {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars are exaggerated. Shatner was also the CEO of the Toronto, Ontario-based C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures, a special effects studio that operated from 1994 to 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} formed as Union of Christian and Centre Democrats in December 2002 upon {{the merger of}} the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD), the United Christian Democrats (CDU) and European Democracy (DE). In 2008 the party was {{the driving force behind}} the Union of the Centre (UdC), an {{alliance}} comprising, among others, The Rose for Italy, the Populars for the Constituent Assembly of the Centre, the Liberal Clubs, the Party of Christian Democracy, the Christian Democratic Party, Veneto for the European People's Party, the Democratic Populars and the Autonomist Democrats. Since then, the party's official name was neglected in favour of the alliance's and, since most of the UdC member parties have joined the UDC too, the UDC and the UdC started to overlap almost completely to the point <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> undistinguishable.|$|E

25|$|The {{important}} role of language, however, {{is not confined to}} the taming plot. For example, in a psychoanalytic reading of the play, Joel Fineman suggests there is a distinction made between male and female language, further subcategorising the latter into good and bad, epitomised by Bianca and Katherina respectively. Language is also important in relation to the Induction. Here, Sly speaks in prose until he begins to accept his new role as lord, at which point he switches to blank verse and adopts the royal we. Language is also important in relation to Tranio and Lucentio, who appear on stage speaking a highly artificial style of blank verse full of classical and mythological allusions and elaborate metaphors and similes, thus immediately setting them aside from the more straightforward language of the Induction, and alerting the audience to the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> in an entirely different milieu.|$|E
25|$|In summer 2003 at Michigan, Busch and Spencer {{had another}} run in. After Spencer was accidentally wrecked by Busch, he was livid. When the race ended, Spencer saw Busch driving by {{him in the}} garage. Spencer {{reportedly}} went into Busch's window and punched Busch in the face. Spencer was led away, and Busch {{was taken to a}} hospital with a broken nose and a dental injury. The next morning NASCAR and Ultra Motorsports declared that Spencer would be parked for the Cup race at Bristol the next weekend as a consequence. The week before the race Spencer also was fined $35,000 and put on probation {{for the rest of the}} year. Spencer was nearly arrested by the police for the charges of assault until NASCAR promised to handle it. After this incident Spencer and Busch did not get involved with each other anymore on the track. In 2013, Busch and Spencer announced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> close friends and no longer have grudges against each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} Queen Elizabeth II saw a {{departure}} from the normal practice in issuing gold coinage. A small number of gold £5 pieces were struck in 1953 in order to provide continuity of the series, and again in 1957, but neither of these strikings were released to the public, with the result <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> valued in the £250,000–£500,000 range. No further £5 gold pieces were struck until 1980, nine years after decimalisation, since when they have been issued somewhat haphazardly in most years. Coins from 1980 to 1984 use the Arnold Machin effigy of the Queen, while the 1985–1990 coins use the Raphael Maklouf effigy. All these years use the Pistrucci reverse. In 1989 a completely new design was used to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the first issue of the sovereign coin – the obverse shows the Queen seated on the coronation throne holding the orb and sceptre, with the legend ELIZABETH II DEI GRA REG FID DEF, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a double rose and the legend ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOLD SOVEREIGN 1489–1989.|$|E

25|$|Although the Talmud {{states that}} women are obligated to say birkat hamazon and that accordingly, three women can {{constitute}} a zimmun and lead it (Berachot 45b), later authorities, such as Maimonides and the Mishnah Berurah, held that women were exempt from leading a zimmun on grounds that women were not generally sufficiently educated to know how. A number of Modern Orthodox authorities have held that because of improvements in women's religious education women can now do so, and some say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> obligated to. Accordingly, women forming a zimmun and leading birkat hamazon has become increasingly common in Modern Orthodox circles. Such authorities disagree, however, on the appropriateness of women leading a zimmun {{in the presence of}} men (or of three men). A minority of Modern Orthodox authorities, citing earlier authorities including Meiri, Sefer HaMeorot and the Shiltei HaGibborim, also hold that 10 women can (or should) constitute a minyan for purposes of saying Zimmun B'Shem for birkat hamazon. Unlike in Conservative or Reform Judaism, even Orthodox authorities who hold that women can form a zimmun maintain that one cannot be formed from a combination of men and women.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Petr Benda and Peter Vallo {{have removed}} {{the other two}} Madagascan species to a {{separate}} genus Paratriaenops, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> known as Paratriaenops auritus and Paratriaenops furculus. The specific name of the extinct species, [...] goodmani, honors Steven Goodman for his research on Madagascan bats. The material of T.goodmani is from locality OLD SE within the cave and is about 10,000 years old or younger. A cladistic analysis using morphological data could not resolve the relationships of Triaenops goodmani, but did not place it with the other species of Triaenops and Paratriaenops studied. In a 2008 paper, Amy Russell and colleagues commented that cranial (skull) characteristics of T.goodmani suggest it {{is a member of}} the [...] "T.furculus/T.auritus group", now placed in Paratriaenops.|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{is based on}} the Top Fuel drag racing motor sport. A real Top Fuel dragster weighs {{approximately}} one ton, while each train on the coaster weighs 15 tons. Its dragster themed trains once had decorative spoilers and engines, but these were removed soon after opening, allowing an extra row of seats to be added to each one. Also, when the ride opened, it had only four cars on each train, including the decals. By the middle of the 2003 season, the fifth cars were added to all trains, making them the five cars long <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b> The fifth cars were added on shortly before the decals were removed. The ride's theme song, [...] "Ready to Go" [...] by Republica, is played while in the station.|$|E
