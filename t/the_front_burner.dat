40|$|The {{installed}} {{performance of}} cooking exhaust fans was evaluated through residential field experiments conducted on {{a sample of}} 15 devices varying in design and other characteristics. The sample included two rear downdraft systems, two under-cabinet microwave over range (MOR) units, three different installations of an under-cabinet model with grease screens across the bottom and no capture hood, two devices with grease screens covering {{the bottom of a}} large capture hood (one under-cabinet, one wall-mount chimney), four under-cabinet open hoods, and two open hoods with chimney mounts over islands. Performance assessment included measurement of airflow and sound levels across fan settings and experiments to quantify the contemporaneous capture efficiency for the exhaust generated by natural gas cooking burners. Capture efficiency is defined as the fraction of generated pollutants that are removed through the exhaust and thus not available for inhalation of household occupants. Capture efficiency (CE) was assessed for various configurations of burner use (e. g., single front, single back, combination of one front and one back, oven) and fan speed setting. Measured airflow rates were substantially lower than the levels noted in product literature for many of the units. This shortfall was observed for several units costing in excess of $ 1000. Capture efficiency varied widely (from < 5 percent to roughly 100 percent) across devices and across conditions for some devices. As expected, higher capture efficiencies were achieved with higher fan settings and the associated higher air flow rates. In most cases, capture efficiencies were substantially higher for rear <b>burners</b> than for <b>front</b> <b>burners.</b> <b>The</b> best and most consistent performance was observed for open hoods that covered all cooktop burners and operated at higher airflow rates. The lowest capture efficiencies were measured when a <b>front</b> <b>burner</b> was used with a rear backdraft system or with lowest fan setting for above the range systems that do not cover <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>burners...</b>|$|R

This is especially true since after the United Nations World Conference on Women in 1975 and the subsequent declaration of 1975 - 1985, as the Decade for Women. The gains of this decade were reinforced by the Beijing conference in 1995 and such other conferences. The result is not totally bad but since development trends require high powered skills, knowledge levels and competences, the acquisition of basic education is no longer adequate to enable both men and women to contribute effectively to national development. In the light of the above it recommended that the girls/women must be encouraged to remain in school long enough (higher institutions) to acquire the necessary skills {{to be able to be}} part of national development, government on its part must restructure the industrial sector to attract investors who are gender sensitive both in providing educational opportunities and in employment.

40|$|Venting range hoods are {{important}} residential ventilation components that remove pollutants generated by cooking activities {{and natural gas}} cooking burners. To address the lack of data on range hood installations in California, we conducted a survey by examining photographs of homes for sale or rent listed on a popular real estate web site. The survey was conducted in November 2010 and April–May 2011. Posted photos of the homes were reviewed {{to determine if a}} hood was installed, the type of hood, and two installation details that can impact performance, namely the height above the cooktop {{and the degree to which}} the hood covers the cooktop burners. We additionally collected information about the homes, including asking price for purchase or rent, type of building (e. g. detached house, townhouse or apartment), building age, floor area, and cooktop fuel type. Listings were first sampled to focus on homes built since 2005, then randomly sampled to include varied prices and locations around the state. Data were obtained for 1002 homes built between 1865 and 2011 (median year built 1989). Homes for sale varied in asking price from $ 16, 000 to $ 16, 500, 000 (median $ 353, 000) and homes for rent varied from $ 500 to $ 25, 000 (median $ 2125) per month. Approximately 74 % of the sample had natural gas cooktops. In this sample, natural gas cooktops were more prevalent in more expensive homes than in less expensive homes. Across the entire sample, 7. 4 % appeared to have no hood installed, 33 % had a short hood, 13 % had a deep hood and 47 % had a microwave over the range. The percentage of these hoods that vent to the outdoors could not be determined. Hood type was related to coverage of the cooktop. For deep hoods, 76 % appeared to cover most or all of the cooktop burners. For short hoods, 70 % covered about three quarters of the cooktop. And for microwaves the vast majority (96 %) covered the back <b>burners</b> but not <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>burners.</b> Hood type was also correlated with asking price or monthly rent, with deep hoods most common in the most expensive homes. Hood type was also correlated with home age, with microwave hoods more common in newer homes. Installation height was related to device type with microwaves installed lower (closer) to the cooktop (median 18 inches), and short hoods (median 28 inches) and deep hoods (median 30 inches) installed higher. Deep range hoods are more common with natural gas cooktops than with electric cooktops, and slightly fewer homes with natural gas cooktops lack a range hood (7 %) than homes with electric cooktops (9 %). This study provides limited but useful information about the characteristics of range hoods in California homes and demonstrates the potential value of non-traditional forms of data collection...|$|R

At highest fan settings and standard installation against the wall, Hoods A and C captured back cooktop burner exhaust at > 90 percent and Hood B at > 80 percent. In this configuration, CE for <b>front</b> <b>burner</b> exhaust was 73 - 78 percent for Hoods A and C but only 46 - 63 percent for Hood B.
