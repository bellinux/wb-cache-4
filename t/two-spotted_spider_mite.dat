40|$|Diapause in {{arthropods}} is {{a physiological}} state of dormancy that is generally thought to promote survival during harsh seasons and dispersal, {{but it may}} also serve to avoid predation in space and time. Here, we show that predation-related odours induce diapause in female adult <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> We argue that this response allows them to move into an area where they are free of enemies, yet forced to survive without food. Spider mites are specialised leaf feeders, but—in late summer—they experience severe predation on leaves. Hence, they face a dilemma: to stay on the leaf and risk being eaten or {{to move away from the}} leaf and risk death from starvation and thirst. Female <b>two-spotted</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> solve this dilemma by dramatically changing their physiology when exposed to predation-associated cues. This allows them to disperse away from leaves and to survive in winter refuges in the bark of trees or in the soil. We conclude that the mere presence of predation-associated cues causes some herbivorous mites to seek refuge, thereby retarding the growth rate of the population as a whole: a trait-mediated indirect effect that may have consequences for the stability of predator-prey systems and for ecosystem structure...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that pest species diversity enhances biological pest control with generalist predators, we studied the dynamics of three major pest species on greenhouse cucumber: Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), and <b>two-spotted</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> Tetranychus urticae Koch {{in combination with the}} predator species Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot. When <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> infested plants prior to predator release, predatory mites were not capable of controlling <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> populations in the absence of other pest species. A laboratory experiment showed that predators were hindered by the webbing of <b>spider</b> <b>mites.</b> In a greenhouse experiment, <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> leaf damage was lower in the presence of thrips and predators than in the presence of whiteflies and predators, but damage was lowest in the presence of thrips, whiteflies and predators. Whitefly control was also improved in the presence of thrips. The lower levels of <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> leaf damage probably resulted from (1) a strong numerical response of the predator (up to 50 times higher densities) when a second and third pest species were present in addition to <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> and (2) from A. swirskii attacking mobile <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> stages outside or near the edges of the <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> webbing.

40|$|Background: <b>Two-spotted</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> hide against predatory mites {{in a web}} of self-produced sticky silk. The {{proteins}} {{invested in}} this shelter may reduce investment in reproduction. Questions: Do <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> populations harbor genetic variation for web production, thereby enabling a response to selection by predation? Is adaptation affected by genetic trade-offs with life-history traits? The data were also used to test a central hypothesis in quantitative genetics, that heritability is indicative of the trait’s importance for fitness and is positively correlated with the amount of additive genetic variation across traits. Method: Using a mother-daughter breeding design, the narrow-sense heritability and coefficients of additive genetic and residual variation (CVA and CVR) were determined for web production and six life-history traits. In addition, correlations between heritable traits were examined for genetic trade-offs. Conclusions: Web production exhibited (marginally significant) heritability of 50 % and a high CVA. Thus, web production is not a fixed defense-related trait but probably has the potential to evolve. Three life-history traits revealed heritable variation. Genetic trade-off with web production were not found, but could not be excluded either. Using the life-history data, a positive relationship was found between heritability and CVA, which supports the hypothesis that the relationship of traits with fitness influences their amount of heritable variation...|$|R
40|$|Predatory mites, {{that are}} {{important}} natural enemies of Tetranychus <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> are less hindered by complex webs of the <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> than are other predatory mites that are natural enemies of other pest herbivores. This can be partly explained by their chaetotaxy, a morphological protection against the webs. However, it has up to now been unclear whether the ability to penetrate complex webs {{is related to the}} ability of thread-cutting behavior to reduce the effects of the webs. The two predatory mites Neo-seiulus cucumeris and Typhlodromus vulgaris, that are natural enemies of other pest herbivores, were often entrapped by the sticky silken threads while moving within the complex web produced by the <b>two-spotted</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> Tetranychus urticae. Once captured, their movements and foraging activities were hindered until their escape from entrapment. In contrast, N. womersleyi and Phytoseiulus persimilis, {{that are important}} natural enemies of Tetranychus mites, were significantly less frequently entrapped by the web and for shorter periods. Furthermore, N. womersleyi and P. persimilis cut significantly more silken threads within the web than did N. cucumeris and T. vulgaris. The different behavioral activities exhibited by N. cucumeris and N. womersleyi could not be explained by their rearing conditions (i. e., past experience with complex webs). These results supported the hypothesis and might offer an ecological indicator for distinguishing potential important natural enemies of Tetranychus mites from less useful types.

40|$|Lima bean plants {{respond to}} feeding damage of <b>two-spotted</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> (Tetranychus urticae) with the {{emission}} {{of a complex}} blend of volatiles that are products of several different biosynthetic pathways. These volatiles attract the carnivorous mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, a specialist predator of the <b>spider</b> <b>mites</b> that exterminates entire prey populations, and thus the volatiles contribute indirectly to plant defense. The volatile blend constitutes information to the carnivores, and blend composition {{is an important factor}} in this. Jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in the signal transduction of this induced defense. Application of JA through the petiole of Lima bean plants induces a volatile blend that is similar, but not identical, to that emitted by spider mite-infested plants. The induced volatiles originate from the lipoxygenase pathway, the shikimic acid pathway, and the isoprenoid pathway. Among the induced bean plant volatiles are nitriles and oximes. Of a total of 61 components, 10 are emitted at significantly different rates. Among these are the terpene (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene and the phenolic methyl salicylate, two compounds that are known to attract P. persimilis. A crucial test for comparing the effect of <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> damage and JA application on volatile induction is the response of P. persimilis. The carnivore is attracted by volatiles from JA-treated plants. Moreover, even treatment of Lima bean plants with methyl jasmonate vapor made the plants attractive to the carnivorous mites. However, the predators prefer the volatiles from spider-mile-infested Lima bean plants over those from JA-treated plants. Thus, chemical as well as behavioral analyses demonstrate that <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> damage and JA treatment have similar, although not identical, effects on volatile induction in Lima bean plants...|$|R
40|$|Jasmonic acid (JA) is a fatty acid–derived {{signaling}} molecule {{that regulates}} {{a broad range}} of plant defense responses against herbivores and some microbial pathogens. Molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis have established that JA also performs a critical role in anther and pollen development but is not essential for other developmental aspects of the plant's life cycle. Here, we describe the phenotypic and molecular characterization of a sterile mutant of tomato (jasmonic acid–insensitive 1 [jai 1]) that is defective in JA signaling. Although the mutant exhibited reduced pollen viability, sterility was caused by a defect in the maternal control of seed maturation, which was associated with the loss of accumulation of JA-regulated proteinase inhibitor proteins in reproductive tissues. jai 1 plants exhibited several defense-related phenotypes, including the inability to express JA-responsive genes, severely compromised resistance to <b>two-spotted</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> and abnormal development of glandular trichomes. We demonstrate that these defects are caused by the loss of function of the tomato homolog of CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE 1 (COI 1), an F-box protein that is required for JA-signaled processes in Arabidopsis. These findings indicate that the JA/COI 1 signaling pathway regulates distinct developmental processes in different plants and suggest a role for JA in the promotion of glandular trichome–based defenses...|$|R

During the three project years, 15 trials were conducted of which however only two yielded meaningful results. We found that the cheapest and most effective way to release T. pyri in hops is the transfer of vine cuttings gathered during the pruning of vines in late winter. Besides, the mixture of P. persimilis and N. californicus proved to be very effective. During samplings of the undersown crop of tall fescue in spring, predatory mites were recorded in low numbers. This is evidence that tall fescue can serve as a hibernation quarter for predatory mites. More studies are however needed to give more detailed answers to this thematic constellation...|$|R
