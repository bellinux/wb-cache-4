5|$|This war was {{the first}} {{occasion}} on which a Roman general had started a war without <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> senate or the people. This was a dangerous precedent and this became an example for the future.|$|E
5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited {{the construction of}} castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown {{points out that the}} word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Matson {{renamed the}} ship Kalani, and {{continued}} using her in Hawaiian service through 1940.

Six days after the approval, Kalani, now under British registry, departed from Los Angeles for New York.|$|E

5|$|In a 1987 sermon Lefebvre, at age 81, {{experiencing}} failing health, {{announced his}} intention to consecrate a bishop to carry on his work after his death. This was controversial because, under Catholic canon law, the consecration of a bishop requires <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pope.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the church}} and rectory had been completed, the workers began to {{envision}} a plaza. The area that was to become the oval was still occupied by the mansion {{that was on the}} Mt. St. Peter grounds. With <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chancery Office of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, the mansion was demolished and {{only a few of the}} fixtures were removed by the church prior to the demolition.|$|E

5|$|The Intelligence Support Activity (ISA, The Activity) is {{the support}} branch of JSOC and USSOCOM. Its primary {{missions}} are to provide Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) mainly for Delta and DEVGRU's operations. Before the establishing of the Strategic Support Branch in 2001, the ISA required <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CIA to conduct covert operations, which considerably lessened its effectiveness in {{its support of}} JSOC operations as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The Presidio Chapel and {{courtyard}} {{were also}} completed during {{the construction of}} the quadrangle. The chapel is occasionally used for civic events such as musical concerts and lectures. Although not a canonical Roman Catholic oratory, Roman Catholic weddings are occasionally performed in the chapel with <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local Roman Catholic Santa Barbara Pastoral Regional bishop.|$|E
5|$|To promote ethnic harmony, in 1648 an {{imperial}} decree formulated by Dorgon allowed Han Chinese civilians to marry {{women from the}} Manchu Banners, with <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners, or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. Only later in the dynasty were these policies allowing intermarriage rescinded.|$|E

5|$|Beswick's mummified {{body was}} {{eventually}} bequeathed to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, {{where she was}} put on display and acquired the soubriquet of the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. The museum's collection was later transferred to Manchester University, when it was decided, with <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bishop of Manchester, that Beswick should finally be buried. The ceremony took place at Harpurhey Cemetery on 22July 1868, more than 110years after her death; the grave is unmarked.|$|E
5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, {{as well as}} many poems. He {{attempted}} to publish the poems in 1772, but was unable to obtain <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774, but soon discovered that the cost of printing, especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In 1610 the Constable {{gave the}} cup to a convent in Medina de Pomar, near Burgos, as the {{inscription}} describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent. A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, for {{the cup to}} be used as a ciborium, or container for consecrated hosts. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.|$|E

5|$|In 1935 Reich {{bought an}} {{oscillograph}} and attached it {{to friends and}} students, who volunteered to touch and kiss each other while Reich read the tracings. One of the volunteers was a young Willy Brandt, the future chancellor of Germany. At the time, {{he was married to}} Reich's secretary, Gertrude Gaasland, and was living in Norway to organize protests against the Nazis. Reich also took measurements from the patients of a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, with <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital's director. Reich described the oscillograph experiments in 1937 in Experimentelle Ergebniße Über Die Elektrische Funktion von Sexualität und Angst (The Bioelectrical Investigation of Sexuality and Anxiety).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Barry Cunliffe decided {{to examine a}} single hill fort and its {{surrounding}} territory {{in an attempt to}} shed light on Iron Age society, its politics, and population. With <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site's owner, Hampshire County Council, archaeological excavations began in 1969 and continued until 1988. Over the twentyseasons archaeologists spent examining the site, they looked at the defences and the gateway, and excavated 57% of the interior, where the remains of wattle and timber houses were discovered. It was the lengthiest investigation of any hill fort in western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Many people camp on Helvellyn {{throughout}} the year, often near Red Tarn which gives good views of Striding Edge, Swirral Edge, and {{the summit of}} Helvellyn itself. Although camping in England is illegal without <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landowner, there is a tradition of wild camping in the Lake District. This has often been tolerated so long as people have camped unobtrusively, {{for no more than}} one night, and have left no trace of their campsite behind.|$|E

In 2007, the government of Canada offered a one-time ex gratia payment of $20,000 as compensation for Agent Orange exposure at CFB Gagetown. On July 12, 2005, Merchant Law Group LLP on behalf of over 1,100 Canadian veterans and civilians who were living {{in and around the}} CFB Gagetown filed a lawsuit to pursue class action litigation concerning Agent Orange and Agent Purple with the Federal Court of Canada. On August 4, 2009, the case was rejected by the court due to lack of evidence. The ruling was appealed.|$|E

After a series of problems emerged, including vagueness on a point even the House of Lords was unable to clarify and poor draftsmanship, the Act was repealed bit by bit during the 1970s, with the Limitation Act 1980 scrapping the last remaining sections.|$|E
