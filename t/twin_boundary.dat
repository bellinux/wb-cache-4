30|$|It {{has been}} widely {{reported}} that <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> strengthen nanowires regardless of their morphology—that is, the strength of nanowires goes up as twin spacing goes down. This article shows that <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> do not always strengthen nanowires. Using classical molecular dynamics simulations, the authors show that whether <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> strengthen nanowires depends on the necessary stress for dislocation nucleation, which in turn depends on surface morphologies. When nanowires are circular cylindrical, the necessary stress of dislocation nucleation is high {{and the presence of}} <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> lowers this stress; <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> soften nanowires. In contrast, when nanowires are square cylindrical, the necessary stress of dislocation nucleation is low, and a higher stress is required for dislocations to penetrate twin boundaries; they strengthen nanowires.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{molecular}} dynamics simulations on nano-twinned copper nanowires reveal that <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{do not always}} strengthen metallic nanowires. For nanowires with square cross-sections, strength increases as twin spacing decreases. In contrast, strength varies little with twin spacing for nanowires with circular cross-sections; the strength with a <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> is slightly lower than that in single crystals. Whether <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> strengthening metallic nanowires depends on the necessary stress required for dislocation nucleation, which in turn depends on the surface morphology of the nanowires. For nanowires with square cross-sections, the existence of sharp edges makes dislocation nucleation feasible at a lower stress than that needed for dislocation penetration through the <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries,</b> leading to a twin-spacing dependence of strength. For nanowires with circular cross-sections, the necessary stress for dislocation nucleation is high, so penetration requires no additional increase of stress. At the same time, the presence of intersections of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> and surfaces facilitates dislocation nucleation, leading to slight softening because <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> are present.|$|R

30|$|First, we {{analyze the}} {{necessary}} stress for dislocation nucleation at surfaces versus that for dislocation penetration of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries,</b> {{the latter being}} stress for yielding. According to Zhu et al. [24], dislocation nucleation stress or activation volume depends on surface conditions. With square cross-sections, the stress for dislocation nucleation is low, and additional stress is necessary for dislocations to penetrate <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Therefore, the presence of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> leads to increase of yield stress, as shown in Fig. 2. With circular cross-sections, the stress for dislocation nucleation is high, and this stress suffices for yielding also. Therefore the presence of <b>twin</b> <b>boundaries</b> leads no increase of yield stress.

40|$|Magnetic {{shape memory}} (MSM) {{materials}} {{are a new}} class of smart materials which exhibit shape deformation under the influence of an external magnetic field. They are interesting for various types of applications, including actuators, displacement/force sensors, and motion dampers. Due to the huge strain and the magnetic field-driven nature, MSM materials show definite advantages over other smart materials, e. g. conventional thermal shape memory materials, in terms of displacement and speed. The principle behind the magnetic field induced strain (MFIS) is the strong coupling between magnetization and lattice structure. The investigation of both static and dynamic magnetic domain structures in MSM materials is a key step in optimizing the properties for future possible devices. 	In this work, optical polarization microscopy is applied to investigate the <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> and magnetic domain wall motion in bulk NiMnGa single crystals. Surface magnetic domain patterns on adjacent sides of bulk crystals are revealed for the first time providing comprehensive information about the domain arrangement inside the bulk and at the <b>twin</b> <b>boundary.</b> The tilting of the easy axis with respect to the sample surface determines the preferable domain size and leads to spike domain formation on the surface. Out-of-plane surface domains extend into the bulk within a single variant, while a <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> mirrors the domain pattern from adjacent variants. Furthermore, magnetic domain evolution during <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> motion is observed. The partial absence of domain wall motion throughout the process contradicts currently proposed models. The magnetic state alternates along a moving <b>twin</b> <b>boundary.</b> With the abrupt nucleation of the second variant this leads to the formation of sections of magnetically highly charged head-on domain structures at the twin boundaries. On the other hand, a dynamic actuation experimental setup, which is capable to provide high magnetic fields {{in a wide range of}} frequency, was developed in the course of this study. The observation of reversible <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> motion up to 600 Hz exhibits the dependence of strain, hysteresis, and <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> velocity on the actuation speed. MFIS increases with frequency, while the onset field is similar in all observed cases. <b>Twin</b> <b>boundary</b> mobility enhancement by fast <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> motion is proposed to explain the increase in MFIS. The <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> velocity is shown to be inversely proportional to the <b>twin</b> <b>boundary</b> density.
