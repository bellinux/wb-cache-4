5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
500|$|Furtado {{wanted to}} make a pop music record [...] "to prove <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could be more streamlined", and cited as a major {{influence}} Madonna's album Ray of Light, saying that [...] "she was smooth but sexy, universal, epic, iconic!" [...] Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine suggested for Furtado to work with Timbaland, who had produced Missy Elliott's [...] "Get Ur Freak On", which featured Furtado in a remix, and done a remix of Furtado's hit [...] "Turn Off the Light”.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E

500|$|If we {{stick to}} the Faust story – if I had been in that story – and I had sold my soul [...] for fame and fortune, and had the arrogance of [...] to not want {{to pay back the}} deal, it's taken a few years for me to {{acknowledge}} <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was hearing: 'Manson , the hell hounds are on your trail.' And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince myself that I was. I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E
500|$|During {{a trip to}} California on Republican Party {{business}} {{in the summer of}} 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, I have no idea what you mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could have married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E
2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a rapper." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I 'm {{not afraid}} of running short," [...] she said gayly, still looking at the {{opposite}} houses. [...] "I could sit here all day, saying <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> here <b>I</b> am at last. It's so dark and old and different." ...|$|R

2500|$|Walking {{home from}} school just before her tenth birthday, she was {{reportedly}} gang raped by five men. According to Satana, her attackers were never prosecuted, and it was rumored that the judge had been paid off. She tells how this prompted her to learn martial arts, such as aikido and karate. Over the next 15 years, she tracked down each rapist and exacted revenge. [...] "I made a vow <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would someday, somehow get even with all of them," [...] she said years later. [...] "They never knew who I was until I told them." [...] Around this time, she formed a gang, [...] "the Angeles", with Italian, Jewish, and Polish girls from her neighborhood. In an interview with Psychotronic Video, [...] she said, [...] "We had leather motorcycle jackets, jeans and boots...and we kicked butt." [...] Because of frequent delinquency, she was sent to reform school. When she was 13, her parents arranged her marriage to 17-year-old John Satana in Hernando, Mississippi, which lasted nine months.|$|E
2500|$|... "'I Won't Give Up' {{was written}} selfishly. As {{many of my}} songs are, I write {{for the purpose of}} {{understanding}} what the hell's going on in my life, my position in the world, processing that lesson and that miracle that I'm learning. Seeing it on the page, proving <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> understand the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that I can move on. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for. Whether we want to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} Razieh, a strong-willed {{little girl in}} Tehran, wants to buy a lucky {{goldfish}} for the upcoming Iranian New Year celebration, but struggles to get and {{hold on to the}} 500-toman banknote needed to purchase the fish. Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can do the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E

60|$|I told him, smiling, <b>that</b> {{no doubt}} <b>I</b> {{could have found}} a ship much nearer my native place, but <b>I</b> had thought <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> was <b>to</b> be a seaman then I would be a British seaman and no other.

60|$|I {{suppressed}} a groan and said <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must really {{get away from}} there.|$|E

60|$|March 7th.

60|$|Again I bowed, {{thinking}} <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{knew nothing}} that would please me more, who was eaten up with a devouring curiosity about this woman.|$|E
6000|$|I vowed <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would call}} him Rectus until his hair was gray. I'd write letters to him {{wherever}} he lived, and direct them: [...] "Rectus Colbert." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Grace, realizing {{his natural}} error, with a flush. [...] "It {{is n't in}} regard <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish to consult with you. It's another person--a friend"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ask no questions, {{and have}} endeavoured so <b>to</b> train <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should care but little about it. But I {{knew it was}} so."

5000|$|... "I {{have most}} of my life been brought up in a Republican {{tradition}} ...

6000|$|... "Have I not tried?" [...] he {{answered}} bitterly. [...] "Tell me, do I so easily relinquish my great desire? Why am I here? Because I have said <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{will not be}} denied. Adrienne shall be mine!" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{lamp and}} matches {{stood in the}} hall, and {{lighting}} the lamp, I whisked up stairs with suspicious rapidity, locked my door and retired to bed, firmly refusing to own even <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had ever heard the name of Bezee Tucker.|$|E
60|$|I {{laughed a}} little as I thought of my tears and cries when Giulia left me. It was not a matter worth troubling about; all I should have said <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a fool not to abandon her before she {{abandoned}} me. Poor Giulia! I quite frightened her in the vehemence of my rage.|$|R
