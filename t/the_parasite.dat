5|$|There {{are many}} parasites that inhibit the bluespotted stingray, {{this is a}} table of the common groups of <b>the</b> <b>parasite,</b> and the {{specific}} name of <b>the</b> <b>parasite.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> {{responsible}} for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus forms part of {{an unusual}} and highly {{regarded}} dish in North America, being one of several species parasitized by the lobster mushroom Hypomyces lactifluorum. Once colonized by <b>the</b> <b>parasite,</b> an orange-red crust forms {{over the surface of}} the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> infiltrates its host's tissues. It is also a common source of food among red squirrels.|$|E
40|$|Parasites and hosts {{have long}} {{evolutionary}} histories that have seen many innovations and adaptations. Natural populations of parasites {{have an interest}} in preventing too much damage to their host populations, but modern agriculture has created new environments where parasites and hosts do not interact as they once did. The new environments favour <b>the</b> <b>parasites,</b> and <b>the</b> hosts need our help to keep <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> under control. To make the new environments favour the hosts, we have begun a war with <b>the</b> <b>parasites.</b> Our main strategy is to kill <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> with drugs. We are fighting a chemical war. <b>The</b> <b>parasites,</b> though, are finding ways to defend themselves. They are fighting a genetic war. I will briefly discuss some of the genetic aspects of the war that often sees <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> winning as they acquire resistance to our chemicals...|$|R
50|$|Coevolution between {{parasite}} {{and host}} {{can lead to}} hosts becoming resistant to <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> or <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> may evolve greater virulence, leading to immunopathological disease.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>parasites</b> {{may be seen}} in {{a stained}} blood smear. <b>The</b> <b>parasites</b> deform <b>the</b> {{erythrocytes}} into crescents and are visible as oval, pale staining bodies within the cell.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} May 2012, the Swiss {{government}} reported {{about half}} of the bee population had not survived the winter. The main cause of the decline was thought to be <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> Varroa destructor.|$|E
5|$|Just as predators such as {{angler fish}} have a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> gets eaten by the host. This deception provides <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> easy entry into the host, which they can then feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle. Researchers {{may be able to}} predict the host of such parasites based on their appearance and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Like all livestock, Brumbies {{can carry}} <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> Cryptosporidium parvum, which {{can result in}} serious {{gastroenteritis}} in people drinking contaminated drinking water.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>parasites</b> undergo sexual {{reproduction}} {{in the gut}} of the definitive host - a bird of prey. They form cysts and are then eaten by a small rodent. Within the gut of <b>the</b> rodent, <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> decyst. They invade the intestinal wall and are carried to the liver. They undergo schizogony in the hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. They then invade the nervous tissue of the rodent host, forming cytic structures. The infected rodent is then eaten by a bird, when the tissue cysts are digested, releasing <b>the</b> <b>parasites.</b> <b>The</b> <b>parasites</b> invade <b>the</b> enterocytes, undergo merogony and gametogony. Gametes are formed which then fuse forming a zygote that undergoes encystation.|$|R

50|$|Her {{abdominal}} aorta gave off iliac branches to the autosite's legs and continued {{as a main}} trunk artery which gave off iliac branches to <b>the</b> <b>parasite's</b> legs and continued, and finally forked into <b>the</b> <b>parasite's</b> subclavian arteries.|$|R
5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{intercepts}} a {{distress signal}} from the Space Pirate frigate Orpheon, whose crew have been slaughtered by the Pirates' own genetically modified, experimental subjects. At the ship's core, she battles with <b>the</b> <b>Parasite</b> Queena giant version of the tiny parasites aboard the ship. <b>The</b> <b>Parasite</b> Queen is defeated and falls into the ship's reactor core, initiating {{the destruction of the}} ship. While Samus is escaping from the doomed frigate, she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta-Ridley. During her escape, an electrical surge and explosion damages her power suit, which revert to her original Power Suit. Samus escapes the frigate and chases her nemesis in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>parasite</b> is {{relatively}} protected from {{attack by the}} body's immune system because {{for most of its}} human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and {{is relatively}} invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P.falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins {{on the surface of the}} infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> from passage through the general circulation and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.|$|E
50|$|They {{attached}} the train that Gian found into the mysterious galactic express train. But {{when they were}} preparing to leave, <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> group found them and attacked them, but the humans won and all <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> were turned back into humans again.|$|R
50|$|Experiments {{published}} in 2000 discuss {{the analysis of}} two different snail populations from two different sources—Lake Ianthe and Lake Poerua in New Zealand. The populations were exposed to two pure parasites (digenetic trematode) taken from the same lakes. In the experiment, the snails were infected by their sympatric parasites, allopatric parasites and mixed sources of <b>parasites.</b> <b>The</b> results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> were more highly effective in infecting their sympatric snails than their allopatric snails. Though the allopatric snails were still infected by <b>the</b> <b>parasites,</b> <b>the</b> infectivity was much less {{when compared to the}} sympatric snails. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> were found to have adapted to infecting local populations of snails.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> seven Bloodlines <b>Parasites</b> {{were created}} for the Bloodlines crossover. <b>The</b> <b>parasites</b> premiered in Lobo annual vol. 2 #1 written by Alan Grant and drawn by Christian Alamy. <b>The</b> <b>Parasites</b> hail from <b>the</b> same {{dimension}} as a powerful Shaman named Pax who gained his own powers due to being bitten by {{one of them and}} left for dead. <b>The</b> <b>parasites</b> escaped from their prison dimension. In the Lobo issue, they encountered a grouping of L.E.G.I.O.N. officers, whom they killed and took their alternate human forms from. They later ended up on Earth, while there they took to feeding on humans.|$|R
5|$|Twelve years {{pass and}} Archer, still plagued by memory loss, lives with T'Pol {{in a house}} on the colony. They are visited by Doctor Phlox, who {{eventually}} engineers a cure. He also discovers that when the subspace radiation treatments kill one of <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> clusters in Archer's brain, it also vanishes from every other previous medical scanas if <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> had never existed. Therefore, since Archer will never have been infected, he would have remained Captain and possibly prevented the chain of events that led to Earth's destruction.|$|E
5|$|A bowl {{of living}} larvae is {{served at the}} meal, to Picard's disgust. He {{attempts}} to leave, only to find Riker blocking his way. The commander appears {{to be controlled by}} <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> Quinn brought to the Enterprise. When the others see a prosthetic protrusion on the back of Riker's neck, he is accepted as one of them and allowed to dine. They reveal that the parasites are seeking to take over Starfleet, using humanoids as hosts. When he is about to put a handful of the larvae in his mouth, Riker suddenly produces a phaser and fires on one of the Admirals. Picard picks up a fallen weapon and the two Enterprise officers subdue the infected, causing parasites to leave the hosts and flee. One of the parasites scurries under a closed door and Picard and Riker follow it. They find Remmick ingesting <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> to join several others inside him. Picard and Riker fire upon Remmick, destroying his body but freeing a giant parasite; the two continue to fire until it is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A {{nematode}} (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) {{causes the}} black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. <b>The</b> <b>parasite</b> also alters the behaviour of the ant, {{causing them to}} carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The droppings of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.|$|E
40|$|Apparently as {{a result}} of {{repeated}} passages through guinea pigs, the virulence of surra of Mauritius for mice became greatly attenuated. Three mice recovered spontaneously and two remained carriers of tryanosomes for four to seven weeks after <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> were last seen in their blood. The mice that recovered acquired no lasting immunity. While the virulence of <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> decreased for mice, it increased for guinea pigs. By cultivating <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> in mice <b>the</b> virulence for these animals was restored after four to eight passages...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>parasites</b> terrorize {{humanity}} by secretly {{killing them}} {{as sources of}} food. Shinichi himself has to fend against <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> who are disgusted {{of the fact that}} his body exhibits two consciousnesses. One of <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> also possesses Shinichi's teacher, Ryoko Tamiya; however, Tamiya is a lot more reasonable and is interested in studying the humans' way of life, which she does by becoming impregnated with fellow parasite Mr. A. Tamiya explains that despite having <b>parasite</b> parents, <b>the</b> baby she carries is a normal human.|$|R
50|$|At these sites, <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> {{lodge and}} form cysts, {{producing}} imflammatory reactions and clinical issues when they die, sometimes causing serious or fatal damage. In <b>the</b> eye, <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> can cause visual loss, and {{infection of the}} spine and adjacent leptomeninges can cause paresthesias, pain, or paralysis.|$|R
5|$|After a {{potential}} dormant {{period in the}} liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle. <b>The</b> <b>parasite</b> escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 20th century, malaria {{remained}} endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including large areas of Central and South America, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of zoonotic species of <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> have complicated control measures.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat {{is dark and}} stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are {{considered}} a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, {{as it can be}} infected with <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> Trichinella spiralis.|$|E
40|$|Infection with acanthocephalan parasite, Neoechinorhynchus agilis (Acanthocephala: Neoechinorhynchidae) is {{reported}} from adult mullet (Mugil cephalus). Heavy infections with <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> {{were observed in}} the posterior region of the intestine, almost blocking the lumen. At <b>the</b> site of <b>parasite</b> attachment, <b>the</b> surface of the intestine appeared thickened and the mucosal epithelium. A description of <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> and its clinicopathology is discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>parasites</b> {{may also}} invade {{erythrocytes}} and leukocytes.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{adhesion}} {{of three different}} strains of Trichomonas vaginalis to a polystyrene substrate was analysed. The process of adhesion was dependent {{on the time of}} incubation and the pH of the phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) in which <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> were suspended. <b>The</b> highest indices of adhesion were observed after an incubation time of 60 min at pH 6. 6. The adhesion index increased when <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> were incubated in the presence of culture media or when Ca++ or Mg++ was added to the PBS solution, whereas cytochalasin B, trypsin or neuraminidase reduced adhesion. Incubation of <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> in <b>the</b> presence of poly-L-lysine facilitated the process of adhesion. Incubation of <b>the</b> <b>parasites</b> or polystyrene beads in the presence of poly-L-lysine led to important changes in their surface charge...|$|R
5|$|Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P.falciparum malaria {{does occur}} naturally, {{but only in}} {{response}} to years of repeated infection. An individual can be protected from a P.falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation. The highly polymorphic nature of many P.falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> from completing its development in the mosquito. Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own. For example, SPf66 was tested extensively {{in areas where the}} disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) {{takes his}} new companion Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman) to the Rings of Akhaten, where several planets revolve around a larger one. They attend a religious festival where the young Queen of Years, Merry Gejelh (Emilia Jones), {{is about to}} be sacrificed. Determined to save Merry, the Doctor and Clara come face-to-face with <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> of Akhaten, who requires memories, stories, and items of sentimental value.|$|E
5|$|L.gigas is {{very often}} parasitized by protists of the phylum Apicomplexa, which are common mollusk parasites. Those coccidian parasites, which are spore-forming, {{single-celled}} microorganisms, initially establish themselves in large vacuolated {{cells of the}} host's digestive gland, where they reproduce freely. The infestation may proceed to the secretory cells of the same organ. The entire life cycle of <b>the</b> <b>parasite</b> typically occurs within a single host and tissue.|$|E
