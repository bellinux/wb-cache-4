60|$|When {{the captain}} was gone, I sent for the men up to me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> and entered seriously into {{discourse}} with them of their circumstances: I told them, I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain carried them away, they would certainly be hanged: I shewed them their captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect.|$|E

60|$|They said {{my mother}} would not be awake nor admit us {{for an hour or}} two, and in the {{meantime}} Eustace was ready <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartments,</b> for indeed we had hardly seen one another.

60|$|And {{a day or}} {{two later}} he meandered up the Avenue <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> to tell me that all was well. The uncle had written Muriel a letter so {{dripping}} with the milk of human kindness that if he hadn't known Mr. Worple's handwriting Corky would have refused to believe him the author of it. Any time it suited Miss Singer to call, said the uncle, he would be delighted to make her acquaintance.|$|E
60|$|When {{the captain}} was gone I sent for the men up to me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> and entered seriously into {{discourse}} with them on their circumstances.

'They {{were both}} in full dress, and my uncle, taking a bundle from Nixon, said to me, [...] "Lilias, I am come to carry you to see a grand ceremony--put on as hastily as you can the dress you will find in that parcel, and prepare to attend me."

6000|$|But the gentler prince paused. [...] "It is true," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have brought}} the vengeance of an unforgiving devil upon this {{helpless}} creature.

Ha! thou at mine elbow, honest Harry Smith? What dost thou here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'However, the {{troubles}} {{caused by the}} unfortunate exchange were only just beginning. My head, without thinking what it was doing, led the prince's body <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartments.</b> But <b>my</b> women, only looking at the dress, declared I had mistaken the corridor, and called some slaves to conduct me to his Highness's rooms. This was bad enough, but when--as it was still night--my servants began to undress me, I nearly fainted from surprise and confusion, and no doubt the Prince's head was suffering {{in the same manner}} {{at the other end of}} the castle! ...|$|R
6000|$|From the parlour M. Pelet {{conducted}} me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> my [...] "chambre," [...] as Monsieur {{said with}} a certain air of complacency. It was a very small room, with an excessively small bed, but M. Pelet gave me to understand that I was to occupy it quite alone, which was of course a great comfort. Yet, though so limited in dimensions, it had two windows. Light not being taxed in Belgium, the people never grudge its admission into their houses; just here, however, this observation is not very APROPOS, {{for one of these}} windows was boarded up; the open windows looked into the boys' playground. I glanced at the other, as wondering what aspect it would present if disencumbered of the boards. M. Pelet read, I suppose, the expression of my eye; he explained:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|On this {{occasion}} Scott says, [...] "After a very hospitable reception {{from the late}} Peter Proctor, seneschal of the castle, I was conducted <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> in a distant part of the building. I must own, that when I heard door after door shut, after my conductor had retired, I began to consider myself as {{too far from the}} living, and somewhat too near the dead. We had passed through what is called 'the King's Room,' a vaulted apartment, garnished with stags' antlers and similar trophies of the chase, and said by tradition to be the spot of Malcolm's murder, and I had an idea of the vicinity of the castle chapel. In spite of the truth of history, the whole night scene in Macbeth's castle rushed at once upon my mind, and struck my imagination more forcibly than even when I have seen its terrors represented by the late John Kemble and his inimitable sister. In a word, I experienced sensations which, though not remarkable either for timidity or superstition, did not fail to affect me {{to the point of being}} disagreeable, while they were mingled at the same time with a strange and indescribable kind of pleasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the blessings}} {{reserved}} for her here, {{which most of}} all concerns us, was the occasional sight of her Brother. Brother {{in a day or}} two ["18th November," [...] she says; which date is wrong, if it were of moment (see OEuvres de Frederic, xxvii. part 1st, where their CORRESPONDENCE is).] ran over from Ruppin, on short leave, and had his first interview. Very kind and affectionate; quite the old Brother again; and [...] "blushed" [...] when, at supper, Mamma and the Princesses, especially that wicked Charlotte (Papa not present), tore up his poor Bride at such a rate. [...] "Has not a word to answer you, but YES or NO," [...] said they; [...] "stupid as a block." [...] "But were you ever at her toilette?" [...] said the wicked Charlotte: [...] "Out of shape, completely: considerable waddings, I promise you: and then"--still worse features, from that wicked Charlotte, in presence of the domestics here. Wicked Charlotte; who is to be her Sister-in-law soon;--and who is always flirting with my Husband, as if she liked that better!--Crown-Prince retired, directly after supper: as did I, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> where in a minute or two he joined me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will be so}} good, sir, as <b>to</b> leave <b>my</b> <b>apartments</b> immediately," [...] {{she said}} to Amelius. [...] "I make no claim to the week's rent, in {{consideration}} of the short notice. This is a respectable house, and it shall be kept respectable at any sacrifice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Barney briskly, [...] "let us go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartments</b> and get <b>to</b> work. Your highness"--and {{he turned}} toward the Princess Emma--"must be greatly fatigued. Lieutenant Butzow, {{you will see that}} a suite is {{prepared}} for her highness. Afterward you may call upon Count Zellerndorf, whom I understand returned to Lustadt yesterday, and notify him that I will receive him in an hour. Inform the Serbian minister that I desire his presence at the palace immediately. Lose no time, lieutenant, and be sure to impress upon the Serbian minister that immediately means immediately." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{evening before}} my {{departure}} for Blithedale, I was returning <b>to</b> <b>my</b> bachelor <b>apartments,</b> after attending the wonderful {{exhibition of the}} Veiled Lady, when an elderly man of rather shabby appearance met me in an obscure part of the street.|$|R
6000|$|Artabanus {{attempted}} to combat this idea by representing to Xerxes that dreams {{were not to}} be regarded as indications of the will of Heaven, but only as a vague and disordered reproduction of the waking thoughts, while the regular action of the reason and the judgment by which they were ordinarily controlled was suspended or disturbed by the influence of slumber. Xerxes maintained, on the other hand, that, though this view of the case might explain his first vision, the solemn repetition of the warning proved that it was supernatural and divine. He proposed that, to put the reality of the apparition still further to the test, Artabanus should take his place on the royal couch the next night, to see if the specter would not appear to him. [...] "You shall clothe yourself," [...] said he, [...] "in my robes, put the crown upon your head, and take your seat upon the throne. After that, you shall retire <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> lie down upon the couch, and go to sleep. If the vision is supernatural, it will undoubtedly appear to you. If it does not so appear, I will admit that it was nothing but a dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{arrived at}} Berlin {{the end of}} October [Monday, 17th, as above said]. My younger Brothers, {{followed}} by the Princes of the Blood and by all the Court, received us {{at the bottom of}} the stairs. I was led <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> where I found the Reigning Queen, my Sisters [Ulrique, Amelia], and the Princesses [of the Blood, as above, Schwedt and the rest]. I learned with much chagrin that the King was ill of tertian ague [quartan; but that is no matter]. He sent me word that, being in his fit, he could not see me; but that he depended on having that pleasure to-morrow. The Queen Mother, to whom I went without delay, was in a dark condition; rooms all hung with their lugubrious drapery; everything yet in the depth of mourning for my Father. What a scene for me! Nature has her rights; I can say with truth, I have almost never in my life been so moved as on this occasion." [...] Interview with Mamma--we can fancy it--"was of the most touching." [...] Wilhelmina had been absent eight years. She scarcely knows the young ones again, all so grown;--finds change on change: and that Time, as he always is, has been busy. That night the Supper-Party was exclusively a Family one.|$|E
6000|$|At length I {{told him}} that he was a {{fortunate}} man, and I trusted that he was grateful for so much light; and, rising, said I would take a lamp, and that I would pay him then for my lodging, for I expected to recommence my journey even as early as the sun rose in his country; but he answered in haste, and this time civilly, that I should not fail to find some of his household stirring, however early, for they were no sluggards, and I could take my breakfast with them before I started, if I chose; and as he lighted the lamp I detected a gleam of true hospitality and ancient civility, a beam of pure and even gentle humanity, from his bleared and moist eyes. It was a look more intimate with me, and more explanatory, than any words of his could have been if he had tried to his dying day. It was more significant than any Rice of those parts could even comprehend, and long anticipated this man's culture,--a glance of his pure genius, which did not much enlighten him, but did impress and rule him for the moment, and faintly constrain his voice and manner. He cheerfully led the way <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> stepping over the limbs of his men, who were asleep on the floor in an intervening chamber, and showed me a clean and comfortable bed. For many pleasant hours after the household was asleep I sat at the open window, for it was a sultry night, and heard the little river ...|$|E

60|$|I had {{sufficient}} leisure for these {{and many other}} reflections during <b>my</b> journey <b>to</b> Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted <b>to</b> <b>my</b> solitary <b>apartment</b> <b>to</b> spend the evening as I pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will come}} I thank you! I must run and tell Madame de Florac," [...] cried the happy young lady, and {{we entered the}} house together. [...] "How came you to be kissing Ethel's hand, sir; {{and what is the}} meaning of this early visit?" [...] asks Mrs. Laura, as soon as I had {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>apartments.</b>|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} we went together {{to see the}} ladies, and the General had a very hearty welcome from both of them, as I also had from Doña Mercedes, while Dolores received me with the utmost indifference, expressing no pleasure or surprise at seeing me wearing a sword in the cause which she had professed {{to have so much}} at heart. This was a sore disappointment, and I was also nettled at her treatment of me. After dinner, over which we sat talking some time, the General left us, telling me before doing so to join him in the plaza at five o'clock next morning. I then tried to get an opportunity of speaking to Dolores alone, but she studiously avoided me, and in the evening there were several visitors, ladies from the town with three or four officers from the camp, and dancing and singing were kept up till towards midnight. Finding that I could not speak to her, and anxious about my appointment at five in the morning, I at length retired sorrowful and baffled <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment.</b> Without undressing I threw myself on my bed, and, being very much fatigued with so much riding about, I soon fell asleep. When I woke, the brilliant light of the moon, shining in at open window and door, made me fancy it was already daylight, and I quickly sprang up. I had no means of telling the time, except by going into the large living-room, where there was an old eight-day clock. Making my way thither, I was amazed to see, on entering it, Dolores in her white dress sitting beside the open window in a dejected attitude. She started and rose up when I entered, the extreme pallor of her face heightened by contrast with her long, raven-black hair hanging unbound on her shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|This {{advice was}} delivered, in a {{paternal}} manner, by the youngest surgeon in the hospital, a kind-hearted little gentleman, {{who seemed to}} consider me a frail young blossom, that needed much cherishing, instead of a tough old spinster, who had been knocking about the world for thirty years. At the time I write of, he discovered me sitting on the stairs, with a nice cloud of unwholesome steam rising from the washroom; a party of January breezes disporting themselves in the halls; and perfumes, by no means from [...] "Araby the blest," [...] keeping them company; while I enjoyed a fit of coughing, which caused my head to spin {{in a way that}} made the application of a cool banister both necessary and agreeable, as I waited for the frolicsome wind to restore the breath I'd lost; cheering myself, meantime, with a secret conviction that pneumonia was waiting for me round the corner. This piece of advice had been offered by several persons for a week, and refused by me with the obstinacy with which my sex is so richly gifted. But the last few hours had developed several surprising internal and external phenomena, which impressed upon me the fact that if I didn't make a masterly retreat very soon, I should tumble down somewhere, and have to be borne ignominiously from the field. My head felt like a cannon ball; my feet had a tendency to cleave to the floor; the walls at times undulated in a most disagreeable manner; people looked unnaturally big; and the [...] "very bottles on the mankle shelf" [...] appeared to dance derisively before my eyes. Taking these things into consideration, while blinking stupidly at Dr. Z., I resolved to retire gracefully, if I must; so, with a valedictory to my boys, a private lecture to Mrs. Wadman, and a fervent wish that I could take off my body and work in my soul, I mournfully ascended <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> and Nurse P was reported off duty.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the first}} of these {{occasions}} I was only ninteeen or twenty years old, when I happened to pass a night in the magnificent old baronial castle of Glammis, the hereditary seat of the Earls of Strathmore. The hoary pile contains much in its appearance, and in the traditions connected with it, impressive to the imagination. It was the scene of the murder of a Scottish king of great antiquity; not indeed the gracious Duncan, with whom the name naturally associates itself, but Malcolm the Second. It contains also a curious monument of the peril of feudal times, being a secret chamber, the entrance of which, by the law or custom of the family, must only be known to three persons at once, viz., the Earl of Strathmore, his heir apparent, and any third person whom they may take into their confidence. The extreme antiquity of the building is vouched by the immense thickness of the walls, and the wild and straggling arrangement of the accommodation within doors. As the late Earl of Strathmore seldom resided in that ancient mansion, it was, when I was there, but half-furnished, and that with movables of great antiquity, which, with the pieces of chivalric armour hanging upon the walls, greatly contributed to the general effect of the whole. After a very hospitable reception from the late Peter Proctor, Esq., then seneschal of the castle, in Lord Strathmore's absence, I was conducted <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> in a distant corner of the building. I must own, that as I heard door after door shut, after my conductor had retired, I began to consider myself too far from the living and somewhat too near the dead. We had passed through what is called [...] "The King's Room," [...] a vaulted apartment, garnished with stags' antlers and similar trophies of the chase, and said by tradition to be the spot of Malcolm's murder, and I had an idea of the vicinity of the castle chapel.|$|E
60|$|The {{explanation}} came a week later. It {{was about}} ten o' clock at night; I had been dining by myself at a restaurant, and having returned <b>to</b> <b>my</b> small <b>apartment,</b> {{was sitting in}} my parlour, reading I heard the cracked tinkling of the bell, and, going into the corridor, opened the door. Stroeve stood before me.|$|R
60|$|After {{they had}} left I bid Carthoris good-night, for I was very tired, and going <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>apartments,</b> bathed and lay down upon my {{sleeping}} silks and furs for the first good night's sleep I had {{had an opportunity to}} look forward to since I had returned to Barsoom. But even now I was to be disappointed.|$|R
60|$|When I {{dismounted}} from my post-horse, I hastened <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>apartment.</b> He was traversing {{it with an}} air of composed {{and steady}} deliberation, which even my arrival, although an only son unseen for four years, was unable to discompose. I threw myself into his arms. He was a kind, though not a fond father, and the tear twinkled in his dark eye, but it was only for a moment.|$|R
