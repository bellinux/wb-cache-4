5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold <b>those</b> <b>assets</b> offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} assurance process typically {{begins with the}} enumeration and classification of the information assets to be protected. Next, the IA practitioner will perform a risk assessment for <b>those</b> <b>assets.</b> Vulnerabilities in the information assets are determined in order to enumerate the threats capable of exploiting the assets. The assessment then considers both the probability and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability in an asset, with impact usually {{measured in terms of}} cost to the asset's stakeholders. The sum of the products of the threats' impact and the probability of their occurring is the total risk to the information asset.|$|E

25|$|Most jurisdictions {{imposing}} {{an income}} tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets—that is, <b>those</b> <b>assets</b> not held {{for sale in the}} ordinary course of business. Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital. Some tax scholars have argued that differences in the ways different kinds of capital and investment are taxed contribute to economic distortions.|$|E
25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally <b>those</b> <b>assets</b> not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Gains on depreciable property used in a business are treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.|$|E
25|$|One early {{introduction}} of energy market concepts and privatization to electric power systems {{took place in}} Chile in the early 1981s, in parallel with other market-oriented reforms associated with the Chicago Boys. The Chilean model was generally perceived as successful in bringing rationality and transparency to power pricing. Argentina improved on the Chilean model by imposing strict limits on market concentration and by improving the structure of payments to units held in reserve to assure system reliability. One of the principal purposes of the {{introduction of}} market concepts in Argentina was to privatize existing generation assets (which had fallen into disrepair under the government-owned monopoly, resulting in frequent service interruptions) and to attract capital needed for rehabilitation of <b>those</b> <b>assets</b> and for system expansion. The World Bank was active in introducing a variety of hybrid markets in other Latin American nations, including Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, during the 1990s, with limited success.|$|E

5000|$|Keen has {{attempted}} to counter Marx's theory (in his view Marx's pre-1857 view, specifically) from a post-Keynesian perspective, by arguing that machines can add more product-value over their operational lifetime than {{the total value of}} depreciation charged during <b>those</b> <b>asset</b> lives. For example, the total value of sausages produced by a sausage machine over its useful life might be greater than the value of the machine. Depreciation, he implies, was the weak point in Marx's social accounting system all along. Keen argues that all factors of production can add new value to outputs.

25|$|The Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp {{was opened}} to public {{subscription}} in August 1781 to raise, nominally, half its capital in one thousand shares. In fact, the Company was seriously under-capitalized, {{as the other}} thousand shares held by the Proli group and Bolts were {{paid for by the}} nominal value of the assets of the former association. Bolts’s valuation of <b>those</b> <b>assets</b> was accepted at face value, but it was a fictitious valuation and in fact the new Company inherited the old association’s debts. It consequently suffered chronic lack of cash and had to resort to short term loans and bottomry bonds (for which the ships themselves were the collateral) at a premium of 30 to 35 per cent. Under these conditions, every voyage had to be a success for the Company to remain viable. Also {{under the terms of the}} agreement erecting the new company, Bolts ceded his charter to his Belgian partners in return for a loan of 200,000 florins (that is, his 200 shares in the Company) and the right to send two ships on his own account to China.|$|E
25|$|Benefits versus cost. The {{intention}} of locating US persons and their non-US financial accounts was to increase tax {{revenues from the}} interest, dividends, and gains of <b>those</b> <b>assets.</b> The majority of assets located was expected be the international equivalent of standard checking and savings accounts, where the applicable interest was less than 0.5% during 2015. The majority of that income is already (by tax treaty) attributable to the country where it resides. (IRS Form 1116 is normally used to credit foreign taxes upon passive income.) Another source from which FATCA intends to raise revenue is {{in the identification of}} a wider population of US persons. However, the majority (82%) of overseas US persons filing owe no tax to the US (due to tax treaties). At the congressional hearing on 26 April 2017, Congressman Mark Meadows stated that according to FATCA's drafters themselves, FATCA would, at most, reduce tax evasion by less than 1% (i.e. recoup less than $1billion out of an estimated $100billion in lost revenue). In contrast, he said, normal enforcement activities create a return of $20 for every $1 spent. Because $200million is being spent to implement FATCA in FY2017, the IRS commissioner’s own estimates show that just shifting the money from FATCA to general enforcement would increase tax revenues by over $1billion.|$|E

In a hearing held in 1993, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that [...] improprieties existed in the management of the trust and removed Barrett as executor. In another decision, the court found that Roddenberry had hidden assets from Star Trek in the Norway Corporation to keep funds away from his first wife, and ordered the payment of 50% of <b>those</b> <b>assets</b> to Eileen, as well as punitive damages. In 1996, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the original will, which stated that anyone who contested it would be disinherited, would stand. As a result, Dawn lost $500,000 from the estate, as well as a share of the trust upon Barrett's death.

Consistent with this tradeoff, we find that funds with named managers receive more positive media mentions, have greater inflows, and suffer less return diversion, but that departures of named managers reduce inflows, especially for funds with strong past performance. To the extent that the hedge fund boom differentially increased outside opportunities for successful named managers, we predict that it should have increased the costs associated with naming managers and led to more anonymous management. Indeed, we find that the shift towards anonymous management is greater in <b>those</b> <b>asset</b> classes and geographical areas with more hedge fund activity...|$|R
