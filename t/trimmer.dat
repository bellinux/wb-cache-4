40|$|AbstractThe {{tripartite}} motif (<b>TRIM)</b> protein, <b>TRIM</b> 5 α, restricts some retroviruses, including {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV- 1), from infecting the cells of particular species. <b>TRIM</b> proteins contain RING, B-box, coiled-coil and, in some cases, B 30. 2 (SPRY) domains. We investigated the properties of human <b>TRIM</b> family members closely related to <b>TRIM</b> 5. These <b>TRIM</b> proteins, like <b>TRIM</b> 5 α, assembled into homotrimers and co-localized in the cytoplasm with <b>TRIM</b> 5 α. <b>TRIM</b> 5 α turned over more rapidly than related <b>TRIM</b> proteins. <b>TRIM</b> 5 α, <b>TRIM</b> 34 and <b>TRIM</b> 6 associated with HIV- 1 capsid–nucleocapsid complexes assembled in vitro; the <b>TRIM</b> 5 α and <b>TRIM</b> 34 interactions with these complexes were dependent on their B 30. 2 (SPRY) domains.

40|$|<b>TRIM</b> protein {{family is}} an {{evolutionarily}} conserved gene family implicated {{in a number}} of critical processes including inflammation, immunity, antiviral and cancer. In an effort to profile the expression patterns of <b>TRIM</b> superfamily in several non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we found that the expression of 10 <b>TRIM</b> genes including <b>TRIM</b> 3, <b>TRIM</b> 7, <b>TRIM</b> 14, <b>TRIM</b> 16, <b>TRIM</b> 21, <b>TRIM</b> 22, <b>TRIM</b> 29, <b>TRIM</b> 59, <b>TRIM</b> 66 and <b>TRIM</b> 70 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC cell lines compared with the normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line, whereas the expression of 7 other <b>TRIM</b> genes including <b>TRIM</b> 4, <b>TRIM</b> 9, <b>TRIM</b> 36, <b>TRIM</b> 46, <b>TRIM</b> 54, <b>TRIM</b> 67 and <b>TRIM</b> 76 was significantly down-regulated in NSCLC cell lines compared with that in HBE cells.

SiRNA-induced knocking down of <b>TRIM</b> 59 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of NSCLC cell lines by arresting cell cycle in G 2 phase.

Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer's Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil. The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls. While some other educational reformers of the period such as Mary Wollstonecraft argued for co-educational instruction, <b>Trimmer</b> was opposed to such pedagogical changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately. The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—"a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desired them".
