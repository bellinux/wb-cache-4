5|$|This was {{the third}} Super Bowl to have two players rush for more than 100 yards as Dominic Rhodes had 113 for the Colts and Thomas Jones had 112 for the Bears. <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> is the third man to win the Super Bowl {{as a head coach}} as well as a player, {{following}} Tom Flores and Mike Ditka.|$|E
5|$|After the Colts owner Jim Irsay hired <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> in 2002, the Colts {{made the}} playoffs for nine {{straight}} seasons. They won five straight AFC South titles from 2003 to 2007 and had seven consecutive seasons of 12 or more victories from 2003 to 2009, {{the first time that}} has been achieved in the NFL's 90-year history. Much of the team's success throughout the 2000s was attributed to the trio of general manager Bill Polian, coach Dungy, and quarterback Peyton Manning.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his rise}} to fame, Jason McElwain {{wrote a book}} titled The Game of My Life. The book is written mainly by Jason, but {{includes}} sections written by his family, coach, and teammates. The Game of My Life is 243 pages long and was published on February 5, 2008 by New American Library. Editorial reviews were left by celebrities such as Magic Johnson, Doug Flutie, Rodney Peete, Holly Robinson Peete, and <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy.</b> The book was co-written by Daniel Paisner.|$|E
50|$|Monte Kiffin is {{the mastermind}} behind the Tampa 2 scheme, {{which is a}} slight {{modification}} of <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> Cover 2. His defensive philosophy has several hallmarks.|$|R
50|$|May 17, 2007 - Indianapolis Colts 38, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 35 in OT, October 6, 2003, the Colts {{trailed by}} 21 points with five minutes left in <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> first game back in Tampa Bay.|$|R
50|$|Caldwell joined <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> {{staff with}} the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2001 as quarterbacks coach. He {{followed}} Dungy to Indianapolis in 2002 and remained {{with him for}} his entire tenure, helping lead the Colts to a win in Super Bowl XLI.|$|R
5|$|Chicago and Indianapolis {{are the two}} closest cities, geographically, to {{ever play}} in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are {{slightly}} closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> to joke to Jim Nantz, {{at the end of}} the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.|$|E
5|$|On October 12, Manning led the Colts to a 31–3 {{blow out}} win at Lucas Oil Stadium against the Baltimore Ravens to avoid their first 0–3 start at home since the 1997 season. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the 17th {{time in his}} career for his effort of three {{touchdown}} passes and 271 yards passing. It was revealed during the game by CBS commentators Jim Nantz and Phil Simms that Manning had a second surgery on his knee before the season started. Colts coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> confirmed this report the day after the game.|$|E
5|$|Collier was {{recognized}} {{after his death}} for his sportsmanship, intelligence and mild manners. He {{was inducted into the}} University of Kentucky College of Education hall of fame in 2001. In 2007, the Kentucky chapter of the NFL Players Association established a Blanton Collier Award given annually to a football player or players who excel {{both on and off the}} field. Past winners include <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy,</b> Jim Brown, Gale Sayers and the Manning family: Archie, Olivia, Cooper, Peyton and Eli. A group of former Kentucky players in 2008 started the Blanton Collier Sportsmanship Group, which promotes ethics, education and integrity in sports. The non-profit organization now oversees the Blanton Collier Award.|$|E
50|$|Tampa Bay won 31-15, won {{the final}} regular season game at Tampa Stadium, and secured a home game against Detroit for {{the wild card}} playoffs. In only head coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> second season, the Buccaneers had a winning record {{and a return to}} the postseason.|$|R
50|$|The 2009 offseason {{saw many}} {{changes in the}} Colts organization, most notably being the fact the Jim Caldwell assumed the duties of head coach {{following}} <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> retirement, with Clyde Christensen being promoted to offensive coordinator. The 2009 season also marked the twelfth season that Peyton Manning was the starting quarterback for the Colts.|$|R
25|$|On January 12, 2009, Jim Caldwell who'd been a {{long time}} Colts {{assistant}} was chosen as the new head coach for the Indianapolis Colts after being named Dungy's future successor a year earlier. On November 1, 2010, the Colts added <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> name to the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor located on the middle balcony {{on the east side of}} Lucas Oil Stadium.|$|R
5|$|This game {{featured}} {{two teams}} ending long Super Bowl appearance droughts. The Colts, who {{finished with a}} 12–4 regular season record, were making their first Super Bowl appearance since winning Super Bowl V in the 1970 season during the team's tenure in Baltimore; they had moved to Indianapolis in 1984. Meanwhile, the Bears, who posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record, were making their first appearance since winning Super Bowl XX in the 1985 season. In addition, the Bears' Lovie Smith and the Colts' <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> both became the first African-American head coaches to coach in the Super Bowl, with Dungy the first to win.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Colts had {{a greatly}} {{improved}} defense over that of recent years. Combining this with their offense, they won their first 13 games, including a 40–21 rout of the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, New England. This was Manning's first road win against the Patriots in eight attempts, {{and his three}} touchdown passes earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. By Week 15, the Colts had a perfect 13–0 record, and had secured the AFC South and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, head coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> {{made the decision to}} play all of his regular starters against the Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26–17. Manning finished the 2005 season with , {{the first time he had}} thrown for under 4,000yards since his rookie season in 1998, largely because Manning sat out much of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched. His quarterback rating of 104.1 was the highest in the league for the season.|$|E
5|$|Six {{times in}} Colts history there were interim head coaches. In 1972, Don McCafferty was fired five games into the season. John Sandusky was named as the interim head {{coach for the}} rest of the season, during which he led the Colts to a 4–5 record, but he was not made the {{permanent}} coach the next year. In 1974, head coach Howard Schnellenberger started off the season 0–3 and was fired. Joe Thomas assumed the duties of head coach and finished the season at 2–12. In 1991, the Colts started off 0–5 and Ron Meyer was fired as head coach. Rick Venturi was named as the interim for the final 11 games. In 2005 <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> was forced to miss one game due to personal issues. Jim Caldwell was named as the one game interim. In 2012 offensive coordinator Bruce Arians was named as the interim head coach indefinitely after Chuck Pagano was diagnosed with leukemia four weeks into the 2012 NFL season. Arians led the Colts to a 9–3 record – the record being credited to Pagano – and made the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|On offense, <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> {{strategy}} {{involved a}} conservative, ball-control offense based primarily around running {{the ball and}} short, high-percentage passes {{when he was at}} Tampa Bay. At Indianapolis, he inherited and kept the offense designed by offensive coordinator Tom Moore because the offense was in the hands of someone he knew and trusted. In both cases, most of the offensive planning has been handled by his offensive coordinators.|$|R
50|$|The 2008 {{season was}} the Colts' inaugural season playing at Lucas Oil Stadium after {{playing at the}} RCA Dome for 24 seasons. This marks <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> 7th and last season as {{head coach of the}} Indianapolis Colts, and Peyton Manning's 11th season as the {{starting}} quarterback. As a result of his play over the final two months of the regular season, Manning was awarded his third MVP award.|$|R
5000|$|On October 6, the Buccaneers {{hosted the}} Indianapolis Colts on Monday Night Football. It marked former coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> return to Tampa Bay, {{and he was}} well {{received}} by fans. During pre-game warm-ups, Warren Sapp stirred up controversy when he skipped through the Colts players, who were spread out over the field stretching. It was Sapp's second such [...] "skipping" [...] incident (the first in 2002 against the Steelers), and he drew considerable criticism.|$|R
25|$|Also of note, this win gave coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> his 100th career {{win in the}} NFL. He is the 34th {{head coach}} to win 100 games.|$|E
25|$|Colts coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> did {{not perform}} his usual head {{coaching}} duties in the next regular season game for the Colts, as {{he had taken a}} brief vacation to mourn the loss of his son. Assistant Head Coach / Quarterbacks Coach Jim Caldwell took over for Dungy in a Week 16 showdown with the Seattle Seahawks, in which the Colts lost, 13–28. Dungy did return to the next game, which happened to be the last game of the regular season. The Colts won that game, 17–13 over the Arizona Cardinals. The Colts dedicated the last two games of the season to James Dungy, with <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> returning to the sideline in their Divisional Playoff game against Pittsburgh.|$|E
25|$|I {{think as}} you look to young coaches {{coming up in the}} ranks, {{a lot of us have}} a picture of how a coach is {{supposed}} to be, how he is supposed to act...And I think what <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> showed me is you don't have to act that way.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{music was}} {{occasionally}} altered on the program, particularly in situations involving injured players. On some occasions where a serious injury or other tragic event occurred, the music would be played at a noticeably softer volume than usual, or would be muted entirely until the highlight resumed. After then-Colts head coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> son James {{committed suicide in}} 2005, the highlights for the Colts's first game after his death began with silence while tributes taking place during the game were shown, with the music only playing for the actual game itself.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{having been}} 7-7 {{toward the end}} of 1995, the 1996 team went 0-5 before getting their first win over <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> former team, the Minnesota Vikings. The 24-13 win over Minnesota started another streak few noted at the time, in which the team held opponents to 13 points or less in four {{consecutive}} games. Despite this, the Oakland Raiders came to Tampa Bay in Week Eleven facing a 1-8 Buccaneers team. Tampa Bay defeated Oakland 20-17 in overtime, which was the first of five wins over the next seven games.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tony</b> Dungy: <b>Dungy</b> {{is listed}} above {{as part of}} the Schottenheimer {{coaching}} tree. However, Dungy attributes most of his coaching style from tutelage under Chuck Noll. Noll learned much of his own philosophy from Paul Brown. Noll coached Dungy as a player and also gave him his first NFL position as the defensive backs coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Dungy later became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers.|$|R
25|$|In January 2002, {{after losing}} {{in the wild}} card round to the Eagles for the second {{consecutive}} year, the Buccaneers fired head coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy.</b> After a recruiting effort aimed at former Jets coach Bill Parcells, Tampa Bay settled on Raiders coach Jon Gruden in exchange for two first round draft picks (2002, 2003), two second round picks (2002, 2004) and US$8 million in cash payments.|$|E
25|$|Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb {{threw for}} 194 {{yards and two}} touchdowns, while also rushing for 54 yards, as Philadelphia {{dominated}} Tampa Bay from start to finish. Bucs quarterback Brad Johnson was intercepted four times, twice by Damon Moore. It was the second consecutive season in which Philadelphia eliminated Tampa Bay from the playoffs during the wild card round, and two days later, Buccaneers coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> was fired.|$|E
25|$|After the Colts' {{loss to the}} San Diego Chargers last week, Colts coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> {{elected to}} keep most of his {{starters}} benched for the entire Christmas Eve game against the Seattle Seahawks, besides the first drive of the game. However, Dungy's decision {{did not come from}} the sidelines, because two days earlier, his eldest son, James, had committed suicide in his apartment. So, assistant coach Jim Caldwell took over for Tony as he spent the week with his family.|$|E
50|$|Brayton was {{the last}} NFL draft pick {{in the first round}} in 2003, after Oakland {{acquired}} the first-round pick from the eventual Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for head coach Jon Gruden {{at the end of the}} 2001 season. Gruden became the Buccaneers coach after <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> firing, with the latter taking over as the Indianapolis Colts coach when Jim E. Mora was fired the same year. Brayton was one of two Raiders selected in the first round in 2003; the other was Nnamdi Asomugha. In his debut season, he played and started in all 16 games and finished the campaign with 61 tackles and 2.5 sacks. The following season, he recorded 45 tackles, 2.5 sacks and his first career interception at the Kansas City Chiefs on December 25. During the 2005 season, Brayton played in all 16 games, notching up three starts and finished the season with 16 tackles and one sack. In 2006, he finished with 42 tackles. In his final year with the Raiders, Brayton finished the season with 11 tackles.|$|R
2500|$|The {{regular season}} {{began with a}} {{crushing}} 20-6 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Qwest Field. But by week 6 the Bucs had turned their fortunes around and had a record of 4-2, including home victories against division rivals the Carolina Panthers and the New Orleans Saints. Running Back Carnell [...] "Cadillac" [...] Williams suffered a season-ending torn patellar tendon in a week 4 home victory over the Panthers, which contributed to a 33-14 blowout loss to former Bucs head coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy's</b> Indianapolis Colts the next week. The Buccaneers' misfortune against non-divisional teams was countered as the season progressed by their domination of the NFC South. In week 15, Micheal Spurlock recorded the first ever kick return touchdown ever scored by a Tampa Bay Buccaneer in a home victory against the Atlanta Falcons. They won {{all but one of}} their divisional games and, at the peak of their success, had a record of 9-5. Many factors contributed to this, such as the problems faced by Atlanta, whose star quarterback Michael Vick had been arrested on dog fighting charges in the preseason, and the season-ending ACL tear suffered by New Orleans running back Deuce McAllister. they finished off the season on a low point, however, but still won the NFC South division, and qualified for a playoff spot at 9-7.|$|R
25|$|The franchise's {{fortunes}} began {{a turnaround}} in the mid-90s under coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy,</b> {{and the success}} continued after the team moved into newly built Raymond James Stadium in 1998. The upward trend culminated in the Bucs' first championship {{at the end of}} the 2002 season under coach Jon Gruden, when they defeated the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII. The Bucs have made several playoff appearances since then but have not returned to the championship game. Dirk Koetter became the Bucs' head coach beginning with the 2016 season.|$|E
25|$|Peyton Manning {{reached his}} fourth Super Bowl, with {{appearances}} under as many head coaches (<b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy,</b> Jim Caldwell, John Fox, and Gary Kubiak). He {{became the first}} quarterback ever to lead two different teams to multiple Super Bowls. He is also the oldest quarterback ever {{to play in a}} Super Bowl at age 39. The previous record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings {{began the}} 2007 offseason by losing their {{defensive}} coordinator, Mike Tomlin, {{who was hired}} {{to be the head}} coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 21, 2007. Coach Brad Childress waited until after the Super Bowl to hire Leslie Frazier, who served as special assistant to the head coach/defensive backs coach under <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> at the Indianapolis Colts. Frazier became the Vikings' new defensive coordinator on February 8. Frazier played cornerback for the 1985 Chicago Bears, and had just won Super Bowl XLI over his former Bears team when he was hired by the Vikings.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} game of the regular season, Colts Coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> made {{his return to the}} sidelines {{after the death of his}} eldest son. The Colts faced the Arizona Cardinals at the RCA Dome, and in front of an {{emotional}} and proud crowd. The Colts won this game, 17–13 over the Cardinals, and they dedicated the last two games of the regular season to James Dungy. Colts QB Peyton Manning only played on the first drive of this game, just like the previous game, and Jim Sorgi played at the quarterback position for the rest of the game.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2005, Colts coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> was {{notified}} that his eldest son, James Dungy, was found unresponsive {{in his apartment}} in Lutz, Florida by James' girlfriend. A deputy from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department performed CPR on the 18-year-old Dungy before an ambulance transported him to University Community Hospital, where James was pronounced dead. The Operations Manager at the Hillsborough County Medical Examiners Department said {{that the cause of}} death was an apparent suicide. On February 17, 2006, after the autopsy was performed, Dr. Jacqueline Lee of the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's Office stated that Dungy had hanged himself from a bedroom ceiling fan with a leather belt.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week, the Bears {{faced the}} New Orleans Saints at the NFC Championship, marking the Saints' first Conference Championship appearance. The Bears’ defense {{shut down the}} Saints’ top-ranked offense, while running backs Thomas Jones and Cedric Benson exploited the Saints’ run defense for nearly 180 yards and three touchdowns. The Bears defeated the Saints, 39–14. The win allowed the Bears to claim the George Halas Trophy {{and the right to}} represent the National Football Conference at Super Bowl XLI against the Indianapolis Colts. Also, Lovie Smith became the first African-American coach to lead his team to a Super Bowl. This feat was matched hours later by his mentor and friend, <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> of the Colts.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Indianapolis Colts {{season was}} the 55th {{season for the}} team in the National Football League and 24th in Indianapolis. The 2007 Indianapolis Colts {{improved}} upon their 12–4 record from 2006 as well as won their fifth-straight AFC South Championship. They finished the season 13–3 and lost to the San Diego Chargers in the divisional round of the playoffs. The Colts remained {{under the supervision of}} Head Coach <b>Tony</b> <b>Dungy</b> and played all of their home games in the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana. 2007 was the Colts' final season in the RCA Dome, as they began playing home games in Lucas Oil Stadium in 2008. In early January 2007 the Colts were the early co-favorites to win Super Bowl XLII, along with the San Diego Chargers.|$|E
