5|$|Bramatnyo {{was accused}} of working for Muhammadiyah when {{creating}} the film, an accusation which he denied. He also was criticised by some Muslim groups, which considered him <b>too</b> <b>liberal.</b> The film was not nominated for best picture at the 2010 Indonesian Film Festival after several nominees threatened to withdraw if Sang Pencerah was nominated. Sang Pencerah later won best picture at the Bandung Film Festival, held in Bandung, West Java, on 6 May 2011.|$|E
5|$|The film, {{released}} on 8 September 2010 during the Eid ul-Fitr holiday, {{was meant to}} show different views of Islam; however, {{it has also been}} interpreted as a critique of the current Muhammadiyah leadership. It was seen in theatres by over 1 million people– the only Indonesian film of 2010 to do so. It also received favourable critical reception, winning the 2011 Bandung Film Festival after being refused a nomination at the 2010 Indonesian Film Festival. However, some Muslim critics decried it as being <b>too</b> <b>liberal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} issue during Desha's tenure was his disdain for Horace Holley, president of Transylvania University. From the time Holley assumed {{the post of}} president in 1818, the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well-qualified and well-respected faculty members such as Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, Daniel Drake, Charles Caldwell, William T. Barry, and Jesse Bledsoe. However, Holley's New England Unitarian beliefs were <b>too</b> <b>liberal</b> for the tastes of many in Kentucky. Many called Holley an infidel and charged {{that he was a}} drinker and a gambler. He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with nude classical statues.|$|E

2500|$|Established Washington press {{figures such}} as Walter Lippman and Jack Germond did not think McGovern had a chance of winning, proclaiming him [...] "too decent" [...] a man, not strong enough for a combative campaign, and <b>too</b> reflexively <b>liberal.</b> [...] Jimmy [...] "The Greek" [...] Snyder gave 200–1 odds against McGovern winning.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, in the Portuguese Liberal Wars (1828-1834), which {{followed}} {{the death of}} John VI, Charles Albert sided with the absolutists under Dom Miguel, who spent time in Piedmont. In this case <b>too,</b> the <b>liberals,</b> led by Dom Miguel's brother Dom Pedro, enjoyed the support of Great Britain and Louis-Philippe's France and were ultimately successful.|$|R
5|$|Hatfield's {{re-election}} {{victory for}} governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on Richard Nixon's short list for vice president, and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. Billy Graham. Hatfield was considered <b>too</b> <b>liberal</b> by many conservatives and Southern moderates, and Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew. Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues, including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House's legal department in 1973 during the Watergate Scandal, after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Neo and Rebecca Leow co-wrote the script, {{which was}} {{completed}} in May 2005. I Not Stupid Too was produced by MediaCorp Raintree Pictures on a budget of S$1.5 million. Shanghai Film Studio had agreed to co-produce I Not Stupid Too with Raintree Pictures, but backed out because they found the film <b>too</b> <b>liberal.</b> The production crew included Daniel Yun as executive producer, Chan Pui Yin and Seah Saw Yan as producers, Ardy Lam as cinematographer and Mo Ju Li as sound editor. Besides writing and directing, Neo starred as Mr. Yeo and composed the theme song, which was sung by Hong Junyang.|$|E
25|$|Yale University {{was founded}} by Englishmen who {{considered}} Harvard <b>too</b> <b>liberal</b> {{for the education of}} New England gentlemen.|$|E
5000|$|The boldest {{clause in}} the {{statement}} was the resolution that black residents of areas designated as [...] "white" [...] by apartheid legislation should be granted suffrage. The Dutch Reformed Church (DRC) in South Africa rejected the Cottesloe Statement as <b>too</b> theologically <b>liberal,</b> {{despite the fact that}} DRC theologians had been represented at the consultation and had agreed to the statement.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{regret to}} hear it; for I had {{believed}} those natives who dwelt within our boundaries had found us <b>too</b> just and <b>liberal,</b> not {{to identify themselves}} fully with our quarrels." ...|$|R
50|$|The Orthodox Presbyterian Church of New Zealand was a Christian {{denomination}} {{formed in}} New Zealand in the 1960s. It {{was organized by}} George Wallace, who led it as a breakoff of the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand because {{he felt that the}} church had adopted <b>too</b> much <b>liberal</b> theology. George Wallace was later fundamental in the formation of Grace Presbyterian Church of New Zealand.|$|R
25|$|She {{attended}} individually, {{and later}} with her husband, the Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., {{before joining the}} National Presbyterian Church in 1996. Articles at the time reported that the Doles stopped attending Foundry in 1995, finding the pastor at the time, J. Philip Wogaman, <b>too</b> <b>liberal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though Arius {{was also}} accused by his opponents of being <b>too</b> <b>liberal,</b> and too loose in his theology, {{engaging}} in heresy (as defined by his opponents), some historians argue that Arius was actually quite conservative, {{and that he}} deplored how, in his view, Christian theology was being too freely mixed with Greek paganism.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{the delegates}} to the Minnesota Republican Party State Convention viewed Carlson as <b>too</b> <b>liberal,</b> and {{endorsed}} instead Allen Quist and Doug McFarland. Carlson and running mate Joanne E. Benson nevertheless won the September state primary, and won the November general election by a large margin, 63% to 34%, over Democratic candidate John Marty.|$|E
50|$|Scozzafava {{considered}} {{running in}} a special election for the 48th state Senate district, which includes most of the northwestern portion of her former assembly district, in 2008. However, area Republicans chose Assemblyman William Barclay, {{in part because they}} thought Scozzafava would be seen as <b>too</b> socially <b>liberal.</b> Barclay lost the election to Democratic Assemblyman Darrel Aubertine, and some Republican operatives said that in hindsight they should have picked Scozzafava.|$|R
60|$|He had, <b>too,</b> a <b>liberal</b> hand, {{though his}} liberality was all by {{the rule of}} three. He did by his {{neighbor}} exactly as he would be done by; he loved some things in this world very sincerely: he loved his God much, but he honored and feared him more; he was exact with others, he was more exact with himself, and he expected his God to be more exact still.|$|R
25|$|Herzen drew {{criticism}} from both liberals who were against violence and from radicals who thought Herzen was <b>too</b> soft. <b>Liberals</b> led by Boris Chicherin and Konstantin Kavelin believed individual freedom would {{be achieved through}} the rationalisation of social relations. Their etatist variety of liberalism was opposed by Herzen as it supposed that Russian society would evolve to an ideal state based on a Hegelian view of reason. They believed the revolutionaries would merely postpone {{the establishment of the}} ideal state, while Herzen thought that, on the contrary, they were blind to historical reality.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} two major kinds of splits from the SSPX. Two notable splits of the first kind {{involved}} priests who viewed the SSPX as <b>too</b> <b>liberal</b> and who use the form that the Mass had before Pope John XXIII. The other kind involved groups who have reconciled with the Holy See and who, like the SSPX, use the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{had tried}} to {{maintain}} a middle-of-the-road approach, but ultimately alienated many of the state's liberals who viewed him as too conservative and many conservatives who viewed him as <b>too</b> <b>liberal.</b> Many were upset that in trying to balance the budget, Davis cut spending for schools while increasing spending for prisons. Some critics attributed the proposal to the California Correctional Peace Officers Associations donations to Davis' re-election campaign.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} {{furlough}} for first-degree murderers was originally {{brought up by}} Democratic candidate Al Gore during a presidential primary debate. However, Gore never referred specifically to Horton. Dukakis had tried to portray himself as a moderate politician from the liberal state of Massachusetts. The Horton ad campaign only reinforced the public's general opinion that Dukakis was <b>too</b> <b>liberal,</b> which helped Bush overcome Dukakis' 17-percent lead in early public opinion polls, and win both the electoral and popular vote by landslide margins.|$|E
50|$|The American Unitarian Conference (AUC) is a {{religious}} organization and a missionary and publication society which serves the needs of individual Unitarian believers. It was founded in 2000 by several Unitarian Universalists who felt that the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) had become <b>too</b> theologically <b>liberal</b> and <b>too</b> political. They decided their mission was to promote classical Unitarianism, which they argued as being based on Christian beliefs though not solely confined by them. They also hoped their organization would {{be of interest to}} non-Christians who embrace generic or philosophical theism and Deism.|$|R
50|$|Sociological {{liberalism}} is {{an international}} relations theory. It is critical of realist theory which it sees as <b>too</b> state-centric. Sociological <b>liberals</b> see international relations in terms of relationships between people, groups and organisations in different countries. Many sociological liberals believe that increased transnational relations could help create new forms of human society.|$|R
50|$|Although the Conservatives painted Ashton’s {{intervention}} as {{an internal}} disagreement between Liberals, they were plainly {{delighted to have}} received Ashton’s endorsement and Ramsbotham clearly relished bringing {{the issue of the}} letter back {{to the attention of the}} electorate as late as meetings on the eve of poll itself. By this time <b>too</b> the <b>Liberals</b> were recovering some lost ground over the letter. Lloyd George claimed two days before polling day that the letter had been written for Lord Ashton by an unnamed Tory MP and alleged he had been told this by the writer of the letter himself. Ashton spluttered out a denial.|$|R
25|$|Many {{military}} {{historians have}} pointed out that Westmoreland became chief of staff at the worst time in history with regard to the Army. Guiding the Army as it transitioned to an all-volunteer force, he issued many directives to try to make Army life better and more palatable for United States youth—e.g., allowing soldiers to wear sideburns and to drink beer in the mess hall. However, many hard-liners scorned these as <b>too</b> <b>liberal.</b> Westmoreland ran unsuccessfully for governor of South Carolina in 1974.|$|E
25|$|But when Maximilian II {{rejected}} the Frankfurt Constitution in 1849 an uprising in the Bavarian Palatinate under Joseph Martin Reichard was put {{down with the}} support of Prussian forces. However Maximilian II stood alongside Bavaria's ally, the Austrian Empire, in opposition to Austria's enemy, the Kingdom of Prussia, which was to receive the imperial crown of a united Germany. This opposition was resented by many Bavarian citizens, who wanted a united Germany, but in the end Prussia declined accepting the crown and the constitution of a German state they perceived to be <b>too</b> <b>liberal</b> and not in Prussia's interests.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning a}} {{contentious}} primary election against Kelly Atkinson {{by a margin}} of 11%, Anderson ran for Congress as the Democratic nominee in Utah's Second Congressional District in 1996 against Republican Merrill Cook. Without any financial help from the Democratic Party (some local Democratic leaders viewed Anderson as being <b>too</b> <b>liberal</b> because of his support of the ACLU, his opposition to U.S. policy toward Nicaragua in the 1980s, and his opposition to the death penalty), he garnered over 100,000 votes in the district. Anderson lost the 1996 race to Merrill Cook by 29,680 votes, achieving 42 percent of the ballots cast versus Cook's 55 percent.|$|E
25|$|To be {{an admirer}} of Thucydides' History, with its deep cynicism about political, rhetorical and ideological hypocrisy, with its all <b>too</b> {{recognizable}} protagonists—a <b>liberal</b> yet imperialistic democracy and an authoritarian oligarchy, engaged in a war of attrition fought by proxy at the remote fringes of empire—was to advertise yourself as a hardheaded connoisseur of global Realpolitik.|$|R
5000|$|Carol, who {{was once}} {{married to a man}} named Pete, who was Philip's father (later the name was changed to Vernon, and was played by actor Charles Siebert, in the sixth season episode [...] "Carol's Dilemma"), was the product of Maude's first {{marriage}} to a man named Barney, whom Maude did not really like, she often mentioned that he was [...] "a wacko you wouldn't BELIEVE!". Her second marriage to Chester lasted six years. Maude had been married four times in all: Walter was her fourth husband. Much like her mother, Carol, <b>too,</b> was <b>liberal</b> and clearly shared her mother's opinions, although at times, they would clash.|$|R
50|$|The {{party will}} work to reform the Indonesian {{political}} system so it is {{in accordance with the}} 1945 Constitution. The party believes that the post-reform political structure has moved <b>too</b> close to <b>liberal</b> democracy, and needs to be corrected to become democracy guided by the wisdom of the leadership in deliberations among deputies. Gerindra believes that Indonesia needs strong leadership.|$|R
25|$|Gardiner {{started his}} law career with Crooks, Roebuck and Parkinson. Gardiner {{turned down a}} {{partnership}} with the firm because Arthur Roebuck (a future attorney-general of Ontario) was <b>too</b> <b>liberal,</b> even though Roebuck took it as a personal slight. Gardiner left the practice in 1921 and joined Commercial Credit Company of Canada, as a legal associate. In 1923, Gardiner returned to law practice partnering with Harry Parkinson. The firm added H. Fred Parkinson and Donald H. Rowan to become the firm of Parkinson, Gardiner and Willis. Gardiner took criminal cases, litigation and continued to handle legal work with Commercial Credit. Gardiner attained the title of King's Counsel in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Although the juntas, which {{forced the}} French to leave Spain, had sworn {{by the liberal}} Constitution of 1812, Ferdinand openly held that it was <b>too</b> <b>liberal</b> for the country. On his return to Spain on April 16, 1814, he refused to swear by the {{constitution}} himself, and continued to rule in the authoritarian fashion of his forebears. Thus the first bourgeois revolution ended in 1814. The reign of Ferdinand VII from 1814 to 1820 {{was a period of}} a stagnant economy and political instability. Much of the country was devastated after the Peninsular War, and government coffers were drained to fight against the independence movements in the Latin American colonies. Political conflict between liberals and royal absolutists further diverted energy and resources needed to rebuild the country.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Montgomery {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the Louisiana Committee for Free Electors, an organization that grew from a meeting of some two hundred conservative Democrats in Baton Rouge. Two representatives from each congressional district were chosen. Montgomery called for the free elector slate to remain viable {{in the event that}} Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York were named the national Republican nominee or if the Republican platform was <b>too</b> <b>liberal</b> to include conservatives. Another free-elector supporter, Taylor W. O'Hearn, subsequently one of the first two Republican members of the Louisiana House of Representatives since Reconstruction, called for electors being chosen by congressional district, rather than at-large statewide. O'Hearn also cited major differences between the two parties despite the influence of such liberals as Rockefeller and U.S. Senator Jacob Javits in the GOP. Ultimately, the free elector movement was abandoned with the nomination in July 1964 of U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona as the Republican nominee.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan EdwardsSamuel T. Logan, Jr. (born October 26, 1943), is Professor of Church History at Biblical Theological Seminary {{and former}} {{president}} of Westminster Theological Seminary. He served as president from 1991 to 2005. He is an ordained minister in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. Logan's tenure was abruptly terminated in 2005 by the seminary's Board of Trustees due to their perception that he was <b>too</b> inclusive of <b>liberal</b> scholarship.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike <b>too</b> many self-proclaimed <b>liberal</b> academics, {{who talk}} the talk but never walk the walk of {{embracing}} real difference, Paul strode through life gathering together {{one of the}} most truly diverse gaggle of colleagues, collaborators, or real comrades one has ever seen. From all classes, nationalities, races, identities, religions, occupations, and neighborhoods, a whole host of people would call Paul their friend, and they continued to do so throughout their lives." ...|$|R
50|$|To that end, the {{mercenary}} {{army of the}} Cuyamel Fruit Company, led by Gen. Christmas, effected a coup d'état against President Miguel R. Dávila (1907-11) {{and installed}} General Manuel Bonilla (1912-13). The U.S. ignored the deposition of the elected government of Honduras by a private army, justified by the U.S. State Department's misrepresenting President Dávila as <b>too</b> politically <b>liberal</b> and a poor businessman whose management had indebted Honduras to Great Britain, a geopolitically unacceptable circumstance {{in light of the}} Monroe Doctrine. The coup d'état was consequence of the Dávila government's having slighted the Cuyamel Fruit Company by colluding with the rival United Fruit Company to award them a monopoly contract for the Honduran banana, in exchange for the UFC's brokering of U.S.government loans to Honduras.|$|R
