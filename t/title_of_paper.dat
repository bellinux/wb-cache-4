40|$|The {{properties}} of SU(1, 1) SU(2),SU(2, 1) and SU(3) {{have often been}} used in quantum optics. In this paper we demonstrate {{the use of these}} symmetries. The group {{properties of}} SU(1, 1) SU(2), and SU(2, 1) are used to find the transition probabilities of various time dependent quadratic Hamiltonians. We consider Hamiltonians representing the frequency converter,parametric amplifier and raman scattering. These Hamiltonians are used to describe optical coupling in nonlinear crystals.

40|$|Circular null {{geodesic}} orbits, in extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetimes, {{are examined}} {{with regard to}} their stability, and compared with similar orbits in the near-extremal situation. Extremization of the effective potential for null circular orbits shows the existence of a stable circular geodesic in the extremal spacetime, precisely on the event horizon, which coincides with its null geodesic generator. Such an orbit also emerges as a global minimum of the effective potential for circular timelike orbits. This type of geodesic is of course absent in the corresponding near-extremal spacetime, as we show here, testifying to differences between the extremal limit of a generic RN spacetime and the exactly extremal geometry.

40|$|When two smooth {{manifold}} bundles {{over the}} same base are fiberwise tangentially homeomorphic, the difference is measured by a homology class in the total space of the bundle. We call this the relative smooth structure class. Rationally and stably, this is a complete invariant. We give {{a more or less}} complete and self-contained exposition of this theory which is a reformulation of some of the results of [7]. An important application is the computation of the Igusa-Klein higher Reidemeister torsion invariants of these exotic smooth structures. Namely, the higher torsion invariant is equal to the Poincaré dual of the image of the smooth structure class in the homology of the base. This is proved in the companion paper [11] written by the first two authors.

40|$|We use a {{variation}} of a classical construction of A. Hatcher to construct virtually all stable exotic smooth structures on compact smooth manifold bundles whose fibers have sufficiently large odd dimension (at least twice the base dimension plus 3). Using {{a variation}} of the Dwyer-Weiss-Williams smoothing theory which we explain in a separate joint paper with Bruce Williams [11], we associate a homology class in the total space of the bundle to each exotic smooth structure and we show that the image of this class in the homology of the base is the Poincaré dual of the relative higher Igusa-Klein (IK) torsion invariant. This answers the question, in the relative case, of which cohomology classes can occur as relative higher torsion classes.

Define a graph AO(G) whose vertices are the acyclic orientations of G {{and whose}} edges join orientations that differ by reversing {{the direction of}} a single edge. It was known previously that AO(G) is connected but not necessarily Hamiltonian. However, Squire [??? <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> place of publication ???] proved that the square AO(G) 2 is Hamiltonian. We prove the slightly stronger result that the prism AO(G) Θ e is Hamiltonian. If G is a mixed graph (some edges directed, but not necessarily all), then AO(G) can be defined as before. The graph AO(G) is again connected but we give examples showing that the prism is not necessarily Hamiltonian.

40|$|The three {{well-known}} {{forms of}} relativistic dynamics are unitarily equivalent {{and the problem}} of constructing the current operators can be solved in any form. However the notion of the impulse approximation is reasonable only in the point form.

The results for deep inelastic scattering based on the impulse approximation in the point form give natural qualitative explanation {{of the fact that the}} values given by the parton model sum rules exceed the corresponding experimental quantities. 1.

40|$|Optical microcavities are {{essential}} in numerous technologies and scientific disciplines. However, their application {{in many areas}} relies exclusively upon discrete microcavities {{in order to satisfy}} challenging combinations of ultra-low-loss performance (high cavity-Q-factor) and cavity design requirements. Indeed, finding a microfabrication bridge connecting ultra-high-Q device functions with micro and nanophotonic circuits has been a long-term priority of the microcavity field. Here, an integrated ridge resonator having a record Q factor over 200 million is presented. Its ultra-low-loss and flexible cavity design brings performance that has been the exclusive domain of discrete silica and crytalline microcavity devices to integrated systems. Two distinctly different devices are demonstrated: soliton sources with electronic repetition rates and high-coherence Brillouin lasers. This multi-device capability and performance from a single integrated cavity platform represents a critical advance for future nanophotonic circuits and systems.

40|$|A {{ground state}} energy variational {{calculation}} of anyon gas with Hamiltonian included {{the interaction of}} spins of particles with anyon vector potential induced, i. e. statistical, magnetic field exhibits exact cancelation of terms connected with fractional statistics. This leads to bosonization of anyons due to coupling of their spins with statistical magnetic field. We presume that at the dense gas fluctuations of effective spins destroy the coupling and bosons become anyons. At the assumption that pseudogap (PG) boundary is temperature independent and when anyons are fermions we use this model to interpret experimental phase diagrams of Tallon and Loram hole and electron doped High-T_c superconductors below PG energy E_g and find the qualitative and quantitative agreement. We do the hypothesis that phase transition (PT) of bosons into Bose-Einstein condensate is not of second order, but of first order, close to second one, PG regime is meta stable phase of bosons, and E_g= 0 is the critical point of this PT. Bosons undergo PT into fermions on PG boundary. Described in the literature non-Fermi quasi-particles {{might be related to}} bosons with effective spins. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures.

Calculated phase diagrams of hole and electron doped cuprate superconductors are in good agreement with experimental ones. <b>Title</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> is slightly changed, introduced co-author: C. -H.

40|$|Associated {{with the}} Davis-Januszkiewicz theory of small covers, this paper {{deals with the}} theory of 2 -torus {{manifolds}} {{from the viewpoint of}} equivariant bordism. We define a differential operator on the "dual" algebra of the unoriented G_n-representation algebra introduced by Conner and Floyd, where G_n=(_ 2) ^n. With the help of G_n-colored graphs (or mod 2 GKM graphs), we may use this differential operator to give a very simple description of tom Dieck-Kosniowski-Stong localization theorem in the setting of 2 -torus manifolds. We then apply this to study the G_n-equivariant unoriented bordism classification of n-dimensional 2 -torus manifolds. We show that the G_n-equivariant unoriented bordism class of each n-dimensional 2 -torus manifold contains an n-dimensional small cover as its representative, solving the conjecture posed in [19]. In addition, we also obtain that the graded noncommutative ring formed by the equivariant unoriented bordism classes of 2 -torus manifolds of all possible dimensions is generated by the classes of all generalized real Bott manifolds (as special small covers over the products of simplices). This gives a strong connection between the computation of G_n-equivariant bordism groups or ring and the Davis-Januszkiewicz theory of small covers. As a computational application, with the help of computer, we completely determine the structure of the group formed by equivariant bordism classes of all 4 -dimensional 2 -torus manifolds. Finally, we give some essential relationships among 2 -torus manifolds, coloring polynomials, colored simple convex polytopes, colored graphs.

40|$|Using mixed methods {{research}} design, {{the current}} study has analyzed Iranian researchers’ information searching behaviour on the Web. Then based on extracted concepts, the model of their information searching behavior was revealed.. Forty-four participants, including academic staff from universities and research centers were recruited for this study selected by purposive sampling. Data were gathered from questionnairs including ten questions and semi-structured interview. Each participant’s memos were analyzed using grounded theory methods adapted from Strauss & Corbin (1998). Results showed that the main objectives of subjects were doing a research, writing a paper, studying, doing assignments, downloading files and acquiring public information in using Web. The most important of learning about how to search and retrieve information were trial and error and get help from friends among the subjects. Information resources are identified by searching in information resources (e. g. search engines, references in papers, and search in Online database…) communications facilities & tools (e. g. contact with colleagues, seminars & workshops, social networking [...] .), and information services (e. g. RSS, Alerting, and SDI).

40|$|Recently, Gomes et al. [1] have visualized the gap {{formation}} in nanoscale regions (NRs) above the critical temperature T_c in the high-T_c superconductor Bi_ 2 Sr_ 2 CaCu_ 2 O_ 8 +δ. It {{has been found}} that, as the temperature lowers, the NRs expand in the bulk superconducting state consisted of inhomogeneities. The fact {{that the size of}} the inhomogeneity [2] is close to the minimal size of the NR [1] leads to a conclusion that the superconducting phase is a result of these overlapped NRs. In the present paper we perform the charge and percolation regime analysis of NRs and show that at the first critical doping x_c 1, when the superconductivity starts on, each NR carries the positive electric charge one in units of electron charge, thus we attribute the NR to a single hole boson, and the percolation lines connecting these bosons emerge. At the second critical doping x_c 2, when the superconductivity disappears, our analysis demonstrates that the charge of each NR equals two. The origin of x_c 2 can be understood by introducing additional normal phase hole fermions in NRs, whose concentration appearing above x_c 1 increases smoothly with the doping and breaks the percolation lines of bosons at x_c 2. The last one results in disappearing the bulk bosonic property of the pseudogap (PG) region, which explains the upper bound for existence of vortices in Nernst effect [3]. Since [1] has demonstrated the absence of NRs at the PG boundary one can conclude that along this boundary, as well as in x_c 2, all bosons disappear. As justification of appearance of single bosons, the bosonization of 2 D fermions is rigorously proven using the concept of anyons. The linear density dependence of the energy gap between excited fermionic and bosonic ground states describes the Uemura relation for 2 D superconductors. Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure.
