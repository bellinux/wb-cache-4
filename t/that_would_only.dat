5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system {{would be needed to}} provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did not care for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that that style would better suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on the special effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E
5|$|The Grangegorman killings {{were the}} {{homicide}} on 6 March 1997 of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan, patients at St Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital in Grangegorman, Dublin, Ireland. After giving a false confession, Dean Lyons {{was charged with}} the murders and placed on remand. In his statement to the Garda Síochána (police), Lyons gave details <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be known to the murderer or to the investigators. After Lyons was charged, Mark Nash confessed to the killings, but later retracted his confession. In April 2015, Nash's trial {{for the murder of}} Shields and Callinan began after an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the trial from going forward.|$|E

5|$|The only soundtrack album {{released}} for {{the game}} was Xenosaga III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, an album of selections from the soundtrack rather {{than all of the}} tracks. The two-disc album has 40 tracks, and a total length of 1:51:46. It was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album reached position #50 on the Japanese Oricon charts, and stayed on the charts for four weeks. In the liner notes for the album, sound producer Keiichi Nozaki explains that the album would have needed to be six discs long to hold all of the music from the game, so he asked Kajiura to select a sample <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> fill two discs.|$|E

Clubs such as the Barbados Cricket Committee (BCC), which was established in the late nineteenth century, adhered to the policy of an all-white team, while Jamaica's Melbourne Cricket Club was composed of only coloured professionals.|$|E

They were approved on October 29, 1909. During the time between the award and approval of the contracts, a non-partisan political body, {{with the backing of}} 25,000 South Brooklyn residents, was created <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> support candidates in the municipal election that pledged support for the Fourth Avenue subway.|$|E
25|$|When the NHL {{announced}} in 1926 {{that it would}} place a team in Chicago, Norris made a bid for the team, but lost to Frederic McLaughlin. Norris {{was one of the}} financial backers of the Chicago Stadium, which opened in March 1929. At that time, Norris and Stadium president Paddy Harmon had discussions with Frank Patrick about bringing another hockey team to Chicago, but under NHL rules, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be possible with McLaughlin's approval, which he would not give. McLaughlin found negotiations with Harmon and Norris for ice time at the Stadium to be difficult, but the two sides came to an agreement during the 1929–30 season.|$|E
25|$|The Nazis {{considered}} the Slavs as subhuman, or Untermenschen. In a secret memorandum dated 25 May 1940, Heinrich Himmler {{stated that it}} was in German interests to foster divisions between the ethnic groups in the East. He also wanted to restrict non-Germans in the conquered territories to schools <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> teach them how to write their own name, count up to 500, and obey Germans. Himmler's Generalplan Ost (General Plan East), agreed to by Hitler in the summer of 1942, involved exterminating, expelling, or enslaving all or most Slavs from their lands over a period of 20–30 years to make living space for Germans. In 1992 Rudolph Rummel estimated the number of Slavs murdered by the Germans to be 10,547,000.|$|E

25|$|Spain {{has been}} {{continuously}} producing sf films since the 1960s, {{at a rate}} of 5 to 10 per decade. The 1970s was specially prolific; the director, and sreenwriter Juan Piquer Simón is the most important figure of fantaterror, producing some low budget sf films. La cabina (1972) is the most awarded Spanish TV production in history. In the 90s Acción mutante (1992), by Álex de la Iglesia, and Abre los ojos (1997), by Alejandro Amenábar, represent a watershed in Spanish sf filming, with a quality <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be reached again by Los cronocrímenes (2007), by Nacho Vigalondo. The most important sf TV series produced in Spain is El ministerio del tiempo (2015-), even though Mañana puede ser verdad (1964-1964) by Chicho Ibáñez Serrador, and Plutón BRB Nero (2008-2009), should also be mentioned.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{was concerned that}} a situation like the Suez Crisis might repeat itself, one that would once again incite a response from the Soviets. The Americans developed a plan to force the UK into the Multilateral Force concept, a dual-key arrangement <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> allow launch if both parties agreed. If those weapons {{were part of a}} single larger force, attacking them would require attacks on the other hosting countries as well, making the prospect far less interesting. The US also feared that other countries would want to follow the UK lead and develop their own deterrent forces, leading to a proliferation problem even among their own allies. If a deterrent was being provided by a larger international force, the need for individual forces would be reduced.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry {{continued}} in the 1970s, when their sons, Chito Loyzaga and Louie Rabat met in the NCAA. The rivalry {{came to an end}} in the 1977 Finals series. In Game One, a brawl ensued among fans of the competing teams, which led to the third game being played behind closed doors, with San Beda winning the basketball championship, after Ateneo's last second shot was ruled invalid. The violence surrounding this championship series, coupled with the violence that was plaguing the league, led to the withdrawal from the NCAA of both Ateneo and San Beda. The Blue Eagles left with 14 seniors titles, a record for the most number of seniors titles <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be tied and surpassed decades later. San Beda later won its 14th title in 2008. The Ateneo de Manila joined the UAAP, while San Beda College eventually came back to the NCAA.|$|E

25|$|Gilbert died in 1905 and Charles Fulford the {{following}} year in Australia, aged 36, after which the business was run by Charles's older brother, Frank Harris Fulford. Charles's estate was valued at £1.3 million, around £ today. He made several bequests which included the gift of twenty per cent of the company shares to the British charity Barnardo's, although this conditional donation sparked consternation. The clauses stipulated the charity must set up a limited company <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> sell Bile Beans and patent medicines manufactured by Fulford's businesses; additionally, Barnardo's were forbidden to sell any of the shares. A writer in the British Medical Journal suggested the bequest presented the charity with an ethical dilemma as it enjoyed the patronage from both medical and religious professions so to trade in products described by a judge as fraudulent would be perpetuating the deception. Initially Barnardo's refused the gift but eventually accepted an unconditional lump sum.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{one reason}} some people {{preferred}} transsexual to transgender {{is that the}} medical community in the 1950s through the 1980s encouraged {{a distinction between the}} terms <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> allow the former access to medical treatment. Other self-identified transsexual people state that those who do not seek sex reassignment surgery (SRS) are fundamentally different from those who do, and that the two have different concerns, but this view is controversial, and others argue that merely having some medical procedures does not have such far-reaching consequences as to put those who have them and those who have not (e.g. because they cannot afford them) into such distinctive categories. Another reason for objecting to the term transsexual is the concern that it implies something to do with sexuality, when it is actually about gender identity. For example, Christine Jorgensen, the first person widely known to have sex reassignment surgery (in this case, male-to-female), rejected transsexual and instead identified herself in newsprint as trans-gender, on this basis.|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{the story}} also take place in London, the capital of Britain. In this timeline, the British people are impoverished due to the German occupation; William Shakespeare and his works are more widely known and {{published}} in Germany than in Shakespeare's homeland, partly due to Britain's economic collapse. During the Second World War, much of London was destroyed by dive bombers and panzers as well as during the last-ditch resistance by Churchill and his supporters. Key British buildings including the Parliament building, Big Ben and St Paul's Cathedral have been completely destroyed, with their only remaining legacy being photographs. Some {{areas of the city}} have been in ruins for over seventy years, due to harsh reparations imposed on the British by the Germans and partisan uprisings <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be completely crushed by 1970. German city planners often visit Britain to see how their colleagues deal with building from the clean slate that they themselves can never have.|$|E

25|$|The German {{defensive}} {{success on}} the Gheluvelt Plateau left the British in the centre open to enfilade-fire from the right, {{that contributed to the}} higher number of losses after the advance had stopped and Gough was criticised for setting objectives that were too ambitious, causing the infantry to lose the barrage and become vulnerable to the German afternoon counter-attacks. Prior and Wilson wrote that the failure had deeper roots, since successive attacks could only be spasmodic, as guns were moved forward, a long process <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> recover the ground lost in 1915. This was far less than the results Haig had used to justify the offensive, in which great blows would be struck, the German defences would collapse and the British would be able safely to advance beyond the range of supporting artillery to the Passchendaele and Klercken ridges, towards Roulers and Thourout and the Belgian coast. The German counter-bombardments and Eingreif divisions had not crumpled, leaving only the possibility of a slow tactical success, rather than a strategic triumph.|$|E
25|$|All Hands Down {{was written}} by Kenneth R. Sewell, a nuclear {{engineer}} and a U.S. Navy veteran who spent five years aboard , a fast attack submarine. It attempts to link the sinking of Scorpion with the Pueblo incident, the John Anthony Walker spy ring, and Cold War Soviet aggression. The thesis of this book is that action off the Canary Islands was the direct cause of the sinking. The author purports that this is supported by motives in the Soviet Navy following the sinking of K-129, which caused the Russian Navy to trap a U.S. submarine. The bait for this trap would be strange military operations and furtive naval manoeuvres in the Atlantic, accompanied by countermeasures <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> seemingly be defeated by the deployment of a nuclear submarine. With information from spying by Walker, the position and arrival time of Scorpion was known by the Russians, and its sinking followed the springing of the trap. The book claims Scorpion was sunk by a Ka-25 helicopter equipped with anti-submarine torpedoes, which took off from one ship and landed on a different one. This was so that no one, other than the aircrew of the helicopter, would notice one torpedo missing.|$|E
25|$|In early 1917, Allenby {{was ordered}} by Haig to start {{preparations}} {{for a major}} offensive around the city of Arras. During his planning Allenby insisted upon putting into practice many of the ideas that his staff officers had offered. Allenby rejected the normal week-long bombardment of the German trenches before making an assault, instead planning on a 48-hour bombardment before the assault went ahead. In addition, Allenby had made careful plans to control traffic in the rear to prevent traffic jams that would block his logistics, a second echelon behind the first echelon <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> be sent in to exploit successes, tunnels to bring up new divisions behind the German lines while avoiding German fire and finally new weapons like tanks and aircraft were to play prominent roles in the offensive. In March 1917, the Germans pulled back to the Hindenburg Line, which led Allenby {{to argue that the}} planned offensive in the Arras sector in April would be changed, a request Haig refused. Despite refusing Allenby's refusal for more time to change his plans, Haig informed him that the entire responsibility for the failure of the Arras offensive would rest with him. As the Zero Hour for the offensive at 5: 30 am on 9 April 1917 approached, Allenby was thus unusually worried as he knew his entire career was in the balance.|$|E
