5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In a rare change, Milligan's run on {{the title}} starts with John living in {{domestic}} bliss with a nurse, Phoebe. Over {{the course of the}} first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a Babylonian demon. Over the course of the run, John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the Liverpool dockers' strike gone insane and sought help from Shade, The Changing Man, after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian, and traveled to India <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way of saving her. Following this, he realised that {{he was in love with}} Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John's iconic trenchcoat to target him.|$|E
5|$|While on {{the trail}} of the vampire known as The Moon, they then run into trouble when the shape-shifting vampire Hierophant tracks them and finds them. The group {{attempts}} to fight him, but he proves to be too powerful. When notified by Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) that the Hierophant cannot enter houses without permission, Jake shapeshifts into a house and the group takes shelter inside. The Hierophant then tells Marceline that he didn't come to fight, but to propose an alliance to take down the Vampire King together. Marceline agrees only on the condition that the Hierophant no longer drinks blood, but he attacks her instead. During the struggle, he is accidentally knocked into Jake and dies due to entering a house uninvited. Marceline reabsorbs his shapeshifting powers but then falls ill, having been stung and poisoned by the Hierophant's stinger. Princess Bubblegum takes Marceline to the Candy Kingdom <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> cure for the Hierophant's poison. Meanwhile, Finn and Jake track down the Moon in hopes of using her healing power to heal Marceline. Upon finding the Moon, they find that due to her healing powers, they can't kill her with their stakes. When the sun sets, the Moon wakes up and Finn and Jake flee, luring the Moon to the Candy Kingdom. However, when they try to fight back, the Moon uses her powers to incapacitate Finn and Jake as she attempts to kill Marceline. Fortunately, Peppermint Butler stabs the Moon in the back, her only weak spot. Marceline reabsorbs the Moon's healing power and fully recovers from the poison.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of 1914-1918 (World War I), Edison became {{concerned}} about America's reliance on foreign supplies of rubber. He partnered with tire producer Harvey Firestone, of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, and Henry Ford, of the Ford Motor Company, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> rubber tree or plant that could grow quickly in the United States. He sought one that would contain enough latex to support his research endeavor. In 1927, the three men contributed $25,000 each, and created the Edison Botanic Research Corporation {{in an attempt to}} find a solution to this problem.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{insisted that}} he {{sincerely}} supported the amendment and along with Representative Martha Griffiths was the chief spokeswoman for the amendment. For 20 years, Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment, with no linkage to racial issues, in the House. He for decades had been close to the NWP and its leader, Alice Paul, {{one of the leaders}} in winning the vote for women in 1920 and the chief supporter of equal rights proposals since then. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to include sex as a protected civil rights category.|$|E
25|$|Any {{branch of}} an {{organization}} that is part {{of an organization}} banned by the central government of the PRC under state security reasons can be banned in Hong Kong at any time, and the Hong Kong government does not have to conduct any independent investigation. This provision was of particular concern because Mainland China does not have a general legal mechanism for defining a banned organization or political dissidents. One consequence of this is that it becomes somewhat harder to prosecute regular members of an organization disliked by the PRC, as it requires the central government <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> crime which the individual has committed.|$|E

25|$|On 13 November 2007, SNCF rail {{workers and}} Paris Métro {{personnel}} {{became the first}} group of workers to commence their strike. Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand met with union leaders on 14 November 2007 <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> resolution. On {{the first day of the}} strike, only 90 out of 700 TGV trains were running, and other rail services were reduced sharply. In Paris, the Métro was only running at 20% capacity and bus services only at 15%. However, some Métro lines experienced fewer disruptions than expected, leading some observers to conclude that support for the strike was not as strong as unions claimed.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, William Stark, an {{assistant}} {{principal of the}} Social Studies Department, was appointed acting principal. He was expected to move up to the principal's office, when Chancellor Harold O. Levy decided <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> Nobel laureate to become principal. However, when that effort failed, Stark was still not offered the job as principal. Stark {{said that if he}} wasn't officially offered the job by a certain date, he would take another position being offered to him elsewhere. When the deadline came and went, Stark accepted a job as principal of Manhasset High School. Many faculty and parents were upset that Stark was not appointed in a timely way and thus had left the school; Vincent Galasso agreed to an interim appointment for one term in 2001.|$|E
25|$|There, Bilbo becomes {{friends with}} Bard (André Sogliuzzo), {{captain of the}} town guard, and {{performs}} several tasks for him, including finding his Black Arrow, which {{is said to have}} special powers. The party then head towards the nearby Lonely Mountain. They find the secret entrance, but Bilbo is dismayed to learn the dwarves have no idea how to kill Smaug. As such, he sneaks into Smaug's lair <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> weak spot. Bilbo tricks Smaug (James Horan) into showing him his stomach, which is coated in diamonds, except for one small spot, where his skin is exposed. Bilbo leaves, telling the dwarves of Smaug's vulnerability, and is overheard by a nearby thrush, who heads towards Lake-town. Furious that he has been outwitted by Bilbo, Smaug bursts from the mountain and attacks Lake-town. However, the thrush tells Bard of the exposed skin, and Bard fires the Black Arrow into Smaug's chest, killing him.|$|E

25|$|Psyonix had {{previously}} developed Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars in 2008 for the PlayStation 3. That title itself bore out from previous modifications that Psyonix' founder, Dave Hagewood, {{had done for}} Unreal Tournament 2003 by expanding out vehicle-based gameplay that Epic Games had already set {{in place in the}} engine into a new game mode called Onslaught. For this, Hagewood was hired as a contractor by Epic for Unreal Tournament 2004 specifically for incorporating the Onslaught mode as an official part of the game. Hagewood used his experience at Epic to found Psyonix. Among other contract projects, Psyonix worked <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> way to make racing the Unreal vehicles in a physics-based engine enjoyable. They had toyed with several options such as race modes or mazes, but found that when they added a ball to the arena to be pushed by the vehicles, they had hit upon the right formula, which would become Battle-Cars. Further to the success was the addition of the rocket-powered cars; this originally was to be a simple speed boost, but with the physics engine, they were able to have the vehicles fly off and around the arena, furthering the possibilities for gameplay.|$|E

He said that Austen should have made the reader feel that Edward was worthy of Elinor and explained how Marianne falls in love with Colonel Brandon, after having her heart broken by Willoughby. The writer increased the male roles, so they could be turned into stronger characters. Davies told Hill that the team [...] "worked very hard" [...] on the men. Brandon is seen rescuing people and doing a lot of fast horse riding, while Edward was given a wood-chopping scene where he vents his frustrations about his engagement. Davies also made the Dashwood sisters younger and [...] "more vulnerable" [...] than how they were portrayed in Lee's film. Hattie Morahan, who portrayed Elinor in the drama, stated, [...] "We are trying to play the story as it was written. In the novel the girls are 19 and 17, so these romantic relationships are real rites of passage for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{scenes in}} which Stewie {{graphically}} beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members—as well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate—enjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: [...] "I don't {{see what the}} problem is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!", {{and so it was}} kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode. However, reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact. The gesture was also left intact on the DVD of [...] "Volume Four"; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom. After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers looked up the word on the Internet <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> definition. MacFarlane stated in the episode's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word, the show will have to stop using it (it has not been used since this episode).|$|E
