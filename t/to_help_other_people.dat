Leslie is enthusiastic despite the low turnout and angry complaints, which she describes as [...] "people caring loudly at me". Local nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) complains about a giant pit near her house, which was dug out by a condominium developer that went bankrupt {{in the middle of the}} construction project. Ann says that her boyfriend Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) broke both his legs after falling into the pit, and she demands something be done about it. Leslie is inspired by the challenge and makes a [...] "pinky promise" [...] that she will fill in the pit and build a park on the land.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1999 at {{the height}} of Emin's Turner Prize fame, she created a number of monoprint {{drawings}} inspired by the public and private life of Princess Diana for a themed exhibition called Temple of Diana held at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as They Wanted You To Be Destroyed (1999) related to Princess Diana's bulimia eating disorder, while other monoprints included affectionate texts such as Love Was on Your Side and a description of Princess Diana's dress with puffy sleeves. Other drawings highlighted The things you did <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> written next to a drawing by Emin of Diana, Princess of Wales in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola. Another work was a delicate sketch of a rose drawn next to the phrase [...] "It makes perfect sence to know they killed you" [...] (with Emin's trademark spelling mistakes) referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death. Emin herself described the drawings, saying they [...] "could be considered quite scrappy, fresh, kind of naive looking drawings" [...] and [...] "It's pretty difficult for me to do drawings not about me and about someone else. But I have did have a lot of ideas. They're quite sentimental I think and there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Riessman's seminal article {{explored}} how nonprofessionals supported {{one another}} in self-help/mutual-aid support groups based on Riessman's observations of a sample of these groups, {{as well as his}} summary of the findings of research in the areas of social work, education, and leadership. This article suggested that although the [...] "use of people with a problem <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> who have the same problem in [...] more severe form" [...] is [...] "an age-old therapeutic approach," [...] the traditional focus on outcomes for those receiving help to the exclusion of considering outcomes for those providing help is too narrow; instead, Riessman advocated for increased consideration of the experience of [...] "the individual that needs the help less, that is, the person who is providing the assistance" [...] because [...] "frequently it is he who improves!" [...] (p.27). Although Riessman expressed doubt that individuals receiving help always benefit from the assistance provided to them, he felt more sure that individuals providing help are likely experiencing important gains; thus, according to Riessman, the helping interaction at least {{has the potential to be}} mutually beneficial for both parties involved (i.e., for both the individual giving and for the individual receiving aid), but it is not absolutely necessary for the [...] "helpee" [...] to benefit in order for the [...] "helper" [...] to enjoy the benefits of helping. In instances where true mutual benefit occurs, the helper and helpee benefit in different ways, such that the person receiving help benefits by way of receiving whatever specific form of assistance is offered to them (e.g., emotional support, information, etc.) while the person providing help benefits by the very act of providing help, regardless of the type of aid they provide.|$|E

60|$|It {{had been}} Lady Harman's clear {{intention}} {{to have a}} luminous and illuminating discussion of the peculiar difficulties and perplexities of her position with Mr. Brumley. Since their first encounter this idea {{had grown up in}} her mind. She was one of those women who turn instinctively to men and away from women for counsel. There was to her perception something wise and kindly and reassuring in him; she felt that he had lived and suffered and understood and that he was ready <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> to live; his heart she knew from his published works was buried with his dead Euphemia, and he seemed as near a thing to a brother and a friend as she was ever likely to meet. She wanted to tell him all this and then to broach her teeming and tangled difficulties, about her own permissible freedoms, about her social responsibilities, about Sir Isaac's business. But now as their taxi dodged through the traffic of Kensington High Street and went on its way past Olympia and so out westwards, she found it extremely difficult to fix her mind upon the large propositions with which it had been her intention to open. Do as she would to feel that this was a momentous occasion, she could not suppress, she could not ignore an obstinate and entirely undignified persuasion that she was having a tremendous lark. The passing vehicles, various motors, omnibuses, vans, carriages, the thronging pedestrians, the shops and houses, were all so distractingly interesting that at last she had to put it fairly to herself whether she hadn't better resign herself to the sensations of the present and reserve that sustained discussion for an interval she foresaw as inevitable on some comfortable seat under great trees at Hampton Court. You cannot talk well and penetratingly about fundamental things when you are in a not too well-hung taxi which is racing to get ahead of a vast red motor-omnibus....|$|E
60|$|Write down then, frankly, {{what you}} are, or, at least, {{what you think}} yourself, not {{dwelling}} upon those inevitable faults which I have just told you are of little consequence, and which the action of a right life will shake or smooth away; but that you may determine {{to the best of}} your intelligence what you are good for and can be made into. You will find that the mere resolve not to be useless, and the honest desire <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> will, in the quickest and delicatest ways, improve yourself. Thus, from the beginning, consider all your accomplishments as means of assistance to others; read attentively, in this volume, paragraphs 74, 75, 19, and 79, {3} and you will understand what I mean, with respect to languages and music. In music especially you will soon find what personal benefit there is in being serviceable: it is probable that, however limited your powers, you have voice and ear enough to sustain a note of moderate compass in a concerted piece;--that, then, is the first thing to make sure you can do. Get your voice disciplined and clear, and think only of accuracy; never of effect or expression: if you have any soul worth expressing, it will show itself in your singing; but most likely there are very few feelings in you, at present, needing any particular expression; and the one thing you have to do is to make a clear-voiced little instrument of yourself, which other people can entirely depend upon for the note wanted. So, in drawing, as soon as you can set down the right shape of anything, and thereby explain its character to another person, or make the look of it clear and interesting to a child, you will begin to enjoy the art vividly for its own sake, and all your habits of mind and powers of memory will gain precision: but if you only try to make showy drawings for praise, or pretty ones for amusement, your drawing will have little of real interest for you, and no educational power whatever.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: It is {{paradoxical}} {{that more}} attention is currently paid to negative features in children’s and adolescents’ behavior (aggressive behavior, bullying) {{than to the}} positive ones (helping, social support). Purpose: This literature review describes how children’s sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> develops and how children acquire competences in helping. Methods: The literature search was conducted in databases using keywords “child”, “prosocial development” and “prosocial behavior”. Publications (papers or monographs) published in English or Czech between 1989 and 2016 were retrieved. Conclusions: The study identified the following sources of prosocial behavior: use of fairy-tale motifs {{in the case of}} babies (e. g. the motif of good deeds) and targeted family education with the use of direct and indirect procedures. Targeted education of children in preschool was accomplished by experienced teachers. Education in providing help and social support to schoolmates (including the socalled partnership and peer teaching) at elementary school was identified as a special case...|$|R
