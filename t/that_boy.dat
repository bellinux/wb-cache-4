5|$|Some {{adjectives}} are inflected for {{degree of}} comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, {{the boy is}} smaller than the girl, <b>that</b> <b>boy</b> is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper examines the different factors that motivate {{girls and boys}} to read. Current research claims <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> and girls have different preferences, which is a large cause of the “gender gap ” in schools. Other researchers claim <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> ‟ resistance to reading {{is due to the}} type of texts used in school, which is primarily fiction. Action research was conducted, where five fifth graders chose three texts {{that they would like to}} read, found <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> and girls have similar reading preferences, but varies from person to person, not gender. This implies that students need opportunities to choose texts not based on gender, but their own preferences and interests...|$|R

So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand.

40|$|Three studies {{examined}} {{the role of}} stereotype threat in boys' academic underachievement. Study 1 (children aged 4 – 10, n = 238) showed that girls from age 4 years and boys from age 7 years believed, and thought adults believed, <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> are academically inferior to girls. Study 2 manipulated stereotype threat, informing children aged 7 – 8 years (n = 162) <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> tend to do worse than girls at school. This manipulation hindered boys' performance on a reading, writing, and math test, but did not affect girls' performance. Study 3 counteracted stereotype threat, informing children aged 6 – 9 years (n = 184) <b>that</b> <b>boys</b> and girls were expected to perform similarly. This improved the performance of boys and did not affect that of girls...|$|R
25|$|Child {{sexual abuse}} occurs {{frequently}} in Western society, although {{the rate of}} prevalence {{can be difficult to}} determine. Research in North America has concluded that approximately 15% to 25% of women and 5% to 15% of men were sexually abused when they were children. In the UK, a 2010 study estimated prevalence at about 5% for boys and 18% for girls (not dissimilar to a 1985 study that estimated about 8% for boys and 12% for girls). More than 23,000 incidents were recorded by the UK police between 2009 and 2010. Girls were six {{times more likely to be}} assaulted than boys with 86% of attacks taking place against them. Barnardo's charity estimates that two thirds of victims in the United Kingdom are girls and 1 third boys. Barnardo's is concerned <b>that</b> <b>boy</b> victims may be overlooked. A firm of solicitors that acts in many cases of child abuse has published a list of over twenty Children's Homes and group actions that they have an interest in or for which they are lead solicitors.|$|E

He started preaching to Wendell to get to work and that kid went to town." [...] Faced with a set of athletic brothers—Edward became an Olympic wrestler—Willkie joined the football team but had little success; he enjoyed the debate team more, but was several times disciplined for arguing with teachers. He was class president his final year, and president of the most prominent fraternity, but resigned from the latter when a sorority blackballed his girlfriend, Gwyneth Harry, as the daughter of immigrants.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{ability to}} project his {{personality}} onto his characters {{played an important}} part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, [...] "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural." [...] Charles Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed, [...] "In truth, <b>that</b> <b>boy</b> hasn't the least idea how well he acts ...

In his review of Cooper's performance in The Real Glory, Graham Greene wrote, [...] "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore." ...|$|E
