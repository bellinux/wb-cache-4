40|$|The {{last few}} years are full of reports of cyber incidents, {{some of which have}} caused {{significant}} damage. Each of these cyber events raise important questions about the role and responsibility of States with respect to cyber incidents. The answer to these questions revolves in large part around the international law doctrine of sovereignty. The extent to which nations exercise sovereignty over cyberspace and cyber infrastructure will provide key answers to how much control States must exercise and how much responsibility States must accept for harmful cyber activities when they fail to adequately do so. This article argues that States have sovereign power over their cyber infrastructure and that with that sovereign power comes corresponding responsibility to control that infrastructure and prevent it from being knowingly used to harm other States. This responsibility to prevent external harm extends not only to state actors, but also to non-state actors. This article will review some of the cardinal principles of sovereignty and their application to cyberspace and then consider <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>duties</b> and obligations.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{adaptive}} control architecture for {{maximum power point}} tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic systems. Photovoltaic systems provide promising ways to generate clean electric power. MPPT technologies have been used in photovoltaic systems to deliver the maximum power output to the load under changes of solar insolation and solar panel's temperature. To improve the performance of MPPT, this thesis proposes a two-layer {{adaptive control}} architecture that can effectively handle the uncertainties and perturbations in the photovoltaic systems and the environment. The first layer of control is ripple correlation control (RCC), and the second layer is model reference adaptive control (MRAC). By decoupling these two control algorithms, the control system achieves the {{maximum power point tracking}} with shorter time constants and overall system stability. To track the maximum power point as the solar insolation changes, the RCC algorithm computes <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>duty</b> cycle, which serves as the input to the MRAC layer. Then the MRAC algorithm compensates the under-damped characteristics of the power conversion system: the original transfer function of the power conversion system has time-varying parameters, and its step response contains oscillatory transients that vanish slowly. Using the Lyapunov approach, an adaption law of the controller is derived for the MRAC system to eliminate the under-damped modes in power conversion...|$|R

40|$|If {{we start}} with the {{assumption}} that copyright law creates a system of property rights, to what extent does this system give adequate notice to third parties regarding the scope of such rights, particularly given the prominent role played by the fair use doctrine? This essay argues that, although the fair use doctrine may provide adequate notice to sophisticated third parties, it fails to provide adequate notice to less sophisticated parties. Specifically, the fair use doctrine imposes nearly insuperable informational burdens upon the general public regarding the scope of the property entitlement and <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>duty</b> to avoid infringement. Moreover, these burdens have only increased with changes in technology that enable more, and more varied, uses of copyrighted works. The traditional response to uncertainty in fair use has been to suggest ways of curing the notice failure by providing clearer rules about what is and is not permitted. This essay suggests, however, that these efforts to reinforce the property framework feel increasingly strained and fail to reflect how copyright law is actually experienced by the general public. Indeed, the extent of the notice failure is such that {{it may be time to}} stop treating copyright like a property right, at least for certain classes of users. The essay ends by suggesting a number of alternative frameworks that would seek to regulate public behavior regarding copyrighted works without imposing the unrealistic informational burdens required by a system of property rights...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} solve TO and CB problems, the output {{characteristic}} curves are investigated under close-loop circuit in Sect.  3.2, {{and then the}} complete I–V and P–V curves of PV panels are defined. When the sampled data (V_PV, I_PV) are obtained from the terminal of PV array, the slope Δ G = Δ I_PV/Δ V_PV can be computed. If Δ G < 0, {{the two sets of}} sampled data are on the same I–V curve. If Δ G > 0, the two sets of sampled data are on two different I–V curves. According to the sign of Δ G, the two sets of sampled data are applied to different calculation algorithms. Then, they are substituted into mathematical equations of the adopted practical PV panel to calculate the values at MPP. Through the transfer function of <b>the</b> converter, <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>duty</b> cycle D_m at MPP is obtained. When D = D_m, MPP is captured online. The proposed maximum power point capturing (MPPC) method is designed to be able to locate a steady operating area around the MPP. Particularly, the duty cycle keeps constant within the steady operating area, and when the operating point is outside this area, MPPC is triggered and a new MPP is captured with an updated steady operating area. This procedure is defined as periodic observation and aperiodic perturbation. The MPPC technique only requires two perturbations to capture MPP, instead of continuous tracking used by conventional MPPT techniques. MPPC controller eliminates oscillations while operating under constant solar irradiance, and has a fast tracking speed when solar irradiance varies. MPPC technique in this study is easy to implement and displays a higher working efficiency under both steady and dynamic conditions.|$|R

We fit a power-law to the projected correlation function wp(rp) to marginalize over redshift space distortions and redshift errors. For a real-space correlation function of the form ξ(r) = (r/r 0) −γ, the fitted parameters in comoving coordinates are r 0 = 15. 2 ± 2. 7 h − 1 Mpc and γ = 2. 0 ± 0. 3, over a scale range 4 ≤ rp ≤ 150 h − 1 Mpc. Thus high-redshift quasars are appreciably more strongly clustered than their z ≈ 1. 5 counterparts, which have a comoving clustering length r 0 ≈ 6. 5 h − 1 Mpc. Dividing our sample into two redshift bins: 2. 9 ≤ z ≤ 3. 5 and z ≥ 3. 5, and assuming a power-law index γ = 2. 0, we find a correlation length of r 0 = 16. 9 ± 1. 7 h − 1 Mpc for the former, and r 0 = 24. 3 ± 2. 4 h − 1 Mpc for the latter. Strong clustering at high redshift indicates that quasars are found in very massive, and therefore highly biased, halos. Following Martini & Weinberg, we relate the clustering strength and quasar number density to the quasar lifetimes and duty cycle. Using the Sheth & Tormen halo mass function, the quasar lifetime is estimated to lie in the range 4 ∼ 50 Myr for quasars with 2. 9 ≤ z ≤ 3. 5; and 30 ∼ 600 Myr for quasars with z ≥ 3. 5. <b>The</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>duty</b> cycles are 0. 004 ∼ 0. 05 for the lower redshift bin and 0. 03 ∼ 0. 6 for the higher redshift bin.

40|$|The recent {{investment}} policy shift, by the South African government, including, termination of bilateral investment treaties with some developed countries, is illustrative of the continued discontent by most developing countries {{with the status}} quo in the realm of international investments agreements (IIAs) regime. Balancing governments' sovereign right to implement domestic policies, in order to achieve socio-economic goals, for overall sustainable development, and <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>duty</b> to protect foreign investments within the host state seems perpetually elusive, within the current bilateral investment treaty (BIT) regime. The parallel rising of free trade agreements (FTAs) incorporating investment chapters to BITs and the withdrawal from international investment arbitration by some countries, is symptomatic of continued disgruntlement with the current investment regime. South Africa is amongst the front runners of this discontentment and has voiced its concerns with the system, by cancelling some of its BITs and substituting same with adopting a new domestic investment regime instead, the investment Act of 2015. This study analyses the government's policy shift, with a view to find {{the extent to which the}} current BIT regime constrained the government's policy space towards economic transformation. This is achieved by analysing the substance and objective of the policy reform as against the international standards. Consequently, after probing the global investment regime and more in particularly the country's economic and political architecture, the study found that although South Africa's {{investment policy}} shift was labelled 'drastic and regressive' by critics, the latter is rational when subjected to substantive approach to the rule of law. Author however, concludes that it is the implementation thereof that is disproportional, as the same objectives underpinning the policy reform can be achieved through a less contentious approach. Finally author suggests a renegotiation of a model BIT as a less onerous and proportionate tool, to achieve the balance sought, and recommends policy options for enhancing international investment regime to address the challenges identified. tm 2017 Centre for Human RightsLLMUnrestricte...|$|R
40|$|The {{shipping}} market {{is characterized by}} high fluctuation range and obvious periodicity, which affects not only the fleet planning of shipowners but also the charterers ability to meet their obligations. When the market falls substantially, the charterer {{might not be able}} to meet hire payments out of earnings on the employment of the vessel. Often the charterer will write to the owner, seeking reduction in agreed rates. The shipowner may in turn persist on the fulfillment of the original contract. The charterer may respond by attempting to negotiate a lower rate in exchange for a longer duration, etc. If the worst comes to the worst, the charterer may redeliver the vessel early, in breach of contract. Another scenario is a ”plain” premature redelivery of the vessel, without connection to a market downturn, i. e. one month prior to the expiry of the charterparty. In both situations, the shipowner and the charterer will be interested in grasping their legal position – what are the legal consequences of such repudiation and what rights and obligations does such breach confer on them. The question of primary concern is whether the shipowner has the right to reject the charterer´s repudiation and affirm the contract. If the answer is negative, the shipowner is obliged to take the possession of the ship and his only remedy will be a claim for damages with <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>duty</b> to mitigate. In practice, a considerable level of uncertainty, in respect of the shipowner´s right to affirm the contract, has led to a prevalent policy of accepting repudiation with a consequent claim for damages, even in situations where the charterer was not insolvent. That way, owners avoid potential significant losses which could arise should the shipowner wrongly interpreted his legal position, affirmed and performed the contract, and subsequently learned from arbitrator´s/court´s decision that he was only entitled to a claim in damages. Early delivery can be considered as a nearly eternal problem in the context of the charter-party relationship. It has a reappearing tendency on the agenda of maritime lawyers, defence clubs and defence departments of P&I clubs. Also, shipowners and charterers are very much interested in the accurate assessment of their negotiating and settlement position. Even though, the right of affirmation within a charterparty relationship was in England and internationally subject to a considerable interest during the years, there was to my knowledge no publication specifically devoted to a systematic research of the topic.
