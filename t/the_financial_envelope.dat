50|$|Luxembourg pledged EUR35 {{million in}} {{aid for the}} 2002-05 period. Covering the period of 2006 to 2010, the second Indicative Cooperation Programme (ICP) aligned Luxembourg’s {{interventions}} with Vietnam’s five-year Socio-Economic Development Plan and supported, with a budget of 50 million EUR, development policies and strategies to achieve the MDGs of the Vietnamese government. Under the overall objective of poverty reduction, the second ICP paid special attention to assisting the poorest provinces and most remote districts.With a budget of 42 million EUR, the third ICP (2011-2015) has a twofold approach. Poverty reduction remains the main objective, support through programmes in social sectors, namely health and local development. In addition the needs and new challenges faced by a middle income country are addressed through an increased focus on capacity building and human resource development in the banking and finance sector {{as well as in}} the vocational training sector including tourism and hospitality. With health, local development and vocational training as priority sectors and with a concentration of activities in the four provinces of Thua Thien Hue, Cao Bang, Bac Kan and Nghe An, the third ICP identifies the same priorities as the previous programme.If the current ICP is a continuity of previous interventions, it constitutes also a consolidation of Luxembourg’s support and aims at diversifying relations between the two countries. With the achievement of the status of a middle income country, enhanced international and regional integration and with continued industrialisation, the needs of Vietnam in terms of international assistance have been changing. Luxembourg adapts its development cooperation accordingly and proposes further support in the field of green growth, capacity building in the finance and banking sector {{as well as in the}} sector of medical research. As the implementation of these activities can rely on specific expertise based in Luxembourg, they constitute adequate means to a transition to stronger and diversified relations beyond development cooperation between the two countries.The third ICP also takes into consideration recent developments in the field of aid effectiveness.A stronger emphasis on cooperation with the private sector is carried out through interventions in the banking and finance sector whereas local development projects aim at close cooperation with civil society and community based organisations. The ICP also includes a variety of aid modalities such as more programme oriented approaches in the health sector, a delegated cooperation to the health sector support programme implemented by the European Commission and collaboration with UN agencies. 20% of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>envelope</b> of ICP III is dedicated to multilateral projects targeting the same sectors as the bilateral projects, in order to strengthen synergies and to increase their impact. The Luxembourg development cooperation contributes to the One UN Fund (2012-2016) which directly supports the implementation of the One UN Plan in Vietnam. It also works directly with five UN agencies in Vietnam: UNCTAD, UN Women, UNICEF, ILO and UNESCO.A mid-term evaluation of the current ICP, conducted in June 2014, underlined the important and visible results and impacts reached by Luxembourg’s development cooperation and its Vietnamese partners on provincial level, be it in strengthening health care in Cao Bang and Bac Kan provinces, in improving income of vulnerable groups in remote areas of Nghe An province, in providing high standard vocational training for tourism and hospitality students in Hue Tourism College and associated schools and in supporting the Vietnam States Securities Commission in creating a better environment for foreign investors. The evaluation also drew conclusions on the need to further diversify relations between the two countries.|$|E

Weighing against the sale are arguments about optimal risk allocation and network externalities. In contrast, there is a productive efficiency case in favour of the sale.

Threats to <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> market security are systematized by sources of formation, scale, duration and nature of influence. The essence of security and flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> market is defined. There systematized indicators of security and flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> market in interrelation with the components of infrastructure potential of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> market. <b>The</b> methodology for determining the level of economic safety and flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> market is substantiated, the corresponding calculations are made. Also the methodology for calculating the normalized index of the infrastructure potential of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> market is developed. The correlation-regression analysis {{of the connection between}} development of the infrastructure potential of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> market, its security and flexibility is carried out. The results of the calculations showed that the degree of implementation of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> market infrastructure potential at the current stage of development of the Ukrainian economy is insufficient.
