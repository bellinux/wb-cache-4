5|$|The TARDIS materialises on a {{seemingly}} derelict spaceship drifting in space. The Doctor, Rose, and Mickey explore {{the ship and}} are puzzled to find an eighteenth-century French fireplace. When he looks through the fireplace, the Doctor sees a young girl and asks who she is. She replies that her name is Reinette and that she lives in Paris in 1727. The Doctor deduces that the fireplace is a <b>time</b> <b>window,</b> a device that allows direct access to another time and place. The Doctor steps through the <b>time</b> <b>window</b> and arrives in Reinette's bedroom {{only to find that}} months have passed there. He discovers a ticking humanoid wearing eighteenth century clothing and a jester's mask hiding under Reinette's bed. After it threatens him with a saw-like device that slides out of its arm, the Doctor tricks the creature into returning through the <b>time</b> <b>window</b> to the spacecraft, where he and his companions learn that it is actually an intricate clockwork android. The android teleports away, and the Doctor warns Mickey and Rose not to go looking for it. The Doctor returns to Reinette's bedroom while Mickey and Rose arm themselves and go looking for the android. While trying to find Rose and Mickey, the Doctor discovers a horse that stepped through a <b>time</b> <b>window,</b> who he later names Arthur. Returning to Reinette's bedroom, the Doctor discovers that she is now a young woman. She flirts with the Doctor and they kiss, before she leaves to join her mother. The Doctor then realises that she is Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV.|$|E
5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a <b>time</b> <b>window</b> to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a <b>time</b> <b>window.</b> The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the <b>time</b> <b>window</b> to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E

5|$|The Lineweaver {{team also}} {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} the galactic habitable zone with respect to time, finding, for example, that stars close to the galactic bulge had to form within a <b>time</b> <b>window</b> of about two billion years in order to have habitable planets. Before that window, galactic-bulge stars would be prevented from having life-sustaining planets from frequent supernova events. After the supernova threat had subsided, though, the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have a high number of giant planets, with the potential to destabilize star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star's circumstellar habitable zone. Simulations conducted in 2005 at the University of Washington, however, show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters, terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales.|$|E
5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through {{the mirror to}} save her. The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an operating <b>time</b> <b>window</b> and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to pack a bag and prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to the fireplace seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's quick return and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> at customer locations (see {{the column}} <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> of Table  1), but <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> {{are known to}} make routing problems {{much more difficult to}} solve whenever they are modeled by node-arc formulations. In fact, almost all papers on drayage with <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> and node-arc models were solved by heuristics, as reported in the rightmost column of Table  1. To our knowledge, exact solutions with multiple containers per truck and stay-with operations were obtained only by Funke and Kopfer (2016), but their instances are small. By using a path-based model, we are able to naturally deal with <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> without changing the formulation, and we are therefore expected to exactly solve realistic solutions in short time. Since in our application a route can serve up to four customers only, we can enumerate all feasible routes and solve a set-covering formulation to select the optimal subset of routes. In this approach, <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> are naturally considered by just checking each route for feasibility and discarding the unfeasible ones. Thus, <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> reduce the cardinality of the set of feasible routes, thereby making the problem easier to solve.|$|R
40|$|Constant-factor, polynomial-time {{approximation}} algorithms {{are presented}} for two {{variations of the}} traveling salesman problem with <b>time</b> <b>windows.</b> In the first variation, the traveling repairman problem, {{the goal is to}} find a tour that visits the maximum possible number of locations during their <b>time</b> <b>windows.</b> In the second variation, the speeding deliveryman problem, the goal is to find a tour that uses the minimum possible speedup to visit all locations during their <b>time</b> <b>windows.</b> For both variations, the <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> are of unit length, and the distance metric is based on a weighted, undirected graph. Algorithms with improved approximation ratios are given for the case when the input is defined on a tree rather than a general graph.

25|$|One debated {{prediction}} {{came from}} the M8 algorithm used by Keilis-Borok and associates in four forecasts. The first of these forecasts missed both magnitude (M 7.5) and time (a five-year window from 1 January 1984, to 31 December 1988). They did get the location, by including most of California and half of Nevada. A subsequent revision, presented to the NEPEC, extended the <b>time</b> <b>window</b> to 1 July 1992, and reduced the location to only central California; the magnitude remained the same. A figure they presented had two more revisions, for M ≥ 7.0 quakes in central California. The five-year <b>time</b> <b>window</b> for one ended in July 1989, and so missed the Loma Prieta event; the second revision extended to 1990, and so included Loma Prieta.|$|E
40|$|We study two {{different}} lot-sizing problems with <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> {{that have been}} proposed recently. For the case of production <b>time</b> <b>windows,</b> in which each client specific order must be produced within a given time interval, we derive tight extended formulations for both the constant capacity and uncapacitated problems with Wagner-Whitin (non-speculative) costs. For the variant with nonspecific orders, known to be equivalent to the problem in which the <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> can be ordered by time, we also show equivalence to the basic lot-sizng problem with upper bounds on the stocks. Here we derive polynomial time dynamic programming algorithms and tight extended formulations for the uncapacitated and constant capacity problems with general costs.

30|$|We {{introduce}} {{and define}} a new routing denoted the orienteering problem with soft <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> (OPSTW). To {{the best of}} our knowledge, this is the first study dealing with orienteering problem with soft <b>time</b> <b>windows.</b> In this routing problem, late service is allowed if an appropriate penalty is paid. In this relaxation scheme, we are placing restrictions on both the penalty payable and the waiting time. We think that OPSTW solutions can result in routes visiting a significant number of potential customers without hurting customers’ satisfaction significantly. Furthermore, soft <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> can provide a workable plan of action for decision makers when hard <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> are not required or when {{it is not possible to}} visit all customers during the current planning time horizon which is the case for the OPTW.|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} we study the orienteering problem with <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> (OPTW) {{and the impact}} of {{relaxing}} the <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> on the profit collected by the vehicle. The way of relaxing <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> adopted in the orienteering problem with soft <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> (OPSTW) that we study in this research is a late service relaxation that allows linearly penalized late services to customers. We solve this problem heuristically by considering a hybrid iterated local search. The results of the computational study show that the proposed approach is able to achieve promising solutions on the OPTW test instances available in the literature, one new best solution is found. On the newly generated test instances of the OPSTW, the results show that the profit collected by the OPSTW is better than the profit collected by the OPTW.|$|R

40|$|The {{difficulty}} in synchronizing {{the activities of}} different actors {{and the existence of}} external constraints, e. g., weather conditions, usually produce some uncertainty on the exact time at which a flight operation can be executed. To cope with this uncertainty, aircraft operators need some flexibility when performing their flight operations, i. e., departing, arriving and flying through air sectors. We express this flexibility in terms of <b>time</b> <b>windows,</b> i. e, periods of time within which flight operations can be executed. The more flexible a flight is, the wider its <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> are. <b>Time</b> <b>windows</b> are centrally calculated and assigned to flights under the agreement that when a flight performs all its operations within the corresponding <b>time</b> <b>windows,</b> no downstream delay is caused to any other actor of the air traffic system. When a flight is unable to respect its <b>time</b> <b>windows,</b> some delay may also be caused to other flights. This paper investigates the effects on the system in terms of additional delay of the nonfulfillment of <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> at flight departures. It considers both airline collaboration and non-collaboration cases and proposes an algorithm that reduces this additional delay. This is achieved through the reassignment of capacity released by flights that are either delayed or have departed. We simulate a set of realistic instances where delays at departure are randomly assigned to flights after <b>time</b> <b>windows</b> have been determined. Our results show that the amount of additional delay generated by departure delays is limited, thus demonstrating the practical viability of the proposed approach...|$|R
