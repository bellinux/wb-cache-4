40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{a patient with}} African tick-bite fever who acquired his infection while visiting rural areas of South Africa and then became sick after returning to the United States. The dominant clinical feature of his illness was the presence of multiple, ulcerated lesions (<b>tache</b> <b>noires).</b> Physicians in the United States and other non-African countries who see travelers returning from southern parts of Africa who give a history of recent tick bite and/or present with multiple, crusted or vesicular skin lesions should be alert to this diagnosis and institute treatment with doxycycline. African tick-bite fever (ATBF) is caused by Rickettsia af-ricae, a spotted fever group rickettsia that is transmitted by infected cattle ticks (Ambylomma hebraeum) in rural areas of southern Africa. Although the distinctive clinical features of ATBF {{have been known to}} physicians practicing in south-ern Africa for approximately 60 years, it was erroneously assumed to be due to R. conorii until 1992 when Kelly and others isolated R. africae from a patient from Zimbabwe with ATBF. 1 Since then, several investigators have re-ex...|$|R

If the eyelids are open for a few hours after death, a film of cell debris and mucus forms two yellow triangles on the sclera, each at side of the iris, with base towards the margin of cornea and apex towards medial or lateral canthus of the eye, which becomes brown and then black within a few hours, upon which dust settles and the surface becomes wrinkled.|$|E

The infection usually manifests with a characteristic symptomatologic triad: fever, exanthema and the so called <b>tache</b> <b>noire,</b> which is the typical eschar {{at the site of}} the tick bite. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and the gold standard micro-immunofluorescent assay, allow serological diagnosis.

40|$|Background: Zoonoses {{are human}} {{infectious}} diseases caused by pathogens that primarily infect animals. Mediterranean Spotted Fever (MSF) represents one such example, affecting the Mediterranean region, in which household animals can be immune-carriers of infected ticks. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analysed the incidence and the clinical and laboratory features of MSF caused by R. Conorii in children {{admitted to the}} Paediatric Operative Unit from 1987 to 2010, for persistent fever and generalised macular-popular erythematous lesions. Clinical, immunological and serological parameters of 55 cases of Rickettsia infections observed in children between 2 and 11 years of age were collected. Results: We found an increasing incidence of MSF in childhood from 1987 to 2010. Diagnosis of MSF {{at the moment of}} hospital admission was done in 16 patients (29. 09 %). The presence of the typical <b>Tache</b> <b>noire</b> was observed in 16 cases out of 55 patients (29. 09 % of cases). We noticed a different representation of R. conorii antigens in serological testing over the time period of the study, corresponding to overall higher incidence rates for infection in the latter years. We also observed a higher incidence of infection in those years in which all four antigens were found positive at serum testing with respect to those years in which only two of the four antigens were observed (1987 - 1990 : 0 - 16 %; 2007 - 2010 : 0. 46 %; P< 0. 005). Conclusions: These changes in R. conorii antigenicity may be the cause of higher pathogenicity in this parasite, perhaps linked to increased immigration along with consequent changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases in host countries...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rickettsia conorii is {{the most}} {{frequent}} species of RickettsiaI causing disease in Portugal. In general the disease manifests itself by fever, exanthema, headaches {{and the presence of}} an eschar. However atypical forms can be present and physicians should be aware. Aims: Analyse the atypical presentation of rickettsiosis. Material and Methods: Children admitted at the CHLC Hospital from 2000 to 2010 with atypical presentation of rickettsiosis. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed by serology and molecular techniques (PCR). Results: Five cases of children with a median age of 2 years, 1 of which female, were admitted between June and August. The diagnoses were: myositis (1), synovitis (1), cholecystitis (1), orchiepididymitis (1) and meningitis (1). Myositis developped with functional disability, CPK 9600 U/L, lower limbs’ edema, hypoalbuminemia (1, 6 g/dL) and arterial hypertension. Synovitis developped with functional disability, synovial fluid increase and CRP 16, 2 mg/dL. The child with cholecystitis had abdominal pain, intraabdominal fluid increase, leukopenia (1900 /μL), thrombocytopenia (75000 /μL) and CRP 15, 3 mg/dL. Orchiepididymitis developped with testicle’s inflammatory signs, leukopenia (2900 /μL), thrombocytopenia (90000 /μL) and CRP 14, 45 mg/dL. The patient with meningitis, who had pleocytosis (320 cells/μL), hyperproteinorrachia (284 mg/dL), hypoglicorrachia (36 mg/dL), presented only with fever and headaches. The <b>tache</b> <b>noire</b> and the classical triad were present in 3 / 5 cases. The clinical course was favourable in all cases. Antibodies against Rickettsia of spotted fever group were detected in 3 / 5 cases. In one patient Rickettsia conorii Malish strain was identified by PCR and sequencing. Conclusions: Rickettsial infection may present itself unusually. In a country of high prevalence, especially during summer months and in the presence of an inoculation eschar, it is of the uttermost importance to study the atypical presentations for a possible rickettsial infection...|$|E

The acute-phase serum sample contained no detectable antibodies, but the convalescent-phase serum sample was positive for IgG antibody (titer, 1 : 128) and IgM antibody (titer, 1 : 16). Serological cross-reactions between R. africae and Rickettsia coronii were found with equal titers of antibody. The patient received doxycycline, 200 mg/day for 10 days, and became asymptomatic. Various rickettsial diseases, of which the spotted fever group (represented by Mediterranean spotted fever) and African tick-bite fever are the principal examples, are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. African tick-bite fever is a disease caused by R. africae and transmitted by cattle ticks in rural areas of southern Africa. It was first described by Kelly et al. [1] in a patient who presented with fever, an inoculation eschar, and a regional lymphadenopathy, but no rash. Since then, R. africae has been implicated in several outbreaks [2 – 4] and has been recognized as an emerging health problem for international travelers to rural sub-Saharan Africa [5, 6]. Clinical features include fever, headache, myalgia, and maculopapular cutaneous rash. A le-sion—the eschar or tache noire—at the site of the tick bite is a diagnostic criterion and requires a detailed clinical exami-nation, as illustrated in the case we describe.

40|$|Background and Design: There {{are very}} few {{clinical}} series about Mediterranean Spotted Fever (MSF) reported from Turkey. Fifty-six patients admitted with fever and rash were diagnosed as MSF in our hospital by clinical, epidemiological signs and Weil-Felix test. We aimed to take attention to the similarities and differencies with another tick-borne infection Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) reported lately in Turkey. Material and Method: Between 1989 - 2006 years 56 cases were diagnosed as rickettsioses based on epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data. We evaluated the patients retrospectively using by “Diagnosis guide for tick transmitted infections in Europe” prepared by ESCMID Study group for Coxiella, Anaplasma, Rickettsia and Barthonella (ESCAR). We compared two diseases according to the Fisher’s exact test in clinical and laboratory characteristics. Results: Twenty-nine female and 27 male cases reached to 25 point according to ESCAR diagnostic scoring were included into the present study. Age distribution was 20 - 80 years (mean 43), duration of hospitalization was 1 - 38 days (mean 8 days). <b>Tache</b> <b>noire</b> was established {{in most of the}} cases (64 %). All of the cases were recovered by 7 - 10 days of doxycyclin treatment except one case stayed in hospital for 38 days and died. When it is compared statistically haemorrhagic manifestations, history of tick exposure, nausea and vomiting, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia rates were found higher in CCHF (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Whereas MSF and CCHF have similar seasonal and clinical features and transmitted by the tick, the treatment regimen and mortality rates differ. In Istanbul we realised that some of the cases reported as possible CCHF were found to be MSF later, for this reason in patients who has fever and maculopapular rash with a history of tick exposure, MSF should always be kept in mind. The differential diagnosis of CCHF and MSF which can cause epidemics in our country should be done by newly developed molecular tests and diagnosis guides...|$|E
