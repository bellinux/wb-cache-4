5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E

25|$|Following Australia's {{loss to the}} English in the World Cup, Gregan led the Wallabies on {{a massive}} winning {{campaign}} during the 2004 season. After defeating Scotland twice at home, the Wallabies faced the English in a World Cup replay in Brisbane, where <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> revenge, defeating England 51 to 15. Under Gregan, Australia lost just three matches in 2004, one against South Africa, one against New Zealand 16-7 in New Zealand and then against France in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 season brought great {{expectation}} with Donegal as reigning All-Ireland champions. However, {{they suffered}} relegation from Division 1 of the National Football League {{early in the}} year. In the Ulster Championship they dispatched Tyrone and Down {{to set up a}} provincial decider with Monaghan. Monaghan were unfancied coming into the game with most of the pressure on the shoulders of the Tir Conaill men. Despite this Monaghan defied the odds and emerged as 0-13 to 0-07 winners. After defeating Laois in the fourth round of the qualifiers Donegal faced a Mayo team looking for revenge in the All-Ireland quarter-final. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> revenge with a 4-17 to 1-10 drubbing that ended Donegal's bid to retain the Sam Maguire.|$|E

25|$|Another {{foil for}} Ralph is Alice's mother, who is even sharper-tongued than her daughter. She despises Ralph {{as a bad}} provider. Alice's father is {{occasionally}} mentioned but never seen. Alice's sister, Agnes, appeared in one episode (Ralph jeopardizes his newlywed sister-in-law's marriage after giving some bad advice to the groom, but all works out in the end). Ralph and Alice lived with her mother for six years after getting married before <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> own apartment. Ralph's mother rarely is mentioned, although she does appear in one episode. Ralph's father is only mentioned in one episode ("Young Man with a Horn") as having given Ralph a cornet he learned to play as a boy, and insists on keeping when Alice suggests it be thrown away. In a 1967 revival, Ralph refers to Alice (played by Sheila MacRae 1966–70 and once more in 1973) as being one of 12 children with her father never working.|$|E
25|$|Notre Dame next {{returned}} home to face the Providence Friars, and, although the Friars were 3–4 in conference play, the game stayed close and the Irish only won after an overtime period. They continued at home and beat DePaul {{in the first of}} two games against the Blue Demons, to move into the rankings {{for the first time in}} the season. As the 21st-ranked team in the country, the team traveled to Seton Hall to face the Pirates. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> second road win of the season, and {{returned home}} to face 16th-ranked Marquette once again. With a win over the Golden Eagles, they moved up to 18th in the rankings. They next traveled to Connecticut to face the 17th-ranked Huskies for the second time. Although the Irish led for much of the game, they lost in the end. Despite winning another road game later in the week against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, they dropped back to 21st in the rankings with a 19–5 record overall.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Dirty Dozen's uniqueness, {{however, the}} band's success {{inspired}} {{a resurgence of}} New Orleans' brass band music, both {{in the city and}} nationwide. The band was most influential in the 1980s, when they demonstrated by example that brass band music could be successful by moving beyond a type of music that risked stagnation as nothing more than a tourist attraction. Before the Dirty Dozen band was formed the Olympia Brass Band was already mixing R and jazz influences in with traditional tunes; the Dirty Dozen took this farther, and gave the trend worldwide visibility. Bands which followed in their wake did not all follow their more jazz oriented stage band approach—only the Soul Rebels have gone in that direction—but a wide variety of bands, from the Rebirth Brass Band to Wisconsin's Youngblood Brass Band have been influenced by them in other ways. Rebirth has the most direct connection with the Dirty Dozen: <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> start playing at Daryl's when the Dirty Dozen was on the road.|$|E

[...] "Looking back further it was where we all lived together in the early years, played all those flapper and jug of ale shows, and then got our record deal".

500|$|The Pipe rolls {{are named}} after the [...] "pipe" [...] shape formed by the rolled up parchments on which the records were {{originally}} written.

They were occasionally referred to as the roll of the treasury, or the great roll of accounts, and the great roll of the pipe.|$|E

500|$|The {{brothers}} {{grew up in}} the 1990s in an Orthodox Jewish {{family in}} Brooklyn.

[...] New York detailed the two [...] "started recording comedy sketches as adolescents, when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> first video camera." [...] They spent most of their teen years in Sullivan County, New York. Benny started college at age 15, while Rafi attended Dickinson College for two years before transferring to Hunter College, where he got a degree in film studies. The two began entertaining their friends with short sketches and full length comedies shot with action figures.|$|E
500|$|They {{appeared}} as specialty dancers in the Broadway musical comedy Hot-Cha! which ran for 119 performances at the Ziegfeld Theatre between 8 March and 18 June 1932. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> break {{when they were}} performing at the Everglades in Manhattan and were spotted by the Shubert brothers. This led to a highly successful career on the stage, in films and in supper clubs. Veloz and Yolanda choreographed the dance sequences in the film Rumba (Paramount, 1935) starring George Raft, and in some sequences Veloz doubled for Raft. The film Under the Pampas Moon (Fox, 1935) starring Warner Baxter featured tango. Rita Cansino, later to achieve fame as Rita Hayworth, performed an exuberant blend of flamenco and tango. The high point of the movie was a performance of a [...] "cobra-tango" [...] by Veloz and Yolanda.|$|E
500|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire were {{developed}} by Game Freak and Nintendo {{under the direction of}} Junichi Masuda. As with its predecessors, Ken Sugimori was the art director, although these were the first games in which he did not single-handedly produce all of the art. When asked where his design team came up with the ideas for all of the new Pokémon, Sugimori stated that <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> ideas from past experiences in their childhood involving nature, animals, and the media and then base them on insects. Even looking at the world in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for the creatures. [...] "First we select an insect and after that we add essential elements to the insects to make it more like Pokemon, such as adding some hard shape to it, to be more like steel," [...] Sugimori said, describing the process of creating a Pokémon.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{remained}} captain for the 1896 season, {{though he}} missed the first four matches of the year due a suspension he had incurred {{at the end of}} the previous season. He returned to the side for round 5 against Williamstown and played up forward in a comfortable 11-goal win. In Melbourne's round 7 win over St Kilda, Markwell wrote that Wilson was [...] "distinctly at his best". And in a round 11 victory against North Melbourne, the same journalist wrote that he had the [...] "soundest judgement" [...] of all forwards on the field. Wilson played [...] "excellently" [...] in the Reds' defeat of Carlton the next week; Markwell remarked upon his desire [...] "to annihilate the men in blue". He kicked his first goal of the season in round 15, a two-goal win over Collingwood, and finished the day with two majors. Markwell observed that Wilson's [...] "judgment and coolness" [...] went a long way to Melbourne winning their round 16 encounter with Essendon. Melbourne finished the season in fourth place on the ladder. Though they never seriously challenged for the premiership, it was noted that the club had bad luck through suspension and injury, and when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> best team on the field they could challenge anyone. In his review of the season, Markwell named Wilson one of Melbourne's best half dozen players.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, {{just after}} an ice hockey {{game in which}} Wayne Gretzky's Edmonton Oilers beat the New Jersey Devils 13–4, Gretzky {{was quoted as saying}} to a reporter, [...] "Well, it's time <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>their</b> act together, they're ruining the whole league.
