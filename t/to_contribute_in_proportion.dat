40|$|Civic Crowdfunding is {{emerging}} as a popular means to mobilize funding from citizens for public projects. A popular mechanism deployed on civic crowdfunding platforms is a provision point mechanism, wherein, the total contributions must reach a predetermined threshold {{in order for the}} project to be provisioned (undertaken). Such a mechanism may have multiple equilibria; unfortunately, in many of these equilibria, the project is not funded even if it is highly valued among the agents. Recent work has proposed mechanisms with refund bonuses where the project gets funded in equilibrium if its net value is higher than a threshold among the agents who are aware of the crowdfunding effort. In this paper, we formalize the notion of social desirability of a public project and propose mechanisms which use the idea of referrals to expand the pool of participants and achieve an equilibrium in which the project gets funded if its net value exceeds a threshold among the entire agent population. We call this new class of mechanisms Referral-Embedded Provision Point Mechanisms (REPPM). We specifically propose two variants of REPPM and both these mechanisms have the remarkable property that, at equilibrium, referral bonuses are offered but {{there is no need for}} actual payment of these bonuses. We establish that any given agent's equilibrium strategy is to refer other agents and <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> to the agent's true value for the project. By referring others to contribute, an agent can, in fact, reduce his equilibrium contribution. In our view, the proposed mechanisms will lead to an increase in the number of projects that are funded on civic crowdfunding platforms...|$|E
40|$|Crowdfunding is {{emerging}} as a popular means to generate funding from citizens for public projects. This is popularly known as civic crowdfunding. In this paper, we focus on crowdfunding public projects with provision point: these are projects in which contributions must reach a predetermined threshold {{in order for the}} project to be provisioned. On web based civic crowdfunding platforms, the success of crowdfunding public projects has been somewhat mixed. In this paper, our objective is to design a mechanism that improves the success of crowdfunding public projects. In particular, we propose a class of mechanisms for crowdfunding platforms with sequentially arriving agents. This class of mechanisms induces an extensive form game for agents arriving on the platform and we show that the game has a non-empty set of sub-game perfect equilibria at which the project is fully funded. We call this new class of mechanisms Provision Point Mechanism with Securities (PPS). The novelty of PPS lies in the use of a prediction market to incentivize agents <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> to their true value for the project and to contribute as soon as they arrive at the crowdfunding platform. Different variations of PPS are possible depending on the underlying prediction market. In this paper, we use a cost function (or equivalently, scoring rule) based prediction market; in fact, we specify the requirements that a cost function should satisfy to be used in PPS. We study and compare two specific instances of PPS: (1) Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule based and (2) Quadratic Scoring Rule based. We also discuss the considerations that should guide the choice of the cost function when deploying our mechanism on crowdfunding platforms...|$|E

In principle each country of a monetary union <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> seigniorage <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> to the country’s demand for base money. However, the actual distribution of seigniorage by the European Central Bank is made in accordance with a specific distribution key, whose components are the respective GDP and population proportions of the individual member countries. Applying this distribution formula, we calculate the weights for the member countries of an enlarged EMU. Pointing to specific features for the countries in Central and Eastern Europe the paper addresses the question whether the new member countries get back the seigiorage that they generated...|$|R
50|$|MAE is not {{identical}} to RMSE, but some researchers report and interpret RMSE as if RMSE reflects the measurement that MAE gives. MAE is conceptually simpler and more interpretable than RMSE. MAE does {{not require the}} use of squares or square roots. The use of squared distances hinders the interpretation of RMSE. MAE is simply the average absolute vertical or horizontal distance between each point in a scatter plot and the Y=X line. In other words, MAE is the average absolute difference between X and Y. MAE is fundamentally easier to understand than the square root of the average of the sum of squared deviations. Furthermore, each error <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> MAE <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> to the absolute value of the error, which is not true for RMSE. See the example above for an illustration of these differences.|$|R

This concept involves utilising a component of the eluent to permit the chromatographic and capillary electrophoresis (CE) separation mechanisms <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>in</b> varying <b>proportions</b> <b>to</b> the separation. This approach was first investigated using a combination of CE with reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) for hydrophobic, charged analytes (aliphatic sulfonates), and using the concentration of organic modifier in the eluent to control the contributions of CE and RP-LC. However, the use of reversed-phase columns was found to be problematic for mobile phases with less then 50 % organic modifier due to the hydrophobicity of the stationary phase causing the column bed to overheat and dry, and low electroosmotic flow (EOF) values (µ ? 17. 8 × 10 – 9 m 2 V– 1 s– 1) caused additional restrictions. In a second case, ion-exchange stationary phases were used, with the type and concentration of a competing anion in the eluent being used to control the contributions of ion chromatography (IC) and CE to the separation. Nine common inorganic anions were separated using a silica based anion-exchange column and phosphate (pH 7. 20) or sulfate (pH 8. 2) as eluent with direct UV detection at 214 nm and 17 inorganic and small organic anions were separated using a nitrate eluent (pH 6. 80) with indirect UV detection at 214 nm. The separation selectivity was shown to be a combination of IC and CE...|$|R
40|$|Human-induced {{climate change}} threatens {{the lives and}} {{livelihoods}} of vulnerable people. Preventing the worst {{effects of climate change}} and compensating those who will suffer are tasks that should be taken up by individuals, firms and states, tasks that constitute a burden. In this thesis I suggest the use of particular principles for justly allocating this "climate burden". I first defend my use of an orthodox ethical approach from Dale Jamieson’s challenge that the ethics of climate change must be revisionary. I also reply to Luc Bovens’ Lockean argument that a history of high emitting justifies giving past polluters more rights to emit. Then, I propose a two-track theory under which the climate burden is divided in two. These two different parts are allocated by a contribution-based "polluter pays" principle and by an "ability to pay" principle. The "fault burden" is the burden from greenhouse gas emissions produced since it became reasonable to suppose that such emissions were harmful, except for the emissions from the very poor, which are not included. The fault burden should be allocated to those who have <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> it, <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> to their contribution. The "no fault burden" is the remaining portion. The no-fault burden should be allocated by an "ability to pay" principle which requires all parties (except for the very poor) to shoulder burdens that constitute an equal drop in whatever goods we deem most relevant. Finally I defend the two track theory from the claim that a "beneficiary pays" principle better allocates the burden caused by past emissions...|$|R
40|$|Fission-track, U^Pb and Pb^Pb {{analyses}} of detrital heavy mineral populations in depositional basins and modern river sediments {{are widely used}} to infer the exhumational history of mountain belts. However, relatively few studies address the underlying assumption that detrital mineral populations provide an accurate representation of their entire source region. Implicit in this assumption {{is the idea that}} all units have equal potential <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> heavy minerals <b>in</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> their exposure area in the source region. In reality, the detrital mineral population may be biased by variable concentrations of minerals in bedrock and di¡erential erosion rates within the source region. This study evaluates the relative importance of these two variables by using mixing of U^Pb zircon ages to trace zircon populations from source units, through the £uvial system, and into the foreland. The ¢rst part of the study focuses on theMarsyandi drainage in central Nepal, using tributaries that drain single formations to de¢ne the U^Pb age distributions of individual units and using trunk river samples to evaluate the relative contributions from each lithology. Observedmixing proportions are comparedwith proportions predicted by a simple model incorporating lithologic exposure area and zircon concentration. The relative erosion rates that account for the discrepancy between the observed and predicted mixing proportions are then modelled and comparedwith independent erosional proxies. The study also compares U^Pb age distributions from four adjacent drainages spanning 250 km along the Himalayan front using the Kolmogorov^Smirnov statistic and statistical estimates of the proportion of zircon derived from each upstream lithology. Results show that, along this broad swath of rugged mountains, the U^Pb age distributions are remarkably similar, thereby allowing data from more localized sources to be extrapolated along strike...|$|R
