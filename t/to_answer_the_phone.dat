5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E

25|$|On December 7, 1973, {{investigators}} {{found that an}} 18½-minute portion of one recorded tape had been erased. Rose Mary Woods, Nixon’s longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later forensic analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and {{perhaps as many as}} nine.|$|E

The quoted delivery time was 60 days but it was many more months before the machines were shipped. By August 1975, they had shipped over 5,000 computers.|$|R

5000|$|Aiming for {{national}} distribution from day one, the partners searched specialty dog publications, recording {{the names of}} potential customers - breeders, kennel owners, hunters, and fellow veterinarians. [...] The first batch of 16,000 catalogs was mailed out in February 1983 using hand typed labels. [...] Two people were hired <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> and handle distribution from the clinics' waiting rooms, which were used to store products.

500|$|Scarface {{provoked}} outrage mainly {{due to its}} unprecedented violence, {{but also}} because of its shifts of tone from serious to comedic. Dave Kehr, writing in the Chicago Reader, said that the film blends [...] "comedy and horror in a manner that suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun." [...] In one scene, Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way. His bumbling assistant, following orders from Camonte, keeps trying <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> instead of ducking even after the gangsters make several passes by the cafe. After the barrage is over, Camonte picks up a tommy gun one of the mobsters dropped, and exhibits child like wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy. Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone (who was also the blatant inspiration for Little Caesar) were being applauded in movie houses all across America. Some of the biographical details that were used for Muni's character in Scarface were so obviously taken from Capone, and the detail so close, that it was impossible not to draw the parallels. Capone sent several members of his gang to threaten screenwriter Ben Hecht, but Hecht was able to convince them the picture was based on other gangsters. When Scarface was released however, Capone adored the film, and purchased a personal copy. The film remained out of circulation, until Hughes's death in 1976. Universal then re-released the picture, but some scenes from the film's original cut are lost.|$|E
2500|$|The {{games are}} visual novels, {{in which the}} player can affect {{the outcome of the}} story through choices. In Chaos;Head and Chaos;Child, the player does this by {{controlling}} what types of delusions the player character experiences: they can make him experience positive or negative delusions, or alternatively choose to let him stay in reality. Chaos;Child Love Chu Chu!! additionally uses a [...] "yes/no" [...] questionnaire the player character takes in in-game magazines to determine the plot's direction. In Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0, the player affects the outcome by using the player character's cell phone: in Steins;Gate, it is done by choosing to respond to certain messages, make phone calls, or taking out the phone at specific times, as this affects what information the player character learns and how he interacts with other characters; and in Steins;Gate 0, it is done by deciding whether or not <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> at certain times. Robotics;Notes works similarly to Steins;Gate, but with the player using a tablet computer and its apps instead of a cell phone.|$|E

[...] Greetings such as [...] "Have you eaten?" [...] ( [...] Htamin sa pi bi la) and [...] "How are you?" [...] ( [...] Nei kaung la) are still common.

When Cordy tells him <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> he seems {{more interested in the}} pocketbooks {{of the people on the}} other end than their problems. Gunn talks to a woman whose dead ex is stalking her, while Wesley and Lorne talk to three demons in chrome face masks who, Lorne says (translating), having read some of Wesley's work, want to buy his head. When he clarifies he tells Wes that they want him to solve a traditional puzzle for them. While they're talking Fred notices the complicated geometric pattern on the demons' tunics, and they leave suddenly to either consult their prince or eat a cheesemonkey.|$|R
5000|$|Peanut. This {{intermittently}} appearing character (voiced by David Alan Grier), is a {{black woman}} ostensibly hired <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> at <b>the</b> studios of CBS Radio (the real life networks where the Adam Carolla Show is broadcast). The running gag is that every time Peanut is featured on <b>the</b> show, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> banks that she is supposed <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> ring constantly, and the calls are often put on hold or disconnected. Peanut's character is disrespectful, possessed of a hair-trigger temper, speaks poor English (once taking the day off for what she called [...] "Mobba Loofin King's Burfday"), and usually ends the sketch by threatening to take off her earrings and flip-flops and challenging Adam to [...] "take it to the parking lot" [...] whenever he makes the slightest suggestion that Peanut is not doing her job.|$|R

The number was over 5,000 by August 1975. MITS had under 20 employees in January but had grown to 90 by October 1975.|$|R

40|$|Although {{promising}} {{results have}} been achieved for human action recognition under well-controlled conditions, it is very challenging to recognize human actions in realistic scenarios due to increased difficulties such as dynamic backgrounds. In this paper, we propose to take multimodal (i. e., audiovisual) characteristics of realistic human action videos into account in human action recognition for the first time, since, in realistic scenarios, audio signals accompanying an action generally provide a cue {{to the nature of}} the action, such as <b>phone</b> ringing <b>to</b> <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> In order <b>to</b> cope with diverse audio cues of an action in realistic scenarios, we propose to identify effective features from a large number of audio features with the generalized multiple kernel learning algorithm. The widely used space-time interest point descriptors are utilized as visual features, and a support vector machine is employed for both audio- and video-based classifications. At the final stage, fuzzy integral is utilized to fuse recognition results of both audio and visual modalities. Experimental results on the challenging Hollywood- 2 Human Action data set demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve better recognition performance improvement than that of integrating scene context. It is also discovered how audio context influences realistic action recognition from our comprehensive experiments. Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|In February 1994 the {{resources}} of NMPH were stretched to the limit by the horrific discoveries at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. Calls to the helpline from relatives of missing people trebled and extra volunteers had to be brought in <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones.</b> New callers reported relatives missing for the first time, even though some had vanished ten years ago or even more. Distressed families already {{in touch with the}} helpline called again, in case their missing relative might figure in the investigation. The police directed anxious families to NMPH for comfort and support. Gloucestershire Police called too, seeking help on identifying the bodies found at Cromwell Street and elsewhere. Their initial interest was in women reported missing from Worcestershire and Gloucestershire in the 1970s and 1980s. Some 390 names were supplied including Alison Chambers and Carol Cooper who were later identified as victims. At the same time, details mentioned by Frederick West were passed to NMPH for checking against our database. One result of this was the identification of Juanita Mott another of the victims discovered at Cromwell Street. A positive side effect of the charities role in the investigation was the reunion of 110 non-victim families in less than two months. On 27 June 1994 the charity took over the Message Home Helpline from the Mothers' Union, allowing adult missing people to pass a message home. In response to NMPH's growing achievements the charity was honoured that HRH The Duchess of Gloucester GCVO accepted the role of Patron. The Duchess continues to attend performances on our behalf and raise morale of staff and volunteers with regular visits.|$|R
