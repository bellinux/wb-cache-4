5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|Abdulwahab Hussain {{was also}} a member of Al Wefaq who {{resigned}} in 2005. Unlike Mushaima and al-Singace, Hussain left politics in 2005. He returned in 2009 when he co-founded Al Wafa' opposition group and became its official spokesperson. He played a bigger role in the uprising; he was not arrested when the uprising began nor was he outside the country. Hussain led the first demonstration in the uprising {{in the early hours of}} 14 February. He is also credited with suggesting autonomous action and total decentralization of the protest movement which was adopted by February 14 Youth Coalition, the group behind the call for an uprising in order <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> infiltrated by government.|$|E

His father, also named Joseph, worked as a roofer and played football semi-professionally for Northwich Victoria. Barton enjoyed physical education at his school, St Thomas Becket, which he represented in various sports and was a talented rugby league prospect. He left school with ten GCSEs.|$|E

5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E

5|$|Rabban Bar Sauma, a Nestorian Christian Uyghur Turk born in Zhongdu (later Khanbaliq, Beijing, {{capital of}} the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty), China, was sent to Europe in 1287 as an {{ambassador}} for Arghun, ruler of the Ilkhanate and grandnephew of Kublai Khan. He was preceded by Isa Kelemechi, an Assyrian Nestorian Christian {{who worked as a}} court astronomer for Kublai Khan in Khanbaliq, and was sent by Arghun to Pope Honorius IV in 1285. A decade earlier, Bar Sauma had originally set out on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, passing through Gansu and Khotan in Northwest China, yet spent time in Armenia and Baghdad instead <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> caught up in nearby armed conflicts. He had been accompanied by Rabban Markos, another Uyghur Nestorian Christian from China who was elected as the Patriarch of the Eastern Church and advised Arghun Khan to have Bar Sauma lead the diplomatic mission to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Dot holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), {{but they do not}} want to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so they do not have to go to school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E

25|$|Death feigning {{may also}} play a role in reproduction, For example, in the nursery web spider, the male {{sometimes}} feigns death <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> eaten by females during mating. In some cases, death feigning is used by a predator. For example, the predatory cichlid Haplochromis livingstoni lies on its side on the bottom sediments until approached by scavengers attracted to {{what appears to be a}} dead fish, whereupon H. livingstoni abandons the pretence, rights itself and attacks the scavenger.|$|E

If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.|$|E

25|$|The virus circulates between ticks and rodents, {{with humans}} being the {{secondary}} hosts. People {{at risk for}} catching the disease are hikers and campers {{that are in the}} risk areas.

Unfortunately, this is also when the weather is pleasant for hiking and camping. The best way <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> bitten and catching this disease is wearing long sleeves or pants, avoiding high tick-infested areas, and wearing tick repellent.|$|E

25|$|The term {{refers to}} a {{specific}} form of analysis paralysis, felt by a batsman when he has scored more than 90 runs in an innings, and is nervous because of the pressure and desire to convert this into a century (100 runs), which {{is considered to be}} a milestone of success in the game. Therefore this situation is referred to as batsmen being in the nervous nineties. Batsmen tend to bat in a more conservative manner when they are close to their century, in order <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> out and thus missing out on the milestone. Batsmen dismissed on 99 are considered the unluckiest of the nervous nineties victims.|$|E
25|$|Simple {{heuristics}} like hill climbing, which move {{by finding}} better neighbour after better neighbour and stop {{when they have}} reached a solution which has no neighbours that are better solutions, cannot guarantee to lead {{to any of the}} existing better solutions – their outcome may easily be just a local optimum, while the actual best solution would be a global optimum. Metaheuristics use the neighbours of a solution as a way to explore the solutions space, and although they prefer better neighbours, they also accept worse neighbours in order <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> stuck in local optima; they can find the global optimum if run for a long enough amount of time.|$|E
25|$|C. lectularius only feeds {{every five}} to seven days, which {{suggests}} {{that it does not}} spend the majority of its life searching for a host. When a bed bug is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches for a host. If it successfully feeds, it returns to its shelter. If it does not feed, it continues to search for a host. After searching—regardless of whether or not it has eaten—the bed bug returns to the shelter to aggregate before the photophase (period of light during a day-night cycle). Reis argues that two reasons explain why C. lectularius would return to its shelter and aggregate after feeding. One is to find a mate and the other is to find shelter <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>getting</b> smashed after eating.|$|E
