[...] "I wanted to write some strong characters, but I didn't {{want them to be}} like those horrible people in those awful American science fiction films, chewing gum and stating the obvious. Not that I wanted to do something terribly 'British', but I didn't like all the flag-waving you got in those films. I tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>real</b> human interest in the stories, and some good humour." ...|$|E
500|$|Mace {{was seen}} as a strong yet very {{feminine}} female character, as she often rescues Lenny in dire situations and shows maternal concern for him. Both characters represent a significant contrast: Mace is the film's hero and moral center, whereas Lenny is the antihero; Mace is black and Lenny is white; and finally, Mace represents the [...] "hard-edged, reality-based" [...] component, while Lenny is dominated by fantasies. This is especially notable when Mace yells to him, [...] "This is your life! Right here! Right now! It's real time, you hear me? Real time, time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>real,</b> not playback!" [...] The film's white characters also tend to be nihilistically concerned with the present, while black characters are generally future revolutionaries. Bigelow considered Strange Days as her most personal film, claiming that [...] "It's a synthesis of all the different tracks I've been exploring, either deliberately or unconsciously, ever since I started making art." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first single}} {{released}} from Mona Bone Jakon was [...] "Lady D'Arbanville", which Stevens wrote about his young American girlfriend Patti D'Arbanville. The record, with a madrigal sound unlike most music played on pop radio, with sounds of djembes and bass {{in addition to}} Stevens' and Davies' guitars, reached number 8 in the UK. It {{was the first of}} his hits <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>real</b> airplay in the US. It sold over 1 million copies, and was awarded a gold record in 1971. Other songs written for D'Arbanville included [...] "Maybe You're Right", and [...] "Just Another Night". In addition, the song [...] "Pop Star", about his experience as a teen star, and [...] "Katmandu", featuring Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel playing flute, were featured. Mona Bone Jakon was an early example of the solo singer-songwriter album format that was becoming popular for other artists as well. Rolling Stone magazine compared its popularity with that of Elton John's Tumbleweed Connection, saying it was played [...] "across the board, across radio formats".|$|E

I just got boiling mad, and I sailed right into her, and told her she didn't know a nice baby when she saw one, and ours was the nicest baby in the world. And after that I just worshipped him. Mother died before he was three years old and I was sister and mother to him both. Poor little lad, he was never strong, and he died when he wasn't much over twenty.
