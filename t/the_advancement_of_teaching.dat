40|$|Throughout his career, a core theme {{running through}} Eric Hoyle's writing {{has been his}} concern with the {{development}} <b>of</b> the <b>teaching</b> profession. Building {{on the work of}} classic American sociologists such as Everett Hughes and D. C. Lortie, for over 30 years Hoyle has been an observer, commentator and analyst <b>of</b> the <b>teaching</b> profession in England, highlighting advances, challenges and contradictions in the profession's changing fortunes. One factor that Hoyle has consistently seen as important in his analysis of the profession is its changing relationship with universities. From his earliest writings (Hoyle, 1974), Hoyle has considered universities important for <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> profession for two, closely interrelated reasons. Firstly they are important because they contribute to the process of 'professionalization'. Drawing his analysis from the sociology of the professions, Hoyle has argued that professionalization is an essentially political process; it is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> status of a profession. Because of their own status in society, a close association with universities, for initial training, for continuing professional development and for research, can therefore contribute to <b>the</b> political <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> profession, helping to legitimate the status of its professional knowledge. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} that the K- 12 education system in the U. S. must be redesigned.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose an approach to redesigning the American school that is informed by combining the Learning Sciences with the Organization Sciences. We begin by summarizing key contributions of the learning sciences. We then consider what two perspectives on organizations—contingency theory and institutional theory— reveal about the influence of task and external environment on the formal structures of organizations.

40|$|In the Pearce Report {{three major}} goals of law schools were {{identified}} as {{similar to those of}} universities: to undertake research; to service the community; and to <b>teach.</b> 1 Achievement <b>of</b> the last goal required going beyond the mere “imparting of knowledge” to include (among other things) an understanding of the law in operation as well as in context, and to develop in students practical legal skills and competencies that were essential to all types of legal work, notwithstanding the degree of separation of that work from the practice of law. 2 The recommendation was made that this objective could be achieved by teaching specific practical legal skills such as advocacy, communication, counselling, drafting, interpretation of legislation, negotiation, and research and writing. 3 One inference to be drawn from the above recommendation is that the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> law can be improved, and the perceived separation of the theory and the practice of law narrowed to some extent, by incorporating practical legal skills into the curricula of law schools. This hypothesis, that <b>teaching</b> and learning <b>of</b> law can be optimised by creating and maintaining a substantial and realistic nexus between legal theory and legal practice, 4 finds support from recent research in general educational theory and methodology of other practice-based professions. 5 However, research in Australia to support that hypothesis in regard to law in the interim since the publication of the Pearce Report appears to remain limited if special issues of periodicals, 6 specialist periodicals 7 and projects supported by the Committee for <b>the</b> <b>Advancement</b> <b>of</b> University <b>Teaching</b> 8 can be relied upon as indicators of research. This alleged limitation exists notwithstanding attention being brought by the Pearce Report to the relative paucity of writing, and to the almost absolute absence of empirical data, on legal education. 9 A movement towards incorporation of such a practical approach, endorsed at the time of publication of the Pearce Report by some commentators 10 and subsequently supported by others, 11 has occurred since the release of the Pearce Report, especially in newly established law schools which have been innovative to varying degrees, 12 thanks in part to support from the Committee for <b>the</b> <b>Advancement</b> <b>of</b> University <b>Teaching.</b> This paper describes one such innovation in legal education, the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> interviewing skills as an addition to the mooting component of the criminal law course, adopted at the Law School of the Flinders University of South Australia and {{supported by a grant from}} the Committee for <b>the</b> <b>Advancement</b> <b>of</b> University <b>Teaching</b> during 1994.

25|$|The SAT rose in {{prominence}} after World War II due {{to several}} factors. Machine-based scoring of multiple-choice tests taken by pencil {{had made it}} possible to rapidly process the exams. The G.I. Bill produced an influx of millions of veterans into higher education. The formation of the Educational Testing Service (ETS) also {{played a significant role in}} the expansion of the SAT beyond the roughly fifty colleges that made up the College Board at the time. The ETS was formed in 1947 by the College Board, Carnegie Foundation for <b>the</b> <b>Advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Teaching,</b> and the American Council on Education, to consolidate respectively the operations of the SAT, the GRE, and the achievement tests developed by Ben Wood for use with Conant's scholarship exams. The new organization was to be philosophically grounded in the concepts of open-minded, scientific research in testing with no doctrine to sell and with an eye toward public service. The ETS was chartered after the death of Brigham, who had opposed the creation of such an entity. Brigham felt that the interests of a consolidated testing agency would be more aligned with sales or marketing than with research into the science of testing. It has been argued that the interest of the ETS in expanding the SAT in order to support its operations aligned with the desire of public college and university faculties to have smaller, diversified, and more academic student bodies as a means to increase research activities. In 1951, about 80,000 SATs were taken; in 1961, about 800,000; and by 1971, about 1.5 million SATs were being taken each year.|$|E
