40|$|This study {{examines}} post-listing equity price performance of foreign firms which cross-listed sponsored American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on the New York and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchanges</b> during <b>the</b> period 1982 - 1992. We use three valuation metrics – price-to-book, price-to-cash-earnings, and price-to-earnings – which are adjusted {{for the home}} country and world industry indices to which the listing firm's stock belongs. We find positive valuation effects associated with cross-listing for both country-benchmarked and industry-benchmarked price ratios. Variables that proxy for home country characteristics such as governance styles, disclosure quality, market liquidity, and so forth are unable to explain the cross-sectional variation in the data. Our results thus suggest that cross-listing in the U. S. enhances valuations for listing firms by simply reducing the overall effect of segmentation among different national securities markets. © 1996 JIBS.

He proclaimed Hong Kong as the most failed financial {{system in the world}} to let these politicians go unarrested.

Under Treat’s leadership, NYMEX also began to research the potential for trading natural gas and electricity, but focused first on natural gas.

In this paper, empirical research will be conducted to analyse those US-listed Mainland Chinese companies with DCSS. This paper aims to assess those transnational companies, their characteristics and corporate performances. As to the range of data to be covered, only those companies listed after 2011 will be sampled in this paper. It is because some of those data of the Mainland Chinese companies on NYSE or NASDAQ listed prior to 2011 were not available or were inaccurate; counting them leads to misleading results. Furthermore, those data is dated for such a changing area of law. In order to reflect the up-to-date status accurately, this paper focuses its empirical study of data which date back to 2011...|$|R

The major aim of the Act is to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures, forecing company's officers to be more accountable for their conduct. Section 404 of the Act is considered by experts and financial practitioners the most challenging aspect of the Act. It requires publicly registered companies and their external auditors to report on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.
