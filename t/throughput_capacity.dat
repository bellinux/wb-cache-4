It is shown that due to their limitations, each of these methodologies on their own cannot completely explain the complex behavioural and physical processes involved in roundabout entries, hence all the models require strong semi-empirical or fully-empirical bases using data obtained from their countries of origin. Differences in driver behaviour and methodologies thus result in differences in predicted capacities by the various models, and although local calibration allows some transferability, it is often limited by the availability of data or an incomplete understanding of the relationships between model parameters and capacity...|$|R

40|$|<b>Throughput</b> and {{transmission}} <b>capacity</b> of ad hoc networks with channel state information Abstract — This paper develops a general framework for deriving the spatial <b>throughput</b> {{and transmission}} <b>capacity</b> of spatially Poisson distributed ad hoc networks for (i) random (e. g., fading) channels, and (ii) random transmission distances. In {{both of these}} scenarios the randomness of the channels and ranges invariably lowers both <b>throughput</b> and transmission <b>capacity</b> assuming that users randomly elect to transmit with some probability (i. e., Aloha). Assuming each node knows the channel state information (CSI, e. g., the channel gain and/or channel distance) to just its intended receiver, we propose a simple distributed threshold-based scheduling rule and derive the threshold that optimizes throughput. The gains are surprisingly large: a factor of three increase in throughput over Aloha is typical even with no further coordination between the nodes in the network. I...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetrical Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF 4) is a {{separation}} technique applicable to particles {{over a wide}} size range. Despite the many advantages of AF 4, its adoption in routine particle analysis is somewhat limited by the large footprint of currently available separation cartridges, extended analysis times and significant solvent consumption. To address these issues, we describe the fabrication and characterization of miniaturized AF 4 cartridges. Key features of the scale-down platform include simplified cartridge and reagent handling, reduced analysis costs and higher <b>throughput</b> <b>capacities.</b> The separation performance of the miniaturized cartridge is assessed using certified gold and silver nanoparticle standards. Analysis of gold nanoparticle populations indicates shorter analysis times and increased sensitivity compared to conventional AF 4 separation schemes. Moreover, nanoparticulate titanium dioxide populations exhibiting broad size distributions are analyzed in a rapid and efficient manner. Finally, the repeatability and reproducibility of the miniaturized platform are investigated with respect to analysis time and separation efficiency...|$|R

40|$|As {{data have}} been growing rapidly in data centers, {{deduplication}} storage systems continuously face challenges in providing the corresponding <b>throughputs</b> and <b>capacities</b> necessary to move backup data within backup and recovery window times. One approach {{is to build a}} cluster deduplication storage system with multiple deduplication storage system nodes. The goal is to achieve scalable <b>throughput</b> and <b>capacity</b> using extremely highthroughput (e. g. 1. 5 GB/s) nodes, with a minimal loss of compression ratio. The key technical issue is to route data intelligently at an appropriate granularity. We present a cluster-based deduplication system that can deduplicate with high throughput, support deduplication ratios comparable to that of a single system, and maintain a low variation in the storage utilization of individual nodes. In experiments with dozens of nodes, we examine tradeoffs between stateless data routing approaches with low overhead and stateful approaches that have higher overhead but avoid imbalances that can adversely affect deduplication effectiveness for some datasets in large clusters. The stateless approach has been deployed in a two-node commercial system that achieves 3 GB/s for multi-stream deduplication throughput and currently scales to 5. 6 PB of storage (assuming 20 X total compression). ...|$|R
