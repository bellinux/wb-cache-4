5|$|Beginning at Highway61 in the south, {{the route}} {{proceeds}} straight north along a concession road midway between Monteith Road {{to the west}} and Hanna Road to the east. Surrounded almost entirely by farmland, the highway encounters McCluskey Drive onekilometre (0.62mi) along its route and Candy Mountain Drive twokilometres north of that. At the latter is the small community of Slate River Valley, though relatively few residences are located on the highway. At Barrie Drive, twokilometres north of the community, the highway turns east; a channelized right turn lane is provided for northbound traffic while southbound traffic is given <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> at the intersection. The highway travels east to Hanna Road where it turns north; this junction features a channelized lane for southbound traffic while giving northbound traffic <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> at the intersection.|$|E
5|$|Each {{captain had}} {{different}} interpretations of The Rule of the Road believing his ship had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b> Captain John Boutwood of the Curacoa kept to the liner's mean course to maximize {{his ability to}} defend the liner from enemy aircraft, while Commodore Sir Cyril G. Illingworth of Queen Mary continued their zig-zag pattern expecting the escort cruiser to give way.|$|E
5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> {{had to be}} cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if {{it had to be}} moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
50|$|The Association {{was renamed}} <b>the</b> American <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Way</b> Association in 1935 {{and again in}} 1980, when it became <b>the</b> International <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Way</b> Association.|$|R
50|$|The Mesta was an {{association}} of sheep owners, (Spanish nobility and religious orders) that had an important economic and political role in medieval Castile. To preserve <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> its transhumant herds through cañadas, the Mesta acted against small peasants.|$|R
40|$|Urban cities {{grown in}} {{population}} day by day, proportionally to the electricity demand. <b>The</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> and <b>the</b> decreasing of land space {{to build new}} overhead transmission line towers, other criterion had to be observed. Other than upgrading towers, re-conductoring can be pursued {{if it does not}} violates <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> in any aspect. This project compares available conductors in the market to determine which will provide better performance in terms of current and sag for 275 kV lattice tower...|$|R
5|$|Bellaire's {{population}} had reached 1,124 in 1940. After 1940, Bellaire had a rapid population {{explosion in the}} post-World War II building boom. On December 31, 1948, the city of Houston had annexed the land around the city of Bellaire, stopping the city of Bellaire's land growth. Bellaire remained independent of Houston; Bellaire adopted a home rule charter with a council-manager government in April 1949. By 1950 the city's residents had numbered 10,173, and there were 3,186 houses. However each subsequent {{year for the next}} two years, an additional 600 to 700 new houses opened. Due to the resulting population increase, several schools, including Bellaire High School, Marion High School, and two elementary schools, were established in that period, and Condit Elementary received a new addition. In the 1960s 250 houses in Bellaire were demolished to make way for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> of the 610 Loop, which bisected the city.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century the number of {{companies}} using the railroad for shipping on Chicago's near north side declined severely. In the 1970s customers at the east end of the line included the Curtiss candy factory and the Jardine Water Purification Plant. The construction of the Columbus Drive Bridge in 1982 wiped out part of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> and the spur to Navy Pier was abandoned. Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s, and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of the spur served only one customer, the Chicago Sun-Times, with only one train per day. The newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in early 2001 leaving no traffic across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised in the open position. On December 12, 2007 the bridge was one of 12 historic Chicago railroad bridges to be designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Arlington {{developed}} along several railroads {{that have}} since been abandoned or re-purposed. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, which spurred the establishment of Arlington in the 1880s, ran north–south through Arlington on its main line between Snohomish and the Canadian border. In 1892, it was acquired by the Northern Pacific Railway, which was acquired by Burlington Northern in 1970. Burlington Northern abandoned the railroad in 1972, favoring a parallel route to the west through Marysville, and it was converted into the Centennial Trail in the 1990s and 2000s. A Northern Pacific branch to Darrington, following the modern-day State Route 530, was built in 1901 and abandoned in 1990; the county government plans to use <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> for the Whitehorse Trail, a multi-purpose trail.|$|E
50|$|As {{the fiber}} optic {{telecommunications}} industry boomed, {{one of the}} greatest impediments to rapid growth for the telecoms was <b>the</b> acquisition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> within which to lay the fiber optic cables. The Ledes came up with a solution to this problem and negotiated a deal with the Canadian National Railway to install the cable in <b>the</b> railroad's <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> alongside <b>the</b> tracks.|$|R
50|$|Sotomayor {{argued that}} the {{majority}} was wrong to analyze <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> under <b>the</b> common law. Instead she concluded that traditional common law terms acquire different meanings in the unique context <b>of</b> railroad <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sotomayor also {{disagreed}} {{that the}} United States's position contradicted {{its position in}} Great Northern, pointing to language in its brief in Great Northern that qualified its description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> as easements.|$|R
5|$|Schnaufer never regained {{consciousness}} and succumbed to his injuries {{at the hospital}} two days later on 15 July 1950. The investigation into the accident concluded that though {{the impact of the}} two vehicles was severe, it seemed unlikely that the collision itself was the cause of his injuries. It was speculated {{that at least one of}} the truck's cargo of 30 empty gas cylinders, which were thrown off by the collision, had struck Schnaufer on the head. Subsequently, the truck driver was charged with manslaughter and breach of traffic regulations before a court at Jauge, Cestas. The hearing began on 29 July 1950 and concluded with his conviction on 16 November 1950. Gasc was found guilty of not yielding <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> and his speed was considered too high. It was ruled that as a consequence of not observing the law, he involuntarily caused the death of Schnaufer.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} railroad between San Francisco and San Jose (known as the Peninsula Commute) {{was built}} by the San Francisco and San Jose Rail Road in 1863. In 1870 the railroad was acquired by Southern Pacific. Southern Pacific double tracked the line in 1904. In 1958 the railroad had record ridership, 7.5 million passengers. The popularity of the railroad began to decline and in 1977 Southern Pacific petitioned to the state government to discontinue Peninsula Commute. After months of negotiation, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) reached {{an agreement with the}} three counties of which the Peninsula Commute ran through to continue rail operation. Under the agreement, the system was renamed Caltrain and operation responsibilities were shared by Caltrans, Southern Pacific and the three counties. The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board was formed in 1987, and it bought <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> of Caltrain from Southern Pacific in late 1991 for $220million. The PCJPB formally took over the operation of Caltrain in 1992 and contracted Amtrak to operate the system. In the same year, Caltrain extended to Gilroy. Amtrak's contract with PCJPB was renewed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of the Green Line is {{near the}} intersection of Branch Avenue (Maryland Route 5) and Auth Road just inside the Capital Beltway near Andrews Air Force Base. The route goes northwest through a park to join <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> of the Suitland Parkway. It veers southeast along Southern Avenue and then north on 13th Street SE to rejoin Suitland Parkway. The Green Line crosses the Anacostia River and tunnels under the Washington Navy Yard and travels west under M Street SE. It then joins the Yellow Line in a tunnel under 7th Street SW. The tunnel bends west along Florida Avenue and U Street NW and then turns north under 14th Street NW. The tunnel turns northeast under New Hampshire Ave NW, and cut across Fort Totten Park where it intersects the Red Line. The Green Line runs east through the Fort Circle Parks and tunnels under Queens Chapel Road to emerge along the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad right of way to Greenbelt adjacent to the Capital Beltway.|$|E
50|$|More than 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> for <b>the</b> {{line had}} been {{acquired}} by May 2007. It {{is expected that}} the project can benefit from carbon finance under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol.|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 1884, the LS&MS and MCR amended their lease, {{making it}} perpetual. The {{agreement}} also transferred <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>way,</b> track, and all equipment of the MCR to the LS&MS, effectively ending the MCR's independent existence as a railroad.|$|R

25|$|Although {{recommended}} {{and studied}} several times since, further Blue Line extension to Lynn has not moved past the proposal stage. <b>The</b> former <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> from Revere Street to Point of Pines {{is owned by}} the Massachusetts Electric Company, a National Grid subsidiary, and used as a utility corridor. Most of its length is covered in brush or wetlands, although several residential buildings and parking areas incur on <b>the</b> utility-owned <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> in Point <b>of</b> Pines. The Alternatives Analysis / Draft Environmental Impact Statement, released in 2011, considered two potential routes: one following <b>the</b> Narrow Gauge <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> through Point <b>of</b> Pines, and one sharing <b>the</b> Newburyport/Rockport Line <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R

25|$|Pedestrian {{crossings}} without {{traffic signals}} are also common. In this case, the traffic laws usually {{states that the}} pedestrian has <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> when crossing, and that vehicles must stop when a pedestrian uses the crossing. Countries and driving cultures vary greatly as {{to the extent to}} which this is respected.
