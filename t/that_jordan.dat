Spurred on by several momentary encounters with similarly demonic beings, Black returns to his home town of Seattle, Washington.

Waking in captivity, he learns that they seek his help against the same demonic forces he has been encountering—and <b>that</b> <b>Jordan</b> is now a willing initiate of the Group.

5|$|Football is {{the most}} popular sport in Jordan. The {{national}} football team has improved in recent years, though it has yet to qualify for the World Cup.

This was the highest <b>that</b> <b>Jordan</b> had advanced in the World Cup qualifying rounds since 1986.

5|$|Many of Jordan's contemporaries say <b>that</b> <b>Jordan</b> is the {{greatest}} basketball player of all time. In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan {{the greatest}} North American athlete of the 20th century, above such luminaries as Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali. Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press's December 1999 list of 20th century athletes. In addition, the Associated Press voted him as the greatest basketball player of the 20th century. Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times. In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.|$|E

5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed <b>that</b> <b>Jordan</b> had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E

5|$|In the 1992–93 season, {{despite a}} 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, Jordan's streak of {{consecutive}} MVP seasons ended as {{he lost the}} award to his friend Charles Barkley. Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, {{and became the first}} player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards. He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs <b>that</b> <b>Jordan</b> was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.|$|E

The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E

50|$|Jordans yearly {{income from}} the {{endorsements}} {{is estimated to be}} over forty million dollars. In addition, when Jordans power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games. Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US $30 million per season. An academic study found <b>that</b> <b>Jordans</b> first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.|$|R

25|$|The Elon Peace Plan is a {{solution}} for the Arab-Israeli conflict proposed in 2002 by former minister Binyamin Elon.
