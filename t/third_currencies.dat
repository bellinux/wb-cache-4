40|$|This paper {{examines}} the hedging decision {{of an international}} firm facing ex-change rate risk exposure to a foreign currency cash flow. Financial markets are incomplete in {{that there are no}} hedging instruments directly related to the home currency. There is, however, an unbiased currency forward market between the foreign currency and a third currency accessible to the firm. A tri-angular parity condition holds among the home, foreign, and <b>third</b> <b>currencies,</b> thereby making cross-hedging opportunities available. If the spot exchange rate of the home currency against the third currency and that of the third currency against the foreign currency are positively (negatively) correlated in the sense of regression dependence, we show that the firm’s optimal forward position is an under-hedge or an over-hedge, depending on whether the firm’s Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion is everywhere less (greater) or greater (less) than unity, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) treaty signed at Maastricht {{does not}} {{guarantee}} the recreation of German-style economic policies and outcomes at the European Community (EC) level.

The Council of Ministers has the power to set exchange rate policy vis-à-vis <b>third</b> <b>currencies.</b> The treaty does not provide binding constraints against fiscal profligacy in member states. The German government agreed to this suboptimal outcome because {{in the wake of the}} demise of the Soviet Union and German unification it had broader political interests in maintaining the pace of European integration at Maastricht. The Bundesbank's policy of high interest rates in 1992, however, has effectively guaranteed a two-speed monetary union, in which the first group of members will be limited to a narrow deutschemark zone. Given the waning enthusiasm for integration across the EC, the German government has no incentive to alter this outcome. Copyright 1993 Blackwell Publishers Ltd [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The precised {{calendar}} of Maastricht treaty {{for setting up}} the european System of central banks (ESCB) and {{the european central bank}} (ECB) with a single currency can merely be explained by the concern of the member countries of having such a monetary integration {{before the end of the}} century.

If the objectives of price controls and non monetisation of debt assigned to ESCB are unequivocal, the responsability of fixing the parity of écu vis-à-vis <b>third</b> <b>currencies</b> which belongs to the Council and the Parliament might deprive the ESCB of full scope in conducting monetary policy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the choice of invoice currency under exchange rate uncertainty. The analysis is motivated by the fact that the U. S. dollar has been the dominant vehicle currency in developing countries. The theoretical analysis is based on an open economy model of monopolistic competition. The export prices are set before exchange rates are known. When the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to set their prices not to deviate from those of the competitors. As a result, when the other exporters set their prices in the <b>third</b> <b>currency,</b> the exporting firm tends to choose the <b>third</b> <b>currency</b> as an equilibrium invoice currency. The tendency becomes conspicuous in the market where the shares of local firms are small. The latter part of the paper empirically investigates the relevancy of the theoretical results by using the export price data in Korea. We find that export prices in Korea are highly stable in terms of the US dollar even in the commodities for which Japan has had dominant shares. We also find that export prices in Korea are more stable against the US dollar in the commodities for which the shares of local firms are small in Japan. The empirical results are consistent with our theoretical model. The result may explain why the firm tends to set prices in the US dollar even if the United States is not a trade partner. ...|$|R

40|$|This study uses two-way quoted data {{on major}} and nonmajor {{currencies}} {{to test the}} exchange rate dynamics. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the arbitrage and the spread in triangular foreign exchange trades. There is only one possible triangle when a bilateral exchange rate equals its trilateral rate. Otherwise, any <b>third</b> <b>currency</b> would potentially create arbitrage opportunities. Empirical testing evidence supports that small but possibly exploitable profitable arbitrage has significantly occurred over the very short haul of uncertainty and turbulence. In other words, we are convinced that the bilateral exchange rate could be diverged from one common currency side of the trilateral basket rates until markets function efficiently. This helps in better explaining foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, we find that the currency correlating decreases slightly but the volatility increases over time, as we expected. ...|$|R

50|$|Triangular {{arbitrage}} (also {{referred to}} as cross currency arbitrage or three-point arbitrage) is the act of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity resulting from a pricing discrepancy among three different currencies in the foreign exchange market. A triangular arbitrage strategy involves three trades, exchanging the initial currency for a second, the second <b>currency</b> for a <b>third,</b> and the <b>third</b> <b>currency</b> for the initial. During the second trade, the arbitrageur locks in a zero-risk profit from the discrepancy that exists when the market cross exchange rate is not aligned with the implicit cross exchange rate. A profitable trade is only possible if there exist market imperfections. Profitable triangular arbitrage is very rarely possible because when such opportunities arise, traders execute trades that {{take advantage of the}} imperfections and prices adjust up or down until the opportunity disappears.|$|R
40|$|Gaussian copulas {{are widely}} used in the {{industry}} to correlate two random variables {{when there is no}} prior knowledge about the co-dependence between them. The perturbed Gaussian copula approach allows introducing the skew information of both random variables into the co-dependence structure.

This paper applies this new perturbed copula to the valuation of derivative products; in particular FX quanto options to a <b>third</b> <b>currency.</b> A calibration procedure to fit the skew of both underlying securities is presented. The action of the perturbed copula is interpreted compared to the Gaussian copula.

30|$|In general, {{the fear}} of {{floating}} comes from three dimensions. First, currency depreciation could increase the real burden of external debt. Many enterprises and financial institutions in developing countries have substantial amount of liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, while most their assets are denominated in domestic currencies, namely currency mismatch. When domestic currencies depreciate, the balance sheets of corporate sector and financial sector will deteriorate, making it even hard to get financed on the international financial market. Second, currency depreciation could lead to capital flight, which exerts downward pressure on domestic investment and output, especially when the central bank raises interest rates to stop the currency depreciation, in which case, even more contraction. <b>Third,</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation could cause inflation, threatening domestic economic stability. To some extent, pegging its domestic currency to the US dollar or any other inflation-proof currency could be deemed as an institutional arrangement or commitment of a developing country to contain inflation. However, currency depreciation violates the commitment and could trigger a credibility crisis.|$|R

The analysis is motivated by the fact that the U. S. dollar has historically been the dominant vehicle currency in developing countries.

When the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to set their prices not to deviate from those of the competitors.

The role of expectations is important in selecting the equilibrium in the static framework. However, in the dynamic model with staggered price-setting, the role of history becomes another key determinant of the equilibrium currency pricing. The role of history may dominate the role of expectations when the firms are myopic, particularly in the competitive local market. It also becomes dominant in the staggered price setting when a small fraction of the new price setters are backward-looking. The result suggests the importance of history in explaining why the firm tends to choose the US dollar as vehicle currency. ...|$|R
