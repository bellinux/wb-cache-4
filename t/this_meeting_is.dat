5|$|There {{seems to}} prevail the opinion in some {{quarters}} that this meeting has been called {{for the purpose of}} inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike preparations on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, let me tell you at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of <b>this</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.|$|E
5|$|The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, {{focuses on}} Trapper Gates's daughter, {{who is the}} only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians come across the camp and plan to rob the miners. The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he will give a lecture on {{locating}} gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that <b>this</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E
25|$|In September 2002, after {{a special}} party {{convention}} ("Sonderparteitag") in Knittelfeld (Styria), the so-called Knittelfeld Putsch, Riess-Passer lost {{the support of}} many party members. <b>This</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes considered as a rebellion against the members which are currently involved in the government, which {{was thought to be}} started or at least supported by Haider. Thus Riess-Passer resigned as Vice Chancellor and Party Chairwoman. With her, Karl-Heinz Grasser, the finance minister, and Peter Westenthaler, the head of the Freedom Party's Parliament Club, also resigned.|$|E

25|$|On the 24 May 1978 the Politburo {{announced}} the {{enlargement of the}} Revolutionary Council. This new enlarged council {{met for the first}} time on the 12 June 1978 and <b>this</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> marked with two controversial changes. The first being to change the flag and replace it with a fully red one. The other being the declaration of the royal family to be traitors and removing their Afghan citizenships. Five days later the Revolutionary Council had a new meeting about the Parcham in the government, while not much information was or has been released about this meeting most of the Parcham politicians of the party were sent abroad as ambassadors.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} X-COM, {{set in the}} near-future {{at the time of}} the game's release, begins in the year 1998. The initial plot centers on {{increased}} reports of UFO sightings as tales of abductions and rumors of attacks by mysterious aliens become widespread. The nations of the world come to perceive this as a threat and attempt to form their own forces – such as Japan's Kiryu-Kai force – to deal with the crisis, but these efforts are unsuccessful. On December 11, 1998, representatives from some of the most powerful nations in the world secretly meet in Geneva to discuss the issue. From <b>this</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> born the clandestine defense and research organization Extraterrestrial Combat (X-COM), over which the player assumes control at the start of the game.|$|E

500|$|At {{some point}} between 1915 and 1917, Tzara is {{believed}} to have played chess in a coffeehouse that was also frequented by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. While Richter himself recorded the incidental proximity of Lenin's lodging to the Dadaist milieu, no record exists of an actual conversation between the two figures. Andrei Codrescu believes that Lenin and Tzara did play against each other, noting that an image of their encounter would be [...] "the proper icon of the beginning of [...] times." [...] <b>This</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> mentioned as a fact in Harlequin at the Chessboard, a poem by Tzara's acquaintance Kurt Schwitters. German playwright and novelist Peter Weiss, who has introduced Tzara as a character in his 1969 play about Leon Trotsky (Trotzki im Exil), recreated the scene in his 1975-1981 cycle The Aesthetics of Resistance. The imagined episode also inspired much of Tom Stoppard's 1974 play Travesties, which also depicts conversations between Tzara, Lenin, and the Irish modernist author James Joyce (who is also known to have resided in Zürich after 1915). His role was notably played by David Westhead in the 1993 British production, and by Tom Hewitt in the 2005 American version.|$|E
500|$|Fineshriber succeeded Samfield in 1915. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1878, {{his father}} had been a Reform rabbi, who {{died at the age of}} 37. When Fineshriber was 13, he moved to Cincinnati on his own, where he {{attended}} high school. After graduating, he attended the University of Cincinnati and entered HUC's eight-year program. By 1900 he had graduated from both and been ordained. He accepted his first pulpit that year at Temple Emanuel in Davenport, Iowa, and joined Children of Israel in 1911 as associate rabbi. He was the synagogue's first HUC graduate, and its first American-born rabbi. He had a quick wit, and was able to speak eloquently and extemporaneously on almost any topic. Often quoted in the newspapers, he was active in the Memphis community, and was a Rotarian, Shriner, and Freemason. He was also an early suffragist, and took up the cause at Children of Israel. At a 1913 women's day event, featuring speakers from Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, he was the only male speaker. At a 1914 rally he stated [...] "Taxation without representation is tyranny... purpose of <b>this</b> <b>meeting...</b> <b>is</b> to shock the people of Memphis into a realization that the question of equal suffrage is not child's play." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{returning}} to England, Phips joined back up with Increase Mather and again supported him in dealing with Whitehall. Increase Mather's diary says they are together on March 25, 1691, and again on March 26. On March 31, they are together as Increase Mather writes {{a response to the}} Board of Trade. Also at <b>this</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> Sir Henry Ashurst. These three—Mather the clergyman, flanked by two knights: Sir Phips & Sir Ashurst—would emerge later as the major proponents of the various compromises that brought about a new charter. Not counting Phips, there seem to have been a total of four agents acting on behalf of Massachusetts in seeking to restore the old charter. The two agents holding official commission papers from the Massachusetts council—Cooke and Oakes—were also the least compromising and the least politically deft. The Board of Trade seems to have sought a policy of pushing through a new charter by cleaving the two knights away from these two agents. July 24, Increase Mather records in his diary that he would [...] "part with my life sooner than [...] ". Not long after this Increase Mather left London on vacation. August 11, 1691, a letter was written from Whitehall to the King William's secretary: [...] "I must now desire your Lordship to acquaint the King {{that they are willing to}} accept their Charter... and no longer Insist upon the Alterations mentioned..." [...] This could not have been Cooke and Oakes, as they never wavered in their stance opposing a new charter. Mather's diary entry one week later (August 19) indicates that he is still either unaware or has not yet accepted this move. On August 20, the Earl of Nottingham told a committee that he had been with Sir William Phips who informed him that the New England agents [...] "did acquiesce therein [...]" [...] By August 27, Increase Mather had decided to participate in the process of shaping this new charter, if reluctantly.|$|E

2500|$|At {{a public}} meeting in Henley town hall on 26 March 1839, Captain Edmund Gardiner {{proposed}} [...] "that from the lively interest {{which had been}} manifested at the various boat races which have taken place on the Henley reach {{during the last few}} years, and the great influx of visitors on such occasions, <b>this</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> of the opinion that the establishing of an annual regatta, under judicious and respectable management, would not only be productive of the most beneficial results to the town of Henley, but from its peculiar attractions would also be a source of amusement and gratification to the neighbourhood, and the public in general." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2006 {{and early}} 2007, the Zapatistas (through Subcomandante Marcos), {{along with other}} {{indigenous}} peoples of the Americas, announced the Intercontinental Indigenous Encounter. They invited indigenous people from throughout the Americas {{and the rest of}} the world to gather on October 11–14, 2007, near Guaymas, Sonora. The declaration for the conference designated this date because of [...] "515 years since the invasion of ancient Indigenous territories and the onslaught of the war of conquest, spoils and capitalist exploitation". Comandante David said in an interview, [...] "The object of <b>this</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> to meet one another and to come to know one another’s pains and sufferings. It is to share our experiences, because each tribe is different." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} January 1882, on his own account, van Gogh met a homeless, pregnant, prostitute named Clasina (Sien) Maria Hoornik who {{had been}} deserted by {{the father of the}} child she was carrying. The exact date of <b>this</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> not known beyond van Gogh's dating of it in a letter to Theo written in May. However another letter written mid-January {{mentions}} he was negotiating modelling with [...] "a mother with a little child" [...] and it does seem plausible this was Sien. It has also been suggested that the woman he [...] "found" [...] following his humiliating rejection by his cousin Kee Vos, as described in a letter to Theo around 23 December the preceding year and immediately before his final estrangement from his father that Christmas Day, was in fact Sien, although there is no direct evidence for the surmise. Based on the dates, van Gogh could not have been the father of the child.|$|E

2500|$|Iturbide was {{convinced}} that independence for Mexico {{was the only way}} to protect the country from a republican tide. [...] He decided to become the leader of the Criollo independence movement. [...] However, in order to succeed, he would need to put together a very unlikely coalition of Mexican liberal insurgents, landed nobility, and the Church. [...] For this goal, he penned The Plan of Iguala, which held itself up on Three Guarantees: Freedom (from Spain), Religion (with Roman Catholicism being the only accepted religion in the new country) and Union (with all inhabitants of México to be regarded as equals). In this manner he was paving the road to gaining the support of the most powerful factions: the Insurgency, the clergy and the Spaniards. In the plan, a monarchy was ensured, thus assuring the support of the Royalists as well. Iturbide held a series of negotiations with Guerrero and made a number of demonstrations of his intentions to form an independent Mexico. [...] Iturbide offered Guerrero a full pardon if he surrendered. [...] Guerrero rejected the pardon but agreed to meet with Iturbide to discuss the independence of Mexico. <b>This</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> now referred to as the [...] "Embrace of Acatempán", named after the locale where they agreed to implement the plan. [...] Iturbide, Guerrero, and another insurgent leader, Guadalupe Victoria, announced the plan on 24 February 1821. [...] On 1 March 1821, Iturbide was proclaimed head of the Army of the Three Guarantees., with Guerrero fully supporting him, and recognizing him as his leader.|$|E
