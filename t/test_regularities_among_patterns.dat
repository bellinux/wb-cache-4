40|$|Abstract-Graph mining {{techniques}} for analyzing large collections of molecules to find <b>regularity</b> or <b>patterns</b> <b>among</b> molecules {{of a specific}} class, such as finding common properties in large numbers of drug candidates, finding molecular features that inhibit the desired reaction etc. is an important research issue in bioinformatics as well as molecular informatics. In this context, finding frequent graphs has received increasing attention over the past years. But, the computational complexity of the underlying problem and {{the large amount of}} data to be explored essentially render traditional sequential algorithms practically useless. To address such problems a distributed algorithm is adopted to find the frequent sub-graphs and to discover interesting patterns in molecular compounds. However, this problem is characterized by a highly irregular search tree, whereby reliable workload prediction is very hard. Therefore, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the dynamic load-balancing problem of highly irregular search tree...|$|R
40|$|Human {{listeners}} {{can keep}} track of statistical <b>regularities</b> <b>among</b> temporally adjacent elements in both speech and musical streams. However, for speech streams, when statistical <b>regularities</b> occur <b>among</b> nonadjacent elements, only certain types of patterns are acquired. Here, using musical tone sequences, the authors investigate nonadjacent learning. When the elements were all similar in pitch range and timbre, learners acquired moderate <b>regularities</b> <b>among</b> adjacent tones but did not acquire highly consistent <b>regularities</b> <b>among</b> nonadjacent tones. However, when elements differed in pitch range or timbre, learners acquired statistical <b>regularities</b> <b>among</b> the similar, but temporally nonadjacent, elements. Finally, with a moderate grouping cue, both adjacent and nonadjacent statistics were learned, indicating that statistical learning is governed not only by temporal adjacency but also by Gestalt principles of similarity. How do listeners organize and learn a patterned sequence of elements? Recent studies of a mechanism we have called statistical learning have shown that adults, young children, and infants are capable of computing transitional probabilities among adjacent syllables in rapidly presented streams of speech and of using these statistics to group syllables into word-like units (Aslin, Saffran, &...|$|R

40|$|Semi) -automatic facade {{reconstruction}} from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds {{is often}} affected by both quality of point cloud itself and imperfectness of object recognition algorithms. In this paper, we employ regularities, which exist on façades, to mitigate these problems. For example, doors, windows and balconies often have orthogonal and parallel boundaries. Many windows are constructed {{with the same}} shape. They may be arranged at the same lines and distance intervals, so do different windows. By identifying <b>regularities</b> <b>among</b> objects with relatively poor quality, these {{can be applied to}} calibrate the objects and improve their quality. The paper focuses on the <b>regularities</b> <b>among</b> the windows, which is the majority of objects on the wall. Regularities are classified into three categories: within an individual window, among similar windows and among different windows. Nine cases are specified as a reference for exploration. A hierarchical clustering method is employed to identify and apply regularities in a feature space, where regularities can be identified from clusters. To find the corresponding features in the nine cases of regularities, two phases are distinguished for similar and different windows. In the first phase, ICP (iterative closest points) is used to identify groups of similar windows. The registered points and a number of transformation matrices are used to identify and apply <b>regularities</b> <b>among</b> similar windows. In the second phase, features are extracted from the boundaries of the different windows. When applying regularities by relocating windows, the connections, called chains, established among the similar windows in the first phase are preserved. To test the performance of the algorithms, two datasets from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds are used. Both show good effects on the reconstructed model, while still matching with original point cloud, preventing over or under-regularization...|$|R
