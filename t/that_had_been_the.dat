5|$|As {{the city}} of Toronto {{expanded}} eastward and encroached on the estate, Elizabeth and Wellington Ashbridge subdivided and sold off much of the family's land for residential subdivisions. The Duke of Connaught Public School (1912) and S.H. Armstrong Community Recreation Centre were built on land <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Ashbridges' orchard. Woodfield Road, {{on the east side}} of the current property, was originally the farm lane going to the fields farther north.|$|E

She was the {{daughter}} of Richard Jennings (or Jenyns), a Member of Parliament, and Frances Thornhurst; her paternal grandfather was Sir John Jennings, father, by his wife Alice Spencer, of an extraordinarily large family. Her uncle (Martin Lister) was a prominent naturalist. Richard Jennings came into contact with James, Duke of York (the future James II, brother of King Charles II), in 1663, during negotiations for the recovery of an estate in Kent (Agney Court) <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> property of his mother-in-law, Susan Lister (nee Temple). James's first impressions were favourable, and in 1664 Sarah’s sister, Frances, was appointed maid of honour to the Duchess of York, Anne Hyde.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, the Hashemite emir {{and later}} king, Abdullah I, {{designated}} Amman instead of al-Salt {{to be the}} capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as {{the capital of the}} country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from {{the southern part of the}} country, particularly Al Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Longford Park was {{the home}} of John Rylands, industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire, from 1855 {{until his death in}} 1888 and of his widow Enriqueta Augustina Rylands until her death in 1908. The house Rylands {{constructed}} in the park in 1857, Longford Hall, was demolished in 1995. It replaced an earlier house of the same name <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> residence of Thomas Walker (died 1817) and subsequently of his sons Thomas (died 1836) and Charles. Today only the front porch, coach house, and the stable buildings remain. The estate and hall were sold to Stretford Council in 1911 after a poll of ratepayers, and the park was opened to the public the following year.|$|E
5|$|Six of {{the bills}} <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of the double {{dissolution}} were introduced in Parliament a third time and, as expected, were again rejected by the Senate. Section 57 of the Constitution provides that, after a double dissolution election, if bills that had been rejected twice by the Senate in the previous parliament were again passed by the House and again rejected by the Senate, they could then be put to a joint sitting of both houses. On 30 July, Whitlam gained Kerr's agreement for a joint sitting, which was set for 6–7 August 1974. The joint sitting, {{the only one in}} Australia's history under Section 57, passed all six bills, including the enabling legislation for Medibank.|$|E

5|$|During this period, the United States Army {{had been}} {{introducing}} the UH-1 Iroquois into service. First used in its intended {{role as a}} transport, it was soon modified {{in the field to}} carry more machine guns in {{what became known as the}} helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the AH-1 Cobra was introduced. This was an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire. The helicopter was effective, and prompted the U.S. military to change its defensive strategy in Europe by blunting any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the tactical nuclear weapons <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Stalwarts, led by Grant's old {{political}} ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw the ex-president's renewed popularity {{as a way}} {{for their}} faction to regain power, and sought to find ways to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> norm since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly, but he wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to capture the nomination.|$|E
5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> envy {{of the world in}} its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E
