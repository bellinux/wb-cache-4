25|$|As the {{production}} of radioactive atoms by the ISOL technique depends on the free atom chemistry of the element to be studied, there are certain beams which cannot be produced by simple proton bombardment of thick actinide targets. Refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium do not emerge from the target even at high temperatures due to their low vapour pressure. In order to produce these types of beams, a thin target is required. The Ion Guide Isotope Separator On Line (IGISOL) technique was developed in 1981 at the University of Jyväskylä cyclotron laboratory in Finland. In this technique, a thin uranium target is bombarded with protons and nuclear reaction products recoil out of the target in a charged state. The recoils are stopped in a gas cell and then exit through a small hole {{in the side of}} the cell where they are accelerated electrostatically and injected into a mass separator. This method of production and extraction takes place on a shorter timescale compared to the standard ISOL technique and isotopes with short half-lives (sub millisecond) can be studied using an IGISOL. An IGISOL has also been combined with a laser ion source at the Leuven Isotope Separator On Line (LISOL) in Belgium. Thin target sources generally provide significantly lower quantities of radioactive ions than <b>thick</b> <b>target</b> sources and this is their main drawback.|$|E

In a 100 x 100 x 180 cm steel-surrounded granodiorite target radioactive medium and high energy spallation products of the incident primary and of secondary particles were analyzed along the beam axis down to depths of 140 g/cm(2) in targets such as Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, T, Si, SiO 2 and Al.

40|$|Ultra-high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) fibre-reinforced composite {{is a promising material}} for ballistic protection {{due to its}} high strength, stiffness and low density. For thick sections of this material however, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms driving ballistic performance. Existing analysis tools do not allow for a good approximation of performance, while existing numerical models are either incapable of accurately capturing the response of thick UHMW-PE composite to ballistic impact or are unsuited to model <b>thick</b> <b>targets.</b> In this thesis, the response of thick UHMW-PE composite to ballistic impact was experimentally investigated. Panel thicknesses ranging from 9 mm to 100 mm impacted by 12. 7 mm and 20 mm calibre fragment simulating projectiles (FSPs) were investigated. The penetration and failure mechanisms were identified by inspection of impacted targets, and scanning electron microscopy was conducted to inspect the load-bearing fibres around the penetration cavity. <b>Thick</b> <b>targets</b> demonstrated a two-stage penetration process: shear plugging during the initial penetration followed by the formation of a transition plane and bulging of a separated rear panel. A new analytical model was developed for thick UHMW-PE composite impacted by blunt projectiles to describe the two stages of penetration identified in the experimental work. The analytical model is based on energy and momentum conservation laws, and uses an energy balance between the projectile kinetic energy and the energy absorbed by the target to predict the ballistic limit velocity. The model was validated against experimental ballistic limit results and showed excellent agreement for <b>thick</b> <b>targets.</b> Existing analytical models based on membrane theory were validated against results of thinner targets and demonstrated to be more suitable. A numerical modelling methodology was developed for the ballistic impact analysis of thick UHMW-PE composite using a commercial hydrocode. A novel approach was used to model interlaminar failure by dividing the panel into sub-laminates connected by breakable bonds. A new failure-based element erosion model was implemented with a user subroutine, which more accurately accounts for the directional properties of fibre-reinforced composites than existing strain-based models. The model is extensively validated against experimental ballistic data. The model gave excellent predictions for depth of penetration, residual velocity and ballistic limit, with results within 5 % of experiment for all conditions considered (12. 7 mm and 20 mm FSP, 9 mm to 100 mm <b>thick</b> <b>targets</b> and impact velocities between 400 m/s to 2000 m/s).
