5|$|The U.S. Air Force {{had already}} begun <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ante in its anti-infiltration campaigns by unleashing B-52 Stratofortress bombers against the trail in December 1965. From April through June 1966 there were 400 B-52 anti-infiltration sorties against the system. The PAVN countered this effort by concentrating more {{anti-aircraft}} artillery weapons within its logistical network. Between 1964 {{and the end of}} 1967 there were 103,148 tactical air sorties launched against the trail, including 1,718 B-52 strikes. During the same timeframe 132 U.S. aircraft or helicopters were shot down over Laos.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Symonds scored 101 {{and took}} two wickets for 46 {{to be the}} {{difference}} between the sides at Old Trafford. Having been sent in to bat, Lancashire owed much of their success to a partnership of 118 between Symonds and Marcus North, and good lower-order hitting took the total to 249 for 8, despite three wickets each from Sussex' Pakistanis, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed. The Sussex chase looked on when they were 112 for 1 with Matt Prior and Chris Adams at the crease, as they were just waiting for opportunities <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> run-rate, but instead Symonds and England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff ran through them with the ball, and Robin Martin-Jenkins and Ahmed eventually had to consolidate to 214 for 8, losing by 35 runs.|$|E
25|$|In a high-scoring {{match at}} Richmond, Middlesex Crusaders made 174 for 7 having opted to bat first. Owais Shah made yet another fifty – his fifth in eight innings – while Scott Styris and Paul Weekes made quick scores <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> run-rate. Shaun Udal, Sean Ervine and Craig McMillan all got two wickets. Hampshire Hawks started slowly, at about seven an over, but McMillan took a liking to Chris Peploe in {{particular}} as he smashed five sixes in his half-hour 65 not out, {{and thanks to}} McMillan's big hitting Hampshire won with sixteen balls and six wickets to spare. However, it was in vain – with only three wins, they finished fourth in the South Division tables, while Middlesex qualified despite having a poorer net run rate than Hampshire.|$|E

The appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial. One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed <b>to</b> <b>up),</b> <b>the</b> so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday.

25|$|Meanwhile, Jayasuriya {{was dropped}} twice, but survived {{and went on}} to make 67 before being run out {{attempting}} a difficult second run. By that time, however, he had steadied the ship with Jayawardene, and Arnold helped <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pace - the score being 122 for 4 after 26 overs, when Jayasuriya was out. It did not matter, as Arnold and Jayawardene treated the spinners with disdain, plundering 125 runs in 20 overs and accelerating the scoring to a point where India could not keep up. Nehra tried, and his variations gave him more wickets - he finished with the second six-wicket-haul of his career, the first coming against England in the 2003 World Cup, but a returning Vaas helped himself to 18 not out and upped the total to 281 for 9. An interesting feature of the scorecard was that no Indian bowler apart from Nehra got wickets - six for him, the other three were run outs.|$|E
25|$|Middlesex Crusaders amassed 333 for 4 in 45 overs - that's {{nearly seven}} and a half runs an over, well over the average five in 45-over games - and still lost to Gloucestershire Gladiators. It didn't look as the score would be as big at first,as Paul Weekes with 81, Ed Smith with 53, Owais Shah with 55 and Scott Styris with 42 kept the score ticking at roughly a run a ball. However, Kenyan-born Jamie Dalrymple slashed four sixes and seven fours in an unbeaten 24-ball 60 <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> run rate late on, and Gloucestershire's Jon Lewis, who earlier in the summer had played ODIs for England, conceded 86 runs in nine overs. Gloucestershire always kept up with the run rate, however, as Phil Weston, Craig Spearman and Matt Windows lifted Gloucestershire to 275 for 2, and despite Paul Weekes' late burst of four wickets, Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher shared a stand of 18 to see Gloucestershire to the target.|$|E

500|$|The {{switch to}} battlecruisers {{was the result}} of a {{proposal}} <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> main armament from /55 caliber guns to /47 caliber guns. Various reasons were behind this. Among other reasons, experiments showed that the smaller gun was [...] "far less effective" [...] than the larger gun, a class of twelve ships would have overtaxed the shipyards already heavily burdened with other ships, and the smallest guns on any foreign ship in service or under construction were more than [...] larger than the 283mm guns. The most persuasive argument for increasing the armament came in 1939, when Adolf Hitler denounced the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{evaluated}} positively after its release.

[...] Neil Smith of the BBC praised the action, but said the drama and comedy between the Joneses was more memorable. He noted, [...] "The emphasis on the Jones boys means Julian Glover's venal villain and Alison Doody's treacherous beauty are sidelined, while the climax [...] one booby-trapped tomb too many." [...] Based on 55 reviews listed by Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of critics praised the film, giving it an average score of 8/10. Metacritic calculated an average rating of 65/100, based on 14 reviews.|$|E

It's right there in the title, so you'd think they'd realize what they lost when they killed him off in Saw III. But it's been downhill ever since, and we hit bottom today". She admitted that the performances have become [...] "painfully stilted" [...] and called the script [...] "a jumble of nothing punctuated by barely-trying death traps". She went on to say, [...] "It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> body count" [...] and closed her review with, [...] "No matter how much money The Final Chapter makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over".|$|E

At the same time, all employees from the 30 Rock building need to disclose any inter-office relationships. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) discloses that he fantasizes about marrying a TGS dancer, named Daphne (Danielle Flora), but discovers that [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) is dating her.

This prompts Tracy to solve this problem by hiring new dancers.|$|E
500|$|The Weighted Companion Cube {{inspiration}} {{was from}} project lead Kim Swift with additional input from Wolpaw from reading some [...] "declassified government interrogation thing" [...] whereby [...] "isolation leads subjects {{to begin to}} attach to inanimate objects"; Swift commented, [...] "We had a long level called Box Marathon; we wanted players to bring this box with them {{from the beginning to}} the end. But people would forget about the box, so we added dialogue, applied the heart to the cube, and continued <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ante until people became attached to the box. Later on, we added the incineration idea. The artistic expression grew from the gameplay." [...] Wolpaw further noted that the need to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube came {{as a result of the}} final boss battle design; they recognized they had not introduced the idea of incineration necessary to complete the boss battle, and by training the player to do it with the Weighted Companion Cube, found the narrative [...] "way stronger" [...] with its [...] "death". Swift noted that any similarities to psychological situations in the Milgram experiment or [...] are happenstance.|$|E

2500|$|Clients’ {{religious}} beliefs {{are increasingly being}} considered in psychotherapy {{with the goal of}} improving service and effectiveness of treatment. A resulting development was theistic psychotherapy. Conceptually, it consists of theological principles, a theistic view of personality, and a theistic view of psychotherapy. Following an explicit minimizing strategy, therapists attempt to minimize conflict by acknowledging their religious views while being respectful of client’s religious views. This is argued <b>to</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> potential for therapists to directly utilize religious practices and principles in therapy, such as prayer, forgiveness, and grace. [...] In contrast to such an approach, psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown argues for the extent to which our spiritual commitments remain unconscious.
