The Newport Docks Disaster occurred on 2 July 1909 when, during {{construction of the}} new south lock connecting the South Dock to the Severn Estuary, supporting <b>timbers</b> <b>in</b> an excavation <b>trench</b> collapsed and buried 46 workers. The rescuers included 12-year-old paper boy Thomas ‘Toya’ Lewis who was small enough to crawl into the collapsed trench. Lewis worked for two hours with hammer and chisel in an attempt to free one of those trapped who was released the next day. Several hundred pounds was later raised through public subscription in gratitude for the boy's efforts, and he was sent on an engineering scholarship to Scotland. Lewis was awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving by King Edward VII in December 1909. A Wetherspoons pub in the city centre is named [...] "The Tom Toya Lewis" [...] after the young hero. The building in which the pub is housed was formerly the Newport YMCA, the Foundation Stone for which was laid by Viscount Tredegar, also in 1909.|$|R

40|$|An archaeological {{evaluation}} {{was undertaken}} by Cotswold Archaeology in December 2013 at Rydon Farm, Ogwell, Devon. A total of sixteen trenches were excavated. The evaluation identified {{a number of}} archaeological features which generally correlated well with a preceding geophysical survey. Archaeologically significant features encountered comprised ditches and pits dated to the prehistoric and post-medieval periods. Evidence for prehistoric activity was identified <b>in</b> <b>Trenches</b> 13 and 14. Pottery of Middle or Later Bronze Age date (c. 1600 - 1000 BC) and a crude endscraper consistent with Bronze Age dating was recovered from the ditch fills of an 'egg' shaped enclosure. A potentially contemporary roundhouse gully and pit were revealed within the enclosure. Post-medieval and modern activity was represented by a field boundary ditch <b>in</b> <b>Trench</b> 13, a pit <b>in</b> <b>Trench</b> 7, land drainage features and services <b>in</b> <b>Trenches</b> 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.

40|$|An archaeological {{evaluation}} {{was undertaken}} by Cotswold Archaeology in January 2012 on Land at Tithebarn Green (Redhayes), near Exeter, Devon. Seventeen trenches were excavated. The evaluation identified {{a number of}} archaeological features throughout the proposed development area which generally correlated well with the results of a preceding geophysical survey. Archaeological features encountered comprised ditches, pits and postholes, generally dated to one of two broad periods; prehistoric and post-medieval/modern. Evidence of Neolithic activity was identified <b>in</b> <b>Trench</b> 7 where four pits, seemingly forming a north-west/south-east alignment, were found to contain pottery of probable Middle Neolithic date. A 14 C date recovered from one of the pits compliments such an interpretation. Substantial ditches identified <b>in</b> <b>Trenches</b> 5, 8, 10, 11, 15 and 17 confirm the presence a large enclosure identified by both cropmark evidence and the earlier geophysical survey. Further ditches located <b>in</b> <b>Trenches</b> 3, 7, 10 and 15 attest to the presence of a probable internal division within this enclosure. Although no closely dateable material was recovered from these features, a possible later prehistoric/Iron Age date is postulated for their construction. A 14 C date recovered from the ditch suggests that it remained partially open and visible as an earthwork into the Saxon period. Further undated, but possibly prehistoric, features comprising pits/postholes were identified <b>in</b> <b>Trenches</b> 2, 3, 5, 6, 11 and 14. Probable post-medieval/modern field boundaries were identified <b>in</b> <b>Trenches</b> 3, 7, 10 and 15. The exact function of the undated ditches identified <b>in</b> <b>Trenches</b> 2, 4, 6, 11, 14 and 17 remains unclear, although they are likely to relate to land management and/or division...|$|R
