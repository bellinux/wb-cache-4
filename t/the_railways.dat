5|$|Due to the war, the SAFA {{suspended}} its {{competition from}} 1916 through to 1918. Despite this official suspension, {{a group of}} South Australian clubs decided to form their own league in 1916 and the money generated would be put toward the war effort. <b>The</b> <b>Railways</b> Football Club {{was one of the}} clubs that participated in this competition and managed to attract Harold Oliver to be the clubs captain. Unfortunately for <b>the</b> <b>Railways,</b> Oliver would only play one game for <b>the</b> <b>Railways,</b> and would instead return to Berri to focus on his farm. Later in the season, Oliver returned to Port Adelaide to play a few games for the club who was also partaking in the Patriotic League. Port Adelaide would end up winning the 1916 South Australian Patriotic League Grand Final defeating West Torrens 7.11 (53) to 1.13 (19). Harold Oliver played for Port Adelaide during the game and kicked a goal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, stimulated by <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> running through their areas, with landowners in both areas profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to <b>the</b> <b>railways,</b> the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, Labour {{pledged to}} reverse the {{privatisation}} of <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> by {{getting rid of the}} franchising system, after previously saying that they would allow the public sector to bid for franchises.|$|E
50|$|Along <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> line Friedberg-Friedrichsdorf exists <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> station Burgholzhausen. <b>The</b> <b>railway</b> {{line was}} opened in 1901 {{and is now}} {{integrated}} into the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>railway</b> {{station is}} {{accessible}} from Urapakkam east through <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> station road {{and through the}} west side using <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> foot over bridge.|$|R

5|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> established engineering in the city. At {{the turn of}} the 20thcentury, the railway accommodated the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway, which employed more than 5,500 people. The railway was instrumental in the expansion of Rowntree's Cocoa Works. It was founded in 1862 by Henry Isaac Rowntree, who was joined in 1869 by his brother the philanthropist Joseph. Another chocolate manufacturer, Terry's of York was a major employer. By 1900 <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> and confectionery had become the city's two major industries.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} a museum run by volunteers, with several {{permanent}} exhibitions about local history, the Fens, Victoriana and <b>the</b> <b>Railways.</b> Chatteris {{also has a}} Scout club, an Army Cadet force and a youth football team.|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> in Weymouth was that until 1987 main-line trains ran though {{the streets and}} along the Weymouth Harbour Tramway to the Quay station at {{the eastern end of}} the harbour, to connect with ferries to {{mainland}} Europe. Due to declining business, goods traffic ceased in 1972, but passenger services continued until they ceased in 1987 from lack of use.|$|E
5|$|From 1845, {{the line}} was {{operated}} by the SER. In 1899, the SER and LCDR entered into a joint working partnership, the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). On 1 January 1923, <b>the</b> <b>Railways</b> Act 1921 came into force, resulting in the Grouping. The SECR {{became part of the}} Southern Railway (SR). On 1 January 1948, the Transport Act 1947 came into force, and the SR became part of British Railways, with the former SR lines becoming the Southern Region. British Railways was rebranded British Rail on 1 January 1965. On 10 June 1986, Network SouthEast branded trains began operating. On 1 January 1994, <b>the</b> <b>Railways</b> Act 1993 came into force, privatising British Rail. Passenger services were taken over by Connex South Eastern on 13 October 1996. On 27 June 2003, Connex lost the franchise due to poor financial management. The Strategic Rail Authority took over the running of passenger trains from 9 November 2003, using their South Eastern Trains train operating company. On 1 April 2006, Southeastern took over the operation of passenger trains on the route.|$|E
50|$|In 1939 <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> {{station of}} Moça Bonita was built, where before stood {{only a little}} stop of the train at <b>the</b> <b>railway.</b> <b>The</b> workers of <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> station began to {{populate}} Vila Vintém.|$|R

5|$|In 2006 the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{announced}} {{they would be}} working to preserve <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> and ferries, and in 2008 {{it became clear that}} the directorate was working with an application for the Rjukan Line, the Tinnoset Line and the ferries to be included in a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the closed plants in Rjukan and Odda.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015 the Lynton & Barnstaple {{signed a}} {{twinning}} {{agreement with the}} Walhalla Goldfields Railway in Victoria, Australia. This agreement came about due to the similar nature of <b>the</b> <b>railways</b> and to foster cooperation and volunteer exchanges. Like the L, the Moe-Walhalla railway was closed over 70 years ago {{and the work of}} restoration requires rebuilding the track bed and railway infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|After World War II, <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> began a {{long period}} of decline. Traffic on <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> dropped in half from 1953 to 1957, as road {{transport}} began to compete for cargo. [...] The Ogaden War of 1977-1978 dealt a further blow to <b>the</b> <b>railway,</b> as Somali troops invaded Ethiopia and captured <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> as far as Dire Dawa. [...] Portions of <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> were blown up in <b>the</b> war, and <b>railway</b> operations were again cut in half. [...] After the war ended, <b>the</b> <b>railway</b> continued to decline from a lack of maintenance and attacks from rebels such as the Ogaden Liberation Front.|$|R
