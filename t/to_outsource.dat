40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which different types of HRM strategy influence HR outsourcing. Six types of HRM strategy, namely: expansion, cost efficiency, quality conscious, commitment, conventional and employee development were employed to test their influence on HR outsourcing. The data was gathered from a survey questionnaire of 232 manufacturing organisations of which 113 organisations engaged with HR outsourcing. The findings suggest that organisations rely on outsourcing of training, recruitment, payroll and HRIS functions when they espouse expansion HRM strategy. Quality conscious HRM strategies are significantly related <b>to</b> the <b>outsourcing</b> of payroll and HRIS functions. In addition, cost efficiency is significantly related <b>to</b> <b>outsourcing</b> recruitment but in opposite direction. Commitment HRM strategy is significantly related <b>to</b> the <b>outsourcing</b> of training and payroll functions while conventional HRM strategy is associated only <b>to</b> <b>outsourcing</b> training functions. However, employee development HRM strategy is not related <b>to</b> any <b>outsourcing</b> activitie...|$|R

5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision <b>to</b> <b>outsource</b> the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E
