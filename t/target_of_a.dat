5|$|In September 1992 {{the museum}} was the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions. Two {{incendiary}} devices were found in a basement gallery, but were extinguished by staff {{before the arrival of}} the fire brigade, and caused only minor damage.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the castle}} could be completed, however, the French attacked. Admiral Claude d'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July, where the local {{authorities}} feared Sandown Castle might be the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> night attack. 2,000 French soldiers men landed on the Isle of Wight and attacked Sandown, where labourers were still present. Their advance soon stalled, however, and the French retreated back to their fleet, bringing the invasion threat to an end; the castle was finally completed after their departure.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the {{situation}} was further complicated when MGM/UA was sold to Qintex, which wanted to then merge with Pathé Communications; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower-than-market value, without consulting Danjaq – who sued MGM/UA Communications, which was itself the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> failed takeover bid by Pathé. In August 1990 Albert Broccoli appointed his daughter Barbara Broccoli alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon, while he concentrated on matters at Danjaq. The dispute between Danjaq and MGM/UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17, but was finally settled in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In New Orleans, a {{homeless}} veteran named Douglas Binder (Chuck Pfarrer) is the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hunt. He {{is given a}} belt containing $10,000 and told that he must reach {{the other side of}} town where he would then win the money and his life. Pursuing him is the hunt organizer Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen), his lieutenant Pik Van Cleef (Arnold Vosloo), a businessman named Mr. Lopaki who has paid $500,000 for the opportunity to hunt a human, and mercenaries including Stephan (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and Peterson (Jules Sylvester). Binder fails to reach his destination and is shot by three crossbow bolts. Van Cleef retrieves the money belt.|$|E
5|$|In September 1998 Manchester United {{were the}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{proposed}} takeover by British Sky Broadcasting, {{a subsidiary of}} Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Negotiations between both sides had begun during the summer, but had stalled after disagreements over the asking price. The satellite group’s original bid of £575million – initially thought to be their final offer – was deemed too low by two members of United’s board (chairman Martin Edwards and Professor Sir Roland Smith), who pressed for a higher figure. Two days of talks followed and {{in an attempt to}} close the deal, BSkyB made a final bid of £623.4million.|$|E
5|$|Late 18th-century critics {{felt that}} Smart's madness {{justified}} them in ignoring his A Song to David, {{but during the}} following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition {{to be the source}} of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E

5|$|One final {{consequence}} of the raid was that the Telecommunications Research Establishment, {{where much of the}} Bruneval equipment was analysed, and British radar systems were designed and tested, was moved further inland from Swanage on the southern coast of England to Malvern to ensure that it was not the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reprisal raid by German airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|The Indo-German {{alliance}} and the conspiracy were the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> worldwide British intelligence effort, which {{was successful in}} preventing further attempts.

The conspiracy resulted in the Lahore conspiracy case trials in India as well as the Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial—at the time the longest and most expensive trial ever held in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Van der Sloot's cell {{became the}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> media circus, with reporters vying to gain {{exclusive}} access and report about his prison surroundings. Since his incarceration, {{he has only}} consented to interviews to De Telegraaf, in which he admitted to extorting the Holloway family {{and said that he}} received a number of marriage proposals in his cell, including one from a woman who wanted to have his child. Van der Sloot reportedly receives fan mail from around the world, though mostly from women residing in the United States and the Netherlands. According to sources within the prison, Van der Sloot sought $1 million in exchange for an on-camera interview.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} progresses, Wes becomes a <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{powerful}} organization known as Cipher. After leaving Phenac, he visits Pyrite Town, where Rui was kidnapped. In Pyrite, Shadow Pokémon are openly offered to {{winners of the}} town's Colosseum tournament. The local police force is powerless to stop the practice, so Duking, an influential man in Pyrite, asks Wes to enter the tournament and investigate. Wes enters the Colosseum challenge and defeats four trainers to win. Inside a nearby building, a Cipher Peon is about to present the Shadow Pokémon prize, but another one recognizes Wes. The pair then battle {{their way through the}} building and a maze-like cave set in the rock behind. Eventually, they face and defeat Miror B., one of four Cipher Admins. Afterwards, Wes returns a Pokémon Miror B. stole from Duking. A team of kids working in Duking's house introduce themselves as members of an anti-Cipher news network, known as the Kids Grid, who pledge their help to Wes and Rui.|$|E

5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|Besides the schism, the Western Church was riven by {{theological}} controversies, some {{of which}} turned into heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity {{should have access to}} the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to Church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite Church, although the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.|$|E
5|$|Having {{discovered}} a lost briefcase in a park, Tintin returns {{it to its}} owner, the sigillographer Professor Hector Alembick, who informs the reporter of his plans {{to travel to the}} Balkan nation of Syldavia. Tintin discovers secret agents spying on him and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant. An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin, but is found unconscious. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bomb attack; but survives the latter when police detectives Thomson and Thompson intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country. On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the sceptre of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current King Muskar XII before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to abdicate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Target</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Assassin is a 1977 film {{directed}} by Peter Collinson.

5|$|In 1843 Hogg {{became the}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{blackmail}} attempt by John Edward Johnson, Jane's husband. Johnson provided journalist Barnard Gregory {{with the details}} of Jane's marital status. Gregory soon published a report on her in The Satirist, but made a crucial mistake. Gregory claimed that the wife of James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly, was legally married to another man, prompting James Hogg to initiate a libel suit against Gregory. Johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of the error. Gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence. Following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication, which could have threatened Hogg's legal position. Hogg appealed to Leigh Hunt, who convinced Gregory not to publish. John Edward Johnson died in 1840, ensuring that Jane would never be blackmailed because of her marital status. Although Hogg and Jane were now free to marry they chose not to, to avoid revealing their situation.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Charles Churchill & Co, {{the parent}} company, moved its offices from London to Birmingham and in 1955 {{increased}} its share capital to £1.26M. By the financial year ending March 1962 it reported a group net profit of £575,352 and a dividend of 22.5%. Exports were up 26% {{and there were}} hopes of the sector eventually amounting to 40% of total output. Fixed assets had increased significantly: the business had taken over Newcast Foundries Ltd, Halifax-based heavy lathe manufacturer Denhams Engineering Co Ltd and Churchill-Milnes; it had spent £2M of its own resources building extensions and plant improvements to more than double its manufacturing capability compared to that in 1951. Information regarding Churchill-Milnes is lacking but a business called Henry Milnes manufactured lathes in the Bradford area {{for many years and}} it may be that this was the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> take-over.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} protect the Big Bend region, the United States {{deployed}} a number of cavalry and signalmen in various posts along the Texas border. One of these posts was at the village of Ojo de Agua which had been raided on September 3, 1915 and was the planned <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Seditionista raid in October 1916. The American base at Ojo de Agua under the command of Sergeant Ernest Schaeffer consisted of a radio station manned by approximately ten men from Troop G, 3rd Cavalry, and eight men of the United States Army Signal Corps. The post at Ojo de Agua was lightly defended and seemed to be little match for the 25 to 100 raiders that planned to raid the village.|$|E
