5000|$|An {{obturator}} hernia {{is a rare}} type of hernia of the {{pelvic floor}} in which pelvic or abdominal contents protrudes through the obturator foramen. Because of differences in anatomy, {{it is much more}} common in women, especially multiparous and older women who have recently lost a lot of weight. The diagnosis is often made intraoperatively after presenting with bowel obstruction. A gynecologist may come across this type of hernias as a secondary finding during gynecological open surgery or laparoscopy [...] The Howship-Romberg sign is suggestive of an obturator hernia, exacerbated by <b>thigh</b> <b>extension,</b> medial rotation and abduction. It is characterized by lancilating pain in the medial thigh/obturator distribution, extending to the knee; caused by hernia compression of the obturator nerve.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{employed}} an Artificial Neuronal Network to analyze the forces flexing the monofin in reaction to water resistance. In addition we selected and characterized key kinematic parameters of leg and monofin movements that define {{how to use a}} monofin efficiently and economically to achieve maximum swimming speed. By collecting the data recorded by strain gauges placed throughout the monofin, we were able to demonstrate the distribution of forces flexing the monofin in a single movement cycle. Kinematic and dynamic data were synchronized and used as entry variable to build up a Multi-Layer Perception Network. The horizontal velocity of the swimmer's center of body mass was used as an output variable. The network response graphs indicated the criteria for achieving maximum swimming speed. Our results pointed out the need to intensify the angular velocity of <b>thigh</b> <b>extension</b> and dorsal flexion of the feet, to strengthen velocity of attack of the tail and to accelerate the attack of the distal part of the fin.

40|$|PurposeVaricose veins are a {{frequent}} burden, {{also in the}} small saphenous system. Yet its basic anatomy is not described consistently. We therefore investigated the fascial and neural relationships of the small saphenous vein (SSV) {{as well as the}} frequency and position of valves and the different junctional patterns, also considering the <b>thigh</b> <b>extension.</b> Materials and MethodsWe dissected the legs of 51 cadavers during the regular dissection course held in winter 2007 at Innsbruck Medical University, with a total of 86 SSVs investigable proximally and 94 SSVs distally. ResultsA distinct saphenous fascia is present in 93 of 94 cases. It starts with a mean distance of 5. 1 cm (SD 1. 2 cm) proximal to the calcaneal tuber, where the tributaries to the SSV join to form a common trunk. The neural topography {{at the level of the}} gastrocnemius muscle's origins shows the medial sural cutaneous nerve in 88 % medially and in 12 % laterally to the SSV, the tibial nerve in 64 % medially and in 36 % laterally, and the common fibular nerve in 98 % medially and in 2 % laterally to the vein. The saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) resembled in about 37 % type A (UIP-classification), 15 % type B, and 24 % type C. A total of 17 % of specimens showed a venous web or star at the popliteal fossa and 6 % had a doubled junction. A <b>thigh</b> <b>extension</b> could be demonstrated in about 84 %. A most proximal valve was present in only 94 % at a mean distance of 1. 2 cm (SD 1. 4 cm) to the SSVs orifice. A consecutive distal valve was only present in 65 % with a mean distance of 5. 1 cm (SD 2. 3 cm). ConclusionTwo fascial points or regions can be described in the SSVs' course and its own saphenous fascia is demonstrated macroscopically in almost all cases. The neural topography is highly individual. The SPJ is highly individual where we found hitherto unclassified patterns in a remarkable number of veins. Venous valves are not as frequent as we supposed them to be. Furthermore, not all most proximal valves seem to be terminal valves. Clinical RelevanceOur study's aim is to support the basic understandings of the small saphenous system by providing exact anatomic data. This will help to understand physiology as well as pathophysiologic possibilities at the small saphenous system. On the other hand, our study especially can provide assistance for the vascular surgical approach at the popliteal fossa and also distally to the beginning of the trunk of the short saphenous vein itself...|$|R

Subsequent anatomic studies detail his findings but receive inadequate attention in clinical and surgical textbooks. The {{purpose of this study}} was to present a summary of the original observations by Giacomini, present our ultrasound scan findings, and review later anatomic, venographic, and ultrasound scan studies. Methods: The study was a literature review and experience with duplex ultrasound scanning from units in Italy and Australia. Results: Giacomini {{described a}} <b>thigh</b> <b>extension</b> from the lesser saphenous vein that passed to join with the greater saphenous vein, which since then bears his name, and described also the other destinations of the thigh extention to deep veins through perforators or an end as multiple tributaries in the superficial tissues or muscles. Duplex ultrasound scanning shows that the vein can be affected by varicose disease with reflux either upwards or downwards in the thigh to the greater or lesser saphenous veins respectively.

Eighteen young fast bowlers (17. 2 ± 1. 7 years) were recruited from the Cricket New South Wales development squad, and their bowling actions were captured by a Cortex 2. 0 motion analysis system (200 Hz). Bivariate Pearson's product-movement correlation coefficients were calculated in SPSS (Version 17. 0) to assess the relationships between wrist speed (of the bowling hand) and the kinematics and kinetics variables corresponding with rear leg motion. A number of kinematic variables were correlated with bowling wrist speed, most of them during the delivery stride, including mean <b>thigh</b> <b>extension</b> angular velocity (r = 0. 606, p = 0. 008), thigh adduction angular velocity at back foot contact (r = 0. 515, p = 0. 029) and maximum change in knee extension angular velocity (r = 0. 559, p = 0. 016).

40|$|We investigate, through {{methods in}} the Calculus of Variations, {{mathematical}} energetic models for incompressible nematic elastomers. These models {{are based on}} the coupling between the neo-classical energy density, developed by Bladon, Warner and Terentjev as an <b>extension</b> of the <b>rubber</b> elasticity theory, with the classical energy density from the Landau-de Gennes theory for uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. A unit-length molecular director of the nematic elastomer and an incompressible deformation are the unknown functions, minimizers of the coupled energy. In contrast to previous mathematical work in this field, the molecular director is not assumed to be constant throughout the domain. After establishing a suitable generalized energetic model for working in Sobolev spaces, we prove lower semi-continuity of the energy. Considering generalized shear deformations motivated by physical experiments on thin film domains, we show the existence of minimizers, and keeping the restriction of incompressibility on the deformation and unit length of the director, we derive weak Euler Lagrange equations satisfied by the minimizers. Additionally, we consider the reduction of the model to a 2 -dimensional one and deduce existence results for non-convex energy densities involving terms related to the constraint of volume’s preservation. In this case we also find weak Euler-Lagrange equations and prove a partial regularity result. ...|$|R
5000|$|Acting {{on behalf}} of the parents of the two {{deceased}} youths, Defence for Children International Palestine requested Forensic Architecture, a research agency based at the University of London, to recreate the events on 15 May. Using the CNN footage the agency undertook analyses of the videos of the killing, the space where the killings took place and the sounds they contained. The results were that [...] "it was an Israeli Border Policeman that fired upon Nawara, identifies the shooter, and demonstrates that he was firing live ammunition. The shooter’s actions undertaken to cover up for his actions are exposed. It suggests that the killing was intentional and premeditated". The analyses involved determining the synchronisation of a border policemen firing and Nawara being hit, as provided by two video sequences, resulting in the shooter being positively identified. This was confirmed by the construction of a three-dimensional model of the area and a determination of available lines of sight, additionally confirmed by the video evidence of automatic ejection of the cartridge, which only happens with live ammunition and not with rubber bullets Still further confirmation came from the unique sound signature of live ammunition being fired through an M-16 <b>extension</b> meant for <b>rubber</b> bullets, which connected the killing of Nawara and that of Abu Daher.|$|R
40|$|Summary: This study {{compared}} {{the differences in}} clinical outcome between an endoscopic (67 of 70) and two-incision (41 of 49) technique used to reconstruct a torn anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) utilizing a double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis (DLSTG) graft. In both techniques the graft was placed without roof impingement, the looped end of the graft was fi xed around a post with bone compaction, and the free ends were fi xed with either double staples or a soft tissue washer(s). No graft required suture fi xation. The post-operative treatment featured an aggressive rehabilitation protocol without a brace, and allowed unrestricted sports participation four months post reconstruction. Age, sex distribution, duration from injury to surgery, and preoperative laxity were not signifi cantly differ-ent between treatment groups. The operative time for the endoscopic technique averaged 48 minutes less than the two-incision technique. There were no signifi cant differences in <b>thigh</b> circumference, knee <b>extension,</b> stability, and the single leg hop test between the two treatment groups at 4 and 24 months. Ninety-one percent of the knees in the endoscopic group and 90 % in the two-incision group had less than a 3 mm increase in anterior translation compared to the normal knee using the manual maximum test (KT- 1000) and had either a normal or near normal knee (IKDC score) at two years. A second surgery for removal of painful, prominent hardware was required in 21 % of the subjects i...|$|R
40|$|The first {{uniaxial}} <b>extension</b> of reinforced <b>rubber</b> materials causes stress softening (the Mullins effect) {{not only}} in this loading direction but in any other direction of subsequent extension. However, the Mullins effect is less pronounced after a change of loading direction than {{in the direction of}} the initial loading. Due to the deformation history mechanical behaviour of the the rubber vulcanisate is distinctly anisotropic. To trace the anisotropic Mullins effect, firstly the standard test method for characterization of the isotropic mechanical behaviour must be extended. The appropriate type of specimen enables to perform multiple load steps with alternating load directions. After repeated stretching in the same direction, a subsequent first uniaxial loading in any other direction is characterized by a stiffer stress–strain behavior compared with the stabilized curve of the previous primary load. Due to the high relevance of the primary permanent set for this experimental method and their strong influence on the secondary load step, the direction dependent consideration is studied. On behalf of a more comprehensive evaluation of the anisotropic Mullins effect the role of active filer like carbon black and silica was investigated. In particular, not only the influence of basic properties of carbon blacks, such as specific surface area or structure, but also the influence of the amount incorporated was determined experimentally. The comparison of carbon black and silica filled vulcanisates provided more insights in the anisotropic material behaviour of reinforced elastomers. For the anisotropic (primary) Mullins effect a similar behaviour can be detected regarding the well-known one-dimensional Mullins effect. In summary, the vulcanisates soften high levelly in the primary load (one-dimensional Mullins effect) and in this way, they show a high level deformation induced anisotropy of the Mullins effect. For the visualization of the direction-dependent stress softening the comparison of the Mullins effect and the applied primary strain energy density is proposed to identify the resulting anisotropic material properties of the elastomer...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the following {{study was to determine}} if a post-chill whole carcass Cecure ® (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) treatment (0. 3 % @ 0. 5 gallon/carcass) would extend the shelf-life of various further processed broiler products which were produced from Cecure ® -treated whole carcasses. Cecure ® is an FDA and USDA/FSIS approved, patented formulation containing the active ingredient cetylpyridinium chloride. Cecure ® is approved by FDA and USDA/FSIS for application to pre-immersion chilled, post-immersion chilled and air-chilled whole carcasses and to skin-on carcass parts. For this study, a commercially available, fully automated, post-chill Cecure ® rinse cabinet was installed and operated in a USDA-inspected broiler processing facility several months prior to initiation of the study. On the day the shelf-life study was to be conducted, a single flock of birds was utilized. Control samples were collected during a 2 -hour period prior to turning on the Cecure ® post-chill whole carcass system. Six different types of broiler products were collected for evaluation including boneless skinless breast meat, thighs, wings, split breasts, leg quarters and whole carcasses. After all control samples were collected (n= 70 per product type) the Cecure ® system was turned on and allowed to run for 2 hours after which similar product samples were collected for products produced from Cecure ® -treated whole carcasses. All broiler parts were tray-packed and whole carcasses were bagged individually. On Day 0, all samples were held at 28 o F for approximately 6 hours after which they were held at 32 o F for 3 days. For the remainder of the study, all samples were held at 34 o F. On Days 0, 5 and 10 and Days 14 through 22, each of the six product types was microbiologically evaluated using Aerobic Plate Count Petrifilm™ 3 until the products were considered spoiled (7 logs colony forming units per mL). Regardless of product type, the Cecure ® whole carcass post-chill treatment (0. 3 %) resulted in initial reductions in Aerobic Plate Count on Day 0 from 0. 5 to > 1 log. These initial Day 0 microbial reductions led to increases in product shelf-life as follows: boneless skinless breast meat and whole carcasses (1. 5 -day <b>extension),</b> <b>thighs,</b> split breasts and wings (2 -day extension) and leg quarters (1 -day extension). It {{should be noted that the}} slope and the shape of the bacterial growth curves for all Cecure ® -treated products were almost identical to those for the control products with the exception of a lower initial (Day 0) level of bacteria; hence, increasing the days to spoilage without a delayed technical effect. The results from this study demonstrate that the use of a post-chill Cecure ® whole carcass rinse treatment (0. 3 %) will significantly improve the shelf-life of whole carcasses and corresponding cut-up broiler parts including boneless skinless breast meat, thighs, wings, split breasts and leg quarters...|$|R
