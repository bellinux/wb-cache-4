25|$|Legislation and {{re-engineering}} of interconnected crossings {{across the}} state of Illinois combined with greater awareness elsewhere resulted in efforts to help to prevent similar crashes from recurring. Informational decals were also added to Illinois school buses advising drivers {{of the length of}} each bus, since the substitute school bus driver was apparently unaware of the exact length of the bus she was driving. Other states have also embraced that and related aspects and incorporated them into their school bus driver <b>training</b> <b>curriculum.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Colombia, fully {{licensed}} {{physicians are}} eligible to compete for a spot in a residency program. To be fully licensed, one must first finish a medical training program that usually lasts 5 to 6 years (varies between universities), followed by 1 year of medical and surgical internship. During this internship a national medical qualification exam is required, and, in many cases, an additional year of unsupervised medical practice as a social service physician. Applications are made individually program by program, and are followed by a postgraduate medical qualification exam. The scores during medical studies, university of medical <b>training,</b> <b>curriculum</b> vitae, and, in individual cases, recommendations are also evaluated. The acceptance rate into residencies is very low (~1-5% of applicants in public university programs), physician-resident positions {{do not have a}} salary, and the tuition fees reach or surpass 10,000 USD per year in private universities, and 2,000 USD in public universities. For the reasons mentioned above, many physicians travel abroad (mainly to Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the United States) to seek postgraduate medical training. The duration of the programs varies between 3 and 6 years. In public universities, and some private universities, it is also required to write and defend a medical thesis before receiving a specialist degree.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, however, it became obvious, {{that a more}} {{professional}} approach is needed. The sending of physicians to the scene was introduced, following the concept [...] "bringing the doctor to the patient, not the patient to the doctor". The development of the system [...] "emergency physician" [...] (Notarzt) started, bearing the need for somewhat qualified assistance on scene. A law to establish the occupation of Rettungssanitäter has been discussed, with a 3-year <b>training</b> <b>curriculum.</b> The government however saw difficulties in financing the training of this new profession. So, eventually in 1977 the original idea was introduced as a 3.5 month (520 hours) <b>training</b> <b>curriculum</b> common to all Länder (federal states) of Germany. This led to a more professionalized approach, but clearly {{below the level of}} the intended original law. By the 1980s it became clear that many situations were occurring in which the knowledge level of the Rettungssanitäter was inadequate, especially in cases where a Notarzt wasn't available in time. The developing of pre-clinical procedures demanded additional qualification for treating patients in the field. It was deemed necessary to find a new profession with even more knowledge and skills.|$|E
