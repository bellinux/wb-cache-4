Ian Nathan of Empire gives the film only two of a {{possible}} five stars, observing that the film [...] "still ranks {{as one of the most}} forgettable Bonds on record." [...] In 2006, IGN chose For Your Eyes Only as the sixth best Bond film, claiming it is [...] "a good old-fashioned espionage tale", a placement shared by Norman Wilner of MSN, who considered it [...] "the one Moore film that seems to reach back to Connery's heyday", and Entertainment Weekly chose it as the tenth best in 2008, saying it was a [...] "return to low-tech, low-key Bond ... some of the best stunts since the early days". In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of For Your Eyes Only and observed that the film is [...] "admirable in intent" [...] but that it [...] "feels a little spare", largely because the plot has been [...] "divested of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> that hallmark the franchise".|$|E

Eurogamer's Oli Welsh said that the game avoids the normal pitfalls that developers introduce in sequels, stating that [...] "Portal is perfect. Portal 2 is not. It's something better than that.". Gus Mastrapa of The A.V.

[...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Clark Collis wrote that the album's title [...] "justifies its name thanks to a chunkier array of riffs and choruses" [...] compared to Where You Want to Be. Sarah Dean wrote on FasterLouder that Louder Now differs from the band's past records; it has [...] "a darker mood, bigger choruses and perhaps even catchier melodies," [...] with the [...] "emo-pop punk flavour Taking Back Sunday are renowned for." [...] Gigwise contributor Lee Glynn wrote that the album had [...] "no standout tracks" [...] other than [...] "MakeDamnSure." [...] Apart from the latter, [...] "there is nothing on this album that reaffirms them as a band full of malice and bite."

Newcomers may wonder what all <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> are about, though.

Billboards Jason Lipshutz called the production [...] "impressive" [...] and said the song [...] "rows stickier upon each listen".

Reid, Topping proposed to Turner at the 21 Club in Los Angeles by dropping a diamond ring into her martini. The ceremony occurred {{three days after}} Topping was divorced from his third wife, actress Arline Judge, who had been previously married to his brother Dan. Although worth millions when they married, Topping suffered heavy financial losses due to poor investments and excessive gambling. The couple's marriage resulted in a church trial for the officiant because the marriage took place {{less than a year}} after Topping's divorce from Judge. Cheryl Crane writes in her memoir that her mother's wedding to Bob Topping was a beautiful, lavish affair held in the spacious Topping family mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, with all of <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> accompanying a traditional wedding. Despite the fact that both the bride and the groom had been married and divorced multiple times previously, Lana wore a traditional white gown, the bridesmaids wore equally beautiful gowns of Lana's choosing, and young Cheryl served as the flower girl. Crane goes on to state that she later saw this as her mother's attempt to finally have a beautiful, traditional wedding while she was still young after three failed marriages (to Artie Shaw and Steve Crane) in which the ceremonies took place before justices of the peace with Lana usually attired in a simple dress suit and heels.|$|E

[...] The product was a success and helped Music Man when its main price point was in a slump. Sterling Ball has commented that, due to the quickly growing $1,000+ segment of the guitar industry, there have been fewer and fewer SUBs in production each year.

[...] Stephanie Classen of The Star Phoenix remarked, [...] "Beyoncé doesn't really need <b>the</b> <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> of a big stadium show, but it sure makes for an unforgettable concert." [...] Additional praise was received from Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press who graded her [...] "lavishly produced" [...] performance 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "In Sasha-mode...

She concluded her review by saying, [...] "Watching Beyoncé sing and strut her stuff can feel at best overawing, at worst, alienating. She takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes, [...] "there is a breathtaking elegance in her acute desire to entertain" [...] further saying that [...] "the whole point of the dazzling show was to make you ask how she does it.

The writer further chose the performances of [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights during the show describing Knowles' vocals as [...] "incredible". Similarly, Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times chose the same songs as highlights during the show, further saying that [...] "Halo" [...] was the most memorable moment of the night. She also praised Knowles' [...] "enviable" [...] dancing skills, compared her with Dionne Warwick but noted that, [...] "Her brilliant performance, which was only let down by weaker, less melodic songs such as Get Me Bodied or Upgrade U, was matched by spectacular production and audio visuals." [...] Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger also wrote that [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] were as [...] "riveting as anything that had come before", further choosing the performances of [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] as other highlights. Lustig described the show as a [...] "bona fide pop spectacle" [...] noting that many of the songs which were performed had futuristic themes.

The robot de-termines the range and bearing to the person by the person’s distinctly coloured vest and a SONAR beaconing package. Unlike similar projects, this system uses fixed latency ra-dio synchronisation between the robot and the person wearing the SONAR beacon. This system also distinguishes itself from similar projects in its application of a set of wide field-of-view SONAR transducers which allow less constrained operation than those employing acoustic reflectors. These two factors allow the robot to accurately pursue the person out-doors at speeds of up to 5 km/h, with a minimum turning radius of 3 m.

Previously stored in a secure building with other equipment and locomotives, the engine was in a very poor cosmetic state, its front end in particular was badly damaged by a diesel engine's buckeye coupling when being moved into the building in 2008. A cosmetic restoration was originally planned for 2010, but for unknown reasons, did not go ahead.|$|R
2500|$|Some American cities, in the {{interest}} of noise abatement, have passed laws prohibiting <b>the</b> sounding of <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles.</b> In December 2003 the US Federal Railroad Administration published regulations that would create areas where train horns could be silenced, provided that certain safety measures were put in place, such as concrete barriers preventing drivers from circumventing the gates or automatic whistles (also called Wayside horns) mounted at the crossing (which reduce noise pollution to nearby neighborhoods). Implementation of the new [...] "Quiet Zone" [...] Final Rule was delayed repeatedly but was finally implemented in the summer of 2005. Rail [...] "Quiet Zone" [...] crossings still require bells as part of the AWDs in addition to the wayside horns. Wayside horns are sets of speakers that are mounted on a pole and directed at the crossing. They produce sounds similar to a train horn.|$|R
