500|$|On the Yardbirds, Unterberger {{identifies}} lead guitarist Jeff Beck {{as having}} [...] "laid the blueprint for psychedelic guitar", {{and the band}} for defining psychedelic rock's [...] "manic eclecticism ... With their ominous minor key melodies, hyperactive instrumental breaks (called rave-ups), and use of Gregorian chants." [...] All were present on Having a Rave-Up the Yardbirds U.S.-only album on which Beck [...] "emerged as a full-fledged guitar hero", {{in the view of}} Guitar Player magazine. [...] "Heart Full of Soul" [...] (June 1965) was a hit single driven by a distorted fuzz guitar riff by Beck made to simulate <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> a sitar, which [...] "carried the energy of a new scene" [...] and herald the arrival of new Eastern sounds.|$|E
500|$|Willis has {{attracted}} detractors {{due to his}} somewhat melancholic style. The Independent commentated on the 1995 Texaco Trophy that Willis had [...] "trenchant content, dismal delivery. As a player Willis had trouble getting to sleep. As a commentator he struggles to stay awake. His voice remains on one note – <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> your neighbour's mower." [...] Andrew Smith wrote in 1999 that [...] "On Sky TV, Willis is often discourteous and unfair to players. Didn't he ever make a mistake?" [...] though the Daily Mail, for whom Willis had begun writing, defended his commentary style. CricInfo's launching of two polls on cricket commentary both returned negative views of Willis' [...] "hyper-critical" [...] commentary. Willis received only 15% of the vote, above only Dermot Reeve and Allott.|$|E
500|$|The second aria, [...] "" [...] (I eat {{my little}} bit of bread with joy and heartily leave to my {{neighbor}} his own.), is dancing and accompanied by two obbligato parts, oboe and violin. They express in vivid figuration in the violin and a slightly simplified version in the oboe the text [...] "" [...] (a happy spirit, a thankful heart, that gives praise). Hofmann observes that the aria depicts a [...] "pastoral idyll with a rustic musical scene – {{a tribute to the}} Enlightenment utopia of simple, happy country life." [...] The violin's figuration suggests <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> bagpipes or hurdy-gurdy. The voice leaps in upward sixths, in [...] "folk-like character" [...] and conveying [...] "contented tranquillity". Mincham notes that the first four notes of the oboe ritornello are the first four notes of the closing chorale turned to major.|$|E

500|$|... 65 Squadron {{remained}} in the battle until its end in October 1940, but Finucane gained no further successes. On 8 November the unit was moved to RAF Leuchars and then on 29 November back to No. 11 Group RAF in the south at RAF Tangmere near Chichester in West Sussex. The squadron remained idle for the winter as The Blitz and the German night attacks began and lasted in to the following spring. Finucane billeted near Oving. While drinking at a nearby pub overlooking the harbour an air raid struck Southampton. Finucane heard <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> German bombers over the Isle of Wight {{in the distance and}} watched as the pathfinders marked the city. They clambered into a Wolseley Hornet two-seater car and headed into the town to seek out acquaintances of a squadron-mate. After seeing the destruction in the city Finucane remarked: [...] "Until this war is won we must shoot every Jerry from the sky." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pipes are famously {{mentioned}} by the character Falstaff in William Shakespeare's play Henry IV, Part 1 (c. 1597) {{in which he}} likens his melancholy to their sound: [...] "Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear...Yea, or <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> a Lincolnshire bagpipe." [...] Robert Armin, an actor in Shakespeare's company, also mentions the bagpipe in his prose work A Nest of Ninnies (1608): [...] "At Christmas time, amongst all the pleasure provided, a noyse of minstrells and a Lincolnshire bagpipe was prepared - the minstrells for the great chamber, the bagpipe for the hall - the minstrells to serve up the knights meate, and the bagpipe for the common dauncing." ...|$|E

60|$|Amid <b>the</b> <b>droning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind {{there had}} come the {{stamping}} of a horse's hoofs, {{and the long}} grind of a wheel as it rasped against the curb. The cab which I had seen had pulled up at our door.|$|R

60|$|The train {{stopped in}} {{a blaze of}} {{sunshine}} at Framlynghame Admiral, which is made up entirely of the name-board, two platforms, and an overhead bridge, without even the usual siding. I had never known the slowest of locals stop here before; but on Sunday all things are possible to the London and Southwestern. One could hear <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> conversation along the carriages, and, scarcely less loud, <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> the bumblebees in the wallflowers up the bank. My companion thrust his head through the window and sniffed luxuriously.|$|E
60|$|On {{the still}} morning air arose {{a sound like}} <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> some {{gigantic}} hive, or of the sea when the tide is making. Affonso Henriques recognized it for the murmur of the multitude.|$|E

60|$|He took Lancelot by the hand.

60|$|At {{once all}} the lights went out, for the fire-flies fled in every direction; but in the {{darkness}} Twinkle thought she could still hear <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> the big bass fiddle and the flute-like trill of the ladybugs.|$|E
60|$|Lawrence {{referred}} to a sound like <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> a giant mosquito, which proceeded from the negro's nose, for that worthy was a heavy sleeper-- when not in danger--and had not been disturbed {{by the arrival of}} the guide.|$|E
60|$|Twenty-five {{years ago}} the school {{children}} used to chant their lessons. The manner of their delivery was a singsong recitative between the utterance of an Episcopal minister and <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> a tired sawmill. I mean no disrespect. We must have lumber and sawdust.|$|E

60|$|It was dull work {{sitting there}} {{listening}} to <b>the</b> <b>droning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insects; but no {{member of the}} party could have kept watch more conscientiously than did he, and when it seemed impossible to hold his eyes open any longer he paced to and fro {{to prevent them from}} closing.|$|R
60|$|He lays {{aside the}} lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of {{costs for the}} eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing {{consents}} and common searches and a writ of Duces Tecum.

60|$|In {{the tiniest}} of whispers with my lips right against his smelly head, I {{submitted}} {{the problem to}} Hans, asking him what we should do, go on or go back.

6000|$|He {{had sunk}} once more upon the ground, panting like a fish; and I saw rising {{in his face}} the same dusky flush that had mantled on my father’s. ‘I feel ill,’ he gasped, ‘horribly ill; the swamp turns around me; <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> these carrion flies confounds me.

50|$|The {{pitch of}} the drum varies, and the tone may vary {{depending}} on conditions of dampness, temperature and so on.

5000|$|The opening {{theme is}} based on [...] "Lady Doyle's Salute", a lament from the 17th century. The strings play alone for a while, the bagpipe enters, also first playing first, then both interact, with the strings at times imitating <b>the</b> <b>drones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bagpipe. Later {{passages}} are reminiscent of the old Scottish dances jig and reel.|$|R

60|$|Still mopping himself, {{he entered}} the inn, and, guided by <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> voices, sauntered into the bar.

60|$|A heavy sky {{seemed to}} cover {{the world with the}} grey {{whiteness}} of a whitewashed ceiling. There was no freshness or fragrance in the air.

Ko is the gene responsible {{for the expression of}} body color type in A. koschevnikovi. This gene is shown to be sex-linked, since experiments have shown that a cross between a brown, dark banded queen and a brown, dark banded drone results in orange, dark banded workers.|$|R

5000|$|As {{pollination}} {{is vital}} for the plants in the Brazilian rain forests, some plant species have developed pheromone mimicry to attract <b>the</b> <b>drones</b> <b>of</b> S. postica. Virgin S. postica queens have a mixture of 2-alkanols in the pheromones that attract <b>the</b> <b>drones</b> for mating. Many Orchidacae species common in Brazilian rain forests, such as Mormolyca ringens, have a similar mixture of alkanes/alkenes that will attract those same <b>drones</b> to <b>the</b> flower. Following the attempted [...] "copulation" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drone</b> with <b>the</b> flower, the chemical composition of the flower’s mimicked pheromone changes {{so that it does}} not attract any more males.|$|R
