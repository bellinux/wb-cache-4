25|$|Day {{five of the}} {{proceedings}} saw conflict as the prosecution again attempted to introduce evidence {{that had not been}} shared with both the court and the defense during pre-trial. The defense objected vehemently with defense lawyer Peter Althin equating the tactic to something out of the old Perry Mason TV show. “Suddenly, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> <b>and</b> in walks an entirely new witness.” The presiding judge stopped the case to deliberate the matter and found in favor of the defense, instructing the prosecution to immediately hand over all material they planned to use.|$|E

Staff and guests (including Lisa) of Kellerman's are singing the closing song together when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> <b>and</b> Johnny walks in. He's returned to do the last dance of the season. Johnny leads Baby onstage, interrupting the show which is already in progress. He makes a brief speech about how [...] "Frances" [...] {{has made him a}} better man. Baby and Johnny dance a more provocative version of their mambo duet, and the other [...] "dirty dancers" [...] join in. Baby runs to Johnny and executes the elusive lift move they'd practiced. The dirty dancers pull guests from their seats to join in the celebration. Jake apologizes to Johnny for thinking he got Penny pregnant, and reconciles with Baby.

2500|$|Stierlitz {{wakes up}} in a prison cell. [...] "Which {{identity}} should I use?" [...] he wonders. [...] "Let's see. If a person in black uniform walks in, I must be in Germany so I'll say I'm Standartenführer Stierlitz. If they wear green uniform, I'm in USSR so I'll admit I'm Colonel Isayev". <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> <b>and</b> {{a person in a}} grey uniform comes in saying, [...] "You really should ease up on vodka, Comrade Tikhonov!" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{safety door}} {{prevents}} finger injuries near the hinges {{without the use}} of door guards. [...] Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. [...] This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular ("bull-nose" [...] shaped) extension to the door, which moves {{in and out of a}} cavity as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> <b>and</b> closes. [...] This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges – either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a doorstop).|$|E
60|$|Then <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> head contractor's {{engineer}} came in.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> Annie entered. She {{looked at}} him questioningly.|$|R
2500|$|Frank puts Leigh {{back in his}} solitary cell. Mary Eunice 'predicts' that Frank has {{had trouble}} with Leigh and slices Frank's throat with the {{straight}} razor. She feigns worrying about a rampage as Leigh maniacally laughs. In the office, Jude prays for guidance and strength. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> <b>and</b> she sees Leigh enter. When asked, {{he says he is}} there to open his [...] "present." [...] Mary Eunice locks the door from the outside and Arden affirms his loyalty to her. Arden leaves to take Grace's body in a cart down the death chute, so the Raspers can dispose of her. Along the way, he is stunned by a bright light and a deafening sound. He regains his senses to find an empty cart and missing Grace. In the office, Leigh reminds Jude of her cruelty to him by caning her across the desk. He intends on raping her but she stabs him in the neck with a letter opener.|$|E
2500|$|Roma {{is furious}} at Williamson, who has blown a big sale. Levene picks up where Roma left off, and begins {{insulting}} Williamson. Mid-rant, Levene accidentally reveals his knowledge that Williamson {{made up the}} claim about the check being cashed, information {{he could not have}} known unless he had been in Williamson's office. Williamson accuses Levene of robbing the office. Levene quickly folds and admits that he and Dave Moss were the thieves. Levene tries to bribe Williamson, offering half of his future sales. Williamson reveals that the Nyborg sale is worthless, as the couple is elderly, mentally ill and just like talking to salesmen because they're so lonely. Levene asks why Williamson wants him turned in, and why he would give him the lead in the first place. Williamson simply states he doesn't like Levene, for the years of verbal abuse, and the old man's flippant nature. [...] Roma comes back from his interrogation and Williamson goes in the back room to speak with the detective. Alone with a devastated Levene, Roma proposes the two men work together. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> <b>and</b> the detective demands to speak with Levene, shoving him into the back room.|$|E

6000|$|At last <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens,</b> <b>and</b> the Prince enters, {{none too}} pleased at finding Cinderella still awake.

60|$|Behind us, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> steps clanked {{upon the}} granite floor.|$|R

60|$|The woman, {{a little}} bewildered by his vehemence, promises, and disappears down the stairs. He takes {{his hat and}} cloak from the chair on which he had thrown them, and turns once more to cross the hall. As he does so, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> <b>and</b> Anne enters.|$|E
6000|$|The cat starts--not at his mistress's {{complimentary}} apostrophe, {{but at a}} {{knock at}} the door, which follows close upon it.
