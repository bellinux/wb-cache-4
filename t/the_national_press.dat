5|$|By the 20th century Fleet Street and {{the area}} {{surrounding}} it were dominated by <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>press</b> and related industries. The Daily Express relocated to No.121–8 Fleet Street in 1931, into a building designed by Sir Owen Williams. It was the first curtain wall building in London. It has survived {{the departure of the}} newspaper in 1989 and was restored in 2001. The Daily Telegraph was based at No.135–142. These premises are both Grade II Listed. In the 1930s, No.67 housed 25 separate publications; by this time the majority of British households bought a daily paper produced from Fleet Street.|$|E

5|$|All three {{channels}} televise {{events such}} as congressional hearings, White House press briefings and presidential speeches, {{as well as other}} government meetings including Federal Communications Commission hearings and Pentagon press conferences. Other U.S. political coverage includes State of the Union speeches, and presidential press conferences. According to the results of a survey after the 1992 presidential election, 85% of C-SPAN viewers voted in that election. The results of a similar survey in 2013 found that 89% of C-SPAN viewers voted in the 2012 presidential election. In addition to this political coverage, the network broadcasts press conferences and meetings of various news media and nonprofit organizations, including those at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Press</b> Club, public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents' Dinner. While C-SPAN does not have video access to the Supreme Court, the network has used the Court's audio recordings accompanied by still photographs of the justices and lawyers to cover the Court in session on significant cases, and has covered individual Supreme Court justices' speaking engagements.|$|E
5|$|In September 1949, Mirta {{gave birth}} to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat. Castro {{continued}} to put himself at risk, staying active in the city's politics and joining the September 30 Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the Partido Ortodoxo. The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries. Castro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on November 13, exposing the government's secret deals with the gangs and identifying key members. Attracting the attention of <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>press,</b> the speech angered the gangs, and Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S. Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.|$|E
5|$|The large, mostly {{spontaneous}} gatherings at Truman's whistle-stop {{events were}} an important {{sign of a}} change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually unnoticed by <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>press</b> corps. It continued reporting Republican Thomas Dewey's apparent impending victory as a certainty. One reason for the press's inaccurate projection was that polls were conducted primarily by telephone, but many people, including much of Truman's populist base, did not yet own a telephone. This skewed the data to indicate a stronger support base for Dewey than existed. An unintended and undetected projection error {{may have contributed to the}} perception of Truman's bleak chances. The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date—Roper in September, and Crossley and Gallup in October—thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey.|$|E

5|$|As Moratti {{prepared}} to make wholesale changes at the club, Bergkamp left Inter and signed with Arsenal in June 1995 for a transfer fee estimated at £7.5million. He became manager Bruce Rioch's first signing at Arsenal and broke the club's transfer fee record set at £2.5million. Bergkamp's arrival at the club was significant not only {{because he was a}}n established international footballer who looked to have his best years ahead of him, but also because he was a major contributor to Arsenal's return to success after much decline in the mid-1990s. On the opening day of the 1995–96 league season, Bergkamp made his full debut against Middlesbrough. He struggled to adapt to the English game and failed to score in the club's next six league matches, prompting ridicule by <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>press.</b> On 23 September 1995, Bergkamp scored his first and second goals for Arsenal against Southampton at Highbury. Bergkamp ended his first season with 33 appearances and 11 goals, helping Arsenal finish fifth and earn a place in the UEFA Cup by scoring the winner against Bolton Wanderers {{on the final day of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1890s, Morris was {{increasingly}} ill and living largely as an invalid; {{aside from his}} gout, he also exhibited signs of epilepsy. In August 1891, he took his daughter Jenny {{on a tour of}} Northern France to visit the Medieval churches and cathedrals. Back in England, he spent an increasing amount of time at Kelmscott Manor. Seeking treatment from the prominent doctor William Broadbent, he was prescribed a holiday in the coastal town of Folkestone. In December 1894 he was devastated upon learning of his mother's death; she had been 90 years old. In July 1896, he went on a cruise to Norway with construction engineer John Carruthers, during which he visited Vadsö and Trondheim; during the trip his physical condition deteriorated and he began experiencing hallucinations. Returning to Kelmscott House, he became a complete invalid, being visited by friends and family, before dying of tuberculosis on the morning of 4 October 1896. Obituaries appearing throughout <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>press</b> reflected that at the time, Morris was widely recognised primarily as a poet. Mainstream press obituaries trivialised or dismissed his involvement in socialism, although the socialist press focused largely on this aspect of his career. His funeral was held on 6 October, during which his corpse was carried from Hammersmith to Paddington rail station, where it was transported to Oxford, and from there to Kelmscott, where it was buried in the churchyard of St. George's Church.|$|E
5|$|The Sinatra period saw extravagant {{parties and}} visits by celebrities such as Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, Kim Novak, Shirley MacLaine, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz and Richard Crenna. However, his mood swings would {{sometimes}} determine how {{he responded to}} patrons. Journalist Herb Caen reported {{that he could be}} dismissive and insulting to those who annoyed him. Giancana was banned from the state of Nevada, but Sinatra continued to allow him to stay at the lodge which resulted in Sanicola seeking to remove himself as a shareholder. Although Sinatra sought to explain that Giancana was only visiting his girlfriend, Phyllis McGuire, the disagreement resulted in the end of Sinatra and Sanicola's friendship. After Giancana was spotted on the premises, Sinatra had his gambling license removed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Following this, Sinatra decided he {{wanted to get out of}} entertainment property ownership as he was being heavily criticized in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>press</b> and pursued by law enforcement over illegal activities at the casino. The Cal Neva Lodge was leased to Jack L. Warner in a deal which also saw a majority stake in Reprise Records sold to Warner Bros. Records and Sinatra gaining a one-third ownership in the new company.|$|E
