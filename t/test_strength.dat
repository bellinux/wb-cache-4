However, Wisden stated that only Hobbs would have been sure of his batting place in a full strength England team, and that both Rhodes and David Denton, the next best batsmen, were a long way behind Hobbs. In all first-class matches, Rhodes scored 499 runs {{at an average of}} 26.26, with three fifties, and took 21 wickets at 25.47. In the Test series, which South Africa won 3–2, Rhodes took only two wickets in the five games. As a batsman, however, he [...] shared some large partnerships with Hobbs. England lost the first two Tests, although in the first Rhodes and Hobbs put on 159 for the first wicket, of which Rhodes made 66. In the second Test the pair put on 94 in the first innings and 48 in the second, Rhodes made little impact on the third and fourth Tests; in the final Test, an England victory, he and Hobbs scored 221 together, Rhodes making what was then his highest Test score of 77. [...] Wisden stated that while overshadowed by the brilliance of Hobbs, Rhodes in this innings batted without mistakes. [...] In the five Tests Rhodes scored 226 runs, [...] averaging 25.11. During the tour Rhodes and Hobbs developed mutual trust while batting together, {{to the point where they}} could score runs without having to call to each other. This degree of understanding was unusual at the time. After the Test series ended, several amateur members of the team wanted to extend the tour into Rhodesia, but the professionals refused to take part as their contracts did not cover this and they would have effectively played for no wages. Rhodes, although not the ring-leader, was influential in this strike, and a sports newspaper, Winning Post, singled him out as responsible in an article highly critical of him and the other professionals.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} cold-formed stainless steel hollow sections subjected to web crippling {{is presented in}} this paper. Tests were conducted on square and rectangular hollow sections of austenitic stainless steel type 304. Tensile and compression coupon tests were performed to obtain the longitudinal tension and transverse compression material properties. The web crippling tests were conducted under two loading conditions for End-Two-Flange (ETF) and Interior-Two-Flange (ITF) specified in the current American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed stainless steel structures. The <b>test</b> <b>strengths</b> obtained from this study and the <b>test</b> <b>strengths</b> of stainless steel lipped channel sections under End-One-Flange (EOF) and Interior-One-Flange (IOF) loading conditions conducted by other researchers are compared with the design strengths obtained using the current American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European Code for cold-formed stainless steel structures. In addition, the <b>test</b> <b>strengths</b> are also compared with the design strengths obtained using the unified web crippling equation as specified in the North American Specification for cold-formed carbon steel structural members.

Twenty-four healthy men aged 70 – 80 yr were recruited for the study.

Twenty seconds post 1 RM, SBP and HR were higher than resting values. Twenty seconds post sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> SBP and DBP were lower (P < 0. 02) and HR (P < 0. 001) was higher than resting values. SBP, DBP and HR were higher (P < 0. 001) during sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> compared to 1 RM testing. Twenty seconds post testing, SBP and DBP were lower (P < 0. 001) and HR was higher (P < 0. 001) for the sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> compared to the 1 RM.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a laboratory investigation on optimum level of Fly ash and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) as a partial replacement of cement {{to study the}} strength characteristics of concrete. Portland cement was partially replaced by 5 %, 6 %, 7 %, 8 %, 9 %, 10 % of GGBS and Fly ash by 20 %, 40 %, 60 % respectively. The water to cementations materials ratio was maintained at 0. 45 for all mixes. The strength characteristics of the concrete were evaluated by conducting Compressive <b>strength</b> <b>test,</b> Splitting Tensile <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> and Flexural <b>strength</b> <b>test.</b> The compression <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> were conducted for 7 days and 28 days of curing and split tensile <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> and flexural <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> were conducted for 28 days of curing on a M 25 grade concrete.

The test results proved that the compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength of concrete mixtures containing GGBS and Fly ash increases as the amount of GGBS and Fly ash increase. After an optimum point, at around 9 % of GGBS and 40 % of Fly ash of the total binder content, the further addition of GGBS and fly ash does not improve the compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength...|$|R

50|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} Danish invasion, Norway's forces were marshaled {{along the border}} to force the Swedes {{to deal with the}} {{prospect}} of fighting a two-front war. A force of 4,000 Norwegians was concentrated at Fredrikshald under the command of General Russenstein, both protecting against any Swedish attempts to invade and threatening to retake the formerly Norwegian province of Bohuslän. The Swedish General Ascheberg took position at Svarteborg with 2,000 men.

40|$|The virus plaque assay {{has been}} {{successfully}} employed to enumerate antigen-sensitive cells in the peripheral blood lymphocyte populations of tuberculin-hypersensitive human donors. The method {{is based on the}} finding that, while resting lymphocytes are unable to produce a variety of viruses upon infection, lymphocytes activated by specific antigens become capable of virus replication. The average number of antigen-sensitive cells detected in cell populations from donors reacting to first <b>test</b> <b>strength</b> or intermediate <b>test</b> <b>strength</b> tuberculin was approximately 3. 6 / 1000 lymphocytes, and the averages for both groups were similar. Studies on the kinetics of appearance of these virus plaque-forming cells and on the effects of the mitotic inhibitor, vinblastine, indicate that the activation of these antigen-sensitive cells is a linear process and that the cells must be nondividing cells during this process. These qualities contrast markedly with those described for the mitogenic response and the antibody-producing cells which require cell division and increase exponentially. On the basis of these experiments it is suggested that the antigen-sensitive cell measured in the virus plaque assay is the effector cell in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and, in addition, {{may be one of the}} cells critically involved in antibody formation...|$|E
