5|$|<b>Toucans</b> are near-passerine birds {{from the}} Neotropics. They are brightly marked and have {{enormous}} colorful bills {{which in some}} species amount to half their body length.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{detection}} by {{the males}} becomes particularly important {{during the period}} when the infants are born. Raptors spend significantly more time near the squirrel monkey troops during this period, and prey on {{a significant number of}} the newborn infants. Other animals that prey on Central American squirrel monkey infants include <b>toucans,</b> tayras, opossums, coatis, snakes, and even spider monkeys.|$|E
5|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes, the others being barbets, <b>toucans,</b> and honeyguides in the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two probably being so.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-throated <b>toucan</b> was at {{one time}} {{considered}} to be {{closely related to the}} Choco <b>toucan</b> but it is only distantly related per genetics. The ranges of the nominate subspecies and the chestnut-mandibled <b>toucan</b> do not overlap in the wild and are found to differ by 1.35% in mitochondrial DNA, leading some authourities to continue to classify the chestnut-mandibled <b>toucan</b> as a separate species. Alternate names for the yellow-throated <b>toucan</b> include the black-mandibled <b>toucan</b> and yellow-breasted <b>toucan.</b>|$|R
50|$|The keel-billed <b>toucan</b> (Ramphastos sulfuratus), {{also known}} as sulfur-breasted <b>toucan</b> or rainbow-billed <b>toucan,</b> is a {{colorful}} Latin American member of the <b>toucan</b> family. It is the national bird of Belize.|$|R
50|$|The toco <b>toucan</b> (Ramphastos toco), {{also known}} as the common <b>toucan,</b> giant <b>toucan</b> or simply <b>toucan,</b> is the largest and {{probably}} the best known species in the <b>toucan</b> family. It is found in semi-open habitats throughout a large part of central and eastern South America. It is a common attraction in zoos.|$|R
25|$|Birds include <b>toucans,</b> pionus parrots, Brazilian tanager (Ramphocelus bresilius), {{solitary tinamou}} (Tinamus solitarius), black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus), penelopes and {{black-fronted piping guan}} (Pipile jacutinga).|$|E

25|$|There is also {{a section}} that sells live animals, from baby chicks, puppies, kittens, <b>toucans,</b> parrots, hamsters, full grown roosters and hens, ducks, rabbits and various species of snakes.

50|$|The citron-throated <b>toucan</b> was {{formerly}} {{classified as a}} subspecies of the channel-billed <b>toucan</b> and some authorities still recognize it as such.

25|$|Brazil ranks {{third on}} the list of countries, behind Colombia and Peru, with the most number of {{distinct}} bird species, having 1622 identified species, including over 70 species of parrots alone. It has 191 endemic birds. The variety of types of birds is vast as well, and include birds ranging from brightly colored parrots, <b>toucans,</b> and trogons to flamingos, ducks, vultures, hawks, eagles, owls, swans, and hummingbirds. There are also species of penguins that have been found in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the trogons within the class Aves has been a long-standing mystery. A variety of relations have been suggested, including the parrots, cuckoos, <b>toucans,</b> jacamars and puffbirds, rollers, owls and nightjars. More recent morphological and molecular evidence has suggested {{a relationship with the}} Coliiformes. The unique arrangement of the toes on the foot (see morphology and flight) has led many to consider the trogons to have no close relatives, and to place them in their own order, possibly with the similarly atypical mousebirds as their closest relatives.|$|E
25|$|In the Caribbean 600 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} of which 163 are endemic such as the tody, Fernandina's flicker and palmchat. The American yellow warbler is found in many areas as is the green heron. Of the endemic species 48 are threatened with extinction including the Puerto Rican amazon, yellow-breasted crake and the Zapata wren. According to Birdlife International in 2006 in Cuba 29 species of bird {{are in danger of}} extinction and two species officially extinct. The black-fronted piping guan is endangered as is the plain pigeon. The Antilles along with Central America lie in the flight path of migrating birds from North America so the size of populations is subject to seasonal fluctuations. In the forests are found parrots, bananaquit and <b>toucans.</b> Over the open sea can be seen frigatebirds and tropicbirds.|$|E

25|$|Yaxchilan {{flourished in}} the 8th and 9th centuries. The site {{contains}} extensive ruins, with palaces and temples bordering a large plaza upon a terrace above the Usumacinta River. The architectural remains extend across the higher terraces and the hills {{to the south of}} the river, overlooking both the river itself and the lowlands beyond. Yaxchilan is known for the large quantity of excellent sculpture at the site, such as the monolithic carved stelae and the narrative stone reliefs carved on lintels spanning the temple doorways. Over 120 inscriptions have been identified on the various monuments from the site. The major groups are the Central Acropolis, the West Acropolis and the South Acropolis. The South Acropolis occupies the highest part of the site. The site is aligned with relation to the Usumacinta River, at times causing unconventional orientation of the major structures, such as the two ballcourts. The site is relatively natural with howling monkeys, bats, <b>toucans</b> and other wildlife to be seen in and around the buildings.|$|E
25|$|World of Birds, which {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades {{in the summer}} of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain <b>toucans,</b> Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden lion tamarins, Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so. In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works towards preserving this species in the wild as well.|$|E
500|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes. Other members of this group, such as the jacamars, puffbirds, barbets, <b>toucans,</b> and honeyguides, have traditionally been thought to be {{closely related to the}} woodpecker family (woodpeckers, piculets, wrynecks and sapsuckers). The clade Pici (woodpeckers, barbets, <b>toucans,</b> and honeyguides) is well supported and shares a zygodactyl foot with the Galbuli (puffbirds and jacamars). More recently, several DNA sequence analyses have confirmed that Pici and Galbuli are sister groups.|$|E
50|$|The white-throated <b>toucan</b> was {{formerly}} {{considered to be}} three separate species. The red-billed <b>toucan</b> and Cuvier's <b>toucan,</b> which differ principally in the bill colour, interbreed freely wherever they meet and therefore now merit only subspecies status. Some authorities consider the Inca <b>toucan</b> to represent a stable hybrid population between the other two subspecies and do not recognize it as a separate subspecies.|$|R

Regarding the fauna, agoutis, white-nosed coatis, gray foxes, Geoffroy's spider monkeys, howler monkeys, harpy eagles, falcons, ocellated turkeys, guans, <b>toucans,</b> green parrots and leafcutter ants can be seen there regularly.
