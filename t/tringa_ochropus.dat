5000|$|Occurrence of {{intrageneric}} hybridization {{has been}} reported between the buff-breasted sandpiper ("Tryngites" [...] subruficollis) and the white-rumped (or possibly Baird's, [...] "Calidris" [...] bairdii) sandpiper - the parent species apparently do belong into the same genus, however (see calidrid) -, {{as well as between}} the common and the green sandpiper (<b>Tringa</b> <b>ochropus).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{green sandpiper}} (<b>Tringa</b> <b>ochropus)</b> {{is a small}} wader (shorebird) of the Old World. The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird {{mentioned}} by Aristotle. The specific ochropus is from Ancient Greek okhros, [...] "ochre", and pous, [...] "foot".|$|E

Other bird species include the common chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), the willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), the tree pipit (Anthus trivialis), the common redpoll (Carduelis flammea), the great tit (Parus major), the spotted flycatcher (Muscicapa striata), the red crossbill (Loxia curvirostra), the Eurasian treecreeper (Certhia familiaris), the wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix), the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) and the goldcrest (Regulus regulus).|$|E

Teal (Anas crecca), water rail (Rallus aquaticus), grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea), grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) are regular visitors or resident. Especially in freezing weather, the disused cress-beds can yield waders: most often snipe (Gallinago gallinago), but also redshank (Tringa totanus) and green sandpiper (<b>Tringa</b> <b>ochropus)</b> and, more rarely, jack snipe (Lymnocryptes minimus) and dunlin (Calidris alpina). Water pipit (Anthus spinoletta) may also be found here in winter, and in January 1965, on some cress-ditches which have now been filled in, up to four spotted crakes (Porzana porzana) were present. The valley {{is a good place}} to see willow tit (Parus montanus), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), and sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus). The alders attract flocks of siskin (Carduelis spinus) and redpoll (C. flammea). Lesser spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos minor) is frequent.Some of the old ditches and surrounding woodland have been made into a local nature reserve. Marsh marigold (Caltha palustris) grows here, and there is a fairly large bed of great reed-mace (Typha latifolia).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Nakdong Estuary in Busan Metropolitan City. The study aimed to monitor Tringa spp. at Nakdong Estuary through the comparative analysis of the long-term findings between the early 1990 s (May, 1989 ~April, 1993) and the mid- 2000 s (May, 2002 ~April, 2008). During the research period (May, 1989 ~April, 1993, May, 2002 ~April, 2008 : 10 years in total), the total of 116, 761 birds representing 9 genera, 27 species were observed. Of them, {{the total number of}} Tringa genus of family Scolopacidae was 1, 461 individuals (1. 25 %) representing 7 species, including 150 individuals of Tringa erythropus, 24 individuals of Tringa totanus, 28 individuals of Tringa stagnatilis, 1, 223 individuals of Tringa nebularia, 9 individuals of Tringa guttifer, 24 individuals of <b>Tringa</b> <b>ochropus,</b> and 3 individuals of Tringa glareola. The monthly comparison of the visitation of the genera Tringa between two periods, {{there was no significant difference}} between the individual numbers in the early 1990 s and the mid- 2000 s (P> 0. 39). There were more individuals observed in the early 1990 s (Mean= 163. 00) than those in the mid- 2000 s (Mean= 134. 83). The results of monthly number of individuals in each year between the early 1990 s and the mid- 2000 s (from May to April in following year) indicated that there was statistically significant mean difference in May (P> 0. 01). On the other hand, no statistical significance was found in the other months. The means of the individual numbers observed in the mid- 2000 s appear in Table 3 and Fig 3. As Table 3 indicates, the mean of individual number of five sites was 26. 97 : 57. 33 individuals in Daema-deung (DMD), 11. 83 individuals in Jangja and Shinja-Do (JJ & SJD), 7. 33 individuals in Saja and Doyo-deung (SJ & DYD), 8. 00 individuals in Lower Ulsuk-Do (LUD), 50. 33 individuals in Ulsuk-Do (USD). There was statistically significant mean difference among these five sites (P> 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|Histological {{structure}} of digestive tracts of 12 species of waders (Aves, Сharadrii) has been studied: Pluvialis squatarola (Linnaeus, 1758), Charadrius hiaticula (Linnaeus, 1758), Recurvirostra avosetta (Linnaeus, 1758), <b>Tringa</b> <b>ochropus</b> (Linnaeus, 1758), T. glareola (Linnaeus, 1758), T. nebularia (Gunnerus, 1767), T. erythropus (Pallas, 1764), Philomachus pugnax (Linnaeus, 1758), Calidris minuta (Leisler, 1812), C. ferruginea (Pontoppidan, 1763), C. alpina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Gallinago gallinago (Linnaeus, 1758). The features of histological {{structure of}} {{all parts of}} the digestive tract of the waders species under analysis were defined and adaptations {{in the structure of the}} digestive system to distant migrations were detected. It is determined that the histological structure of the wall of the esophagus of the studied species of waders is universal, and the relief of mucosa is folded; stratified squamous epithelium of the mucous membrane has an insignificant degree of hornification. A large number of esophagus glands is observed in the lamina propria of the mucosa; these glands secrete mucus which facilitates the movement of food along the esophagus. The muscular coat is well-developed and formed by longitudinal and circular layers of smooth muscle tissue. It is found that characteristics of histological structure of the stomach wall of the waders species under analysis are presupposed by the following functions: 1) glandular stomach wall provides secretion of digestive enzymes through active secretory activity of glands of deep complex; 2) secretion (mucus) of simple tubular glands is excreted to the surface of glandular stomach performing the protective function; 3) the wall of the muscular stomach provides mechanical treatment of food through well-developed muscle layer and solid layer of the cuticle. It is established that the waders’ intestine is shortened, that is compensated by the complication of the relief of intestinal mucosa by plates that form complex mazes and anastomoses, several times increasing the absorbing surface of the intestine. The plates are covered with a single layer of prismatic bordered epithelium which includes Goblet cells, the number of which increases in the caudal direction of intestines. It is found out that the particular feature of the histological structure of the examined wall of the waders’ small intestine is multi-layer location of crypts in the mucosa. A large number of cambial cells with figures of mitosis were noticed in the crypt, which indicated the intensive processes of proliferation of intestinal enterocytes. These features in the structure of the wall of the small intestine are considered as adaptations to distant migrations and are connected with waders’ intense nutrition on migration stops. For the first time Meckel diverticulum has been found in waders and its histological structure has been described. It is established that waders’ Meckel diverticulum is a lymphoid-epithelial organ and it serves as the immune system of waders’ digestive tract. It is stated that the wall of waders’ rectum has wrinkles that contribute to its stretching; mucous membrane has the plate relief, it is lined with a single layer of epithelium bordered with many Goblet cells. It is revealed that different parts of the investigated waders’ cecum have uneven development of histological structures and the presence of lymphoid tissue clusters in the lamina propria mucosa indicates the functional belonging of the cecum to the immune defense system of waders’ digestive tract; the presence of mainly bordered enterocytes in the surface epithelium indicates its osmo-regulatory functio...|$|E
