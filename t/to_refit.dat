5|$|During {{battles in}} Soviet Union in 1941 and 1942, the Waffen-SS {{suffered}} enormous casualties. The LSSAH and Das Reich lost over half their troops to illness and combat casualties. In need of recruits, Himmler began to accept soldiers {{that did not}} fit the original SS racial profile. In early 1942, SS-Leibstandarte, SS-Totenkopf, and SS-Das Reich were withdrawn to the West <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> and were converted to Panzergrenadier divisions. The SS-Panzer Corps returned to the Soviet Union in 1943 and participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov in February and March.|$|E

In November the cruiser {{was sent to the}} Kure Naval Arsenal <b>to</b> <b>refit.</b> The ship was reassigned to the 2nd Division after the refit, which was ordered north to Wonsan on 2 February to escort the occupation force there. Tokiwa was ordered home on 12 February for another refit. On 13 April, the 2nd Division, including the armored cruisers Izumo and , sailed to escort minelayers as they laid 715 mines off Vladivostok.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} week of March, the {{battalion}} finally withdrew <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> with the M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyer. In so doing, it reverted to the old self-propelled battalion organisation; three companies of twelve tank destroyers, plus a fourth reconnaissance company with a platoon of pioneers. The new organisation was smaller than the old - fewer men were needed for vehicle crews - and so even after the creation of the new Reconnaissance Company on 27 March, the 824th finished the month with a complement of 646 all ranks, down from 750.|$|E
5|$|Waffen-SS units {{which had}} survived the summer campaigns were {{withdrawn}} from the front line <b>to</b> <b>refit.</b> Two of them, the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, did so in the Arnhem region of Holland in early September 1944. Coincidentally, on 17 September, the Allies launched {{in the same area}} Operation Market Garden, a combined airborne and land operation designed to seize control of the lower Rhine. The 9th and 10th Panzers were among the units that repulsed the attack.|$|E

5|$|Chépart {{himself was}} taken captive by the Natchez, {{who were at}} first unsure {{what to do with}} him, but finally decided that he should be killed by a stinkard—a member of the lowest caste in the tribe's hierarchy. The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was {{employed}} by the Natchez <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground. Just as Governor Bienville had done with the executed Indians in 1717 and 1723, the Natchez beheaded the dead Frenchmen and brought the severed heads for the Great Sun to view.|$|E
5|$|HMS Achilles was an {{armoured}} frigate {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the 1860s. Upon completion in 1864 she {{was assigned to the}} Channel Fleet. The ship was paid off in 1868 <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> and be re-armed. When she recommissioned in 1869, she was assigned as the guard ship of the Fleet Reserve in the Portland District until 1874. Achilles was refitted and re-armed again in 1874 and became the guard ship of the Liverpool District in 1875. Two years later, she was rejoined the Channel Fleet before going to the Mediterranean in 1878. The ship returned to the Channel Fleet in 1880 and served until she was paid off in 1885.|$|E
5|$|HMS Active {{was laid}} down in 1867 and {{launched}} on 13 March 1869. The ship was completed in March 1871 at a total cost of £126,156. Of this, £85,795 was spent on her hull and £40,361 on her machinery. Unlike her sister ship , Active was placed in reserve after completion until 1873 when she was commissioned {{to serve as the}} flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, Commodore William Hewett. The ship participated in naval operations during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War of 1874 and some of her crew were landed to reinforce the forces ashore. Commodore Francis Sullivan replaced Hewett in 1876 and he retained command until 1879 when the ship returned home <b>to</b> <b>refit.</b>|$|E

5|$|HMS Defence was {{assigned}} to the Channel Squadron upon completion in 1862. The ship was paid off in 1866 <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> and be re-armed and was briefly reassigned to the Channel Squadron again when she recommissioned in 1868. Defence had brief tours on the North American and Mediterranean Stations, from 1869 to 1872 before she was refitted again from 1872 to 1874. She became guard ship on the Shannon when she recommissioned. The ship was transferred to the Channel Squadron again in 1876 and then became guard ship in 1879 on the Mersey until 1885. Defence was placed in reserve until 1890 when she {{was assigned}} to the mechanical training school at Devonport in 1890. She was renamed Indus when the school adopted that name and served there until sold in 1935.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Nuclear Posture Review study {{determined}} that, of the 18 Ohio SSBNs the U.S. Navy {{would be}} operating in total, 14 {{would be sufficient}} for the strategic needs of the U.S. The {{decision was made to}} convert four Ohio-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional land attack and special operations. As a result, the four oldest boats of the class—Ohio, Michigan, Florida, and Georgia—progressively entered the conversion process in late 2002 and were returned to active service by 2008. The boats could thereafter carry 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 66 special operations personnel, among other capabilities and upgrades. The cost <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> the four boats was around US$1billion (2008 dollars) per vessel.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{in early}} 1942, in {{response}} to Japan's entry to the war, the battalion was transferred back to Australia and {{after a period of}} re-organisation and training it was sent to New Guinea where it took part in the Kokoda Track campaign. Arriving {{at the height of the}} fighting, after the Japanese advance stalled it took part in the pursuit of Japanese forces to the northern coast, fighting around the beachheads at Buna–Gona. In 1943, after returning to Australia for six months <b>to</b> <b>refit,</b> the battalion was committed to the Salamaua–Lae campaign, and then the Ramu Valley–Finisterre Range campaign. Returning to Australia in early 1944, a long period of inactivity followed before the 2/33rd undertook its last campaign in Borneo in the final months of the war. The battalion was disbanded in Brisbane in March 1946.|$|E

5|$|Whilst Valiant {{was under}} construction, Westwood, Baillie went {{bankrupt}} in November 1861 and their shipyard {{was taken over}} by the Thames Ironworks. This delayed her launching by {{about a year and a}} shortage of muzzle-loading guns delayed her completion by nearly five years. Hector, in contrast, served with the Channel Fleet from commissioning until 1867, when she was paid off to be re-armed and <b>to</b> <b>refit.</b> She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886 much like Valiants service as the First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland after her commissioning, where she remained until 1885. Both ships did little of significance until they were assigned to the Particular Service Squadron, commanded by Admiral Geoffrey Hornby, from June to August 1878 during the Russian war scare during the Russo-Turkish War.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Obergruppenführer Wilhelm Bittrich's II SS Panzer Corps—comprising {{the remains}} of Walter Harzer's 9th SS and Heinz Harmel's 10th SS Panzer Divisions—had moved into the area north of Arnhem <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> and reorganise. Although badly mauled after {{escaping}} the Falaise pocket, the Korps {{was made up of}} seasoned veterans and made available significantly more forces to the Germans than the allies had been led to expect. The divisions were also specially trained in anti-airborne operations; during their formation both divisions had undergone month-long anti airborne exercises whilst waiting for their heavy equipment, and had also spent the last 15 months studying the best reactions to a parachute attack in classroom and field exercises. The 9th SS had a Panzergrenadier brigade, a reconnaissance battalion, an artillery battalion, two batteries of self-propelled guns and a company of tanks. Exactly how many men were available after the withdrawal from Normandy is unclear. Some sources suggest that the 9th had up to 6,000 men, others suggest that the combined total of the 9th and 10th SS was only 6,000–7,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Duperré did {{not meet}} any British ships on his journey back to the French island, {{as most of the}} British {{blockade}} squadron were engaged {{in the aftermath of the}} Invasion of Île Bonaparte, conducted during July by Commodore Rowley. With the British distracted by this amphibious operation, it was simple for Duperré to reach Grand Port on the south east coast of Île de France in spite of the small blockade squadron under Captain Samuel Pym. This narrow and well-protected anchorage was considered to be the best place <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> the battered French squadron, but in August it came under attack by a British squadron in the Battle of Grand Port. This action was a disaster for the British as their ships became grounded in the unfamiliar shoals of the harbour and four frigates were lost under fire from shore batteries and Duperré's squadron.|$|E

5|$|HMS Hector {{was laid}} down on 8 March 1861 by Robert Napier and Sons in Govan. She was {{launched}} on 26 September 1861, completed in January 1862, and commissioned on 22 February 1864. She cost £294,000 to build, including a payment of £35,000 to her builders who had underestimated their costs. She {{served with the}} Channel Fleet until 1867, when she was paid off to be re-armed and <b>to</b> <b>refit.</b> She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886; during this time her only military activity occurred when she was detailed to service in the Particular Service Squadron {{under the command of}} Admiral Hornsby during the Russian war scare of June to August, 1878. Hector was assigned as Queen Victoria's guard ship nearly every summer during this period when the Queen, and her family, were in residence in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She was paid off at Portsmouth in 1886 and remained there, partly dismantled, until 1900 when she briefly became part of the torpedo school HMS Vernon as a store hulk. Hector became the first British warship to have wireless telegraphy installed when she conducted the first trials of the new equipment for the Royal Navy. The ship was sold for scrap in 1905.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, Zähringen and {{her four}} sisters sortied {{in an attempt}} to locate Russian {{warships}} off Gotland, but returned to port two days later without having engaged any opponents. Additionally, the threat from submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships from active service. Zähringen and most of the other IV Squadron ships left Libau on 10 November, bound for Kiel; upon arrival the following day, they were designated the Reserve Division of the Baltic. The ships were anchored in Schilksee in Kiel. On 31 January, the division was dissolved, and the ships were dispersed for subsidiary duties. Zähringen was initially used as a training ship in Kiel. In 1917, the ship was used to train stokers but then became a target ship for torpedo boats and the old ironclad , which had by that time become a torpedo training ship. Later, the Kaiserliche Marine considered replacing the cruiser , then the gunnery training ship, with Zähringen, and work began <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> her for this duty on 22 July 1918. The repairs and modifications had not been completed {{by the end of the}} war, however. The ship was left in Germany, and on 13 December was placed out of service.|$|E
5|$|The French {{had also}} been {{preparing}} reinforcements for the region, but their nearest naval bases were in France itself, several thousand miles away across oceans almost totally controlled by the Royal Navy. These distances also delayed the arrival of news from the Indian Ocean, and therefore word had still not reached France {{of the fall of}} Isle de France by 17:00 on 2 February 1811, when a reinforcement squadron set sail from Brest. This squadron consisted of three powerful frigates, Renommée under Commodore François Roquebert, Clorinde under Captain Jacques Saint-Cricq and Néréide under Captain Jean-François Lemaresquier. Each ship carried over 200 soldiers for the Isle de France garrison and significant food and military supplies with which <b>to</b> <b>refit</b> Hamelin's squadron and resupply the island. The French authorities were aware of the possibility that Isle de France had been captured, and had ordered that if the island was in British hands, the squadron should continue on to the Dutch city of Batavia on Java, to operate against the British from there.|$|E
