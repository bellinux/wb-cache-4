5|$|The second {{version was}} a lyric video, which {{features}} Hamasaki in a recording studio. It also features candid photos of Hamasaki in Los Angeles, Japan, and doing other endeavours outside of music. The Riff Studio version features Hamasaki as her character design AyuPan and a character titled the Bloody Bunny. Both {{of them are}} in a space ship, and travel throughout different worlds and atmospheres, until landing on a planet with blue aliens. The aliens appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sad,</b> whist AyuPan and the Bloody Bunny stand there. AyuPan then plays the song from her space ship, and makes the aliens feel happy; they all begin dancing to the track. It ends with the world turning pink instead of blue, and has heart shapes around it. This version premiered one week before the album's release in July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E

On {{the lyric}} side of things, if I was singing about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn't ring true for me. I don't know why that is.

Sydney argues that the rape was an [...] "excess of love" [...] and less severe than being deprived of love as attested by the line, [...] "Since wanting is more woe than too much having." ...|$|E

Hader toured the studio over a week, and also [...] "helped out" [...] in the story room. He was invited to play Fear {{by the end of}} his stay there, but was also asked to contact fellow Saturday Night Live (SNL) veteran Amy Poehler, whom the team viewed as perfect for the character of Joy. [...] "They said: 'Would you mind calling Amy? We don't want to call her and have her think we're some weirdo,'" [...] he recalled. He phoned Poehler and explained the story to her, noting that her role would be the driving force in the film. When the story was pitched to Kaling, she broke down in tears, explaining [...] "I just think it's really beautiful that you guys are making a story that tells kids that it's difficult to grow up and it's OK <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> about it." ...|$|E

The video premiered on 17 October 2007.|$|E
500|$|Johann Peter Hebel {{was born}} on 10 May 1760 in Basel, where his parents were {{employed}} in a patrician household during the summer. He spent half of his childhood in Basel {{and the other half}} in the village of Hausen im Wiesental, where his father worked as a weaver during the winters. As he wrote in an autobiographical sketch, [...] "there I learned early on {{what it meant to be}} poor and rich... to have nothing and to have everything, to be happy with the happy people and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> with those who cried". Memories of both places had a deep influence on his literary work. Hebel's father, who had moved to southern Baden from the Hunsrück area, died of typhus early in 1761, as did his younger sister, who was only a few weeks old. Hebel went to primary school in Hausen in 1766, and in 1769 went on to the Latin school in Schopfheim, where his teacher was the theologian August Gottlieb Preuschen. During the summer months he went to a parish school in Basel, and later to the prestigious cathedral school (Gymnasium am Münsterplatz). His mother died when he was thirteen.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sad,</b> one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E
500|$|The fear in of {{the fourth}} floor refers to tetraphobia, the superstitious fear of the number four. Jokes about this have been {{featured}} in such pop culture works as the 1999 film Being John Malkovich and the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. The song [...] "Unskinny Bop", a 1990 single by the band Poison, plays {{during one of the}} strip club scenes. Leslie said Tom hides his emotions behind [...] "a very thick layer of Axe body spray", a reference to the real-life male grooming product. The Parks department employees eat at a restaurant called Jurassic Fork, a reference to the Steven Spielberg dinosaur adventure film Jurassic Park, which was adapted from a novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. During one scene, Tom refers to Ron as [...] "Rondoleezza Rice", a reference to former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. At the strip club, Leslie mistakenly refers to a stripper named Sierra by the name Seabiscuit, a champion thoroughbred racehorse. Reflecting on his marriage, Tom said, [...] "At least we lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and that guy from Sum 41", a reference to the pop singer's short-lived marriage to Sum 41 guitarist Deryck Whibley. Tom says one of the strippers also works at Quiznos, a sandwich fast-food franchise; Tom says of her: [...] "She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos." [...] Andy said he has a T-shirt that is [...] "literally priceless" [...] because he was wearing it when he tackled American singer Eddie Vedder. When Ron was commenting on how well Tom was pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> about his divorce, he tells Tom, [...] "Take it down a notch. You've already won your Oscar, DiCaprio," [...] which is a reference to the Academy Awards and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.|$|E
2500|$|People loathed {{being alone}} for long without someone {{available}} to perform this rite before the sick collapsed. The family dressed the deceased {{in their best}} clothes, and adorned them with packets of gold dust (money for the after-life), ornaments, and food for the journey [...] "up the hill". The body was normally buried within 24 hours. Until that time the funeral party engage in dancing, drumming, shooting of guns, all accompanied by the wailing of relatives. This was done because the Ashanti typically believed that death was not something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> about, but rather a part of life. As the Ashanti believed in an after-life, families felt they would be reunited with their ancestors upon death. Funeral rites {{for the death of}} a king involved the whole kingdom and were a much more elaborate affair.|$|E

30|$|Out of {{the four}} {{predictors}} used in the human ratings model (happiness, sadness, likability, interestingness), only the sadness and happiness ratings were significant predictors of depression. Depressed participants’ photos <b>were</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sadder</b> and less happy than those of healthy participants. Ratings assessments generally showed strong patterns of correlation with one another, but exhibited extremely low correlation with computational features. The modest positive correlation of human-rated happiness with the presence and number of faces in a photograph was the only exception to this trend. Correlation matrices for all models are available in Additional file 1.|$|R

Produced by Calvin Harris, 'We Found Love' is a {{swirling}} party track about love and loss, the rare song that manages <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> and joyous all at once. And it is a pinnacle of the pop/dance crossover, a throwback to '90s raves that could make even the most stoic lover of pop want to break out a glow stick and just dance. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone put [...] "We Found Love" [...] at number eleven on his list of Top 25 Songs of 2011 commenting, [...] "While her other hits tried to camouflage her spindly voice, here it just strains for that spindly melody." [...] It was named the third biggest love song of all time by Billboard.|$|E

The single [...] "California" [...] failed to be commercially successful, but [...] "Storm", featuring Jay-Z, reached the charts. [...] "Calling All Angels" [...] was successful in various countries and a huge hit in Brazil, however it was [...] "Lady" [...] that became the album's surprise hit, making the US Top 30 and propelling Baptism to gold status.

Kravitz served as the opening act for Aerosmith who are long term friends of Kravitz on their fall 2005 tour. The tour began on October 30 at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut. The night before that tour started, October 29, 2005, Lenny's father, TV producer Seymour [...] "Sy" [...] Kravitz, died. During that first show, Lenny broke the news to the stunned crowd and stated it was not a time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sad,</b> but rather a time to celebrate because he is now in Heaven. Lenny then dedicated Let Love Rule to his father. That tour was so successful that it was extended through February 25, 2006 and ended in Anaheim, California.|$|E

It's portraying fictional characters!" [...] Marc Elliott added: [...] "The storyline got whipped up into a massive frenzy. It's not {{representative}} in any way, shape or form of mothers {{who have lost their}} babies." [...] EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer has also praised the plot for its [...] "great acting". In an interview with Take It Easy, asked whether the show's bosses handled the storyline well, Palmer replied: [...] "I think they did. I know there's been loads of bad press, but something like that is always going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> to watch and it will upset people. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a drama and it's not real. I think it got blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, things like that do happen in real life. Babies get swapped and snatched in hospitals. I'm sure that any parent who has lost a child will find even talking about their experience very difficult, let alone watching it being acted out on television. Even my daughter got upset but she is only 9 so maybe I shouldn't have let her watch it. I just didn't realise it was going to be so heart-wrenching, which was down to the great acting." ...|$|E
