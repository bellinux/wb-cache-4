5|$|The high {{waves and}} winds caused the {{greatest}} marine damage {{in a decade}} around New York City. More than 100boats were overturned or beached in Jamaica Bay, and another 150boats were wrecked between Hell Gate and {{the west end of}} Coney Island. At least ten houseboats were damaged or sank, with boaters injured and requiring rescue. A man attempting to row ashore near Point O' Woods required rescue amid strong winds. Passengers swam safely ashore after their boat capsized in Hell Gate.
