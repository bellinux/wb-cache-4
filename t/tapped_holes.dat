40|$|We {{have used}} {{polished}} stainless steel as a mirror substrate to provide focusing of soft x-rays in grazing incidence reflection. The substrate is bent to an elliptical shape with large curvature and high stresses in the substrate require a strong elastic material. Conventional material choices of silicon or of glass will not withstand the stress required. The use of steel allows the substrates to be polished and installed flat, using screws in <b>tapped</b> <b>holes.</b> The ultra-high-vacuum bender mechanism is motorized and computer controlled. These mirrors are used to deliver focused beams of soft x-rays {{onto the surface of}} a sample for experiments at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). They provide an illumination field that can be as small as the mirror demagnification allows, for localized study, and can be enlarged, under computer control, for survey measurements over areas of the surface up to several millimeters. The critical issue {{of the quality of the}} steel surface, polished and coated with gold, which limits the minimum achievable focused spot size is discussed in detail. Comparison is made to a polished, gold coated, electroless nickel surface, which provides a smoother finish. Surface measurements are presented as power spectral densities, as a function of spatial frequency. The surface height distributions measured with an interferometric microscope, and complemented by atomic force microscope measurements, are used to compute power spectral densities and then to evaluate the surface roughness.

50|$|Gravity {{delivers}} the apatite ore, carbon (coke) and silica (gravel) to the submerged-arc furnace through feed chutes {{situated in the}} roof of the furnace. This ensures a constant packed bed volume. The gaseous product, a mixture of carbon monoxide and phosphorus gas, leaves the furnace through two symmetrically placed outlet vents situated above the ferrophosphorus <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> in {{the roof of the}} furnace. The ferrophosphorus is tapped off, usually once per day. Slag, however, is continuously tapped through two alternating, water-cooled <b>tap</b> <b>holes</b> located 400 mm above the furnace floor. The feed material forms the major electrical and flow resistance of the smelting furnace circuit. As the feed materials descend towards the hot zone in the furnace, they start to soften and melt, significantly lowering the electrical resistance. A conductive path is thus provided between the electrodes where the Joule heating is released to attain the high temperatures and energy levels needed to effect the essential endothermic reactions.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tap</b> <b>hole</b> {{refractories}} constitute critical {{parts of}} the refractory lining in submerged arc furnaces. For several hours every day, molten slag and metal flow through the <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> calling for thorough selection of refractory materials able to withstand the intense thermal, corrosive and erosive conditions present in this area. Carbon-based refractories have shown excellent thermal properties and high strength, as well as low wettability towards process materials, and are therefore utilized in silicomanganese production furnaces both as side lining, in the hearth, and in the <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> area. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to determine the compatibility of five refractory materials utilized in the <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> area of an industrial silicomanganese furnace with two industrial silicomanganese slags: 	Investigate the suitability of the selected refractory materials for confining the process materials during industrial production of silicomanganese alloys. 	Identify critical refractory wear mechanisms upon slag-refractory interaction at industrial tapping temperatures. Compatibilities were investigated through 12 static crucible tests and two static plate tests in a vertical tube furnace redesigned during this investigation. Slag-refractory interaction was studied after two and four hours holding time at 1367 °C ± 1. 8 °C, 1464 °C ± 2. 1 °C and 1600 °C - 0. 6 °C /+ 0. 2 °C. Holding temperatures were verified through the wire-bridge method at the melting points of gold and palladium. Visual inspection, as well as optical microscopy and SEM, were utilized to examine the samples after heat treatment. During compatibility experiments, dissolution of refractory matrix due to solubility of oxide refractory binder phases in silicomanganese slags was observed, as well as disintegration of refractory particles due to gas formation at slag-refractory interface, or expansion as a result of phase transformations in refractory material. Direct reduction of manganese oxide from slags and iron oxide present in refractories by carbon and silicon carbide was also observed. Establishment of partial slag-metal equilibriums between iron oxide and silicon metal originally present in slag was observed, as well as formation of silicon carbide at the slag-refractory interfaces. The latter may serve to protect the refractory from wear caused by slags. Based on observations of extensive interaction between silicomanganese slag sample I and ramming paste at 1600 °C, the ramming paste investigated cannot be recommended for usage during tap block repair in an industrial silicomanganese furnace. Incipient electrode paste disintegration by slags and silicon carbide tap block slag interaction were observed after compatibility tests at 1464 °C, calling for further investigations of these refractory materials. <b>Tap</b> <b>hole</b> clay and carbon tap block showed minimal signs of interaction with process materials at 1464 °C.

Stands {{were divided into}} 4 plots that received the following fertilizer treatments: dolomitic lime – calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K), and lime plus P+K treatments and no fertilizer in June 1999. The effects of crown damage level and fertilization on root starch, sap volume, sap sugar content, syrup production, and <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> closure rate were examined during Phase I of this study, which ran from 1998 to 2001. During Phase II fall root starch content and stem diameter growth (fall of 2003), sap volume and sugar content, hourly block temperatures measured during the sap run (spring of 2004), and <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> closure (fall of 2004) were examined and effects on syrup production calculated. Fall root starch content, sap volume, and <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> closure rate were not affected by crown damage level. Sugar content of sap was reduced in trees with moderate (26 - 50 %) and severe (> 50 %) damage. Moderate damage also lowered syrup production per tap. Daily air temperature amplitudes were about 1 oC greater in moderately and severely damaged stands compared to lightly (0 - 25 %) damaged stands. Moderately and severely damaged trees also had less stem diameter growth in 1999, 2000, and 2001, but not in 2002 and 2003. The fertilizer and lime treatments had no significant effects.

40|$|Silicomanganese (SiMn) as an alloy {{supplies}} silicon and manganese to the steelmaking industry. It {{is produced}} through carbothermic reduction in a submerged arc furnace. The slag and metal are typically tapped through a single-level <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> at 50 K (50 C) below the process temperature of 1873 K to 1923 K (1600 C to 1650 C). In one tapblock refractory design configuration, the <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> is installed as a carbon tapblock and rebuilt {{during the life}} of the lining using carbon-based cold ramming paste. The carbon tapblock lasts {{for a number of years}} and ramming paste only for months. The purpose of the study presented here was to determine to what extent chemical reactions between carbon-based refractory and slag or metal in the <b>tap</b> <b>hole</b> of a SiMn furnace can contribute to wear of tap-hole refractory. The results of the study are reported in two parts. In Part I, the results of thermodynamic calculations of the potential for chemical reaction between carbon-based refractory material and slag or metal are reported. The results were tested experimentally using pure graphite and synthetic SiMn slag (produced from pure oxides). The paper also reports the composition, microstructure, and phases of industrial SiMn slag, and commercially available carbon block and cold ramming paste refractory materials. These compositions were used in predicted equilibria of refractory–slag reactions. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that reaction between SiMn slag and carbonbased tap-hole refractory is possible, and experiments with nominally pure materials support this. However, practical refractory materials are by no means pure materials, and contain secondary phases and porosity which can be expected to affect reaction with slag.
