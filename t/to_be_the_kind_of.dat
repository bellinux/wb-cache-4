In his {{biography}} of the Cure, Never Enough: The Story of the Cure, Jeff Apter wrote that it [...] "turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> album—just like Lou Reed's Berlin or Bowie's coke-fueled Low—that required some distance and a good few years of music history to be really appreciated". In 1995, Mark Coleman of Rolling Stone noted that Pornography {{had come to be}} [...] "revered by Cureheads as a masterstroke", while noting that [...] "normal listeners will probably find it impenetrable". Stewart Mason of AllMusic found it to be [...] "much better than most mainstream critics of the time thought", {{but at the same time}} [...] "not the masterpiece some fans have claimed it to be" [...] and [...] "just a bit too uneven to be considered a classic". In 2004, Jaime Gill of BBC Music singled out the album's [...] "sonic depth and sheer relentless conviction" [...] for praise, adding that without these qualities, its [...] "extraordinary misanthropy would be laughable". Uncut called Pornography [...] "a masterpiece of claustrophobic self-loathing".|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} of the Bautista bat flip celebration, which could be viewed during the beta, received wide media coverage, with sites such as Yahoo! Sports, FOX Sports, CBS Sports, {{as well as the}} MLB's own Cut4 news subsidiary reporting on it. Critics who played the game's beta gave it generally positive reviews. Samit Sarkar of Polygon stated that [...] "NHL 17 is shaping up <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> game that could bring the series back to its previous-generation heights," [...] complimenting the game's gameplay improvements and the new additions to the EASHL mode. Jake Sundstrom of SB Nations Fear the Fin blog enjoyed the game's team and arena builders, but commented that they need [...] "a little more depth". Brian Mazique of Forbes lauded the game's graphics, stating that [...] "NHL continues {{to be one of the}} most attractive sports games available." [...] He also praised the game's improved AI systems for CPU teammates and opponents as well as the online connectivity. He was more critical of the HUT mode's menus and the game's presentation, calling it [...] "beyond stale and outdated." [...] Mazique enjoyed the EASHL mode, but felt that the player creation feature was limited in options. SB Nation writer SkyonAir, of the Stanley Cup of Chowder blog, praised the player and team creators as well as the gameplay overhaul for goaltenders. While he criticized the beta's lack of game modes offered, he recommended the game to readers.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} {{which appeared in}} The New York Times, Williams said that the choices {{for many of the}} pieces of classical music were made by the studio. He also said that while he did not know why certain pieces were chosen, Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony), which features prominently in the film, was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script. Some of the other choices, such as Gideon's playing of Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by Bach on an organ in the subterranean prison, were also in the screenplay, and he figured that [...] "hey are some writer's conception of what this character might have listened to." [...] Williams did choose the minuet from a Haydn string quartet (Op. 64, No. 1) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse. He said he picked the piece because [...] "t seemed to me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing a woman like this would play on the radio." [...] The New York Times characterized the score as [...] "evocative" [...] and said it was [...] "thoroughly modern" [...] while also being [...] "interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks." [...] The piece heard when Anderton is shown entering his apartment and he tells his computer system [...] "I'm home" [...] is the 2nd movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, known as the [...] "Pathetique" [...] Symphony.|$|E

500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It <b>was</b> good <b>to</b> play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> character.

2500|$|Scott Foundas at Variety {{calls the}} film [...] "pleasant," [...] and gives much credit to {{director}} Pasquin.

[...] Steve Simels at TV Guide writes that the film [...] "has genuine wit and pathos," [...] some well drawn characters, [...] "and a couple of sly comic performances." [...] However, Simels did state that [...] "none of these virtues can completely compensate for the film's utterly conventional message of uplift." [...] Simels gave praise {{to some of the}} lead performances, crediting Greg Germann in particular for nearly stealing the film, calling his portrayal [...] "truly a marvel to behold."

2500|$|The sleeve to Watermark was {{illustrated}} to {{a design}} painted by graphic designer Laurence Dunmore. The cover image of Enya {{was shot by}} David Hiscook with additional photography by Russel Yamy, with [...] "layers and layers of imagery" [...] hand drawn on top of it.

It had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sleeve you'd fall in love with ... And I think it works that way – the effect in window displays is stunning." [...] Enya was [...] "very happy" [...] with the cover, calling it [...] "very classic" [...] and [...] "in taste with the music", not portraying her as the latest [...] "girl on the scene" [...] when compared to other female solo artists at the time, such as Madonna and Kylie Minogue. The artwork provided the inspiration to the music video for [...] "Orinoco Flow". Dickins decided against the inclusion of a detailed set of liner notes and lyrics with their translations as it encouraged the listener to conjure up their own images and understanding when they play it, a decision that Enya supported.|$|E

2500|$|On May 23, 2005, Lieberman {{was one of}} {{fourteen}} senators, dubbed the [...] "Gang of 14," [...] who forged a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial filibuster, thus avoiding the Republican leadership's implementation of the so-called [...] "nuclear option". [...] Under the agreement, the Democrats would exercise the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an [...] "extraordinary circumstance," [...] {{and three of the}} filibustered Bush appellate court nominees [...] (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) [...] would receive a vote by the full Senate, which resulted in their confirmation. Lieberman refused to support a filibuster against Supreme Court Justice nominee Samuel Alito. Alito was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 31, 2006 by a vote of 58-42, becoming the Court's 110th Justice. Lieberman voted against the Alito confirmation in the final Senate vote.

50|$|His second feature La Vampire Nue (<b>The</b> Nude Vampire) <b>was</b> {{his first}} film in colour. It was mostly {{inspired}} by the 1916 film Judex, and also surrealism in general.

6000|$|Near {{the middle}} of the field was two women working together, raking as {{steadily}} as if they had been brought up to it. One of these was young, and even handsomer than Miss Dick, which was the name of the bar lady. To look at her made me think of what I had read of Queen Marie Antoinette and her court ladies playing the part of milkmaids. Her straw hat was trimmed with delicate flowers, and her white muslin dress and pale blue ribbons made her the prettiest picture I ever saw out-of-doors. I could not help asking Mrs. Locky who she was, and she told me that she was the chambermaid at the inn, and the other was the cook. When I heard this I didn't make any answer, but just walked off a little way and began raking and thinking. I have often wondered why it is that English servants are so different from those we have, or, to put it in a strictly confidential way between you and me, madam, why the chambermaid at the [...] "Bordley Arms," [...] as she is, is so different from me, as I used to be when I first lived with you. Now that young chambermaid with the pretty hat is, as far as appearances go, as good a woman as I am, and if Jone was a bachelor and intended to marry her I would think it was as good a match as if he married me. But the difference between us two is that when I got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> woman I am I wasn't willing to be a servant, and if I had always been the kind of young woman that chambermaid is I never would have been a servant.|$|E
