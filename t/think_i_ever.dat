At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner adjusted his technique, saying that he [...] "found I could get better results. I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> swore at a player from that time.

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} from {{television}} critics were mostly mixed, who {{found it to be}} [...] "a thorough examination of both Miley Cyrus and the evil monkey in Chris' closet," [...] but, [...] "things got ridiculous." [...] Television critic Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, and called it a [...] "much better episode than Brian's Got a Brand New Bag, with some clever sight gags, an annoyingly catchy musical number, and the revelation of the Evil Monkey's true reasons for hiding in Chris' closet." [...] In a simultaneous review of all four MacFarlane programs, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C- stating, [...] "Turning Miley Cyrus into a Small Wonder parody was fitfully amusing, {{but the rest of the}} Hannah Montana material was ridiculously non-specific, filled with the kinds of jokes everyone made about Cyrus a few years ago." [...] VanDerWerff praised the action sequence at the end {{of the episode}}, however, calling it [...] "high quality stuff for the show." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad stated of the Evil Monkey's role in the episode, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> wanted this character fully explored or seen by anyone else in the house [...] The character lost some of its mystique and charm." ...|$|E

Following the release of The Avalanche, Stevens expressed a dissatisfaction with his music, stating in an interview with Pitchfork in 2006: [...] "I'm getting tired of my voice. I'm getting tired of ... the banjo. I'm getting tired of ... the trumpet". In 2009 Stevens admitted that his Fifty States Project—an attempt to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. States—had been a [...] "promotional gimmick" [...] and not something that he had seriously intended to complete. In the same year he released The BQE, an orchestral suite accompanying a home-made film dedicated to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. In an interview with BeatRoute Magazine in 2010, Stevens stated [...] " [...] kinda sabotaged the mechanical way of approaching my music, which was basically narrative long-form. It really opened things up for me. It also confused things as well. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> really fully recovered from that process". On August 20, 2010, without prior announcement, Stevens released the EP All Delighted People, and less than one week later, announced The Age of Adz to be released on October 12.|$|E

He already had both his ears pierced and wore dangling women's diamante earrings. Keen to shock, {{on one of}} the Human League's posters in 1981, Oakey posed shirtless displaying pierced nipples linked together by a gold chain. Oakey says of his early 1980s style: [...] "I deliberately wore clothes that either men or women could wear. But I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> really looked like a woman. And I never wore very masculine clothes".|$|E

Still a teenager, acclimatising herself to her new surroundings was an uneasy process. Coming from the South, she did not speak Hindi and struggled to communicate with co-workers, and was constantly missing her mother, who was critically ill. Moreover, she was required to follow a strict diet. Recalling this phase, Rekha was later quoted as saying (Reacting to it, many years later, she said, [...] "I'm healed, I am not bitter anymore, I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> was."), ...|$|E

2500|$|Frustrated, {{she left}} Decca and signed with United Artists, where she teamed with the {{producer}} Allen Reynolds, who offered her the creative freedom she wanted {{and helped her}} develop her own style and phrasing. The first album, Crystal Gayle, was released in 1974 and produced her first top-ten country hit, [...] "Wrong Road Again" [...] (number 6). By 1976, she had the first of her 20 number one country singles with [...] "I'll Get Over You", which also became her first single on Billboard's Hot 100 (number 71) and adult contemporary chart (number 40). The following year, she had two more top-2 country hits, [...] "You Never Miss a Real Good Thing (Till He Says Goodbye)" [...] (number 1) and [...] "I'll Do It All Over Again" [...] (number 2), before achieving her greatest success. Gayle recalled what her sister Loretta Lynn had said: [...] "'You record what I couldn't record — you do MOR, middle of the road', [...] "and {{that was the best}} advice I could get.

2500|$|By this time, however, he {{had decided}} to further his {{education}} at a first-rate university. His first choice was Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. But he soon realized that he probably would not pass Vanderbilt's tough entrance examinations. So, in 1895, at the age of 28, Lomax matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in English literature, and undertaking almost a double course load (including Greek, Latin, and Anglo Saxon) and was graduated in two years. With a touch of Texas hyperbole, he later wrote:Never was there such a hopeless hodge-podge, There was I, a Chautauqua-educated country boy who couldn't conjugate an English verb or decline a pronoun, attempting to master three other languages at the same time. ... But I plunged on through the year, for since I was older than the average freshman, I must hurry, hurry, hurry. I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> stopped to think how foolish it all was. In his memoir, Adventures of a Ballad Hunter, Lomax recounts how he had arrived at the University of Texas with a roll of cowboy songs he had written down in childhood. He showed them to an English professor, Morgan Callaway, only to have them discounted as [...] "cheap and unworthy," [...] prompting Lomax to take the bundle behind the men's dormitory and burn it. His interest in folksongs thus rebuffed, Lomax focused his attentions on more acceptable academic pursuits. He joined the fraternity Phi Delta Theta and the Rusk Literary Society, as well as becoming an editor and later the editor-in-chief of the University of Texas Magazine. During the summer of 1896, he attended a summer school program in Chicago studying languages. In 1897, he became an associate editor of the Alcalde, a student newspaper. After graduation in June 1897, he worked at the University of Texas as registrar for the next six years until the spring of 1903. He also had other duties such as being personal secretary to the President of the University, manager of Brackenridge Hall (the men's dormitory on campus), and serving on the Alumni Scholarship Committee. Lomax joined a campus fraternity known as The Great and Honorable Order of Gooroos receiving the title [...] "Sybillene Priest".|$|E
