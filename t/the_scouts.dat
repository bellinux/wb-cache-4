5|$|In 1972, the NHL {{announced}} plans to add two expansion teams, including one in Kansas City, Missouri. Edwin G. Thompson led the group that purchased ownership of the team, which was nicknamed <b>the</b> <b>Scouts</b> in reference to Cyrus E. Dallin's statue {{of the same name}} which stands in that city's Penn Valley Park In the team's inaugural season, 1974–75, <b>the</b> <b>Scouts</b> were forced to wait until the ninth game to play in Kansas City's Kemper Arena, and did not post a win until beating the Washington Capitals, their expansion brethren, in their tenth contest. With 41 points in their inaugural season, <b>the</b> <b>Scouts</b> finished last in the Smythe Division; only the Capitals had fewer points in the NHL. Kansas City fell to 36 points the following season, and had a 27-game win-less streak, three short of the NHL record, which was set when the 1980-81 Winnipeg Jets went 30 games without a win. <b>The</b> <b>Scouts</b> had difficulty drawing fans to home games, and National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) leader Alan Eagleson publicly expressed concerns about whether Scouts players would be paid.|$|E
5|$|In an {{expedition}} to Shinganshina, <b>the</b> <b>Scouts</b> are attacked by a Female Titan who attempts to capture Eren. Although <b>the</b> <b>Scouts</b> are able to briefly capture the Female Titan, she breaks free and devastates Levi's squad, forcing the expedition to retreat. Armin determines that the Female Titan is Annie, one of the cadets who taught Eren to fight, and devises a plan to capture her at Stohess. During this operation, collateral damage reveals that Titans reside in and make up the walls surrounding the human settlements.|$|E
5|$|Leslie is {{approached}} by scouts looking for potential candidates for elected office, {{which has always}} been one of her dreams. Impressed by the memorial service and the harvest festival Leslie previously organized, they believe she would be a good candidate for upcoming city council seats, or possibly the mayoral position. With the expected increased media attention on her personal life, <b>the</b> <b>scouts</b> ask whether Leslie has any secret scandals in her life. She denies any such scandals exist, thus omitting her secret relationship with Ben, and <b>the</b> <b>scouts</b> promise to contact her about preparing an electoral run.|$|E

5|$|The same year, {{the family}} moved to Deurne, a suburb of Antwerp, where he came in contact with nature and with scouting, which both had a {{profound}} impact on his character and his later work. With <b>the</b> <b>scouts,</b> he became the troop reporter, writing down heavily illustrated reports on their outings and adventures, in a similar vein as what Hergé did in his scouting period. Through <b>the</b> <b>scouts,</b> he also came into contact with Le Boy-Scout Belge, the Walloon scouting magazine where Hergé made Totor, his first published comic. Vandersteen made a few sequels to these adventures for his friends as amusement, which are the earliest preserved comics he made. He continued to follow the work of Hergé later on. Meanwhile, Vandersteen combined his studies at the Academy with his work in his father's workshop until 1935, when the market for stone decorations for houses collapsed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scouts</b> were {{pursued by}} the disorganized militia and several were killed. The {{surviving}} scouts arrived at Black Hawk's camp ahead of the militia and reported the events. At the camp, the warriors set up a skirmish line in order {{to fend off the}} pending militia attack. The militia soldiers, intent on pursuing <b>the</b> <b>scouts,</b> chased them back toward the main force of Black Hawk's warriors and their skirmish line. Black Hawk and his force concealed themselves and ambushed the pursuers. Believing that thousands of Sauk and Fox were attacking them, the militia panicked and fled back to the main force camped at Dixon's Ferry. Stillman's exact whereabouts are unknown during this point in the battle. His later account published in a newspaper did not mention his location and noted his only order was to retreat. Stillman's account, published in the Missouri Republican, has been called fanciful.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{his closest}} friends in <b>the</b> <b>Scouts</b> also had {{athletic}} backgrounds: John Tripson, formerly a Detroit Lions all-pro tackle, Robert Halperin, who had played quarterback for Knute Rockne's Notre Dame football team and in the NFL, and Jerry Donnell, a football player {{who was killed in}} action at the Battle of Anzio.|$|E

50|$|Several {{derivatives}} of <b>the</b> <b>Scout</b> X-1 {{were also}} flown. The United States Navy developed <b>the</b> Blue <b>Scout,</b> {{which was a}} three-stage sounding rocket, and <b>the</b> Blue <b>Scout</b> II which was almost identical to <b>the</b> <b>Scout</b> X-1. <b>The</b> <b>Scout</b> X-1A, a five-stage variant of <b>the</b> <b>Scout</b> X-1, was used for a single suborbital launch in March 1962. It featured an improved first stage, and a NOTS-17 upper stage.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Scout</b> X had <b>the</b> same {{configuration}} as <b>the</b> <b>Scout</b> X-1, {{which would}} be the first all-up version of <b>the</b> <b>Scout.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> X-1, which had four live stages, <b>the</b> <b>Scout</b> X only had live first and third stages, with battleship mockups of the second and fourth.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the next}} week scouts from the army were sent through the {{northern}} townships of Columbia County. <b>The</b> <b>scouts</b> failed to find any evidence of a military uprising.

5|$|By 1976, both leagues {{were dealing}} with serious {{financial}} problems. The St. Louis Blues {{were on the verge}} of bankruptcy. Talk of a merger between the NHL and the WHA was growing. In 1976, for the first time in four decades, the NHL approved franchise relocations; <b>the</b> <b>Scouts</b> moved after just two years in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies, while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons. Two years later, after failed overtures about merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver, the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing the NHL to 17 teams for 1978–79.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, the Somali Olympic Committee {{appointed}} {{a team of}} professionals to find talented Somali athletes for the upcoming Summer Olympics.
