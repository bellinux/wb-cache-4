The effect of parental presence during competition was studied {{as was the}} role of parenting practices. Data were collected from a sample of 341 athletes (201 basketball <b>players</b> and 140 <b>tennis</b> <b>players)</b> before an official competition. Analysis of variance indicated {{that the presence of}} both parents was associated with higher levels of pre-competitive anxiety for all participants, except male <b>tennis</b> <b>players.</b> The absence of both parents did not result in lower levels of anxiety. A second set of variance analysis revealed that girl <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> at provincial and national level perceived higher levels of parental pressure than most other participants. Canonical correlation analysis showed a positive relationship between pre-competitive anxiety and parenting practices for <b>tennis</b> <b>players,</b> but not for basketball players.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to analyze}} the portrayal of women <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> within tabloid print media during the time period of the Wimbledon grand slam from the past five years. A grounded theory analysis was conducted of the tabloid newspapers, The Daily Mail and The Sun. A secondary data collection method was implemented which was a focus group discussion with 5 amateur <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> to elicit {{their views on the}} representation of women <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> in the print media. It is apparent from the findings of this dissertation that the print media in relation to tennis still portrays a predominantly negative perception of women’s tennis do to the essentialist perceptions of femininity within society. The representations of women <b>tennis</b> <b>player’s</b> is focused on the clothes they wear and how they look rather than their performance on court. Additionally, we will see that amateur <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> are very aware of the negative depictions of women <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> within print media...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to fi nd a trend of changes for {{selected}} anthropometric characteristics and motor abilities of young male and female <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> of three different age groups. Trends were observed in the periods between 1992, 2000 and 2008. In addition, a comparison of results of <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> and school pupils was included. The sample of subjects were selections of young <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> and of primary and secondary schools pupils (boys and girls) divided into three age groups (12 - to 13 -year-olds, 14 - to 15 -year-olds, and 16 - to 17 -year-olds). Fitness tests items (backwards obstacle course, forward bend on the bench, 20 -second hand-tapping, 60 -second sit-ups) and three anthropometric measurements (body height, body weight, BMI) were included in this study. The analysis of trends for different periods of measurement in male and female <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> revealed an increase in some test items and a decrease in others. In the majority of observed fi tness test items, young <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> performed better than their school peers, indicating the positive effects of training and an appropriate selection process of <b>tennis</b> <b>players.</b> Male and female <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> were taller than the school pupils, and body height values in both groups increased from 1992 to 2008.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} differences between elite athletes and <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> in order to provide a clearer picture regarding the energy demands in modern tennis. Forty-eight (48) athletes and 24 <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> from Croatian national leagues were compared in morphological and physiological parameters of an all-out incremental treadmill test with gas exchange measurements. Tennis players’ HRmax (192. 96 ± 7. 75 bpm) shows values that are most different to 400 -meters sprinters (200. 13 ± 6. 95 bpm). Maximum running speed of <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> on the treadmill (vmax) is no different with the speed achieved by sprinters, while there are significant differences among other athletes. Values in running speed at anaerobic threshold (vAnT) show no statistically significant difference with the values for athlete sprinters and 400 -m sprinters. Values of RvO 2 max for <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> indicate significant similarities with athlete sprinters and 400 -m sprinters while the values of RvO 2 AnT are nearly identical with the values for sprinters and show no statistically significant differences (p< 0. 05). The results indicate that values achieved by <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> approximate most different those of the middle and long distance runners. This singles out the possible importance of the anaerobic capacity and the high level of sprint endurance in <b>tennis</b> <b>players.</b> Knowing these characteristics is the basis for planning and implementing training systems that will enable the increase and optimal usage of energy capacities of <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> in possibly improving sports results...|$|R

40|$|Objectives in this study, the {{hypothesis}} that <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> with scapular dyskinesia present a smaller subacromial space than non-athletes was investigated. Additionally, {{the correlation between the}} size of the subacromial space and abnormalities in scapular movement during arm abduction was studied. Design Cross-sectional study. Participants A total of 53 elite <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> and 20 control participants were enrolled in the study. Participation was restricted to elite-level, junior <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> who had no current shoulder pain or history of shoulder injuries. Intervention Each individual was examined for scapular dyskinesia by a single physician and by ultrasound, with the results analysed in a blind fashion by a single radiologist. Results 43. 4 % of the <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> and 20 % of control participants presented with scapular dyskinesia. of the 106 shoulders evaluated, 39. 6 % of <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> and 10 % of control participants presented with scapular dyskinesia in the clinical examination (p = 0. 005). Ultrasonographic measurements demonstrated that <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> presented statistically smaller subacromial spaces compared with control participants (p< 0. 001). A decrease in the subacromial space was observed in <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> when the shoulder was raised from 0 degrees to 60 degrees of abduction; however, dyskinesia-afflicted athletes demonstrated a significantly greater decrease following this movement (19. 3 vs 13. 8 mm, p = 0. 002). Conclusions {{the results of this study}} demonstrated that <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> with scapular dyskinesia present a smaller subacromial space than control participants. Furthermore, when the shoulder was analysed dynamically, moving from neutral abduction to 60 degrees of elevation, the <b>tennis</b> <b>players</b> with scapular dyskinesia presented a greater reduction in the subacromial space compared with unaffected athletes.
