It gave the film three out of five. TIME gave the film a C-, stating that the film [...] "cannibalizes Walt's vault for jokes" [...] and [...] "fails to find a happy ending that doesn't feel two-dimensional". Similarly, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian commented that the film [...] "assumes a beady-eyed and deeply humourless sentimentality" [...] and that Adams' performance was the [...] "only decent <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> overhyped family movie covered in a cellophane shrink-wrap of corporate Disney plastic-ness".

500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the script, Arndt {{read in a}} {{newspaper}} about Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking {{to a group of}} high school students and saying [...] "If there's one <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world I hate, it's losers. I despise them." [...] As a result, Arndt developed his script lampooning the thought process: [...] "And I thought there's something so wrong with that attitude... I wanted to... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down... So to a degree a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through." [...] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: [...] "As far as the pageant goes, it was very important to us that the film not be about pageants. It's about being out of place, it's about not knowing where you're going to end up..." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoeft, who won 20games for the Tigers in 1956, had {{continually}} under-performed since, and {{was noted}} {{for being in}} the manager's [...] "doghouse"; however, TimesDaily sportswriter Hap Halbrooks commented, [...] "I can't see where they (Tigers) gained a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> transaction." [...] The Tigers had lost 15 of their first 17games of the season before the trade and decided that changes were needed. In addition to the Sisler trade they fired manager Bill Norman and replaced him with Jimmy Dykes. These moves initially proved effective, sparking a winning game streak, which began by defeating the Yankees in both games of a doubleheader on May3. Continuing their rebound, the Tigers faced the Red Sox next, winning two of three, and Sisler pitched a scoreless one-inning relief appearance against his former team on May6. Used exclusively in relief, Sisler pitched in 32games for the Tigers, winning one game against three losses and collected seven saves, which was seventh most in the AL, {{and he did not}} record an error.|$|E

500|$|The first {{critical}} review of Very's book {{was written by}} Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review; it said Very's poems had [...] "an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the [...] "sing song" [...] style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: [...] "I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known." [...] James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the Western Messenger, between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity [...] "is only superficial". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: [...] "The thought is deeply spiritual; and {{while there is a}} certain character of peculiarity which we so often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, I know not where you would... find any <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country to compare with these Sonnets." ...|$|E

2500|$|The unnamed {{reviewer}} in The Observer (7 September 1924) wrote: [...] "Miss Christie {{has done}} one bold and one regrettable <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> book. She has dispensed with Hercule Poirot, her own particular Sherlock Holmes, to whose presence and bonhomie and infallibility {{the success of}} her previous books has been mainly due." [...] After comparing Poirot with Harry Rayburn, the reviewer continued {{by saying that the}} book, [...] "will be something of a disappointment to those who remember The Mysterious Affair at Styles. It is an excellent and ingenious complexity, in its way, but it might have been written by quite a number of the busy climbers of who now throng this particular slope of Parnassus. One almost suspects that Miss Christie contemplates exchanging the mantle of Conan Doyle for that of Miss Dell; a hazardous manoeuvre, for the two authoresses are very different in tastes and sympathies." [...] The reviewer went on to say that, [...] "The plan of the book is rather confused. There is a prologue which does not link itself up {{with the rest of the}} story for quite a long time; and the idea of giving alternate passages from the diaries of the heroine and of Sir Eustace Pedler is not altogether justified by the glimpses it gives of that entertaining but disreputable character. One of the points on which some readers will have doubts is as to the plausibility of the villain: assuredly he is a novel type in that role. The book, like all Miss Christie's work, is written with spirit and humour." ...|$|E
