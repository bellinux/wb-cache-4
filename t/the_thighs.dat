5|$|The skin of E. rabborum was {{granular}} in {{texture and}} predominantly a mottled brown. The upper {{surfaces of the}} limbs was also mottled brown while the rear surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>thighs</b> were a pale yellow. The chin and upper chest was distinctively brown, though {{the rest of the}} underside of the body was mostly white speckled with irregular brown spots. The eyelids and upper surfaces of the limbs and back were studded with green flecks, the appearance and positions of which could be changed by the animal voluntarily (metachrosis). The irises of the eyes was uniformly reddish brown.|$|E
5|$|The Limousin {{is a large}} framed {{breed of}} beef cattle with a bright wheat-coloured coat, not too dark, a little lighter on the belly, the rear of <b>the</b> <b>thighs,</b> between the legs, on the anus, around the {{testicles}} or udder, and the tail tip. Absence of any spots or pigmentation, with pink mucous membranes. Short head, broad forehead and muzzle, lighter area around the eyes and muzzle, fine horns curved forward and slightly raised at the tip (if present). Short neck. Chest broad and rounded. Side round. Pelvis wide, especially at the pin bones, not too inclined. Bones of lower back and hips slightly protruding. Forequarter well-muscled, wide above and very muscular. Hindquarters thick, deep and rounded. Horns and hooves lighter coloured. Correct limbs. Fine supple hide.|$|E
5|$|The {{count of}} dorsal scales, from axilla (armpit) to groin, averages 32 {{with a range}} of 30 to 35. The ventral count from axilla to groin along the midventral line averages 28 scales and ranges from 26 to 29. The scales around the midbody average {{approximately}} 52 and range from 50 to 55. There are two postnasals and one to three (usually two) internasal scales. There are two to three (usually three) scales from the upper lip to the eye (upper labials). On the fourth toe of the right foot, there are eight or nine (usually eight) lamellae, or plate-like scales that provide traction for geckos. The escutcheons (scales around the genital region) are relatively small and only slightly extend onto <b>the</b> <b>thighs,</b> varying from three to five scales in length and 11 to 13 scales in width.|$|E

5|$|The neck had at {{each side}} {{two rows of}} large scutes. The osteoderms of the lower neck row were very large, flat and plate-like. The first osteoderms of the top neck rows formed a pair of unique three-pointed scutes {{directly}} behind the head. These points {{seem to have been}} connected by tendons to the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses, of the axis vertebra. In general the scutes were larger {{at the front of the}} torso, the osteoderms diminishing towards the rear, especially on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>thighs.</b> The smallest flat round scutes might have filled the room between the larger osteoderm rows. Perhaps a row of vertical osteoderms was present on the upper arms. Compared to the later Ankylosauria, Scelidosaurus was lightly armoured, without continuous plating, spikes or pelvic shield. Rough areas on the skull and lower jaws indicate the presence of skin ossifications.|$|E
25|$|A common {{technique}} {{used in many}} undeveloped nations involves holding the child by the backs of <b>the</b> <b>thighs,</b> above the ground, facing outward, in order to urinate.|$|E
25|$|The main {{symptom of}} {{dysmenorrhea}} is pain {{concentrated in the}} lower abdomen or pelvis. It is also commonly felt in the right or {{left side of the}} abdomen. It may radiate to <b>the</b> <b>thighs</b> and lower back.|$|E
50|$|The deep artery of <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> {{branches}} off <b>the</b> {{femoral artery}} soon after its origin. It travels down <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> closer to <b>the</b> femur than the femoral artery, running between the pectineus and the adductor longus, and {{running on the}} posterior side of adductor longus. The deep femoral artery does not leave <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The fascial {{compartments}} of <b>thigh</b> are <b>the</b> three fascial compartments {{that divide}} and contain <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> muscles. <b>The</b> fascia lata is the strong and deep fascia of <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> that surrounds <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> muscles and forms {{the outer limits}} of the compartments. Internally the muscle compartments are divided by the lateral and medial intermuscular septa.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, {{with the}} hip flexed, the gluteus medius and minimus {{internally}} rotate <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b> With <b>the</b> hip extended, the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus internally rotate <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{military}} tunic {{is a type}} {{of medium}} length coat or jacket, the lower hem of which reaches down to <b>the</b> <b>thighs</b> all the way round. It is named after the tunic, a garment of similar length worn in Ancient Rome.|$|E
25|$|As {{subcutaneous}} fat accumulates, dimpling, or cellulite, becomes more apparent on <b>the</b> <b>thighs</b> and buttocks. Stretch marks (striae distensae) may {{appear on the}} skin in these areas. Susceptibility to sunburn increases, possibly because the skin is thinner and less pigmented.|$|E
25|$|Pubic hair is body hair {{found in}} the genital area of {{adolescent}} and adult humans, located on and around the sex organs, the crotch, and sometimes {{at the top of}} the inside of <b>the</b> <b>thighs,</b> in the pubic region around the pubis bone.|$|E
50|$|The lateral {{cutaneous}} nerve of <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> (also called <b>the</b> lateral femoral cutaneous nerve) is a cutaneous nerve that innervates {{the skin}} on the lateral part of <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b>|$|R

25|$|Bipedalism {{requires}} strong leg muscles, {{particularly in}} <b>the</b> <b>thighs.</b> Contrast in domesticated poultry the well muscled legs, against {{the small and}} bony wings. Likewise in humans, the quadriceps and hamstring muscles of the thigh are both so crucial to bipedal activities that each alone is {{much larger than the}} well-developed biceps of the arms.|$|E
25|$|The fusion really worked, {{and after}} two days of intense rehearsals we had an amazingly tight piece, {{although}} we had problems with twenty dancers being covered in bruises! In order to get the attitude across and the intensity with the choreography they really had to slap each other. We had to change the styling to hide all the bruises, particularly on <b>the</b> <b>thighs.</b>|$|E
25|$|As a {{military}} term, the word quijote refers to cuisses, {{part of a}} full suit of plate armour protecting <b>the</b> <b>thighs.</b> The Spanish suffix -ote denotes the augmentative—for example, grande means large, but grandote means extra large. Following this example, Quixote would suggest 'The Great Quijano', a play on words that makes much sense {{in light of the}} character's delusions of grandeur.|$|E
5000|$|The semitendinosus (...) {{is a long}} {{superficial}} {{muscle in}} the back of <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b> It is so named because it has a very long tendon of insertion. It lies posteromedially in <b>the</b> <b>thigh,</b> superficial to <b>the</b> semimembranosus.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main part}} {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> and leg {{consists}} of numerous filaments derived {{from both sides of the}} nerve, and distributed to the skin covering the back and medial side of <b>the</b> <b>thigh,</b> <b>the</b> popliteal fossa, and the upper part of the back of the leg.|$|R

25|$|The figurine {{is roughly}} biconical. Typical of other venus figures, the {{feminine}} features are overemphasized: <b>the</b> <b>thighs</b> and hips are large while the belly, breasts and buttocks are protruding. The head is a cone, the arms are barely sketched, {{and there are}} no hands, feet, or shoulders at all. The back is concave. In some points a few traces of red ochre paint are still visible.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of postural changes, the growing baby, unstable pelvic joints {{under the influence}} of pregnancy hormones, and changes in the centre of gravity can all add to the varying degrees of pain or discomfort. In some cases it can come on suddenly or following a fall, sudden abduction of <b>the</b> <b>thighs</b> (opening too wide too quickly) or an action that has strained the joint.|$|E
25|$|It is {{advised to}} {{maintain}} a degree of muscle tension in this asana. Moderate tension in <b>the</b> <b>thighs</b> and hips can help develop positive habits and can increase the musculature in those areas which can help prevent injury. Additionally maintaining a degree of tension requires awareness, which can help prevent injury itself. Though in this asana {{it is unlikely to}} injure one's self, this habit can be beneficial throughout yoga practice.|$|E
50|$|The {{posterior}} cutaneous nerve of <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> (also called <b>the</b> posterior femoral cutaneous nerve) provides innervation to {{the skin}} of the posterior surface of <b>the</b> <b>thigh</b> and leg, as well as {{to the skin}} of the perineum.|$|R
50|$|The deep vein of <b>the</b> <b>thigh,</b> (profunda femoris vein or deep femoral vein) {{is a large}} deep vein in <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b> It {{receives}} {{blood from}} <b>the</b> inner <b>thigh</b> and proceeds superiorly and medially running alongside the profunda femoris artery to join with the femoral vein approximately {{at the level of}} the inferior-most portion of the ischial tuberosity.|$|R
50|$|The {{posterior}} branch pierces the fascia lata, and subdivides into filaments which pass backward {{across the}} lateral and posterior surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>thigh,</b> supplying <b>the</b> {{skin from the}} level of the greater trochanter to the middle of <b>the</b> <b>thigh.</b>|$|R
25|$|When {{dining in}} a {{traditional}} tatami room, sitting upright on the floor is common. In a casual setting, men usually sit with their feet crossed and women sit with both legs to one side. Only men are supposed to sit cross-legged. The formal way of sitting for both sexes is a kneeling style known as seiza. To sit in a seiza position, one kneels {{on the floor with}} legs folded under <b>the</b> <b>thighs</b> and the buttocks resting on the heels.|$|E
25|$|The European jackal is {{the largest}} of the golden jackals, with animals of both sexes {{measuring}} 120–125cm (47–49in) in total length and 10–13kg (20–29lb) in body weight. One adult male in North-Eastern Italy is recorded to have reached 14.9kg (33lb). The fur is coarse, and is generally brightly coloured with blackish tones on the back. <b>The</b> <b>thighs,</b> upper legs, ears and forehead are bright reddish chestnut. Jackals in Northern Dalmatia have broader than average skulls, which is thought to result from human induced isolation from other populations, thus resulting in a new morphotype.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014 the Finnish postal service, Itella Posti, {{published}} {{a set of}} three first class stamps featuring drawings by Laaksonen and {{in association with the}} stamps' release exhibited some of his correspondence at the Finnish Postal Museum. Two of the stamps include portions of an illustration of a nude man sitting between the legs of another man dressed as a police officer; the other depicts nude buttocks with a man's face included between <b>the</b> <b>thighs.</b> The stamp set exceeded Posti's expectations, with pre-orders from 178 countries, making it the best-selling stamp set in the service's history.|$|E
