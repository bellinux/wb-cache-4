5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches lay {{four to six}} bluish-white eggs, {{which are}} oval in shape and about , roughly <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peanut. It is thought that they are laid during the night. The eggs are {{incubated}} by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the hull showed that a piece of coral <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug {{the hole in the}} hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.|$|E

5|$|As {{the half}} eagle {{approximated}} <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{number of foreign}} gold coins, such as the British guinea and the French louis d'or, it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions. DeSaussure {{is believed to have}} struck half eagles first for that reason, after consultation with bank officials. The eagle lacked such equivalents, was too high in value for many transactions, and rapidly became unpopular.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (about <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> half dollar) being {{issued by the}} Mint was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.|$|E
5|$|Changyuraptor yangi {{is a close}} {{relative}} of Microraptor gui, also {{thought to be a}} glider or flyer based on the presence of four wings and similar limb proportions.

5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph about <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E
5|$|Divers are aquatic birds <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large duck, {{to which}} they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|Halley {{may have}} been {{recorded}} as early as 467BC, but this is uncertain. A comet was recorded in ancient Greece between 468 and 466 BC; its timing, location, duration, and associated meteor shower all suggest it was Halley. According to Pliny the Elder, that same year a meteorite fell {{in the town of}} Aegospotami, in Thrace. He described it as brown in colour and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wagon load. Chinese chroniclers also mention a comet in that year.|$|E

40|$|We present {{efficient}} algorithms {{for generating}} all maximal and all maximum independent sets <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interval graph and a circular- arc graph.

It was reportedly <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> horse, with a spotted body covered in scales. Opinion on the creature's origin was divided, with some islanders believing it to be a sea serpent, while others opined that it was merely a large seal.|$|E
5|$|In {{automatic}} test pattern generation, finding cliques {{can help to}} bound <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> test set. In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms {{have been used to}} infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an important step in the analysis of certain random processes. In mathematics, Keller's conjecture on face-to-face tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} this scheme to be accurate, the time step must {{be large enough}} to cause the curve to move by at least one pixel even at points of low curvature, but small enough to cause the radius of {{blurring}} to be less than the minimum radius of curvature. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pixel must be , small enough to allow a suitable intermediate time step to be chosen.|$|E

50|$|Body wave {{magnitude}} ('''''') is <b>a</b> way <b>of</b> determining <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> earthquake, using <b>the</b> {{amplitude of}} the initial P-wave to calculate the magnitude. The P-wave is <b>a</b> type <b>of</b> body wave {{that is capable of}} traveling through the earth at <b>a</b> velocity <b>of</b> around 5 to 8 km/s, and is the first wave from an earthquake to reach <b>a</b> seismometer.

5|$|In the 1990s, Burney, who was {{studying}} recent extinctions in Madagascar, collected tales about a creature called the kilopilopitsofy {{that had been}} described by villagers {{in the town of}} Belo-sur-mer, a small fishing village on the west coast. Several villagers independently described an animal that, as recently as 1976, had entered their village, was <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cow, was dark pigmented, grunted a lot, and when threatened, fled underwater. No known animal on Madagascar fits the description but the animal seemed remarkably like a hippopotamus.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was {{exceptional}} {{because he}} played point guard despite being 6ft 9in (2.06m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players. He combined <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, {{and the ball}} handling talent of a guard, making {{him one of the}} most dangerous triple-double threats of all time; his 138triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 181. Johnson is the only player in NBA Finals history to have triple-doubles in multiple series-clinching games.|$|E
