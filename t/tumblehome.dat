5|$|Iéna was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy. The ship's keel {{was laid}} in 1898 {{and she was}} completed four years later. Her design {{was derived from the}} preceding s with a heavier secondary battery and thicker armour. She retained the <b>tumblehome</b> characteristic of all large French warships of this period that caused stability issues. Upon completion Iena was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and remained there for the duration of her career. She participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers and made many visits to French ports in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The Charlemagne-class ships did not {{function}} {{well in a}} head sea. Stormy weather in the Bay of Biscay in 1900 caused the captain of Gaulois to complain that the ship's forward gun turret and casemates were flooded out and that the ship generated enormous sheets of spray when water came over the bow. Like most French capital ships of the period, they had pronounced <b>tumblehome.</b> Gauloiss captain also said that his ship was a steady gunnery platform and manoeuvered well in tight spaces but he criticized the armour layout as not high enough to prevent munitions from penetrating above the main armour belt and detonating below the secondary armament positions.|$|E
25|$|Netley {{was built}} to a design by Sir Samuel Bentham. She was a {{modified}} and somewhat enlarged version of , which was a somewhat smaller version of his Dart-class vessels. Bentham's designs featured little sheer, negative <b>tumblehome,</b> a large-breadth to length ratio with structural bulkheads, and sliding keels. They were also virtually double-ended.|$|E
25|$|Najaden had a slab-sided {{hull and}} the typical Hohlenberg pinkie stern, with {{a place for}} two stern chaser guns. Gardiner {{suggests}} that the pinkie stern and increased <b>tumblehome</b> towards the stern permitted the vessel to fire over the quarters. Naval warfare in the Baltic made extensive use of oared gunboats, which would fire on becalmed vessels from the quarter, an angle that normally broadside guns could not cover. The pinkie stern was unpopular with the British, who removed it when they refitted her.|$|E
25|$|Willis {{considered}} that The Tweeds bow shape {{was responsible for}} its notable performance, and this form {{seems to have been}} adopted for Cutty Sark. Linton, however, felt that the stern was too barrel shaped and so gave Cutty Sark a squarer stern with less <b>tumblehome.</b> The broader stern increased the buoyancy of the ship's stern, making it lift more in heavy seas so it was less likely that waves would break over the stern, and over the helmsman at the wheel. The square bilge was carried forward through the centre of the ship. In the matter of masts Cutty Sark also followed the design of The Tweed, with similar good rake and with the foremast on both ships being placed further aft than was usual.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005, {{the program}} entered the {{detailed}} design and integration phase, for which Raytheon is the Mission Systems Integrator. Both Northrop Grumman Ship Systems and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works share dual-lead for the hull, mechanical, and electrical detailed design. BAE Systems Inc. has the advanced gun {{system and the}} MK57 VLS. Almost every major defense contractor (including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Sperry Marine, L-3 Communications) and subcontractors from nearly {{every state in the}} U.S. are involved to some extent in this project, which is the largest single line item in the Navy's budget. During the previous contract, development and testing of 11 Engineering Development Models (EDMs) took place: Advanced Gun System, Autonomic Fire Suppression System, Dual Band Radar , Infrared, Integrated Deckhouse & Apertures, Integrated Power System, Integrated Undersea Warfare, Peripheral Vertical Launch System, Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI), <b>Tumblehome</b> Hull Form.|$|E
500|$|Rossia was [...] long overall. She had {{a maximum}} beam of [...] and a draught of [...] She {{displaced}} , only [...] more than designed. Rossia was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce fouling. She {{was considered to}} be a good sea boat with a smooth rollattributable to her <b>tumblehome</b> sides.|$|E
500|$|Outwardly, {{the biggest}} change was in the {{appearance}} of the Borodinos from the original Tsesarevich design. [...] Skvortsov added two more casemates, each containing four [...] guns, one at the bow and the other aft. This was added to the already existing dozen 75mm guns emplaced along the sides above the armor belt. [...] This caused the <b>tumblehome</b> used {{on the rest of the}} hull to be deleted over the twelve guns, and flat-sided armor was used in its place. Thus the five Borodino-class battleships only had <b>tumblehome</b> hulls fore and aft of their 75mm guns emplaced along their sides. The centreline bulkhead between the engine and boiler rooms caused a danger of capsizing if one side flooded and their narrow belt armor became submerged when overloaded. As such, naval historian Antony Preston regarded these as some of the worst battleships ever built.|$|E
500|$|The Petropavlovsk-class {{ships were}} [...] long overall, had {{a beam of}} [...] and a draft of [...] Designed to {{displace}} , they were [...] overweight and actually displaced [...] The ships were the first flush-decked battleships built for the Navy. They had a partial double bottom and the hull was divided by 10 watertight transverse bulkheads; a centerline bulkhead divided the machinery spaces. The {{upper part of the}} hull between the main and upper decks curved inwards (<b>tumblehome),</b> although the <b>tumblehome</b> on these ships was much less pronounced than that found on French battleships of the time, which began curving inwards at the waterline. They had a designed metacentric height of [...] and were good seagoing ships. Their crew consisted of 26–27 officers and 605–25 enlisted men; Petropavlovsk had a crew of 750 when serving as a flagship.|$|E
500|$|République and Patrie were {{authorized}} in the Fleet Law of 1900, {{which also}} called for four additional battleships, which were to be the similar [...] The new battleship design corrected many of the defects in earlier battleships, which was accomplished through increases in the displacement and beam. They also had a significantly reduced <b>tumblehome</b> compared to earlier French battleships.|$|E
500|$|Rossias main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four [...] 45-caliber Pattern 1892 guns, one {{at each end}} of the ship on each side, sponsoned out over the <b>tumblehome</b> of the ship's sides. They were protected by gun shields. The guns could be depressed to −5° and elevated to 18°. They fired [...] projectiles at a muzzle velocity of [...] which gave a range of [...] at 13° elevation.|$|E
500|$|As built, Galena was [...] long between perpendiculars and [...] long overall. She had {{a beam of}} , a {{depth of}} hold of , and a draft of [...] The ship {{displaced}} [...] and had 738 tons burthen. The number of masts was reduced to two {{and the amount of}} <b>tumblehome</b> greatly increased. Her crew numbered 150 officers and enlisted men. On her only ocean voyage in her original configuration, Galena rolled heavily.|$|E
500|$|Iéna was {{designed}} {{at the request}} of the Board of Construction (...) to follow the Charlemagne-class ships, whose seakeeping qualities were not entirely satisfactory. But Constructor Thibaudier just modified the Charlemagnes design with a heavier secondary battery and thicker armour, distributed in a slightly different manner. This increased her displacement by [...] in comparison to the older ships and she retained the pronounced <b>tumblehome</b> that was the cause of the stability problems.|$|E
500|$|The entire ship's {{side was}} {{protected}} with wrought-iron armor 4.5 inches thick that reduced to [...] beginning [...] from the ship's ends. It {{was backed by}} [...] of teak and extended [...] below the waterline. The ship's hull was divided by six watertight transverse and two longitudinal bulkheads for protection against underwater damage. The hull had a <b>tumblehome</b> of 27° to help deflect shells. The open-topped conning tower was also protected by 4.5 inches of armor.|$|E
500|$|Her {{secondary}} armament {{consisted of}} two [...] Canon de 274 mm Modèle 1887 guns in two single-gun turrets, one amidships on each side, sponsoned out over the <b>tumblehome</b> of the ship's sides. Eight 45-calibre 138mm Canon de 138.6 mm Modèle 1891 guns were mounted in manually operated twin turrets {{at the corners of}} the superstructure with 160° arcs of fire. The guns could depress to -10° and elevate to +25°. They fired [...] armour-piercing shells at a muzzle velocity of [...] which gave a range of [...] at maximum elevation. Their rate of fire was about 4 rounds per minute.|$|E
500|$|The first {{design for}} Petropavlovsk {{and her sister}} ships of the [...] was {{approved}} in January 1891. She was to be an improved version of the battleship , but with most of her armament in barbettes, including four [...] guns. The class was designed with a displacement of [...] at full load. She had a full waterline belt, and the upper hull featured a <b>tumblehome.</b> Imperator Nikolai I was chosen {{as a starting point}} for the design because of her good seakeeping and seaworthiness. Some characteristics were copied from the [...] and the American s, such as the flush-deck hull and Brennus high freeboard.|$|E
500|$|Tsesarevichs {{most obvious}} design feature was her <b>tumblehome</b> hull. This had several {{advantages}} because it allowed greater freeboard since the narrow upper decks reduced the structural {{weight of the}} vessel's hull, it increased the field of fire of guns mounted on the sides, and it reduced the ship's roll in heavy seas. Its great disadvantage was that it reduced buoyancy and stability which contributed to excessive heel during turns. [...] During the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, Imperial Japanese Navy observers thought the Tsesarevich was going to capsize when she suddenly turned out of the battleline.|$|E
500|$|Ne Tron Menia was [...] long overall, with {{a beam of}} [...] and a {{designed}} {{draft of}} [...] She displaced [...] and her iron hull had a pronounced <b>tumblehome.</b> She was fitted with large rams at bow and stern; the stern ram also serving to protect her rudder and propeller. The ship did not steer well and had [...] "an unpredictable habit of suddenly lurching to one side or another", probably {{as a result of}} poor water flow to the rudder. Ne Tron Menia required six men to man her wheel and her total crew numbered 459 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
500|$|Carnots main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1887 guns in two single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. She also mounted two Canon de 274 mm Modèle 1887 guns in two single-gun turrets, one amidships on each side, sponsoned out over the <b>tumblehome</b> of the ship's sides. Her secondary armament consisted of eight Canon de 138.6 mm Modèle 1888 guns, which were mounted in single turrets {{at the corners of}} the superstructure. She also carried four [...] quick-firing guns, twelve 3-pounders, and eight 1-pounder revolving cannons. Her armament suite was rounded out by two [...] torpedo tubes, which were submerged in the ship's hull.|$|E
500|$|The first {{design for}} Sevastopol {{and her sister}} ships of the [...] was {{approved}} in January 1891. She was to be an improved version of the battleship , but with most of her armament in barbettes, including four [...] guns. The class was designed with a displacement of [...] at full load. She had a full waterline belt, and the upper hull featured a <b>tumblehome.</b> Imperator Nikolai I was chosen {{as a starting point}} for the design because of her good seakeeping and seaworthiness. Some characteristics were also copied from the [...] and the American s, such as the flush-deck hull and Brennus high freeboard.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Pervenets, the ship's <b>tumblehome</b> of 27°, {{intended}} to deflect shells, began above the waterline so the narrow vertical strake of wrought iron armor at the waterline was increased to a thickness of [...] in compensation for its reduced protective abilities. The {{rest of the}} ship's side was protected with 4.5 inches of armor that reduced to [...] beginning [...] from the ship's ends. It backed by [...] of teak and extended [...] below the waterline. The ship's hull was divided by six watertight transverse and two longitudinal bulkheads for protection against underwater damage. The open-topped conning tower was also protected by 4.5 inches of armor.|$|E
500|$|The Charles Martel {{group of}} battleships all {{shared the same}} layout for their main and {{secondary}} armament—a design that minimised the cramped upper decks produced by the pronounced <b>tumblehome</b> favoured by French designers, and capitalised on the bulging sides of the vessels. The bow and stern turrets had only a single gun and were placed uncomfortably close to the extremities of the ship in Jauréguiberry because she was some [...] shorter than the other ships in the group. The single turrets of the secondary armament were mounted on the ship's beam, while the [...] guns were mounted in four twin turrets sited symmetrically behind and outboard of the main gun turrets.|$|E
500|$|Design {{work for}} the Petropavlovsk class began as an {{enlarged}} and improved version of the battleship , but with her main armament of four [...] guns mounted in barbettes. Based on experience with [...] in which the casemate-mounted secondary armament could often not be worked in rough weather, the Naval Technical Committee adopted {{the layout of the}} American s with the secondary armament of [...] guns mounted in turrets on the upper deck. Use of the lighter barbette mounting allowed for a flush-deck hull which gave the ship high freeboard. The class was designed with a displacement of , a full-length waterline armor belt, and the upper hull featured a modest amount of <b>tumblehome.</b> It was approved in January 1891.|$|E
500|$|Bouvets main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. She also mounted two Canon de 274 mm Modèle 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one amidships on each side, sponsoned out over the <b>tumblehome</b> of the ship's sides. Her secondary armament consisted of eight Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1893 naval guns, which were mounted in single turrets {{at the corners of}} the superstructure. She also carried eight [...] quick-firing guns, twelve 3-pounders, and eight 1-pounder guns. Her armament suite was rounded out by four [...] torpedo tubes, two of which were submerged in the ship's hull. The other two tubes were mounted above water, though these were later removed.|$|E
500|$|The Mary Rose {{was built}} {{according}} to the carrack-style with high [...] "castles" [...] in the bow and stern with a low waist of open decking in the middle. The shape of the hull has a so-called <b>tumblehome</b> form and reflected {{the use of the}} ship as a platform for heavy guns. Above the waterline, the hull gradually narrows to compensate for the weight of the guns and to make boarding more difficult. Since only part of the hull has survived, {{it is not possible to}} determine many of the basic dimensions with any great accuracy. The moulded breadth, the widest point of the ship roughly above the waterline, was about 12 metres (39ft) and the keel about 32 metres (105ft), although the ship's overall length is uncertain.|$|E
500|$|The ship's {{secondary}} armament {{consisted of}} ten 45-calibre Canon de 164 mm Modèle 1893 guns. Six {{of these were}} carried in single turrets {{on each side of}} the superstructure and the remaining four were mounted in individual casemates below them on the 1st Deck. The casemates were sponsoned out over the <b>tumblehome</b> of the sides. The guns fired [...] shells at a muzzle velocity of [...] to a maximum range of [...] Their theoretical rate of fire was between two and three rounds per minute. She carried 1906 shells for these guns. Suffren also carried eight 45-calibre Canon de 100 mm Modèle 1893 guns in shielded mounts on the shelter deck and on the superstructure. These guns fired a [...] projectile at , which could be trained up to 20° for a maximum range of [...] Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was six rounds per minute, but only three rounds per minute sustained. The ship carried 2264 shells for these guns.|$|E
500|$|Massénas main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. Each turret had an arc of fire of 250°. The placement of the forward gun turret close to the bow placed {{a great deal of}} weight too far forward. This exacerbated stability problems with the ship, and rendered accurate shooting more difficult. She also mounted two Canon de 274 mm Modèle 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one amidships on each side, sponsoned out over the <b>tumblehome</b> of the ship's sides. Her secondary armament consisted of eight Canon de 138.6 mm Modèle 1891 guns, which were mounted in manually operated single turrets at the corners of the superstructure with 160° arcs of fire. She also carried eight [...] quick-firing guns, twelve 3-pounder quick-firers, and eight 1-pounder guns. Her armament suite was rounded out by four [...] torpedo tubes, two of which were submerged in the ship's hull.|$|E
500|$|The main {{armament}} of the Imperator Aleksandr II-class ships {{was a pair}} of [...] Obukhov Model 1877 30-caliber [...] guns. Imperator Nikolai I carried hers in a twin-gun turret forward. The four [...] Obukhov Model 1877 35-caliber {{guns were}} on center-pivot mounts in casemates at the corners of the citadel, the hull given a pronounced <b>tumblehome</b> to increase their arcs of fire ahead and behind. The eight [...] Model 1877 35-caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts. Four were fitted between the 9-inch guns and could traverse a total of 100°. The others were mounted {{at each end of the}} ship where they could fire directly ahead or astern. The ten [...] Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in hull embrasures of the ship, between the nine and six-inch guns to defend against torpedo boats. Four [...] Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in each fighting top. Imperator Nikolai I carried six above-water [...] torpedo tubes. One was in the bow, two tubes were on each broadside and a tube was in the stern.|$|E
500|$|Ne Tron Menia, Touch Me Not (from {{the biblical}} Latin phrase Noli me tangere which appears in [...] ), was ordered on 31 May 1862 when a {{contract}} was {{signed with the}} British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell. The total price of the ship was 923,500 rubles. The state-owned Galerniy Island Shipyard in Saint Petersburg was leased to Mitchell and the Naval Ministry agreed to upgrade the facilities to handle iron-hulled, ironclad warships. The {{construction of a new}} slipway large enough to handle the ship delayed the start of construction until 30 January 1863 and the delay allowed the design to be modified to handle larger and more powerful eight-inch rifles about to enter service. These guns required more room to operate than the older, ineffectual smoothbore guns, so the main deck was slightly widened by raising {{the point at which the}} hull's <b>tumblehome</b> began. Based on the experiences with her sister, bilge keels [...] deep and [...] were fitted to reduce the ship's rolling. Ne Tron Menia was not formally laid down until 1 December 1863 and she was launched on 23 June 1864.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stability}} of the DDG-1000 hull design in heavy seas has {{been a matter of}} controversy. In April 2007, naval architect Ken Brower said, [...] "As a ship pitches and heaves at sea, if you have <b>tumblehome</b> instead of a flare, you have no righting energy to make the ship come back up. On the DDG 1000, with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern comes out of the water – and basically, roll over." [...] The decision to not use a <b>tumblehome</b> hull in the CG(X) cruiser, before the program was canceled, may suggest that there were concerns regarding Zumwalts seakeeping. However, in a 1/4 scale test of the hull design, named Sea Jet, the <b>tumblehome</b> hull proved seaworthy.|$|E
2500|$|The older CIÉ stock {{comprised}} {{a variety}} of designs, built to two distinct profiles. [...] The carriages built in the early 1950s had a narrower, more vertical profile with a small <b>tumblehome</b> {{similar to that used}} by Edgar Bredin of the Great Southern Railways for its steel panelled coaches. [...] The carriages built {{from the end of the}} 1950s had a wider profile with a more pronounced <b>tumblehome.</b> Like the [...] "Bredins", they were wooden framed and steel panelled.|$|E
2500|$|The Zumwalt-class {{destroyer}} reintroduces the <b>tumblehome</b> {{hull form}}, a hull form not seen {{to this extent}} since the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. It was originally put forth in modern steel battleship designs by the French shipyard Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne, Toulon. French naval architects believed that <b>tumblehome,</b> in which the beam of the vessel narrowed from the waterline to the upper deck, would create better freeboard, greater seaworthiness, and, as Russian battleships were to find, would be ideal for navigating through narrow constraints (e.g. canals). On the downside, the <b>tumblehome</b> battleships leaked and could be unstable, especially when turning at high speed. The <b>tumblehome</b> has been reintroduced {{in the 21st century}} to reduce the radar return of the hull. The inverted bow is designed to cut through waves rather than ride over them. The stability of this hull form in high sea states has caused debate among naval architects, with some charging that [...] "with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern comes out of the water—and basically roll over." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lahloo was of {{the same}} class and {{sharpness}} as Ariel, [...] "with more deadrise and <b>tumblehome</b> and a slightly fuller run." [...] She was designed by William Steele, had a composite hull, and carried Cunningham's roller-reefing topsails.|$|E
2500|$|Hobbs & Hellyer built six {{vessels to}} Bentham's design. Milbrook was [...] a {{somewhat}} smaller {{version of his}} Dart-class vessels ( [...] and [...] ), and of another schooner, [...] Bentham's designs featured little sheer, negative <b>tumblehome,</b> a large-breadth to length ratio with structural bulkheads, and sliding keels. They were also virtually double-ended.|$|E
2500|$|Despite being 40% {{larger than}} an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the radar {{cross-section}} is {{more akin to}} that of a fishing boat, according to a spokesman for Naval Sea Systems Command. The <b>tumblehome</b> hull and composite deckhouse reduce radar return. Overall, the destroyer's angular build makes it [...] "50 times harder to spot on radar than an ordinary destroyer." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{concerns}} {{began to}} grow about the stability of Zumwalts hull. [...] Naval architect Ken Brower said in April 2007 that [...] "as a ship pitches and heaves at sea, if you have <b>tumblehome</b> instead of flare, you have no righting energy to make the ship come back up. On the , with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern {{comes out of the}} water - and basically roll over." [...] There were also doubts whether the Zumwalt hull was big enough to accommodate ballistic defense weapons, and a possible nuclear propulsion system. In July 2007 came the first suggestions that the AOA might recommend a two-class solution, a 14,000ton [...] "escort cruiser" [...] based on the Zumwalts stealthy [...] "tumblehome" [...] hull, and a ballistic missile defense ship of 23,000tons. The latter would use a more conventional shape than the <b>tumblehome,</b> as its use of radars to search for missiles while on station would make a stealthy hull pointless. In July 2008, Roscoe Bartlett of the House Seapower subcommittee stated that it was [...] "unlikely the [...] hull could be used in the CG(X) program".|$|E
