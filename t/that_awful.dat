Dear old Dot, she's got strong moral views and odd {{religious}} beliefs, but her heart's {{in the right}} place. She has <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> worried {{expression on her face}} the whole time". Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show's inception, saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish, but since her character remarried in 2002, she has gained security and has [...] "no reason to have the hypochondria she had in the past [...] She's become more caring over the years. She enjoys the company of young people. She loves her church. She can get in an anxious state– I like it when Dot's hysterical! She's also amusing, mostly because she doesn't realise she is".|$|E

500|$|With {{his wife}} {{administering}} the campaign organization, Sunday {{was free to}} do what he did best: compose and deliver colloquial sermons. Typically, Homer Rodeheaver would first warm up the crowd with congregational singing that alternated with numbers from gigantic choirs and music performed by the staff. When Sunday felt the moment right, he would launch into his message. Sunday gyrated, stood on the pulpit, ran from one end of the platform to the other, and dove across the stage, pretending to slide into home plate. Sometimes he even smashed chairs to emphasize his points. His sermon notes had to be printed in large letters so that he could catch a glimpse of them as he raced by the pulpit. In messages attacking sexual sin to groups of men only, Sunday could be graphic for the era. A theological opponent, Universalist minister Frederick William Betts, wrote, [...] "Many of the things said and done bordered upon things prohibited in decent society. The sermon on amusements was preached three times, to mixed audience of men and women, boys and girls. If the sermons to women had been preached to married women, if the sermons to men had been preached to mature men, if the sermon on amusements had been preached to grown folks, there might have been an excuse for them, and perhaps good from them. But an experienced newspaper reporter told me that the sermon on amusements was 'the rawest thing ever put over in Syracuse.' I can not, must not, quote from this sermon...", [...] "fainted under <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> definition;", [...] "if you do not 'hit the trail' then watch out for the fireworks"... says that Mr. Sunday's sermon on the sex question was raw and disgusting. He also heard the famous sermons on amusements and booze. [...] says that all in all they were the ugliest, nastiest, most disgusting addresses he ever listened to from a religious platform or a preacher of religion. He saw people carried out who had fainted under <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> definition of sensuality and depravity.|$|E
500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live {{the rest of my life}} with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E

Fin Martin of professional wrestling magazine Power Slam, in a 2013 article, wrote: [...] "Shango and his curses were a total embarrassment. Fans exhaled loudly {{each time he}} appeared on screen. Shango bombed, and deservedly so." [...] Former opponent Bret Hart considered Shango to be possibly the second-worst idea in WWF history, after the Gobbledy Gooker.

She and Dillon set sail on the RMS Olympic under the name Mr and Mrs Dillon and were met at the American port by her sister Alice, who had resided {{in the country for}} many years. Upon arrival, Lloyd and Dillon were refused entry when the {{authorities}} found out that they were not married, as they had claimed when applying for entry visas. They were detained and threatened with deportation on the grounds of moral turpitude and were sent to Ellis Island while an enquiry took place. [...] Dillon was charged under the White Slave Act with attempting to take into the country a woman who was not his wife, and Lloyd was charged with being a passive agent. [...] After a lengthy enquiry, a surety of $300 each, and an imposed condition that they were to live apart while in America, the couple were allowed to stay until March 1914. [...] Alice later stated that [...] "the indignity of the subsequent experience [...] went to Marie's heart in a way she never survived. [...] She could not bear to talk of <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> twenty-four hours." ...|$|E
500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{was five}} years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, {{died of breast cancer}} at the age of30. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the {{newsreel}} appears to have convinced Brulatour to capitalize further with a drama based on the sinking. He had a unique advantage – a leading actress who was a survivor and eyewitness to what had happened. Gibson later described her decision to participate as an [...] "opportunity {{to pay tribute to}} those who gave their lives on <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> night." [...] Jeffrey Richards suggests that it was more likely that Brulatour persuaded her that the disaster offered an opportunity to advance her career. The filming took place at Éclair's studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey and aboard a derelict transport vessel in New York Harbor. It was completed in only a week and the entire process of filming, processing and distribution took only half the time normally required for a one-reel film – a sign of the producers' eagerness to get the film onto screens while news of the disaster was still fresh. The film was only ten minutes long but this was typical of the time, as feature films had not yet become the norm. Instead, a program typically consisted of six to eight short films, each between ten and fifteen minutes long and covering a range of genres. Although newsreels were the main vehicle for presenting current events, dramas and comedies also picked up on such issues. There was very little footage of Titanic herself, which hindered the ability of newsreels to depict the sinking; however, the disaster was an obvious subject for a drama.|$|E
500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|After abandoning Wicked Stepmother {{and with}} no further film offers (though she was keen to play the centenarian in Craig Calman's The Turn Of The Century and worked with him on {{adapting}} the stage play to a feature-length screenplay), Davis appeared on several talk shows and was interviewed by Johnny Carson, Joan Rivers, Larry King, and David Letterman, discussing her career, but refusing to discuss her daughter.

The Chinaman sank down on the steps of the hong, like a man hearing medicine proposed to him when he was gangrened from head to foot, and made a gesture, palms downward, toward the ground, as one who said, “It has done its last for me — I am paying the matured bills of penalty.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> company! But I wonder if we can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to having}} {{traveled}} internationally as a child, she learned English, Spanish and Danish fluently, {{and had a}} working knowledge of Portuguese and German. During her formative years, she showed no interest in acting. Miller said of her childhood, [...] "My mother was a professional singer and I think she was eager {{for me to go}} into the entertainment field." [...] However, after she played a main role in her high school's production of George S. Kaufman's The American Way (1939), her taste for show business began to form. In one version of how she was discovered by Hollywood, in 1944 the 18-year-old Miller saw an opportunity when a Warner Brothers talent scout was to attend one of her school's performances. The scout never showed up, so she sent a letter and photograph to the studio, and garnered a screen test at Warner, where she changed her name to Kristine Miller. When Miller set out for Hollywood, she recalled, [...] "People said to my mother, 'Are you letting that girl go to <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> place?'" [...] But her mother replied, [...] "I know that girl, and she’ll be all right." [...] Although she failed the screen test, she was noticed by producer Hal Wallis, who was then feuding with the studio head, Jack L. Warner. Under acrimonious circumstances, Wallis left Warner Brothers for Paramount Pictures. Wallis brought with him Miller and another actress that also failed a screen test at Warner, the 21-year-old Lizabeth Scott.|$|E
2500|$|Biblical {{references}} {{appear in}} several forms. Chapter VI cites the Book of Job, ii. 13); {{there is an}} allusion to the elder brother in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, and Margaret paraphrases the definition of charity ("that spirit which suffereth long and is kind and seeketh not her own") (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15) from the First Epistle to the Corinthians. However, Gaskell cautions against misuse; Bessy Higgins reads the Apocalypse to cope with her condition and interprets the parable of Dives and Lazarus so simplistically that Margaret counters vigorously: [...] "It won't be division enough, in <b>that</b> <b>awful</b> day, {{that some of us}} have been beggars here, and some of us have been rich—we shall not be judged by that poor accident, but by our faithful following of Christ" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 19). Margaret and John follow a path of conversion which leads to reconciliation, acknowledging their [...] "unworthiness" [...] (Pollard, 1967). Margaret, who has the longest way to go, is crushed by guilt from her lie and by shame from being debased in Thornton's eyes (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 39). Francis de Sales encourages her to seek [...] "the way of humility" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 41), despite Mr. Bell's attempts to minimise and rationalise her lie as told in a panic. Thornton, on the brink of ruin like Job, tries not to be outraged while his mother rebels against the injustice of his situation ("Not for you, John! God has seen fit to be very hard on you, very") and gives fervent thanks for the [...] "great blessing" [...] his existence gives her (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 50).|$|E
