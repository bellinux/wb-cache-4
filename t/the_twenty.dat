5|$|Ironside {{began on}} 23 May 1944 {{with the aim}} of having the threat {{established}} by 29 May and continued until 28 June (22 days after the Normandy landings). It was implemented via double agents, in Britain and the United States, under the control of <b>the</b> <b>Twenty</b> Committee. The operation did not receive any resources from the Allied navies or airforce, so the deception had no physical element. This meant that Ironside had none of the traditional accompaniments to an invasion, including reconnaissance flights, bombardment, and naval operations. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Twenty</b> Committee was cautious about using important agents to pass over the deception.|$|E
5|$|The later Upanishads, {{numbering}} about 95, {{also called}} minor Upanishads, are dated {{from the late}} 1st-millennium BCE to mid 2nd-millennium CE.

Patrick Olivelle and other scholars date seven of <b>the</b> <b>twenty</b> Sannyasa Upanishads to likely have been complete sometime between the last centuries of the 1st-millennium BCE to 300 CE. About half of the Sannyasa Upanishads were likely composed in 14th- to 15th-century CE.|$|E

5|$|As Ironside was a {{marginal}} operation, {{and they were}} worried about exposing agents as false, <b>the</b> <b>Twenty</b> Committee for the most part utilised less important agents and added words of caution to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E
