He was convicted of the two low-level felonies and sentenced in December 1997 to eleven months in prison followed by three years of federal probation. As a condition of his sentence, Bell was compelled to pay, upon his release, $1,359 in restitution for the stinkbomb attack. He was also subjected to three years of supervised release, during which he was barred from accessing computers and from possessing chemicals.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, <b>Tobacco,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Firearms</b> (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E

While the event had taken place before he became Director, a highly controversial investigation ensued, including allegations of a cover-up by the FBI, and tensions developed between Freeh and Janet Reno, then-Attorney General. Reno, who had herself been blamed for mishandling of the confrontation and investigation, sent United States Marshals to FBI headquarters to seize Waco-related evidence.|$|E

25|$|Orr {{then became}} a serious arson suspect {{and the subject of}} {{investigation}} and surveillance for several months. Orr was alerted to this surveillance effort on May 3, 1991, when he discovered and removed a tracking device that belonged to the Bureau of Alcohol, <b>Tobacco,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Firearms</b> (ATF) hidden under the bumper of the vehicle he was driving. However, Orr was apparently unaware of the fact that a Teletrac tracking device was later installed behind his dashboard when he brought his city vehicle for service on November 22, 1991. Meanwhile, a federal grand jury handed down an indictment, and shortly thereafter Orr was present at the scene of a suspicious fire, so a decision was made to end the surveillance, obtain an arrest warrant, and effect an arrest. Orr was arrested on December 4, 1991.|$|E

25|$|On September 1, 1978, {{there were}} three {{separate}} explosions from improvised explosive devices placed in trash bins around the town. The damage was minor, {{and no one was}} injured. Speedway authorities called on explosive experts from the Indiana State Police, Marion County Sheriff's Department, 64th Ordnance from nearby Fort Benjamin Harrison and specialists from the Bureau of Alcohol <b>Tobacco</b> <b>and</b> <b>Firearms.</b> They formed a 100-strong taskforce to solve the case. The devices were simple homemade bombs constructed from soda cans packed with Tovex 200 and triggered with a rudimentary timing device. The following Saturday, two more blasts hit Speedway with another the day after at the local bowling alley. The next day, a device exploded under the car of an off duty Speedway police officer, who was on sick leave at the time and was not injured.|$|E
25|$|In December 1982, Webb, Howard Emmett Bramblett {{of nearby}} Ocoee, and David Parks {{decided to start}} {{manufacturing}} illegal M-80 and M-100 fireworks in an old metal dairy barn on the farm. Bramblett, who owned a fireworks store in Benton and {{had a history of}} involvement with illegal fireworks, had reportedly taught Webb and Parks how to manufacture these fireworks and where to get the materials. They employed several family members of Webb and Parks. Most employees were unaware and not educated in the dangerous working conditions. Between December 1982 and the date of the explosion, at least 1,542,000 of the M-series fireworks were reported to have been manufactured at the factory and distributed to at least twelve states. Months before the explosion, the Polk County Sheriff's Office, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), and the Bureau of Alcohol, <b>Tobacco,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Firearms</b> (ATF) had received word of an illegal fireworks operation in the area, but were uncertain of the location.|$|E

[...] Over a six-month period, Bell also compiled evidence of what he alleged was illegal surveillance of him by a government agency. In {{the days leading up to}} his arrest, he claimed that the agency had unlawfully installed a covert listening device in his home and a tracking device in his car, something the ATF admitted doing during the subsequent trial. The ATF stated that it had planted a covert GPS system in Bell's car and that it had tracked the movements of his Nissan Maxima in real time.|$|E

500|$|At 1:20a.m. on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol {{officers}} in uniform, and Detective Charles Smythe and Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine {{arrived at the}} Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced [...] "Police! We're taking the place!" [...] Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate. Days after the raid, one of the bar owners complained that the tipoff had never come, and that the raid was ordered by the Bureau of Alcohol, <b>Tobacco,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Firearms,</b> who objected {{that there were no}} stamps on the liquor bottles, indicating the alcohol was bootlegged.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Bob Trinchero of the Sutter Home Winery {{decided to}} try {{draining}} some juice from the vats in order to impart more tannins and color to his Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel. He vinified this juice as a dry wine, and tried to sell it {{under the name of}} Oeil de Perdrix, a Swiss wine made by this saignée method. The Bureau of Alcohol, <b>Tobacco</b> <b>and</b> <b>Firearms</b> insisted on an English translation, so he added [...] "White Zinfandel" [...] to the name, and sold 220 cases. At the time, demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes, encouraging other California producers to make [...] "white" [...] wine from red grapes, with minimal skin contact. [...] However, in 1975, Trinchero's wine experienced a stuck fermentation, a problem in which the yeast dies off before all the sugar is converted to alcohol. He put the wine aside for two weeks, then tasted it and decided to sell this pinker, sugary wine. Just as Mateus Rosé had become a huge success in Europe after World War II, this medium sweet White Zinfandel became immensely popular. White Zinfandel still accounts for 9.9% of U.S. wine sales by volume (6.3% by value), six times the sales of red Zinfandel. Most white Zinfandel is made from grapes grown for that purpose in California's Central Valley.|$|E
