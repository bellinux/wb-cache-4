5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or <b>toluidine</b> blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation.

25|$|Automotive {{antifreeze}} has {{a characteristic}} odor {{due to the}} additive tolytriazole, a corrosion inhibitor. The unpleasant odor in industrial use tolytriazole comes from impurities in the product that are formed from the <b>toluidine</b> isomers (ortho-, meta- and para-toluidine) and meta-diamino toluene which are side-products {{in the manufacture of}} tolytriazole. These side-products are highly reactive and produce volatile aromatic amines which are responsible for the unpleasant odor.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} {{properties of the}} <b>toluidines</b> are quite {{similar to those of}} aniline, and <b>toluidines</b> have properties in common with other aromatic amines. Due to the amino group bonded to the aromatic ring, the <b>toluidines</b> are weakly basic. The <b>toluidines</b> are poorly soluble in pure water but dissolve well in acidic water due to formation of ammonium salts, as usual for organic amines. ortho- and meta-toluidines are viscous liquids, but para-toluidine is a flaky solid. This difference is related {{to the fact that the}} p-toluidine molecules are more symmetrical. p-Toluidine can be obtained from reduction of p-nitrotoluene. p-Toluidine reacts with formaldehyde to form Trögers base.|$|R

Gallium 67 scans are also useful in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in approximately 90% of cases and are often positive before the chest x-ray becomes abnormal. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the causative organism in sputum or bronchio-alveolar lavage (lung rinse). Staining with <b>toluidine</b> blue, silver stain, periodic-acid schiff stain, or an immunofluorescence assay will show the characteristic cysts. The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of 2 to 8 (and {{not to be confused}} with Histoplasma or Cryptococcus, which typically do not form aggregates of spores or cells). A lung biopsy would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli. Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity which is characteristic of this pneumonia.|$|E

Kekulé argued for his proposed structure by considering the number of isomers observed for derivatives of benzene. For every monoderivative of benzene (C6H5X, where X = Cl, OH, CH3, NH2, etc.) only one isomer was ever found, implying that all six carbons are equivalent, so that substitution on any carbon gives only a single possible product. For diderivatives such as the <b>toluidines,</b> C6H4(NH2)(CH3), three isomers were observed, for which Kekulé proposed structures with the two substituted carbon atoms separated by one, two and three carbon-carbon bonds, later named ortho, meta, and para isomers respectively.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{thermodynamic}} description of dilute aqueous solutions of organic substances {{in a wide range}} of temperature and pressure. The benzene derivatives with functional groups -CH 3, -OH and -NH 2, namely phenol, o-, m- and p-cresol, aniline, o-, m- and p-dihydroxybenzene, o-, m-and p-aminophenol and o-phenylenediamine were studied. In experimental part of the work five thermodynamic quantities were measured by various techniques. Measurement of heat capacities of aqueous solutions was the most extensive. In addition, densities of aqueous solutions, solubility, vapour pressure and heat capacities of pure compounds were also measured. Heat capacities of aqueous solutions at superambient conditions were measured in the Laboratory of Thermodynamics of Solutions and Polymers of the Blaise Pascal University in Clermont-Ferrand, France (LTSP-CF) by high-temperature differential flow heat capacity calorimeter. The measurement covers temperature range from 300 K to 623 K and pressure range from 0, 1 MPa to 30 MPa. The upper temperature limit varied for each group of substances depending on their thermal stability. With the exception of phenol the present data are the only one of its kind. Densities of aqueous solutions of phenol and cresols were measured in the LTSP-CF by vibrating tube flow densimeter. Densities at temperatures 573, 598 and 623 K and pressures from 10 to 30 Mpa were obtained. Gibbs free energy of hydration, which is directly linked to the Henry's law constant, is an important thermodynamic quantity characterizing aqueous solutions. In order to obtain Henry's law constant the literature research and vapour pressure and solubility measurements were done. Parameters of vapour pressure equation can be avaluated by simultaneous correlation of vapour pressure and heat capacity data. For this reason, also some heat capacities of pure substances were measured. Heat capacities of pure <b>toluidines</b> and dihydroxybenzenes were measured in the Department of Physical Chemistry of the Institute of Chemical Technology, Prague (ICT-P) by a Setaram C 80 commercial calorimeter in temperature range from 300 to 373 K. Vapour pressures were measured in ICT-P by a static apparatus. Data for o-, m- and p-toluidine in temperature range from 335 to 445 K were obtained. Parameters of the Cox equation for <b>toluidines</b> and anilines and of the King equation for m-, and p-dihydroxybenzene were evaluated by the method of simultaneous correlation of vapour pressure and heat capacity. Solubility measurement was done in ICT-P for <b>toluidines</b> and aminophenols for three temperatures 298, 313 and 323 K. Solubilities along with vapour pressure were used for calculation of Henry's law constant of <b>toluidines</b> and dihydroxybenzenes by combining experimetal data from this work and literature data. Henry's law constant of phenol, cresols and aniline were determined from literature data solely. Experimental data from this work and from literature were simultaneously correlated by three models developed for description of thermodynamic properties of aqueous solutions. The modified Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) model, density analogue of HKF model (DEN) developed in LTSP-CF and hydration model (HYD) based on fluctuation solution theory were used. DEN model was found to be superior to other two models for description and calculation of thermodynamic properties of aquaeous solutions of studied substances. One may use parameters of the DEN model for prediction of the Gibbs free energy of solute, which in turn serves as input value in phase and chemical equilibria calculationsAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R

The chemical shifts correlate reasonably well with ^(19) F shifts of similarly substituted fluorobenzenes, with C- 1 of the anilines themselves and with Hammett sigma values.

DNT biotransformation in the presence and absence of oxygen was mostly reductive and was representative {{of the type of}} cometabolic transformations that occur when a high concentration of an easily degradable carbon source is present. P. aeruginosa reduced both nitro groups on DNT, with the formation of mainly 4 -amino- 2 -nitrotoluene and 2 -amino- 4 -nitrotoluene and small quantities of 2, 4 -diaminotoluene. Acetylation of the arylamines was a significant reaction. 4 -Acetamide- 2 -nitrotoluene and the novel compounds 2 -acetamide- 4 -nitrotoluene, 4 -acetamide- 2 -aminotoluene, and 2, 4 -diacetamidetoluene were identified as DNT metabolites. The biotransformation of 2, 4 -diaminotoluene to 4 -acetamide- 2 -aminotoluene was 24 times faster than abiotic transformation. 2 -Nitrotoluene and 4 -nitrotoluene were also reduced to their corresponding <b>toluidines</b> and then acetylated.

The effects of different parameters, such as speed of agitation, temperature, ammonia concentration, elemental sulfur loading, catalyst concentration, sulfide concentration, and concentration of nitrotoluene, on the conversion and reaction rate of nitrotoluene were studied to establish the mechanism of the reaction. The rate of reaction of nitrotoluene was found to be proportional to the concentration of catalyst, to the square of the concentration of sulfide, and to the cube of the concentration of nitrotoluene. The apparent activation energy for this kinetically controlled reaction was estimated as 19. 43, 21. 45 and 25. 54 kcal/mol for ONT, PNT and MNT, respectively.

The measurements were {{performed in the}} temperature range from 303 K up to the upper temperature limit, between 373 and 573 K, depending on the thermal stability of individual compounds. The data were obtained typically at pressure of 0. 1 MPa at the lowest temperature and at a pressure near 2 MPa at higher temperatures to 473 K. For m-aminophenol and o-diaminobenzene the measurements were also performed at higher temperatures at pressures to 30 MPa. The standard heat {{capacities of}} aqueous solutes were obtained by extrapolation of the experimental data to infinite dilution. The new data were combined with the results on standard heat capacities of phenol, aniline, cresols and <b>toluidines,</b> published in our previous paper. This {{made it possible to}} examine the effects of the functional substituent groups and their position on the aromatic ring. The changes in the temperature dependence of the heat capacity with the polarity of the functional groups were compared with the evolution of standard volumes. The different trend was observed for the solutes containing two polar groups in comparison with those with one polar group only. Our data suggest that the standard derivative properties (partial molar properties at infinite dilution) of aromatic solutes with multiple polar groups tend towards minus infinity when the critical temperature of water is approached from below. Finally the results show also that a simple group contribution concept can be used to calculate the standard heat capacities for a given class of compounds...|$|R

Telomere length differs among individuals due to genetic and environmental factors. Aiming {{to examine the relationship between}} DNA-damaging agents and average telomere length in peripheral blood, we conducted a cross-sectional study among 157 workers working in the rubber industry in Sweden. METHODS: N-nitrosamines were measured in air by personal sampling on Thermosorb/N tubes and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) for 60 individuals. Based on a similar working situation, the exposure was estimated for all workers. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were measured as the metabolite 1 -hydroxypyrene (1 -HP) in urine by LC. Carbon disulphide (CS 2) was measured as the metabolite 2 -thiothiazolidine- 4 -carboxylic acid (TTCA) in urine by LC/MS/MS. <b>Toluidines</b> (orto-, meta-, and para-) were measured in urine by gas chromatography (GC) /MS. The average telomere length in peripheral blood was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: There was a reduction in telomere length with increasing exposure to N-nitrosamines in air [measured (N= 60) N-nitrosamines β-coefficient= - 10, (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] - 19 - - 1. 2) P= 0. 026; estimated (N= 157) N-nitrosamines β-coefficient = - 5. 3, (95 % CI - 9. 5 - - 0. 97) P= 0. 016].
