500|$|Coolbrith {{continued}} {{to write and}} work to support herself. From 1909 to final publication in 1917, she painstakingly collected and edited a book of Stoddard's poetry, writing a foreword and joining her short memorial poem [...] "At Anchor" [...] to verse submitted by Stoddard's friends Joaquin Miller, George Sterling and Thomas Walsh. At the age of 80, McCracken wrote to Coolbrith to complain to her dear friend of still having {{to work for a}} living: [...] "The world has not used us well, Ina; California has been ungrateful to us. Of all the hundred thousands the state pays out in pensions of one kind and another, don't you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{at the head of the}} pensioners, and I somewhere down below?" ...|$|E
60|$|Cecily. I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{so proud}} of that, though I am sure {{it must have been}} very pleasant.|$|E
60|$|Really, Christina, {{you do me}} an injustice. I can't bear to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> parted {{from your}} {{precious}} boy an instant longer than necessary.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Really, Helen,' said Elizabeth, 'I cannot <b>think</b> why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{determined}} {{to say all}} that you can against that poor Rupert.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "1. Custom {{becomes an}} obsession. As a shopper, once you’re {{empowered}} {{to get something}} exactly {{the way you want}} it, you will realize you can get ANYTHING made exactly the way you want it. And CustomMade <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to. Easily. 2. There is some talented individual maker or some company out there who can make you exactly what you’re looking for, exactly the way you want it. All you need is a way to communicate with that maker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Harry, [...] "I suppose I {{ought to}} be President. And then {{we must have a}} Treasurer, and I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> Treasurer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have {{a letter}} here that--which--in Lord Martindale's absence, I {{thought it might}} be better--you might prefer my coming direct to you. I cannot but <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> aware'--stammered Mr. Wingfield.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> thankful {{there is}} one human being--however wretched--who cares {{enough for you to}} care about the truth in what {{concerns}} you,' Laura said. 'Selina, Selina--are you hideously deceiving us?' ...|$|E

6000|$|And then Lady Anna came in. [...] "They {{wanted me}} to stay and dine, mamma, but I {{did not like to}} <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> left alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> such a hero!" [...] said Lady Amaldina, much gratified. [...] "I didn't {{believe you}} would take so much trouble about such a thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't wish to {{tell the}} others all of it," [...] she said, [...] "but I will tell you. In a way, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> held responsible. Can you guess in what manner that ghost awakened me last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{will be no}} feeding. Felix, you are so heartless and so cruel that I {{sometimes}} think I will {{make up my mind}} to let you go your own way and never to speak to you again. My friends will be here about ten;--I should say from ten till twelve. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> here to receive her, not later than ten.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{my opinion}} is of little {{consequence}} on such a subject. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> guided by Mr. Casaubon. I spoke without thinking of anything else than my own feeling, which {{has nothing to do}} with the real question. But it now occurs to me--perhaps Mr. Casaubon might see that the proposal was not wise. Can you not wait now and mention it to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sincerely}} hope we shall!" [...] he returned, {{sitting down}} near her. [...] "It is really painful to <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> immured in this uncongenial place with your tastes and--advantages." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed. And a whole army {{of accusations}} {{has been brought}} against him. I have never liked to tell you, and yet I do not <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> left in the dark." ...|$|R
5000|$|In June 2015, National Association for Gun Rights {{sent out}} mailers {{targeting}} Republican William J. Howell, the Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates. According to The Washington Post, NAGR's mailer [...] "Portrayed Howell as being friendly to rapists" [...] by depicting a woman cowering before a knife-wielding assailant alongside the text [...] "Speaker Bill Howell <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> left vulnerable to armed thugs and rapists!” Howell had {{been endorsed by}} the NRA {{and said he was}} a [...] "100 percent supporter of the Second Amendment." [...] Howell described the mailers as [...] "pretty low by even today’s political standards." ...|$|R
6000|$|And as for {{you that}} cannot yet well endure to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{justified}} by {{the blood of the}} Son of Mary shed on the cross without the gate, I say to you, [...] "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him" [...] (Psa 2:12).|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not happy}} about Maqueda, Doctor," [...] he said to me. [...] "I am afraid there is {{something}} in that story. She wanted to be with us; indeed, she begged to be allowed to come almost with tears. But I wouldn't have it, since accidents may always happen; the vibration might shake in the roof or something; in fact, I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> here. Why don't you go away and leave me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jacinta drily. [...] "I fancy {{he would}} do it rather well. Mr. Austin is not much of an artist, and would never be a great one; but he has the {{capacity}} of understanding, or, perhaps, I should say imagining things. Still, the pity is that he usually stops there. He doesn't want to do them, and though he once very rashly tried, he was not long in discovering that the work was a good deal too hard for him. I really <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> glad there is a trace of primitive--we'll be candid, and call it brutality--in Harry Jefferson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{have learned}} {{that you have been}} {{watching}} with me by night, and working by day, when <b>you</b> never <b>should</b> have worked at all. To <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> reduced to that, and I not know it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh how glad I am {{you have}} not!' exclaimed Uriah. 'To <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{the first to}} kindle the sparks of {{ambition}} in my umble breast, and that you've not forgot it! Oh!--Would you excuse me asking for a cup more coffee?' ...|$|R
60|$|LYDIA Well, I cannot {{blame you}} for {{defending}} him. But tell me candidly, Julia, had he never saved your life, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>been</b> attached to him as you are?--Believe me, the rude blast that overset your boat was a prosperous gale of love to him.|$|R
60|$|All {{the goods}} {{he would ever}} have of his own, he had now;--position, a title, and a {{handsome}} face. Surely he could afford to risk something! Even the ruins and wreck of such wealth as that displayed in Grosvenor Square {{would be better than}} the baronet's present condition. And then, though it was possible that old Melmotte should be ruined some day, there could be no doubt as to his present means; and would it not be probable that he would make hay while the sun shone by securing his daughter's position? She visited her son again on the next morning, which was Sunday, and again tried to persuade him to the marriage. 'I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> content to run a little risk,' she said.|$|E

5000|$|Therefore, when Parker visits film {{schools and}} talks to young filmmakers, he tells them that the new film {{technology}} available for making films and telling a story {{is less important than}} conveying a real message: [...] "If you haven't got something to say, I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a filmmaker." ...|$|E

On Wednesdays {{the show}} {{features}} [...] "Check Your Priorities," [...] a segment that explores how [...] "the {{most popular and}} most widely read stories on the internet aren't always the most important" [...] with Dominick, Aaron Hodges, and Brian Dominick examining these stories with humorous banter, which is then followed by a description of [...] "the stories we <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> paying attention to." ...|$|E
