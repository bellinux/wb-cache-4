40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose/aim: The aim of {{this essay}} {{is to make a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the phenomenon of net dating, both among those who have dated on the internet and among those who haven’t tried it at all. Key questions to be answered are what attitudes are associated with net dating? How do the attitudes differ between those who have tried compared to those who haven’t? What kind of positive and negative aspects is there with net dating? Are there any prejudices against net dating and – if so, what kind of prejudices? How does the future look for net dating? Material/method: Qualitative method with eight interviews divided into two groups depending weather the person has <b>tried</b> <b>net</b> dating or not. Main results: The study shows that net dating is a phenomenon that will continue to grow and attract more users. The most significant result from the interviews are the different prejudices that are articulated. The common opinion amongst those who haven’t tried internet dating, is that it’s okay for everyone else to do it – but not for them selves. However, the analyse shows that the awkwardness that surrounds internet dating will probably diminish as more people start use this dating forum. The analyse also discuss how the identities are being experimented with, since internet is a place where the visible features such as body and style are unimportant. Instead it’s up to the individuals to decide how they want to present them-selves on the internet.

Lucas fell behind schedule {{in the first}} week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns. Moreover, a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming. Taylor said, [...] "you couldn't really see where the land ended and the sky began. It was all a gray mess, and the robots were just a blur." [...] Given this situation, Lucas requested for heavy filtration, which Taylor rejected, who said: [...] "I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ... But George saw it differently, so we <b>tried</b> using <b>nets</b> and other diffusion. He asked to set up one shot on the robots with a 300mm, and the sand and sky just mushed together.

40|$|We report {{here the}} results of a series of careful {{experiments}} in turbulent channel flow, using various configurations of blade manipulators suggested as optimal in earlier boundary layer studies. The mass flow in the channel could be held constant to better than 0. 1 %, and the uncertainties in pressure loss measurements were less than 0. 1 mm of water; it was therefore possible to make accurate estimates of the global effects of blade manipulation of a kind that are difficult in boundary layer flows. The flow was fully developed at the station where the blades were mounted, and always relaxed to the same state sufficiently far downstream. It is found that, for a given mass flow, the pressure drop to any station downstream is always higher in the manipulated than in the unmanipulated flow, demonstrating that none of the blade manipulators <b>tried</b> reduces <b>net</b> duct losses. However the net increase in duct losses is less than the drag of the blade even in laminar flow, showing that there is a net reduction in the total skin friction drag experienced by the duct, but this relief is only about 20 % of the manipulator drag at most...|$|R

This is difficult when {{costs and benefits}} of participation vary independently, as in land conservation. We share a classroom game that explores cases in which minimizing costs may not maximize benefits and vice versa. This game is a contextually rich pedagogical tool, putting students in the role of landowners who must decide whether to conserve land in different policy environments: flat conservation payments, agglomeration bonuses, and a conservation auction. Students learn about specific issues in land conservation, ecosystem services, preferences for non-money outcomes, and general issues in policymaking. The game is suited to classes in environmental, resource, agricultural, and policy economics, and more general classes in microeconomics and public policy...|$|R

40|$|Net {{weighting}} {{is a key}} {{technique in}} large scale timing driven placement, which {{plays a crucial role}} for deep submicron physical synthesis and timing closure. A popular way to assign net weight is based on the slack of the <b>nets,</b> <b>trying</b> to minimize the worst negative slack (WNS) for the entire circuit. While WNS is an important optimization metric, another figure of merit (FOM), defined as the total slack difference compared to a certain slack threshold for all timing end points, is of equivalent importance to measure the overall timing closure result for highly complex modern ASIC and microprocessor designs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the slack and FOM sensitivities to the net weight, and propose a new net weighting scheme based on the slack and FOM sensitivities. Such sensitivity analysis implicitly takes potential physical synthesis effect into consideration. Experiment results on a set of industrial circuits are promising for both stand-alone timing driven placement and physical synthesis afterwards. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R

Another concise method is the calculation of isochrones to mark the accessibility of urban and suburban areas from important economic or public centres in the city.

My Scottish father had become manager of the British Union Oil Company there. a srnall outfit that evplorcd {{for oil and gas}} on the island and refined crude oil from Venezuela. I had arrived in Barbados in Api-il of 1939, and with the outbreak of war and appearance of German U-boats in the region, my family became trapped on the island. As a result. I spent seven of my foi-mative years in a house in the tropics that had a golf cousse at the back and the emerald Caribbean Sea a short distance in front. This is where i t all began. The golf course became my hunting ground for butterflies and bird and reptile eggs. What a challenge i t was to <b>try</b> to <b>net</b> those elusive butterflies or reach a nest way out on a thin limb. Molluscs were also highly sought after. Sunrise Tellins (Tellirm radiata), which we called "auroras " because of their radiating colors, were a special prize. To capture them, I had to pump holes in the shallow back-reef sand with my feet until I could feel one of these slippery bivalves and dive i t up. When slit open and spread out to dry, they resembled butterflies. About the time I started school, I met the "ultimate collector, " Dr Alfred Senn. the British Union Oil Company's geologist. I used to spend hours after school watching him picking microfossils- mostly foraminifera, I think- out of samples and filing them in endless rows of small vials. This was the Iife for me: 1 decided then and there to become an oil company geologist. When the war ended, my father, convinced that an 1 1 -year old who was spending all his spare time in trees or in the sea was simply not taking life seriously enough, decided to ship me off to boarding school in Scotland. There I was expected to develop character and apply myself to more serious studies. So in 1946, still set on becoming an oil company geologist, I headed for the land of chilblains. After completing my secondary education, I turned my gaze to the New World because of the expanding opportunities for work in oil companies there.
