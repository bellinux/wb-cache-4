5|$|The main {{attraction}} of Waterfall Gully is <b>the</b> <b>waterfall,</b> First Falls. It {{is at the}} south-eastern end of the road, in land owned by Cleland Conservation Park. The weir {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>Waterfall</b> was constructed in the late 19th century and was part of Adelaide's early water supply. Development in the area has continued since the construction of a restaurant in 1912. Developments over recent decades have included improving access to the site, upgrading the bridges, and the addition of new signage.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{within the}} last century has {{resulted}} in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of <b>the</b> <b>waterfall</b> from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could theoretically restore the 19th century appearance of the falls.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, much of {{the area}} that forms today's Cleland Conservation Park was {{purchased}} by the State Government, {{in large part because}} of the lobbying efforts of Professor Sir John Cleland. Most of this land, including <b>the</b> <b>Waterfall</b> Gully area, was later combined in 1963 to create the park that extends eastwards up into the hills to the summit of Mount Lofty and northwards to Greenhill Road. During 1943, the Municipality of Burnside was proclaimed the City of Burnside.|$|E

The river has carved a 10 km canyon and created 13 lakes with <b>waterfalls</b> between them. <b>The</b> <b>waterfalls</b> {{are one of the most}} visited attractions of the area and people often swim there. The walls around <b>the</b> <b>waterfalls</b> are white in colour, whereas the water from the Mirusha river is a dirty brown. <b>The</b> <b>waterfall's</b> caves are also popular with visitors. <b>The</b> highest <b>waterfall,</b> between <b>the</b> sixth and seventh lake, is 22 m high.|$|R
5000|$|Sloughan Glen Waterfalls {{are located}} roughly 4 {{miles from the}} village. This is a popular tourist {{location}} and {{it is common to}} see people picnicking throughout <b>the</b> year. <b>The</b> <b>waterfalls</b> themselves lie in a deep ravine and can be accessed by a series of walkways and steps. The layout of the walk is such that the visitor comes across <b>the</b> smaller <b>waterfall</b> first this can be viewed from ground level. The steps can then be taken to view <b>the</b> first <b>waterfall</b> from a high walkway. Upon following this walkway further and climbing several more steps <b>the</b> larger <b>waterfall</b> can be viewed from atop. The best time to view <b>the</b> <b>waterfalls</b> is after heavy rainfall when <b>the</b> <b>waterfalls</b> are at their strongest. There are several picnic areas in <b>the</b> <b>Waterfalls</b> and a sufficient size car park making access good.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, both Marge and Mr. Burns want Homer {{to go on}} {{the same}} rafting trip. Homer starts with being on his family's raft, and then swims back and forth between that and Mr. Burns's raft. Marge discovers that he has double booked the weekend while both rafts float near a waterfall, and is upset that he chose to do work on a family outing. Homer can only save one raft, and he saves the one {{containing}} his family. As Mr. Burns and the executives are about to go over <b>the</b> <b>waterfall,</b> Marlowe rides up on a motorboat and carries Mr. Burns to safety, while the executives fall over the edge. Homer goes over <b>the</b> <b>waterfall</b> by himself, but is completely unharmed and finds gold. Later, at their house, Homer tells Marge that he is a safety inspector again. Fireworks go off outside, and it is revealed that they were caused by a fire at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, presumably because Homer failed at his job.|$|E

5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, <b>the</b> <b>waterfall</b> was {{inundated}} and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day Mackinaw City. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Waterfall Gully {{was first}} {{explored}} by European {{settlers in the}} early-to-mid-19th century, and quickly became a popular location for tourists and picnickers. The government chose to retain control over portions of Waterfall Gully until 1884, when they agreed to place the land {{under the auspices of}} the City of Burnside. 28 years later the government took back the management of the southern part of Waterfall Gully, designating it as South Australia's first National Pleasure Resort. Today this area remains under State Government control, and in 1972 <b>the</b> <b>Waterfall</b> Gully Reserve, as it was then known, became part of the larger Cleland Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|The Papuan swiftlet, Aerodramus papuensis, {{has three}} toes {{instead of the}} usual four in this group. It has the ability to echolocate, but whereas other {{previously}} studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their caves, the Papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and <b>the</b> <b>waterfall</b> swift Hydrochous gigas, are sister taxa, a relationship that would indicate paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the {{interior of}} a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for <b>the</b> <b>waterfall</b> sequence.|$|E

5|$|The {{stopping}} {{patterns on}} the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line have generally been determined by several different termini. The steam era saw these termini change quite frequently as more terminating facilities were constructed: the first trains on the line after <b>the</b> <b>Waterfall</b> extension in 1887 either ran to Hurstville (16 per day), Sutherland (two per day) and Waterfall (two per day), with all trains stopping at every intermediate station. By 1907, however, Como and Oatley had {{been added to the}} list of termini, with nine and seven trains per day respectively. Seven trains per day at this time also ran to Sutherland, and one to Waterfall. Most trains terminated at Hurstville.|$|E

5|$|While {{the route}} to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was on public land, the {{alternative}} route along the gully was through private properties. Nevertheless, many visitors chose this route, and a combination of public demand and a desire {{from some of the}} landowners for improved access to and from their propertiesespecially from the Mügge familyled to pressure to build a road through the gully. Although there was opposition from some of the locals, <b>the</b> <b>Waterfall</b> Gully road was built in the late 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Minnehaha Falls {{received}} pilgrimages {{from fans}} of Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha by the 1870s. At the same time, business {{people wanted to}} harness its power.
