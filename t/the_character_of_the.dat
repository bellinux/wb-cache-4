5|$|According to K. N. T. Sastry in {{his book}} Alanati Chalana Chitram, the film begins with the theme of Dhairye Sahase Lakshmi (Bravery gives wealth) which is present {{throughout}} the film. While the characters of Rama Rao and Ranga Rao epitomise heroism, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> princess played by Malathi epitomises innocence and sensuality. Pathala Bhairavi sets up an opposition between the worship of Rama by the protagonist's mother and the worship of Pathala Bhairavi by the sorcerer; the former being a frequent one inhabited in a domestic space while the latter being an uncivilised one.|$|E

5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur during which <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> call changes. The female mounts {{the male and}} a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct {{over a period of}} a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E

5|$|Gabriel García Márquez's The General in His Labyrinth (El general en su laberinto, 1989) is a fictionalized {{account of}} the last days {{in the life of}} Simón Bolívar. Bolívar, also known as the Great Liberator, freed from Spanish rule the {{territory}} that would subsequently become Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. However <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General is not portrayed as the glorious hero that traditional history has presented; instead García Márquez develops a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European discourse on <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) {{as a general}} evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention {{was brought to the}} individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E

Additionally, the state {{would also have to}} take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E
