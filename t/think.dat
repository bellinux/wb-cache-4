5|$|I find {{it quite}} nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you write}} songs, you don't really <b>think</b> about performing in a video. I <b>think</b> it's quite fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E
5|$|I <b>think</b> {{that the}} band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had}} a goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I <b>think</b> we showed too much. I <b>think</b> maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I <b>think</b> that the lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I <b>think</b> that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E

5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I <b>think</b> Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't <b>think</b> they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I <b>think</b> after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, King's College London {{students}} founded London's first student-led <b>think</b> tank, the King’s <b>Think</b> Tank (formerly {{known as}} KCL <b>Think</b> Tank).

This student initiative organises lectures and discussions in seven different policy areas, and assists students in lobbying politicians, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other policymakers with their ideas. Every September, it produces a peer-reviewed journal of policy recommendations called The Spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I <b>think</b> Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I <b>think</b> that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I <b>think</b> people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E

5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from.

5|$|<b>Think</b> Tank, {{released}} in May 2003, {{was filled with}} atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist's absence also meant that <b>Think</b> Tank was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound {{was seen as a}} testament to Albarn's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group's creative direction. <b>Think</b> Tank was yet another UK number one and managed Blur's highest US position of number 56. It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards. The band did a successful tour in 2003, with former Verve guitarist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon.|$|E
