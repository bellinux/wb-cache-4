Sheridan eventually decided that {{if he wanted to}} establish a career, he had to relocate, so he moved <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1992. Sheridan stayed at a friend's house, and as he did not own a cell phone, he used a payphone located on Sunset Boulevard to call interested employers.|$|E

After a short season, Robinson returned <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> December 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Football League. By that time, however, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place, drawing the United States into World War II and ending Robinson's nascent football career.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{her final}} {{semester}} of study, Levy moved to Washington, D.C., to become a paid intern with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In October 2000 she began her internship at the bureau's headquarters, where she {{was assigned to the}} public affairs division. Her supervisor, bureau spokesperson Dan Dunne, was impressed with Levy's work, especially her handling of media inquiries regarding the upcoming execution of Timothy McVeigh, convicted of bombing the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Levy's internship was abruptly terminated in April 2001 because her academic eligibility was found to have expired in December 2000. She had already completed her master's degree requirements and was scheduled to return <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> May 2001 for graduation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the war, Lt.

5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} in Jalisco, Mexico. His father, Antonio del Valle, was {{a soldier in the}} Spanish army who came <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1819 and was mayordomo (administrator and/or foreman) of Mission San Fernando Rey de España. Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at the Presidio of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was {{promoted}} to second lieutenant and transferred to the Presidio of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved in a power struggle with the commandant of the Presidio of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing a rift between father and son, and they never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|Emigration to {{the west}} {{decreased}} over the following years, but {{it is likely that}} the drop in numbers was caused more by fears over the outcome of the ongoing Mexican-American War than by the cautionary tale of the Donner Party. In 1846, an estimated 1,500 people migrated <b>to</b> <b>California.</b> <b>In</b> 1847, the number dropped to 450 and to 400 in 1848. The California Gold Rush spurred a sharp increase, however, and 25,000 people went west in 1849. Most of the overland migration followed the Carson River, but a few forty-niners used the same route as the Donner Party and recorded descriptions about the site.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} in the Mexican–American War, Washington joined the Charles Town Mining Company and {{traveled}} <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush with his brother Benjamin Franklin Washington; however, there are no existing records of Washington finding gold during his pursuit. While in California, Washington authored the novel, A Tale to be Told Some Fifty Years Hence, {{which was published in}} 1853.|$|E

5|$|Following the Mexican–American War, Washington {{traveled}} <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush and authored the novel, A Tale to be Told Some Fifty Years Hence. Washington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, {{where he}} remained {{for a few}} years and fought as a Border Ruffian during the Bleeding Kansas confrontations over slavery along the border between Kansas Territory and Missouri. While under the command of Captain Henry Clay Pate, Washington was present at the June 1856 Free-Stater attack known as Battle of Black Jack, where he sustained minor injuries. Washington died by drowning after falling overboard from a steamboat on the Missouri River in September 1856. His family's descendants claim Washington was murdered by Jayhawkers.|$|E
5|$|Forty-niners {{came from}} Latin America, {{particularly}} from the Mexican mining districts near Sonora and Chile. Gold-seekers and merchants from Asia, primarily from China, began arriving in 1849, at first in modest numbers to Gum San ("Gold Mountain"), the name given <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> Chinese. The first immigrants from Europe, reeling {{from the effects of}} the Revolutions of 1848 and with a longer distance to travel, began arriving in late 1849, mostly from France, with some Germans, Italians, and Britons.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, the {{congregation}} hired Oakland's first rabbi, Meyer Solomon Levy. Born in England in January 1852 and raised there, {{he was the}} son of Rabbi Solomon Levy of Borough Synagogue in London. Meyer Solomon Levy had been ordained in England as an Orthodox rabbi before he was twenty, and moved to Australia as a young man. An early supporter of Zionism, he had served as a rabbi in Melbourne before moving <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1872 or 1873, where he served as the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El (then Bickur Cholim) in San Jose. Levy was paid $100 a month (today $), and donated a percentage to the poor.|$|E

5|$|Kinman {{claimed to}} have {{migrated}} <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1849 during the great Gold Rush {{and worked as a}} prospector in Pierson B. Reading's party on the Trinity River near present day Douglas City. He then returned to Illinois for two years. In 1852, he travelled to California and explored the Humboldt Bay area, near present day Eureka, California. Humboldt Bay had been recently rediscovered by gold miners seeking a faster and cheaper route to transport supplies. An early settlement in the area was also named Uniontown, but is now known as Arcata. During this period, prospectors and their suppliers were often flush with gold, but had little to spend it on.|$|E
5|$|O'Connell {{was born}} to {{distinguished}} lawyer Charles O'Connell in 1849 in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, some {{two years after the}} death of his famed grand-uncle Daniel O'Connell. Young O'Connell attended Belvedere College, a Jesuit school in Dublin, but was called home at the deaths of his mother and sister in a coach accident. This tragic event was later judged to be the source of O'Connell's sense of the impermanence of the world. After the funeral, he was transferred without enthusiasm to Clongowes Wood College where he studied the classics for three years. O'Connell signed on with the Royal Navy as a midshipman. He travelled around Cape Horn <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1868.|$|E
5|$|Shannon (1941–1955), named Shannon II in America, was an {{outstanding}} Australian Thoroughbred racehorse who {{was inducted into}} the Hall of Fame. He created new racecourse records in Australia before he was sold to an American buyer who exported him <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> 1948. There Shannon equalled the world record of 1:47 for the nine furlongs (1,800 metres) in winning the Forty Niner Handicap Stakes, then one week later equalled the world record of 1:59 for a mile and a quarter (2,000 metres). Shannon was named the 1948 American Champion Older Male Horse. At stud in America he proved to be a good sire.|$|E

5|$|Some {{events and}} their timing are unclear during this early period. Sources {{disagree}} {{on whether he}} brought his family to California from Illinois in 1852 or 1854. Carranco dates Seth's first return to Illinois starting in 1850, with his return <b>to</b> <b>California</b> <b>in</b> August 1852, his arrival in Humboldt County in February 1853, another return to Illinois in September 1853, and a trip back to California starting in May 1854 with his mother, two children, and a herd of cattle. Thus, {{in the course of}} the six years 1849-1854, he is believed to have crossed the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains five times, travelling mostly on foot.|$|E

5|$|The loss of {{a charismatic}} and {{dominant}} leader often precipitates the decline of such groups, but the Spirit Fruit Society persevered. This made the society unique among other groups of this time. Though the commune continued after his death, their two publications, Spirit Voice and Spirit Fruit, ceased to be produced. Virginia Moore was chosen president of the society upon Beilhart's death, and the community stayed together and carried on its activities as before. In 1911, the society put an advertisement in the local papers seeking to sell their lakefront property and 'temple'. Virginia Moore stated that the Illinois climate was not suitable for their activities and the decision {{had been made to}} move <b>to</b> <b>California.</b> <b>In</b> the winter of 1914–1915, the society moved west.|$|E
