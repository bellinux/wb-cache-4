25|$|Aguirre {{is helping}} Senator Grassley's staff examine 21,000 Federal Reserve (the Fed) {{transactions}} involving taxpayer funds distributed to {{banks and other}} financial institutions. The Fed was forced to reveal the information by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by Bloomberg News and Fox News, as well as provisions contained in Wall Street reform legislation. Despite pronouncements by the Fed about its transparency, the information released has been incomplete. The lack of details {{make it impossible to}} tell just how much profit the recipients of <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>are</b> making and only the recipients' names and amount of funds are known. Aguirre says that between $3 and $4 trillion in cash transfers were made and another $9 to $11 trillion in commitments that taxpayer funds would cover the cost of failed investments. “It looks like they are borrowing the money from the Fed, say, at 70 cents on the dollar and selling it back to the Fed for 90 cents. We can’t tell for certain because the Fed won’t tell us. The Fed publishes information but not enough for you {{to figure out what the}} hell happened,” Aguirre said.|$|E
500|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a method by which a {{creditor}} can hold a security interest in loans, through inserting a clause into the contract which limits the purposes for which the borrower can use the money. If <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>are</b> used for a different purpose, a trust is created around {{the money for the}} benefit of the moneylender. This allows the moneylender to trace any inappropriately spent funds, and, in the case of the borrower's insolvency, prevents the money from being taken by creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd, in which Lord Wilberforce maintained that in Quistclose situations, the intention must be to create a secondary trust {{for the benefit of the}} moneylender, arising if the [...] "primary trust" [...] (the appropriate use of the money) is not fulfilled. The idea of a primary and secondary trust comes from Toovey v Milne, where money was lent by A to B, to pay off his debts. When B went bankrupt and returned the money to A, the courts held that the creditors could not recover this money, as it was held in a form comparable to a trust. Most situations in which a trust will arise require that a specific use of the money is identified by the contract.|$|E

Robinson III was sufficiently damaged by his past personal record that Republican state party officials refused to endorse him. Kennedy got 73percent of the general election vote, with Robinson splitting the rest with Libertarian Carla Howell. [...] During the long, disputed post-presidential election battle in Florida in 2000, Kennedy supported Vice President Al Gore's legal actions. After the bitter contest was over, many Democrats in Congress {{did not want to}} work with incoming President George W. Bush. Kennedy, however, saw Bush as genuinely interested in a major overhaul of elementary and secondary education, Bush saw Kennedy as a potential major ally in the Senate, and the two partnered together on the legislation. Kennedy accepted provisions governing mandatory student testing and teacher accountability that other Democrats and the National Education Association did not like, in return for increased funding levels for education. The No Child Left Behind Act was passed by Congress in May and June 2001 and signed into law by Bush in January 2002. [...] Kennedy soon became disenchanted with the implementation of the act, however, saying for 2003 that it was $9billion short of the $29billion authorized. Kennedy said, [...] "The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>are</b> not," [...] and accused Bush of not living up to his personal word on the matter. Other Democrats concluded that Kennedy's penchant for cross-party deals had gotten the better of him. The White House defended its spending levels given the context of two wars going on.|$|E
