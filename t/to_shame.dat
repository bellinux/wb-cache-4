5|$|Decades after Yue's death, {{the later}} Emperor Xiaozong of Song honored Yue Fei as a {{national}} hero in 1162, providing him proper burial and memorial of a shrine.

5|$|The Allied {{victory at}} Salamis ended the {{immediate}} threat to Greece, and Xerxes now returned to Asia {{with part of}} the army, leaving his general Mardonius to attempt to complete the conquest. Mardonius wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly, and the Athenians were thus {{able to return to}} their city, which had been burnt and razed by the Persians, for the winter. For the Athenians, and Themistocles personally, the winter would be a testing one. The Peloponnesians refused to countenance marching north of the Isthmus to fight the Persian army; the Athenians tried <b>to</b> <b>shame</b> them into doing so, with no success.|$|E

5|$|A {{narrative}} pattern follows, whereby Cet {{demands a}} challenge, an Ulster warrior rises, and the Ulaid cry out {{the name of}} the challenger; Cet then proceeds <b>to</b> <b>shame</b> that warrior by recounting one of his deeds against him, as above. Cet shames the challenger Óengus son of Lam Gabuid, by recounting how he had cut off Lam Gabuid's hands in battle; he shames Éogan son of Durthacht, the king of Fermag, by recounting how he put out his eye in a cattle-raid; he reminds Muinremur son of Gerrgend how he had taken his son's head as a trophy not six days earlier; Mend son of Salchad, how he had cut off his father's foot; Celtchair son of Uthecar, how he had castrated him with his spear; and even Conchobar's son Cúscraid Mend Machae, how he had pierced his neck with a spear during Cúscraid's first feat of arms, in ignominious circumstances which led to the abandonment a third of Cúscraid's retinue in a cowardly retreat. In each case, the challenging warriors are compelled to retake their seats in shame.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI <b>to</b> <b>shame,</b> yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

25|$|A {{person may}} {{experience}} multiple orgasms, or an involuntary orgasm, {{such as in}} the case of rape or other sexual assault. An involuntary orgasm from forced sexual contact often results in feelings of shame caused by internalization of victim-blaming attitudes. The incidence of those who experience unsolicited sexual contact and experience orgasm is very low, though possibly under-reported due <b>to</b> <b>shame</b> or embarrassment; such orgasms additionally happen regardless of gender.|$|E
25|$|A white feather {{has been}} a {{traditional}} symbol of cowardice, used and recognised especially within the British Army and in countries of the British Empire since the 18th century, especially by patriotic groups, including some early feminists, in order <b>to</b> <b>shame</b> men who were not soldiers. It also carries opposite meanings, however: in some cases of pacifism, and in the United States, of extraordinary bravery and excellence in combat marksmanship.|$|E
40|$|The {{tendency}} <b>to</b> experience <b>shame</b> or {{guilt is}} associated differentially with anxiety, depression and substance abuse, with shame {{being associated with}} greater psychopathology. Recent interventions designed <b>to</b> decrease <b>shame</b> emphasize mindfulness or self-compassion. The present study investigated correlational relationships of shame-proneness and guilt-proneness with mindfulness and with self-compassion in undergraduate participants. Shame-proneness was strongly negatively correlated with all facets of mindfulness and with self-compassion, while guilt-proneness was weakly positively correlated with self-compassion and some facets of mindfulness. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that shame-proneness was predicted by self-compassion but not by mindfulness. More frequent meditation was associated with greater mindfulness and self-compassion and lower shame-proneness, but not guilt-proneness. Limitations {{of the study and}} implications of the findings for interventions <b>to</b> reduce <b>shame</b> are discussed. Hannah Woods, Michael Proev...|$|R

25|$|A {{child must}} never put a parent <b>to</b> <b>shame,</b> or speak arrogantly to a parent.

25|$|Gay pride or LGBT {{pride is}} the {{positive}} stance against discrimination and violence toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people {{to promote their}} self-affirmation, dignity, equality rights, increase their visibility as a social group, build community, and celebrate sexual diversity and gender variance. Pride, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>shame</b> and social stigma, is the predominant outlook that bolsters most LGBT rights movements throughout the world.
