We study <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laryngeal tube and hypopharynx on the synthesized voice using the proposed model.

5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited to <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo in <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> a vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E
