Ruaidhri, ri Alban, a suis occisus est, that is, that Findláech was killed by his own people. No {{reason for this is}} given, but the logical thing is to conclude that his successor, his nephew Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti, {{had something to do with}} it. Indeed, the Annals of Tigernach <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sons of Máel Brigte were responsible; the only sons we know of are Máel Coluim and Gille Coemgáin, both of whom evidently benefited from the killing, as both succeeded to the throne.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s {{pioneering}} work of Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and others, scientists have developed techniques {{that attempt to}} use genetic markers to indicate the ethnic background and history of individual people.

This conclusion from a genetic perspective supports a large amount of archaeological, anthropological, and linguistic evidence that Native American peoples' ancestors migrated from Asia at the latest 16,500–13,000 years ago.

50|$|We {{compute the}} cohomology of CPn using the fibration:Now, on the E2 page, in the 0,0 {{coordinate}} {{we have the}} identity of the ring. In the 0,1 coordinate, we have an element i that generates Z. However, we know <b>that</b> by <b>the</b> limit page, there can only be nontrivial generators in degree 2n+1 <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> generator i must transgress to some element x in the 2,0 coordinate. Now, this <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> there must be an element ix in the 2,1 coordinate. We then see that d(ix) = x2 by <b>the</b> Leibniz rule <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 4,0 coordinate must be x2 since there can be no nontrivial homology until degree 2n+1. Repeating this argument inductively until 2n+1 gives ixn in coordinate 2n,1 which must then be the only generator of Z in <b>that</b> degree thus <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2n+1,0 coordinate must be 0. Reading off the horizontal bottom row of the spectral sequence gives us the cohomology ring of CPn and it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> answer is Zx/xn+1.|$|R

500|$|After {{speaking}} about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> word 'molecule' is a modern word.

[...] We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. [...] At this point, however, Maxwell notes {{that no one has}} ever seen or handled a molecule.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, Eakins was using {{photography}} to explore sequential movement {{and as a}} reference for painting. Some time in 1883 or 1884, he photographed his students engaged in outdoor activities. Four photographs of his students swimming naked in Dove Lake have survived, and bear a clear relationship to The Swimming Hole. The swimmers are seen {{in the same spot}} and from the same vantage point, although their positions are entirely different from those in the painting. None of the photographs closely matches the poses depicted in the painting; this was unusual for Eakins, who typically adhered closely to his photographic studies. [...] "The divergence between these sets of images may hint at lost or destroyed pictures, or it may <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> photographs came first, before Eakins' mental image had crystallized, and before the execution of his first oil sketch. The poses in the photographs are more spontaneous, while those of the painting are deliberately composed with a classical [...] "severity". Although no photographic studies have survived that would suggest a more direct connection between the photographs and the painting, recent scholarship has proposed that marks incised onto the canvas and later covered by paint indicate that Eakins made use of light-projected photographs.|$|E
500|$|The English {{tradition}} of semi-opera, to which The Fairy-Queen belongs, demanded {{that most of}} the music within the play be introduced through the agency of supernatural beings, the exception being pastoral or drunken characters. All the masques in The Fairy-Queen are presented by Titania or Oberon. Originally Act I contained no music, but due to the work's enormous success it was revived in 1693, when Purcell added the scene of the Drunken Poet and two further songs later on in the work; [...] "Ye gentle spirits of the air" [...] and [...] "The Plaint". As noted above, each masque is subtly related to the action in the play during that particular act in a metaphorical way. In this manner we have Night and Sleep in Act II, which is apt as that act of the play consists of Oberon's plans to use the power of the [...] "love-in-idleness" [...] flower to confuse various loves, and it is therefore appropriate for the allegorical figures of Secrecy, Mystery et al. to [...] usher in a night of enchantment. The masque for Bottom in Act III includes metamorphoses, songs of both real and feigned love, and beings who are not what they seem. The Reconciliation masque between Oberon and Titania at the end of Act IV prefigures the final masque. The scene changes to a Garden of Fountains, denoting King William's hobby, just after Oberon says [...] "bless these Lovers' Nuptial Day". The Four Seasons <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> marriage here celebrated is a good one all year round and [...] "All Salute the rising Sun"/...The Birthday of King Oberon". The kings of England were traditionally likened to the sun (Oberon = William. Significantly, William and Mary were married on his birthday, 4 November.). The Chinese scene in the final masque is in homage to Queen Mary's famous collection of china. The garden shown above it and the exotic animals bring King William back into the picture and Hymen's song in praise of their marriage, plus the stage direction bringing (Mary's) china vases containing (William's) orange trees {{to the front of the}} stage complete the symbolism.|$|E

2500|$|Lighting {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{innovations}} of the polyptych. The panels contain complex light effects and subtle plays of shadow, the rendering of which was achieved through new techniques of handling both oil paint and transparent glazes. The figures are mostly cast with short, diagonal shadows which serve to, in the words of art historian Till-Holger Borchert, [...] "not only heighten their spatial presence, but also <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> primary light source is located beyond the picture itself." [...] In the Annunciation scene, shadows imply that they emanate from the daylight within the chapel in which they are housed.|$|E

2500|$|It is also possible, {{although}} experimentally difficult, {{to estimate}} {{the mass of the}} Higgs boson indirectly. In the Standard Model, the Higgs boson has a number of indirect effects; most notably, Higgs loops result in tiny corrections to masses of W and Z bosons. Precision measurements of electroweak parameters, such as the Fermi constant and masses of W/Z bosons, can be used to calculate constraints on the mass of the Higgs. As of July 2011, the precision electroweak measurements <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mass of the Higgs boson is likely to be less than about [...] at 95% confidence level (this upper limit would increase to [...] if the lower bound of [...] from the LEP-2 direct search is allowed for). These indirect constraints rely {{on the assumption that the}} Standard Model is correct. It may still be possible to discover a Higgs boson above these masses if it is accompanied by other particles beyond those predicted by the Standard Model.|$|E

2500|$|There {{remains the}} {{possibility}} that Alba is simply a Gaelic translation of the Pictish name for Pictland. Both the Welsh and the Irish use archaic words for Briton to describe the Picts. It is very likely therefore that the Picts did so themselves; or {{if they did not}} originally, they came to do so. In which case the Pictish for Pictland would have been either the same as their word for Britain, or an obsolete term. Alba was exactly this kind of word in Old Irish. It is therefore plausible that Alba is simply a Gaelic translation. The name change is first registered {{at the very beginning of}} the tenth century, [...] not long before Constantine II is alleged to have Scotticised the [...] "Pictish" [...] Church, and at the height of Viking raids. Later records, especially the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba and other documents in the Poppleton Manuscript, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Picts were simply conquered and annihilated by king Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín). This is the traditional explanation, and the one repeated by many historians. [...] The only thing which is certain is that before 900, [...] the Cruithentuath (Gaelic for Pictland), and perhaps Fortriu, became Gaelic-speaking Alba.|$|E

5000|$|Suppose we wish {{to perform}} a query in this structure, for q = 50. We first do a {{standard}} binary search for q in M1, finding the value 641,5.

More precisely, binary searching for q in M3 would return either the value 622,3 at position 3, or the value 441,2 one place earlier. A comparison of q with the smaller value 44 shows <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> correct search result in M3 is 622,3.
