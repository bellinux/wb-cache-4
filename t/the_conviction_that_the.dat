The School aims at providing a centre of common awareness and a sense of human responsibility, making the University more than a complex of specialist departments. In addition, it is committed to the achievement of academic and linguistic excellence, creativity and all-round development of students. The courses offered in the School reflect these objectives and concerns.|$|E
25|$|The Geschichte der Halbinsel Morea set Fallmerayer at loggerheads {{with the}} European philhellenes in general, {{and with the}} Bavarian King Ludwig I in particular, a {{convinced}} philhellene who already in 1829 had begun to advance the candidacy of his son, Otto, for the Greek throne (Otto became King of Greece in 1832). Ludwig's philhellenism was in fact grounded in <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Greek revolt against Ottoman rule represented the return of antique Hellenic virtue. Ludwig's displeasure with Fallmerayer led to a long delay in the confirmation of Fallmerayer's election to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.|$|E

25|$|The Royalists {{were now}} {{fighting}} with the courage of despair. Those who still fought against Charles did so with the full determination to ensure the triumph of their cause, and with <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only possible way was the annihilation of the enemy's armed forces. The majority, however, were so weary of the war that the Earl of Manchester's Presbyterian royalism, which contributed so materially to the prolongation of the struggle, {{would probably have been}} accepted by four-fifths of all England as the basis of a peace. It was, in fact, in the face of almost universal opposition, that Fairfax and Cromwell and their friends at Westminster guided the cause of their weaker comrades to complete victory.|$|E

Is evident that, in this short examples, the coincidence of Barret with the characteristic tone of the regenerationist wave that flooded the Spanish thoughts because of the “disaster” of the ’98 and that have its main exponents in Costa, Picavea, Isern, and others, and its algid points in the press with the famous article published in “El tiempo”, a journal of the conservationist opposition, August 16 of 1898.

25|$|The work {{is unique}} in the period because of Mary's swoon; her {{collapse}} echoes the pose of her son, {{as far as to}} the two figures that hold her as she falls. This pose was entirely new for Early Netherlandish art. The sentiment, however, is a direct reflection of the mystical devotion expressed by Thomas à Kempis' popular treatise The Imitation of Christ, first published in 1418. The text, just as the image here, invites the reader or viewer to personally identify with the suffering of Christ and Mary. The doctrines of Denis the Carthusian also emphasized the significance of the Virgin Mary and her belief in Christ at the moment of his death. Denis expresses <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary was near death when Christ gave up his spirit; Van der Weyden's painting powerfully conveys this idea.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of his {{philosophy}} is a view of humanity as greater than the contexts in which it is placed. He sees each individual possessed of the capability to rise to a greater life. At the root of his social thought is <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world is made and imagined. His work begins from the premise that no natural social, political, or economic arrangements underlie individual or social activity. Property rights, liberal democracy, wage labor—for Unger, these are all historical artifacts that have no necessary relation to the goals of free and prosperous human activity. For Unger, the market, the state, and human social organization should not be set in predetermined institutional arrangements, but need to be left open to experimentation and revision according to what works for the project of individual and collective empowerment. Doing so, he holds, will enable human liberation.|$|E
500|$|On 30 July, the RSK {{declared}} a state of war and the RSK President Milan Martić stated that the Croatian territorial gains would soon be reversed in cooperation with the VRS. VRS Supreme Commander Colonel General Ratko Mladić visited Knin the same day, also promising to restore the territory lost that month. However, the RSK military concluded that the VRS had no units in western Bosnia capable of the attack. Analyses of the RSK military showed that the HV had saved the Bihać pocket for the second time and that it was preparing to attack the RSK at several points. Following the offensive, the RSK authorities reported fear and panic among the population caused by <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> RSK could not defend itself against the HV. [...] On 2 August, the RSK civil defence authorities ordered preparation for evacuation of the RSK, and the RSK prime minister Milan Babić asked the government ministers to prepare to move to Donji Lapac. Women and children started to evacuate to FR Yugoslavia, while a mobilization of the RSK military was largely completed by 3 August.|$|E

500|$|Sociobiology {{attracted}} {{a large number}} of critical reviews, not only by biologists, but by social scientists who objected especially to Wilson's application of Darwinian thinking to humans, asserting that Wilson was implying a form of biological determinism. It was, unusually, reviewed {{on the front page of}} the New York Times in May 1975, and again in November that year as the controversy grew. The paper described the effect as [...] "a period of ferment", naming the [...] "monumental" [...] book as the [...] "yeast" [...] The Times noted that the debate was an updated version of the nature or nurture argument that had simmered ever since Darwin's time: [...] "The assertion that man's body is a biological machine, subject to biological rules, has never completely shaken <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> human intellect and human behavior are unique, the subject of free will." [...] The paper reported that Wilson's colleague at Harvard, Richard Lewontin, had issued a 5,000 word attack on the book, and that the [...] "meticulous" [...] Wilson had said [...] "I've tried to be extremely cautious in all this". The paper noted that Wilson had nowhere actually said that human behaviour was totally determined by genes, and reported him as saying that a rough figure was 10 percent genetic.|$|E

As a result, creation science also challenges the commonly accepted geologic and astrophysical theories for the age and origins of the Earth and Universe, which creationists acknowledge are irreconcilable to the account in the Book of Genesis.|$|E
2500|$|According to Daniel Hallin, the {{dramatic}} {{structure of the}} uncensored [...] "living room war" [...] as reported during 19651967 remained simple and traditional: [...] "the forces of good were locked in battle once again with the forces of evil.

[...] During late 1967 MACV had also begun to disregard the decision it had made at the Honolulu Conference that the military should leave the justification of the war to elected officials in Washington.

[...] "We are learning toleration," [...] one student {{said in an interview with}} the Woman's Journal.

2500|$|Professor Gerhard von Rad of Heidelberg University in the mid-20th-century {{argued that}} the {{ordinances}} for standardizing the cult and establishing only one sanctuary are the most distinctive feature in Deuteronomy's new arrangements for ordering Israel's life before God. Von Rad cited [...] and [...] among {{a small number of}} “centralizing laws” that he argued belong closely together and were a special, later stratum in Deuteronomy. Von Rad {{argued that the}}se texts indicate that Israel's cult had become completely lacking in unity, celebrating at former Canaanite shrines intended for Baal. The instructions to centralize the cult sprang from <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cult in the different country shrines could no longer be reincorporated into the ordinances of a pure faith in God. Jewish educators Sorel Goldberg Loeb and Barbara Binder Kadden wrote that Von Rad saw the Book of Deuteronomy and the discussion of sacrifices in particular as a way of getting the Israelites back on track, as the Israelites had been influenced by other nations whose worship habits did not coincide with the Israelite belief system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{motivation}} of the German soldiers tumbled.

[...] Until the German army's failed Spring offensive the German army was not as badly affected by [...] "flight from the flag" [...] (desertion) as the entente armies, however. [...] Initially, during the 1918 spring offensive, German troop motivation and morale surged, only crumbling again after the offensive failed. [...] Thaer commented in his diary, [...] "personally I had to force myself to <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> troops now operated under a crushing burden of disappointment. [...] The attacking spirit of 21 March and the days that followed which I experienced to the south of Arras 4- 6 weeks ago was no longer there. ...

"it {{would seem}} {{necessary}} to underline {{the fact that}} the three types of exception to the rule concerning the return of the child must be applied only so far as they go and no further.

In fact, the Convention as a whole rests upon the unanimous rejection of this phenomenon of illegal child removals and upon <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> best way to combat them at an international level is to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practical application of this principle requires that the signatory States be convinced that they belong, despite their differences, to the same legal community within which the authorities of each State acknowledge that the authorities of one of them – those of the child's habitual residence – are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic invocation of the said exceptions, substituting the forum chosen by the abductor for that of the child's residence, would lead to the collapse of the whole structure of the Convention by depriving it of the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration." ...|$|E
