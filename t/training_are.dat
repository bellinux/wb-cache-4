5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in <b>training</b> <b>are</b> topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, while {{enrichment}} and <b>training</b> <b>are</b> {{related to}} increases in spine formation and stability, long-term sensory deprivation leads {{to an increase in}} the rate of spine elimination and therefore impacts long-term neural circuitry. Upon restoring sensory experience after deprivation in adolescence, spine elimination is accelerated, suggesting that experience {{plays an important role in}} the net loss of spines during development. In addition, other sensory deprivation paradigms—such as whisker trimming—have been shown to increase the stability of new spines.|$|E

25|$|First and {{foremost}} a family dog, the Leonberger's temperament {{is one of its}} most important and distinguishing characteristics. Well socialized and trained, the Leonberger is self-assured, insensitive to noise, submissive to family members, friendly toward children, well composed with passersby, and self-disciplined when obliging its family or property with protection. Robust, loyal, intelligent, playful, and kindly, they can thus be taken anywhere without difficulty and adjust easily to a variety of circumstances, including the introduction of other dogs.However, a Leonberger attacked a child. Proper control and early socialization and <b>training</b> <b>are</b> essential, as this is a giant breed.|$|E
