2500|$|On 16 September 2010, a ministerial panel {{headed by}} Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak made a final {{decision}} to purchase 20 new F-35 fighter jets, despite opposition {{from a number of}} senior defense officials over the high cost of the deal.

50|$|Two weeks earlier, on February 11, 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> {{identified}} <b>the</b> {{problem and}} informed the U.S. Army and the PATRIOT Project Office, the software manufacturer.

2500|$|During the 2006 Lebanon War, Cole accused {{both sides}} of {{committing}} [...] "war crimes" [...] against civilians.

5000|$|In the Mitzpe Yishai {{neighborhood}} {{of the illegal}} Israeli settlement Kedumim, there are issues that <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> improperly taken control of private Palestinian land. The Israeli Civil Administration calls it [...] "theft", though it occurred in an [...] "orderly manner", but without any official authorization.|$|E
50|$|By {{the evening}} of June 9, <b>the</b> four <b>Israeli</b> brigades <b>had</b> all broken through to the plateau, {{where they could be}} {{reinforced}} and replaced. Thousands of reinforcements began reaching the front, those tanks and half-tracks that had survived the previous day's fighting were refueled and replenished with ammunition, and the wounded were evacuated. By dawn, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> eight brigades in the sector.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> {{advanced}} to positions some 101 kilometres from Egypt's capital, Cairo, and occupied 1,600 square kilometres west of the Suez Canal. They had also cut the Cairo-Suez road and encircled the bulk of Egypt's Third Army. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> also taken many prisoners after Egyptian soldiers, including many officers, began surrendering in masses {{towards the end of}} the war. The Egyptians held a narrow strip on the east bank of the canal, occupying some 1,200 square kilometres of the Sinai. One source estimated that the Egyptians had 70,000 men, 720 tanks and 994 artillery pieces on the east bank of the canal. However, 30,000 to 45,000 of them were now encircled by <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In their leaflet campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> warned {{repeatedly}} {{they would}} consider minivans, trucks and motorcycles as targets. A UN official said: [...] "The minivans are {{a target for}} Israel because they can take Katyusha rockets for Hezbollah, so they do not contemplate too long. They just shoot it." ...|$|E

50|$|Rising {{tensions}} in the Middle East led French President Charles de Gaulle to embargo <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Mirage 5s on 3 June 1967. The Mirages continued to roll off the production line, {{even though they were}} embargoed, and by 1968 the batch was complete and <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> provided final payments.|$|R
5000|$|In September, {{the court}} {{ruled in favor of}} <b>Israelis</b> who <b>had</b> been {{expelled}} from their home four years earlier after a Palestinian they had purchased it from claimed that it had been [...] "stolen". <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> provided a film of him receiving the money paid for the building.|$|R

50|$|While it is {{difficult}} to understand why the Army had such difficulty obtaining what {{would seem to be a}} relatively simple technology, part of the problem seems to be specsmanship. The Israelis were able to make use of battlefield UAVs quickly because they had simple requirements. The weather in the Middle East is generally hot, sunny, and clear, and <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> a relatively fixed set of adversaries who mostly live right on their border.|$|E
25|$|The Arabs {{claimed that}} <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> massacred Arab civilians, but <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> {{rejected}} <b>the</b> claims.

Traffic along the Haifa-Hadera coastal railway was also restored.|$|R
50|$|Israel desires {{a strong}} {{economic}} system for Palestine. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> government <b>has</b> created and distributed areas to expand Palestine’s trade system, which includes import/export passages, information, specific economic sectors and transportation.

50|$|Sharon and the faction who {{supported}} his disengagement proposals left the Likud party after the disengagement {{and created the}} new Kadima party. This new party supported unilateral disengagement {{from most of the}} West Bank and the fixing of borders by the Israeli West Bank barrier. The basic premise of the policy was that <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> no viable negotiating partner on the Palestinian side, and since they cannot remain in indefinite occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel should unilaterally withdraw.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> upheld {{substantial}} {{air superiority}} {{for most of}} this time with Israel able to operate almost unopposed; Israel enjoyes near air supremacy against targets anywhere within range in the Middle East and North Africa until today. Regarding aircraft procurement, Israel started with British and French designs, then transitioning to indigenous production and then also design before moving again to purchasing to American designs. The Arabs directly participating in these battles against Israel except for Jordan and to some extent Iraq have commonly used Soviet designs.|$|E
50|$|Though the war {{reinforced}} Israel's military deterrence, it had {{a stunning}} effect on the population in Israel. Following their victory in the Six-Day War, <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> military <b>had</b> become complacent. The shock and sudden reversals that occurred {{at the beginning of}} the war inflicted a terrible psychological blow to <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> who <b>had</b> hitherto experienced no serious military challenges.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> {{broke through}} with tank-led assaults. However, Aviram's forces misjudged the Egyptians' flank, and were pinned between strongholds {{before they were}} {{extracted}} after several hours. By nightfall, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> finished mopping up resistance. <b>Israeli</b> forces <b>had</b> taken significant losses, with Colonel Gonen later telling reporters that [...] "we left many of our dead soldiers in Rafah, and many burnt-out tanks." [...] The Egyptians suffered some 2,000 casualties and lost 40 tanks.|$|R
50|$|Israeli {{armor and}} paratroopers also entered Suez {{in an attempt}} to capture the city, but they were confronted by Egyptian {{soldiers}} and hastily raised local militia forces. They were surrounded, but towards night <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> forces managed to extricate themselves. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> lost 80 dead and 120 wounded, with an unknown number of Egyptian casualties, for no tactical gain (see Battle of Suez).|$|R
50|$|After the 2009 Gaza flotilla, Sawalha {{said that}} the next convoy would avoid the type of {{confrontation}} that had occurred with Egypt: “the confrontation will be directly with the Zionist enemy itself on the high seas.” Interviewed on Iranian PressTV about the 2011 flotilla, Sawalha said: “Now <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> to understand that their policies and crimes will not make us turn away and go back. We will continue under any circumstances until we break the siege on Gaza.” Sawalha organized the autumn 2010 LifeLine 5 convoy to Gaza, which reportedly delivered $5 million of aid to the Hamas government.|$|E
5000|$|American {{military}} strategist {{and historian}} Edward Luttwak drew comparisons with the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where what initially {{looked like an}} Israeli setback later {{turned out to be}} an IDF victory and an Arab defeat. He stated that although some IDF tanks were penetrated by missiles, they also largely limited IDF casualties, and that Hezbollah had failed to inflict massive losses on the IDF and to kill large numbers of Israelis in rocket attacks. Cambridge professor and Peterhouse Fellow Brendan Simms summed up the war this way; [...] "Hezbollah have suffered a setback (but are too clever to admit it) and <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> scored a long-term success (but are too narrow-minded to realize it)." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2006, he was Knighted by the Italian President. Later {{that year}} in November, he {{attended}} the 28th World Federation Japanese Religionists Conference for World Peace in Tokyo, where he concluded that [...] "The Palestinians {{have to give up}} their big dream of historical Palestine and to accept the 1967 borders for their State. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> to give up their dream of Greater Israel and to accept the land of Israel to be within the 1948 borders." [...] Two years later, in April 2008, {{he was one of the}} main speakers at the Doha Debates: [...] "This House believes the Palestinians risk becoming their own worst enemy" [...] in Qatar.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> force {{consisted}} of several armored vehicles and {{armored personnel carriers}} with infantry. They left at 02:00 on December 23 and quickly captured the village. However, the Egyptians withdrew to an antitank position just west. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> not known about this position {{and at least two}} of their vehicles were put out of commission as they approached. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> commander of <b>the</b> raid was killed, the remainder retreated under a smoke screen.|$|R
50|$|On 16 February 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> {{parliament}} <b>had</b> approved <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> disengagement from Gaza, {{which would}} drastically change the Israeli-Palestinian relations in Gaza.|$|R
