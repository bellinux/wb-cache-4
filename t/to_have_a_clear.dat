5|$|In the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{visited the}} RCA Dome {{for the second}} AFC divisional playoff game of the 2005 season. In the fourth quarter {{with only a few}} minutes left in the game, Manning threw what looked to be the game-ending {{interception}} to safety Troy Polamalu, but the interception was overturned (a call the NFL later admitted was incorrect). The Colts went on to score, and got the ball back down three points {{near the end of the}} game. On fourth down, Manning was sacked near his own goal line, and the game seemed to be over as the Steelers were one yard from a touchdown. On the next play, the ball was fumbled by running back Jerome Bettis and picked up by Colts defender Nick Harper who appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> path down the sideline for what might have been the game-winning score. However, Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger dove in front of Harper and tackled him by the leg, saving a touchdown. Then the Colts drove down the field to the Steelers 27-yard line, before Mike Vanderjagt missed a field goal as time ran out.|$|E

500|$|Historians have {{debated whether}} defence or revenue {{collection}} was the gatehouse's primary purpose. The Victorian antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley, {{who wrote the}} first history of the bridge and gate in 1902, described the gatehouse as [...] "a little fortress complete in itself, though of course, useless in time of war". [...] Her account contended that the [...] "tower was {{not in any way}} connected with the fortification walls of the town" [...] and that the gatehouse was erected solely [...] "for the purpose of taking tolls". Kissack follows her argument, noting that the gatehouse was ineffective in defensive terms, as the Monnow could easily be crossed on foot upstream. More recent commentators disagree; Soulsby considered the bridge <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> defensive purpose, and Michael Rowlands, author of the most recent history of the bridge and gatehouse, argued that the bridge and gatehouse met the dual aims of defensive protection and the collection of tolls.|$|E
