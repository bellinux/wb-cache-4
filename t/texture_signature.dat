In this paper an improved road tracker, based on cooperation between angular <b>texture</b> <b>signature</b> and template matching, is presented. Our tracker uses parabola to model the road trajectory and to predict the position of next road centreline point. It employs angular <b>texture</b> <b>signature</b> to get the exact moving direction of current road centreline point, and moves forward one predefined step along the direction to reach a new position, and then uses curvature change to verify the new added road point whether right enough. We also build compactness of angular <b>texture</b> <b>signature</b> polygon to check whether the angular <b>texture</b> <b>signature</b> is suitable to be used to go on tracking. When angular <b>texture</b> <b>signature</b> fails, least squares template matching is then employed instead. Cooperation between angular <b>texture</b> <b>signature</b> and template matching can reliably extract continuous and homogenous ribbon roads on high resolution remotely sensed imagery. 1...|$|E

Texture–based {{computerized}} analysis of high–resolution computed tomography images from patients with interstitial lung dis-eases is introduced to assist radiologists in image interpretation. The cornerstone of our {{approach is to}} learn lung <b>texture</b> <b>signatures</b> using a linear combination of N–th order Riesz templates at multiple scales. The weights of the linear combination are derived from one–versus–all support vector machines. Steerability and multiscale properties of Riesz wavelets allow for scale and rotation covariance of the texture descriptors with infinitesimal precision. Orientations are normalized among texture instances by locally aligning the Riesz templates, which is carried out analytically. The proposed approach is compared with state–of–the–art texture attributes and shows significant improvement in classification performance with an average area under receiver operating characteris-tic curves of 0. 94 for five lung tissue classes.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} texture {{learning}} approach that exploits local organizations of scales and directions. First, linear combinations of Riesz wavelets are learned using kernel support vector machines. The resulting <b>texture</b> <b>signatures</b> are modeling optimal class-wise discriminatory properties. The visualization of the obtained signatures allows verifying the visual {{relevance of the}} learned concepts. Second, the local orientations of the signatures are optimized to maximize their responses, which is carried out analytically and can still be expressed as a linear combination of the initial steerable Riesz templates. The global process is iteratively repeated to obtain final rotation– covariant <b>texture</b> <b>signatures.</b> Rapid convergence of class-wise signatures is observed, which demonstrates that the instances are projected into a feature space that leverages the local organizations of scales and directions. Experimental evaluation reveals average classification accuracies {{in the range of}} 97 % to 98 % for the Outex_TC_ 00010, the Outex_TC_ 00012, and the Contrib_TC_ 00000 suites for even orders of the Riesz transform, and suggests high robustness to changes in images orientation and illumination. The proposed framework requires no arbitrary choices of scales and directions and is expected to perform well in a large range of computer vision applications.

In this thesis we present an approach to track several subjects using multiple cameras in real time. The tracking framework employs a numerical Bayesian estimator, {{also known as a}} particle lter, which has been developed for parallel implementation on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). In order to integrate multiple cameras into a single tracking unit we represent the human body by a parametric ellipsoid in a 3 D world. The elliptical boundary can be projected rapidly, several hundred times per subject per frame, onto any image for comparison with the image data within a likelihood model. Adding variables to encode visibility and persistence into the state vector, we tackle the problems of distraction and short-period occlusion. However, subjects may also disappear for longer periods due to blind spots between cameras elds of view.

However, due to the extreme complex-ity of an urban scene, road extraction in urban areas is challenging.

The proposed approach begins with an image segmentation using a traditional k-means clustering algorithm. The road cluster is automatically identified by using a fuzzy classifier based {{on a set of}} predefined membership functions for road surfaces and on the corresponding normal-ized digital numbers in each multi-spectral band. A number of shape descriptors for the adapted Angular <b>Texture</b> <b>Signature</b> are defined and used to reduce the misclassifications between roads and other spectrally similar objects, such as parking lots, buildings and crop fields.

The most common explanation is the “stuff-and-cut” hypothesis, which describes Neandertals clamping {{down on a}} piece of meat and slicing a portion close to their lips. “Stuff-and-cut” has been accepted as a general aspect of Neandertal behavior without fully assessing its variability. This study analyzes anterior dental microwear textures across habitats, locations, and time intervals to discern possible variation in Neandertal anterior tooth-use behavior. Forty-five Neandertals from 24 sites were analyzed, represented by high-resolution replicas of permanent anterior teeth. The labial surface was scanned for antemortem microwear using a white-light confocal profiler. The resultant 3 D-point clouds, representing 204  ×  276  μm for each specimen, were uploaded into SSFA software packages for texture characterization. Statistical analyses, including MANOVAs, ANOVAs, and pairwise comparisons, were completed on ranked microwear data. Neandertal descriptive statistics were also compared to 10 bioarchaeological samples of known or inferred dietary and behavioral regimes. The Neandertal sample varied significantly by habitat, suggesting this factor was a principal driving force for differences in Neandertal anterior tooth-use behaviors.

In this paper, we present a detection rate optimized bit allocation (DROBA) principle, which assigns more bits to discriminative features and fewer bits to nondiscriminative features. We further propose a dynamic programming (DP) approach and a greedy search (GS) approach to achieve DROBA. Experiments of DROBA on the FVC 2000 fingerprint database and the FRGC face database show good performances. As a universal method, DROBA is applicable to arbitrary biometric modalities, such as fingerprint <b>texture,</b> iris, <b>signature,</b> and face. DROBA will bring significant benefits not only to the template protection systems but also to the systems with fast matching requirements or constrained storage capability.|$|R
