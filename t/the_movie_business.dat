5|$|Seeking a {{customer}} for Photophone, in late 1927 David Sarnoff, then {{general manager of}} RCA, approached Joseph P. Kennedy about using the system for Kennedy's modest-sized studio, Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Negotiations resulted in General Electric acquiring a substantial interest in FBO—Sarnoff had apparently already conceived of {{a plan for the}} company to attain a central position in the film industry, maximizing Photophone revenue. Next on the agenda was securing a string of exhibition venues like those the leading Hollywood production companies owned. Kennedy began investigating the possibility of such a purchase. Around that time, the large Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) circuit of theaters, built around the then-fading medium of live vaudeville, was attempting a transition to <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business.</b> In mid-1927, the filmmaking operations of Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC) had united under KAO's control. Early in 1928, KAO general manager John J. Murdock, who had assumed the presidency of Pathé, turned to Kennedy as an adviser in consolidating the studio with De Mille's company, PDC. This was the relationship Sarnoff and Kennedy sought.|$|E

500|$|However, the Coens disavow a {{significant}} connection between Faulkner and Mayhew, calling the similarities [...] "superficial".

[...] Unlike Mayhew's inability to write due to drink and personal problems, Faulkner continued to pen novels after working in <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business,</b> winning several awards for fiction completed during and after his time in Hollywood.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{two films}} {{that could have}} catapulted her to star status, Streets of Fire (she turned down Splash and Risky Business for this film) and The Cotton Club, were both {{commercial}} and critical failures, and her career languished as a result.

Critics were appreciative of Kapadia's performance, which earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare. Deepa Karmalkar from Screen characterised her as [...] "gloriously bitchy", while Sukanya Verma from Rediff hailed her as [...] "stunning, striking, storming".|$|E
500|$|The Lithuania-born Volk brothers, Bill and Sidney, came to Minnesota in {{the early}} 1920s and got {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business</b> by purchasing neighborhood theaters during the Great Depression.

The Riverview was designed by architectural firm Liebenberg and Kaplan and built in 1948 in the Streamline Moderne style. It opened December 30, 1948, with a showing of June Bride. The single-screen theater utilized stadium seating, {{making it one of the}} earlier movie theaters to do so.|$|E

Regarding this change in her career path, Fields told Peary in 1980 that [...] "All these young filmmakers are possessive. They feel I belong to them, and they feel a certain resentment - that I went to the other side. In calmer moments, of course, they know it isn't true, that I can do more for them now." [...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün. They're {{executives}} who actually made records. In <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business,</b> as an executive who's worked with film, you have only Verna.

Ideas ranged from [...] "a narrative story in a surreal fashion with as much money and special effects as possible" [...] to [...] "pockets of all of that or something that's live or the band playing". Although Carey stated that the necessary know-how was at hand due to the band's connections to artists working in <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business,</b> Jones dismissed the idea, saying [...] "It's just talk right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the character of W.P. Mayhew and novelist William Faulkner. Like Mayhew, Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of Southern literature and later worked in <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business.</b> Like Faulkner, Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood. Faulkner's name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book City of Nets, which the Coens read while creating Barton Fink. Ethan explained in 1998: [...] "I read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture.... That {{was part of what}} got us going on the whole Barton Fink thing." [...] Faulkner worked on a wrestling film called Flesh (1932), which starred Wallace Beery, the actor for whom Barton is writing. The focus on wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens, as they participated in the sport in high school.|$|E

[...] The Motion Picture earned $17million within a week. At its widest domestic distribution, the film was shown in 1,002 theaters; it grossed $82,258,456 in the United States, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1979 in that country. Overall, the film grossed $139million worldwide. The Motion Picture was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Art Direction (Harold Michelson, Joseph R. Jennings, Leon Harris, John Vallone and Linda DeScenna), Best Visual Effects, and Best Original Score.|$|E
500|$|Looking to {{forestall}} the impending legal imbroglio in early 1954, Hughes {{offered to buy}} out all of RKO's other stockholders. Convinced that the studio was sinking, Walt Disney ended his arrangement with RKO and set up his own distribution firm, Buena Vista Pictures. Virtual, but not quite actual. Floyd Odlum reemerged to block Hughes from acquiring the 95% ownership of RKO stock he needed to write off the company's losses against his earnings elsewhere. Hughes had reneged on his promise to give Odlum first option on buying the RKO theater chain when he divested it and was now paying the price. With negotiations between the two at a stalemate, in July 1955, Hughes turned around and sold RKO pictures to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25 million. For Hughes, this was the effective end of a quarter-century's involvement in <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business.</b> Historian Betty Lasky describes Hughes's relationship with RKO as a [...] "systematic seven-year rape." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{days before}} the ceremony, activist group Rainbow Coalition, led by Reverend Jesse Jackson, planned a protest {{regarding}} African Americans and other racial minorities in the film industry. The group was voicing its objections to unflattering portrayals of minorities in film and television {{and the fact that}} minorities were underemployed in the entertainment industry. Jackson further pointed out the disparity in racial minorities in Hollywood by noting that Best Live Action Short Film nominee Dianne Houston was the only African American nominated that year. Although the group initially planned to demonstrate outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, an agreement between Jackson and producer Jones caused the protest to be moved adjacent to the broadcast facilities of the local ABC affiliate KABC-TV. Nevertheless, Jones remarked that the Academy Awards were not the appropriate venue for such protest declaring [...] "Why should <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business</b> be different from anything else in America?
