5|$|Of all <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> {{that make}} up the Metacomet Ridge, West Rock, in New Haven, Connecticut, bears special mention because it was not formed by the {{volcanic}} flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an enormous volcanic dike through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island is a {{distinct}} terrestrial ecoregion known as the Lord Howe Island subtropical forests. It {{is part of the}} Australasia ecozone and shares many biotic affinities with Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. Almost half of the island's native plants are endemic and many of the island's unique plants grow on or around the mountain summits where the height has allowed the development of a true cloud forest and many different microhabitats from sealevel to <b>the</b> <b>summits.</b> One of the best known is Howea, an endemic genus of palms (Arecaceae) that are commonly known as kentia palms and make handsome houseplants. Annual exports provide a revenue of over A$2million, providing the only major industry on the island apart from tourism.|$|E
5|$|The {{palatial}} structures at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos were erected on <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> {{of hills}} or rocky outcrops, dominating the immediate surroundings. The best preserved {{are found in}} Pylos and Tiryns, while Mycenae and the Menelaion are only partially preserved. In Central Greece, Thebes and Orchomenos have been only partially exposed. On the other hand, the palace built at the acropolis of Athens has been almost completely destroyed. A substantial building at Dimini in Thessaly, possibly ancient Iolcos, is believed {{by a number of}} archaeologists to be a palace. A Mycenaean palace has been also unearthed in Laconia, near the modern village of Xirokambi.|$|E

5|$|Three of the {{earliest}} recorded observers of the volcanoes were the Scottish scientists Archibald Menzies in 1794, James Macrae in 1825, and David Douglas in 1834. Just reaching <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> proved daunting: Menzies took three attempts to ascend Mauna Loa, and Douglas died {{on the slopes of}} Mauna Kea. The United States Exploring Expedition spent several months studying the islands in 1840–1841. American geologist James Dwight Dana was on that expedition, as was Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, who spent most of the time leading a team of hundreds that hauled a pendulum to the summit of Mauna Loa to measure gravity. Dana stayed with missionary Titus Coan, who would provide decades of first-hand observations. Dana published a short paper in 1852.|$|E
5|$|Around 1730, the Baroque style {{gradually}} {{began to}} break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} from the Admiralty required a detailed geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly whether they rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of tides measured with specially constructed gauges. He chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work. Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a limited range of native plants and no land birds, but hermit crabs everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of the theory he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank. This idea was supported by the numerous soundings FitzRoy had taken showing a steep slope outside the reef with no living corals below 20–30 fathoms (10–15m).|$|E

2500|$|The Fourth EAS was {{significantly}} delayed and its location changed {{a number of}} times due to internal tensions in Thailand, the host nation. In the lead up to <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> there were several border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia. <b>The</b> <b>summit</b> however is said to be used as an opportunity for discussions on the sidelines between the respective nation's leaders. <b>The</b> <b>summit</b> was cancelled following protesters taking over <b>the</b> <b>summit's</b> venue on <b>the</b> day of <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> [...] It was rescheduled and held on 25 October 2009. <b>The</b> <b>summit</b> adopted statements on disaster relief and the Nalanda University.|$|R

5|$|The Columbia Gorge AVA {{is found}} in the Columbia Gorge. This region {{straddles}} the Columbia River, and thus lies in both Oregon and Washington; it is made up of Hood River and Wasco counties in Oregon, and Skamania and Klickitat counties in Washington. The region lies to the east of <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> of nearby Mount Hood and Mount Adams, situated in their rain shadows; thus, the region is significantly drier than the Willamette Valley. It also exhibits significant differences in elevation due to gorge geography, and strong winds common in the area also play a factor in the region's climate. This allows a wide variety of grapes to be grown in the Columbia Gorge. The region has nearly 40 vineyards, growing a wide variety of grapes, including Syrah, Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot gris, Riesling, and Sangiovese.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ascent of}} Mont Blanc in 1786 by Jacques Balmat and Michel Paccard {{initiated}} {{the sport of}} alpine mountaineering, and {{it was during the}} golden age of alpinism (185465) and the silver age of alpinism (186582) {{that the majority of the}} main summits of the massif were first attained. Members of the England-based Alpine Club were instrumental in many of the first ascents, usually accompanied by guides from the towns of Chamonix or Courmayeur, such as Michel Croz, Michel Payot and Émile Rey, as well as the Swiss guide, Christian Almer. Across the massif there are now more than two thousand different mountaineering routes to <b>the</b> <b>summits,</b> ranging greatly in both length and difficulty. These attract climbers from all over the world who, unlike the early ascensionists, now have access to numerous climbing guidebooks, modern safety equipment, good information on climbing routes and technical difficulty, as well as weather forecasts and mountain accommodation and food.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s a {{group of}} American astronomers became {{interested}} in the higher peaks of the Gammons as possible sites for an observatory, and several parties camped for some time on <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> of Mount McKinlay and Benbonyathe Hill (vehicle tracks were also graded to <b>the</b> <b>summits),</b> but nothing further was done (a large observatory is located at Arkaroola, about a hundred kilometres to the northeast).
