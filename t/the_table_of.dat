Noot for the 19 April 1940 design {{does not give}} any armament specifics, as these likely remained unaltered from the earlier 16 February 1940 drawing. This drawing provided the following: a main armament of nine 283mm guns, a secondary armament of twelve 120mm dual purpose guns, and an anti-aircraft defense consisting of fourteen Bofors 40mmguns and eight Oerlikon 20mmcannons.|$|E

5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> <b>of</b> human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E
5|$|As {{illustrated}} by <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>of</b> matches above, {{little is known}} of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 {{had fallen}} out of favor even with {{airborne}} troops, despite their strong preference for compact and lightweight weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 in the summer of 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting and <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> Organisation and Equipment (TO) of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (designed to fit into the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|E

5|$|Hansell drew up the {{tactical}} doctrine, SOPs, and <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>of</b> organization and equipment of the Twentieth Air Force, {{which was to}} be commanded by Arnold personally, including use of AAF Air Staff as the staff of the Twentieth.

When Arnold was incapacitated by a heart attack in May, Hansell acted as de facto commander of the Twentieth Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The {{publisher}} was Galaxy Publishing Corporation, New York. The {{magazine was}} initially titled Beyond Fantasy Fiction, and this remained the title on the masthead throughout the ten-issue run. However, issue 9 changed the title to simply Beyond Fiction {{on the cover}}, spine, and table of contents. Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to Beyond Fantasy Fiction for <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>of</b> contents. As a result, the magazine is often listed as having changed its name {{for the last two}} issues.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} season, Wales {{completed}} their first full Home Nations Championship; Gould played as the lone centre {{in all three}} games. It was a fairly successful Championship for the Welsh, with a draw, a win and a loss, leaving them second in <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>Of</b> note during the series was Bob Gould's captaincy in the second match, against Scotland, and Gould's first ever international dropped goal – which gave Wales a win over Ireland and made up for him missing a dropped goal by just a yard in their draw against England. Due to work commitments, Gould only played {{one of the two}} Wales games of the 1888 Home Nations Championship, in the country's first victory over Scotland, thanks to a single try from Thomas Pryce-Jenkins. In the second game, played away to Ireland, George Bowen was given the centre position in the last match Wales would play with a three threequarter system. Gould then missed the first Welsh international against an overseas touring side, when the New Zealand Natives were beaten at St. Helen's in Swansea, and was still absent two months later for the opening game of the 1889 Championship. Gould returned in time for the clash with Ireland where he was given the captaincy and played alongside Llanelli centre Tom Morgan. Gould lost his first match as captain, losing by two tries to nil at home – this was the first of 18 caps he earned leading his country.|$|E
