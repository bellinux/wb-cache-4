40|$|Two-dimensional {{numerical}} simulations {{are conducted}} for a single-stage axial-turbine {{system with the}} inlet gas flow provided by a pulse detonation combustor. The objectives {{of this study are}} to compute the <b>turbine</b> <b>work</b> output as a function of rotor speed and gain insights into the significant gap between theoretical predictions and experimental results. The <b>turbine</b> <b>work</b> output is evaluated by two approaches. One is an energy balance evaluation method using average stagnation enthalpy at the stage inlet and outlet, and the other is a mechanical method of integrating the force acting on the rotor blade surface. From the results of both approaches, it is confirmed that the <b>turbine</b> <b>work</b> increases with increasing rotor speed up to 150 % from the design point. Multi-cycle operation is also conducted at the design point for an initial pressure of 0. 15 MPa and turbine adiabatic efficiency is observed to be reduced 5 % after the second cycle.

On the other hand, Francis <b>turbine</b> <b>works</b> on low Specific speeds i.e., high pressure heads.|$|E

5000|$|Nicknamed the [...] "father of {{catalytic}} combustion", Pfefferle {{invented the}} original catalytic combustor for gas turbine engines {{in the early}} 1970s. Gas <b>turbines</b> <b>work</b> by mixing fuel with compressed and heated air, which burns and generates energy to turn the turbines.

50|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{is the most}} {{efficient}} steam engine {{and for this reason}} is universally used for electrical generation. Steam expansion in a turbine is nearly continuous, which makes a turbine comparable to {{a very large number of}} expansion stages. Steam power stations operating at the critical point have efficiencies in the low 40% range. Turbines produce direct rotary motion and are far more compact and weigh far less than reciprocating engines and can be controlled to within a very constant speed. As is the case with the gas turbine, the steam <b>turbine</b> <b>works</b> most efficiently at full power, and poorly at slower speeds. For this reason, despite their high power to weight ratio, steam turbines have been primarily used in applications where they can be run at a constant speed. In AC electrical generation maintaining an extremely constant turbine speed is necessary to maintain the correct frequency.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{provided}} for the <b>turbine</b> <b>work</b> is converted from the enthalpy and kinetic energy of the gas. The turbine housings direct the gas flow through the turbine as it spins at up to 250,000 rpm. The size and shape can dictate some performance characteristics of the overall turbocharger. Often the same basic turbocharger assembly {{is available from the}} manufacturer with multiple housing choices for the turbine, and sometimes the compressor cover as well. This lets the balance between performance, response, and efficiency be tailored to the application.|$|R
