40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{perceptions}} of the “Ideal President” and candidates in the 2008 US presidential election in relation to gender and leader prototypes. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 768 undergraduate business students rated either <b>the</b> ideal <b>President</b> or a presidential candidate on Bem Sex-Role Inventory and Implicit Leadership Theory scales. Findings – <b>The</b> ideal <b>President</b> <b>was</b> seen as more similar to male candidates as a group than female candidates as a group (i. e. “think <b>president</b> – <b>think</b> male”). <b>The</b> ideal <b>President</b> <b>was</b> seen as higher in masculinity than femininity (i. e. “think president – think masculine”). Research limitations/implications – Additional factors beyond gender and leader prototypes may affect perceptions of presidential candidates and <b>the</b> ideal <b>President.</b> Respondents came exclusively from northeastern USA; hence, results may not be generalizable to other populations. Replication of this study in nations that have elected a female leader is recommended. Future theory and research should link perceptions of male and female leaders in different nations to dimensions of national culture such as gender egalitarianism. Social implications – The results suggest the continued presence of sex-related biases in leader evaluations in the political context. Such biases influence whether specific groups are excluded from political leadership because of their personal characteristics (e. g. women), which would dilute the talent of the pool of available candidates. Originality/value – The results increase knowledge of the linkages among sex, gender, and political leadership by incorporating both gender and leader prototypes...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of affirmative action and equal employment opportunity policies on attitudes toward women who are hired into organizations that practice such policies. Managers attending continuing education courses served as subjects and evaluated bogus resumes for job applicants for managerial bank positions. The subjects were presented {{a case study in}} which two of the job applicants had already been selected for two managerial positions. In addition to rating the managerial characteristics of the selected job applicants, the subjects also rated the person who made the hiring decision;The independent variables manipulated in the study were (1) sex of hired person, (2) type of job (vice-president and assistant vice-president), and (3) type of organizational employment policy. The dependent variables were the managerial characteristics attributed to the hired persons and the person who made the hiring decision;It was predicted that when the female applicant was selected for the superior managerial position in an organization that practices equal employment opportunity, she would be perceived as possessing fewer managerial characteristics than the female applicant hired in the control condition. While the prediction of differential ratings for female applicants was not supported, a manipulation check revealed differential ratings for the item, 2 ̆ 2 How much pressure do you <b>think</b> <b>the</b> bank <b>president</b> <b>was</b> under in making the decision? 2 ̆ 2 The person making the hiring decision was perceived as being under the most pressure when the organization espoused a strong affirmative action policy. This was true when the male applicant was hired, as well as when the female applicant was hired. Ratings for the person making the hiring decision did not differ by type of employment policy. This finding along with the results of the manipulation check has implications for employees 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward policy makers compared with attitudes toward policy implementers;It was also predicted that the female applicants in all employment policy conditions would be evaluated less favorably than the male applicants in each corresponding condition. The results of the data analysis revealed no significant differences with a trend toward the female being evaluated more favorably than the male. This finding is explained by 2 ̆ 2 evaluation apprehension 2 ̆ 2. The reaction of the subjects to the superior and 2 ̆ 2 unusual for a woman 2 ̆ 2 qualifications of the female applicant also account for the results of the study;As an exploratory research project, the results provoke suggestions for further research. Therefore, some recommendations for future research on the effect of equal employment opportunity policies on attributions toward women hired into management positions are discussed...|$|R
