5|$|Needing to hurry, the Patriot militia put 900 men {{on horseback}} and rode for Kings Mountain. They left immediately, marching {{through the night}} of the 6th and morning of the 7th, even though the rain never stopped. By sunrise of the 7th, they forded the Broad River, fifteen miles from Kings Mountain. By early {{afternoon}} they arrived and immediately surrounded <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> attacked.|$|E
5|$|Nescopeck Creek {{is in the}} {{geological}} region known as <b>the</b> <b>Ridge</b> <b>and</b> Valley region. This region is characterized by fertile valleys and steep ridges.

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Briar Creek {{is located}} in <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> valley physiographic region. The top of Lee Mountain forms a drainage divide between the creek's watershed and another watershed. Several points along Briar Creek and its tributaries have erode with ease or moderate ease. The infiltration capacity of these points is mostly moderate to high.|$|E
5|$|A {{portion of}} the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58 is on Nescopeck Mountain. Additionally, the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 187 contain the Nescopeck Mountain Barrens. The ridge is on the {{northern}} border of the 3550-acre Nescopeck State Park. Historically, there were trails {{leading up to the}} top of Nescopeck Mountain. There is high visibility from the top of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> the town of Bloomsburg can be seen.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00 on 26 October, Oka's unit {{finally reached}} and {{attacked}} the Marine defenses near the Matanikau. Oka's troops assaulted all along an east-west saddle ridge held by Hanneken's battalion but concentrated particularly on Hanneken's Company F, which defended the extreme left {{flank of the}} Marine positions on the ridge. A Company F machine gun section under Mitchell Paige killed many of the Japanese attackers, but Japanese fire eventually killed or injured almost all the Marine machine gunners. At 05:00, Oka's 3rd Battalion, 4th Infantry succeeded in scaling the steep slope of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> pushed the surviving members of Company F off the crest.|$|E

5|$|During {{the rest}} of the morning, an {{infantry}} battalion from the 22nd Armoured Brigade group, took up defensive positions in the town; the troops at Point 213 had been cut off and a force was assembled to extricate them. The relief force was unable to advance on <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> <b>and</b> when more German forces arrived between 11:00 and 13:00 the trapped squadron surrendered. More German troops had arrived, and engaged the 22nd Armoured Brigade group along the road back to Livry.|$|E
5|$|Firing {{upon the}} Australians with machine-guns, mortars and grenades, the Japanese {{defenders}} upon Coconut Ridge {{held up the}} advance. Throughout {{the rest of the}} day, the 2/48th Battalion undertook a series of flanking attacks in which at least 80 Japanese were killed, however by nightfall the Japanese still held <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> <b>and</b> the 2/48th Battalion withdrew to a nearby knoll to reorganise, having suffered six killed and 26 wounded. Elsewhere, the other two Australian battalions had also found the going slow: the 2/24th had dug in east of the 2200 feature, while the 2/23rd had only managed to advance about half the expected distance.|$|E
5|$|Grisedale Tarn is the {{starting}} point for the south ridge of Helvellyn, and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale, or from Dunmail Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck. Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the fellside, and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags on the side of <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> <b>and</b> avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a more interesting and scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags as closely as possible, over the tops of Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two days}} later, on Sunday 18 June, the Duke of Wellington {{positioned}} his Anglo-allied army along a ridge {{near the village}} of Waterloo, in order to block Napoleon's advance along the road to Brussels. The Brunswick Corps formed part of Wellington's reserve corps, under his personal command. In that capacity, they were kept well behind the crest of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> avoided casualties during the opening French bombardment. In {{the early part of the}} afternoon, the British Foot Guards moved down the slope to reinforce the Château d'Hougoumont, which was under fierce French attack; the Brunswick Corps was brought forward to take their place.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved more potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, and pulled back with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated {{under the cover of}} part of <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> <b>and</b> moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Mahanoy Creek is in <b>the</b> <b>Ridge</b> <b>and</b> Valley Appalachians. The {{lower part}} of the creek's watershed is in the Northern Shale Valleys and Slopes Ecoregion. The Mahanoy Creek watershed is part of a synclinorium that runs from the northeast to the southwest, running between Hunter and Shenandoah. Rock formations in the watershed include the Pottsville Group and the Llewellyn Formation. These are found on the northern side of the creek's valley.|$|E
5000|$|The colour of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> valleys vary among colonies, with <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> being various {{shades of}} brown, and the valleys either whitish, green, or tan. <b>The</b> <b>ridge</b> tops are {{indented}} {{with a single}} thin groove. <b>Ridges</b> <b>and</b> valleys may be up to 2 centimetres wide, and this breadth distinguishes it from the narrower Diploria, which may otherwise be similar in appearance.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> cliffs above <b>the</b> dark, steep valleys (mostly clearcut) are favourites of rock climbers {{and have}} {{supposedly}} {{some of the}} finest rock in the province; their name for the area is [...] "The Chehalis".|$|R
5|$|While the {{traprock}} cliffs {{remain the}} most obvious evidence of the prehistoric geologic processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life {{in the form of}} Triassic and Jurassic fossils; in particular, dinosaur tracks. At a state park in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.|$|E
5|$|After being named, Ivy quickly {{intensified}} {{after its}} convection was {{drawn into the}} circulation. Late on February 23, the JTWC upgraded Ivy to {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and the FMS followed suit the following day by upgrading Ivy to a severe tropical cyclone as continued favorable conditions allowed for rapid deepening. On February 24 the cyclone began a turn to the southwest as it moved around <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> <b>and</b> the next day it turned to the south toward Vanuatu as an approaching shortwave trough passed to the south and created a weakness in the ridge. A nearby upper-level low temporarily cut off outflow, although once it moved further away the low enhanced ventilation. Strengthening continued and, late on February 25, the FMS reported that Ivy attained peak 10–minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) over the Vanuatu archipelago; this made it a Category4 on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1–minute sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph), after a 19km (12mi) eye developed.|$|E
5|$|As a {{strengthening}} tropical storm, Fanapi developed deeper convection {{near the}} center. A passing trough {{to the north}} weakened <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> caused the storm to slow, turning northeastward by September16. That day, Fanapi developed an eye feature, becoming a typhoon at 18:00UTC. As the ridge built into the East China Sea, the storm responded by turning to the northwest, {{and at the same}} time, outflow improved to the north. The eye organized further as it contracted to a diameter of 19km (12mi). By that time, the typhoon was moving due westward toward Taiwan, steered by a ridge over northeastern China. At 06:00UTC on September18, the JTWC estimated that Fanapi attained peak 1minute winds of 195km/h (120mph). Around the same time, the JMA estimated peak 10minute winds of 175km/h (110mph).|$|E
60|$|The {{supposition}} {{is therefore}} untenable that the courses of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> are wholly {{determined by the}} flexures. It appears, however, that the courses of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> those of <b>the</b> lines of flexure may be in part, but in part only, due to {{the action of the}} same causes.|$|R

5|$|On 20 August, {{with his}} forces encircled, Model {{organised}} {{attacks on the}} Polish position from {{both within and outside}} the pocket. The Germans managed to isolate <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> force open a narrow escape corridor. Lacking the fighting power to close the corridor, the Poles nevertheless directed constant and accurate artillery fire on German units retreating from the pocket, causing heavy casualties. Exasperated, the Germans launched fierce attacks throughout 20 August which inflicted losses on Hill 262's entrenched defenders. Exhausted and dangerously low on ammunition, the Poles managed to retain their foothold on the ridge. The following day, less intense attacks continued until midday, when the last German effort to overrun the position was defeated at close quarters. The Poles were relieved by the Canadian Grenadier Guards shortly after noon; their dogged stand had ensured the closure of the Falaise pocket and the collapse of the German position in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|On {{the coast}} the 52nd (Lowland) Division was fought a fierce action after {{crossing}} the Wadi el Hesi {{on the coast}} north of Gaza. By the morning of 8 November, two infantry brigades had crossed the Wadi el Hesi near its mouth and, despite some opposition established themselves on the sand dunes to the north towards Askelon. Sausage Ridge, on their right stretched from Burberah to Deir Sineid, was held in considerable strength, as the ridge covered the road and railway from Gaza to the north. During the afternoon the 155th Brigade moved to attack Sausage Ridge, but it was threatened by a counterattack on the left forcing, the brigade to halt and face north to meet this attack. When the 156th Brigade arrived from Sh. Ajlin on the Wadi el Hesi, the 157th Brigade attacked the southern portion of <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> <b>and</b> gained a footing as darkness fell. They lost this precarious position four times to fierce Ottoman counterattacks, before strongly attacking and throwing the defenders off the ridge by 21:00. The two attacking brigades lost 700 men in this action.|$|E
5|$|On {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of November 7, an area of disturbed weather organized to a tropical depression 60miles (100km) east of Atlántico Norte, Nicaragua. Its origins were traced to a tropical wave that originated over western Africa on October 26. Atmospheric conditions resembled an early fall pattern, and a large ridge was situated over the Gulf of Mexico and Southwestern United States. The depression moved northward into the Caribbean Sea, and the environment supported further development. On November 9, the depression strengthened to a 40mph (65km/h) tropical storm and was given the name Jeanne. Later, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft reported a strengthening system; maximum sustained winds increased to 50mph (80km/h), and a minimum pressure of 999 mbar was measured. The tropical cyclone moved northward into the southern Gulf of Mexico on November 10. Jeanne's northward movement was blocked by <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> <b>and</b> the cyclone slowly turned to the west. On November 11, Jeanne quickly intensified to a minimal hurricane; later, it attained its peak intensity of 100mph (155km/h).|$|E
