5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{determination}} not {{to discriminate}} between European and Third World refugees helped prepare <b>the</b> <b>UNHCR</b> {{for a change in}} the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened <b>the</b> <b>UNHCR</b> mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees from the Palestinian territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, <b>the</b> <b>UNHCR</b> and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.|$|E
5|$|Tharoor's {{career in}} the United Nations began in 1978 as a staff member of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva. From 1981 until 1984 he was head of <b>the</b> <b>UNHCR</b> office in Singapore, during the boat people crisis, for which he led the organisation's rescue efforts at sea and succeeded in resettling a backlog of Vietnamese refugees. He also {{processed}} Polish and Acehnese refugee cases. After a further stint at <b>the</b> <b>UNHCR</b> headquarters in Geneva, during which {{he became the first}} chairman of the staff elected by UNHCR personnel worldwide, Tharoor left UNHCR. In 1989 he was appointed special assistant to the Under-Secretary General for Special Political Affairs, the unit that later became the Peacekeeping Operations Department in New York. Until 1996, he led the team responsible for peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, spending considerable time on the ground during the civil war there.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{population}} {{is expected to}} drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over {{how to cope with}} this problem. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year. According to <b>the</b> <b>UNHCR,</b> in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 76,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} refugee status prompted {{some of them to}} opt for the voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by <b>the</b> <b>UNHCR.</b> In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia {{to reduce the size of}} its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme, and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass <b>the</b> <b>UNHCR</b> screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, the National Assembly of Cambodia {{introduced}} an immigration law which authorises the deportation of illegal immigrants. <b>The</b> <b>UNHCR</b> perceived {{the law as}} targeting Vietnamese migrants in Cambodia, and the Cambodian government later stepped in to assure that no mass deportations of Vietnamese refugees would be implemented. The Khmer Rouge continued to carry out sporadic attacks on Vietnamese civilians until they surrendered in 1999. Ethnic Vietnamese continue to face discrimination from Cambodian society, and encountered physical intimidation from society and government authorities especially during the general elections or when disputes between Cambodia and Vietnam arise.|$|E
5|$|According to Serbian sources, some 120,000 Serbs were {{displaced}} from 1991 to 1993, and 250,000 were displaced after Operation Storm. The number of displaced Serbs was 254,000 in 1993, dropping to 97,000 {{in the early}} 1995 and then increasing again to 200,000 {{by the end of}} the year. Most international sources place the total number of Serbs displaced at around 300,000. According to Amnesty International 300,000 were {{displaced from}} 1991 to 1995, of which 117,000 were officially registered as having returned as of 2005. According to the OSCE, 300,000 were displaced during the war, of which 120,000 were officially registered as having returned as of 2006. However, it is believed the number does not accurately reflect the number of returnees, because many returned to Serbia, Montenegro, or Bosnia and Herzegovina after officially registering in Croatia. According to <b>the</b> <b>UNHCR</b> in 2008, 125,000 were registered as having returned to Croatia, of whom 55,000 remained permanently.|$|E
