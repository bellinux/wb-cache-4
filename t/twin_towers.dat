At , the 110-story {{buildings}} were the world's tallest from 1972 until they were surpassed by {{the construction of the}} Willis Tower in 1974 (formerly known as the Sears Tower, located in Chicago).

5|$|The {{construction}} of the World Trade Center, of which the <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers</b> (One and Two World Trade Center) were the centerpieces, was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by David Rockefeller. The project was intended to help revitalize Lower Manhattan. The project was planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki. Yamasaki {{came up with the}} idea of building <b>twin</b> <b>towers.</b> After extensive negotiations, the New Jersey and New York State governments, which supervise the Port Authority, consented to the {{construction of}} the World Trade Center at the Radio Row site, located in the lower-west area of Manhattan. To satisfy the New Jersey government, the Port Authority agreed to buy the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (renamed to Port Authority Trans-Hudson), which transported commuters from New Jersey to Lower Manhattan.|$|E

The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how {{fire protection systems}} might be improved in future construction. The investigation into the collapse of 1WTC and 2WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7WTC was completed in August 2008.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} 110-floor <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers,</b> {{numerous}} other buildings at the World Trade Center site were destroyed or badly damaged, including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. The North Tower, South Tower, the Marriott Hotel (3WTC), and 7WTC were completely destroyed. The U.S. Customs House (6 World Trade Center), 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in 2007. The two {{buildings of the}} World Financial Center also suffered damage.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers.</b> Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E
5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries {{and a more}} traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers,</b> rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{numerous}} structural modifications {{were made}} to suit the needs of tenants in the <b>Twin</b> <b>Towers.</b> Modifications were made {{in accordance with the}} Port Authority's Tenant Alteration Review Manual and were reviewed by the Port Authority to ensure the changes did not compromise structural integrity of the buildings. In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect tenant floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy files that tenants had on their floors.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the station's <b>twin</b> <b>towers,</b> {{which had}} been Grade II listed in 1972, were {{restored}} in a project costing £242,000 (now £). The works revealed that the east tower still contained a large water tank which was used during the days of steam traction to replenish locomotives and to power the station's hydraulic systems. The brickwork was repaired, cleaned and repointed, and the weather vanes gilded to complement the dome of nearby St Paul's Cathedral. This work {{was one of the}} Railway Heritage Trust's first projects and coincided with an exhibition held in the station in August of the same year to mark its 150th anniversary.|$|E
