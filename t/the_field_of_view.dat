5|$|Kepler-6 is {{a yellow}} giant {{situated}} in the constellation Cygnus. The star lies within <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of the Kepler Mission, which discovered {{it as part of}} a NASA-led mission to discover Earth-like planets. The star, which is slightly larger, more metal-rich, slightly cooler, and more massive than the Sun, is orbited by at least one extrasolar planet, a Jupiter-sized planet named Kepler-6b that orbits closely to its star.|$|E
5|$|The lens is {{equipped}} with a full-frame digital SLR-compatible mount allowing the usage of both APS-C sized cameras and formats larger than APS-C – the build in lens hood however visibly restricts <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (FOV) on formats larger than APS-C – see example above. The FOV in APS-C sized cameras is further restricted at shorter focal lengths if the front cap adaptor ring is not removed – see example below.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8 {{is a star}} {{located in}} the {{constellation}} Lyra in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of the Kepler Mission, a NASA-led operation tasked with discovering terrestrial planets. The star, which is slightly hotter, larger, and more massive than the Sun, has one gas giant in its orbit, Kepler-8b. This gas giant is larger than Jupiter, but is less massive, and thus more diffuse. The planet's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 along with four other planets. As the fifth confirmed planetary system verified by Kepler, it helped demonstrate {{the capabilities of the}} Kepler spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|On Thursday May 8, 1997, at 21:42 UTC, BeppoSAX's Gamma Ray Burst Monitor {{registered}} a gamma-ray burst {{that lasted}} approximately 15seconds. It was also detected by Ulysses, a robotic space probe designed {{to study the}} Sun, and by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The burst also occurred within <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of one of BeppoSAX's two X-ray Wide Field Cameras. Within a few hours, the BeppoSAX team localized the burst to an error box—a small area around the specific position {{to account for the}} error in the position—with a diameter of approximately 10arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's pupil is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to {{the total amount of}} light in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> not by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E

40|$|The dual frequency-range {{principle}} {{developed in}} Part I (Chahine, 1974) for infrared remote sounding of atmospheric temperature profiles {{in the presence}} of a single cloud layer is extended here to the case of multiple cloud formations.

Numerical verifications are carried out to illustrate the stability and accuracy of the method using simulated radiance data, from the 4. 3 and 15 micron CO 2 bands in the terrestrial atmosphere, {{in the presence of}} up to three cloud layers in <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view...</b>|$|R

5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{structure}} and motion estimation by using image sequences captured by a multi-camera system {{moving in a}} scene. Single camera systems with a relatively small <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> have limited accuracy because of the inherent confusion between translation and rotation. This {{is also the case}} for the stereo camera systems if the systems need <b>the</b> intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> for stereo correspondence. The cameras constituting the multi-camera system considered ultimately in this paper are arranged so that there is no, or a small, intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> This configuration improves the accuracy of the structure and motion estimation because the ambiguity mentioned above decreases due to a large <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> We propose a recursive algorithm for real time applications of the multi-camera system using long term image sequences, which have appearing and disappearing point features. The results of the experiments with long term real image sequences are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of {{respiratory protective equipment}} is unstable and unpredictable. Respirators cannot substitute other measures, that reduce the impact of air pollution on the staff (sealing equipment, ventilation and so on), but only supplement them.

25|$|Using depth electrodes, {{the local}} field {{potential}} gives {{a measure of}} a neural population in a sphere with a radius of 0.5–3mm around {{the tip of the}} electrode.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for the remote measurement of winds and atmospheric turbulence by the cross-correlation of passive optical signals. If small local variations in atmospheric density, temperature or other parameters cause fluctuations in scattered or thermal radiation detected by a radiometer on the ground, then the cross-correlation of fluctuations detected by two radiometers with crossed <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> can yield turbulence information {{pertaining to the}} region about this intersection point. When <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> are not quite crossed turbulent eddies will be convected through <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> sequentially, and <b>the</b> transit times of the eddies identified by the correlation procedure will yield wind information. The successful application of this technique, detecting fluctuations in scattered sunlight, has demonstrated both the potential, and the present limitations of the method, which are discussed. Results for the power spectrum of the fluctuations and for winds {{at an altitude of}} 61 meters are shown...|$|R
