50|$|A <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> a {{reduction}} in taxes. The immediate effects of a tax cut are {{a decrease in the}} real income of the government and an increase in the real income of those whose tax rate has been lowered. Due to the perceived benefit in growing real incomes among tax payers, politicians have sought to claim their proposed tax credits as tax cuts. In the longer term, however, the loss of government income may be mitigated, depending on the response of tax-payers. The longer-term macroeconomic effects of a tax cut are not predictable in general, because they depend on how the taxpayers use their additional income and how the government adjusts to its reduced income.|$|E

5000|$|The idea of {{helicopter}} drops was revived as {{a serious}} policy proposal in the early 2000s by economists considering the lessons from Japan. Ben Bernanke famously delivered a speech on preventing deflation in November 2002 as a Federal Reserve Board governor, where he says that Keynes [...] "once semi-seriously proposed, as an anti-deflationary measure, that the government fill bottles with currency and bury them in mine shafts to be dug up by the public." [...] In that speech, Bernanke himself says, [...] "a money-financed <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money." [...] In a footnote to that speech, Bernanke also references an important paper by Gauti Eggertson which emphasises {{the importance of a}} commitment from the central bank to keep the money supply at a higher level in the future. The Irish economist, Eric Lonergan, also argued in 2002 in the Financial Times, that central banks consider cash transfers to households as an alternative to further reductions in interest rates, also on the grounds of financial stability. In 2003, Willem Buiter, then chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, revived the concept of helicopter money in a theoretical paper, arguing that base money is not a liability, which provides a more rigorous case for Friedman and Haberler's Pigouvian intuitions.|$|E
50|$|Economic growth, though positive, has {{not been}} {{sufficient}} to generate jobs and prevent unemployment from rising. In fact,there {{are now more than}} two million fewer private sector jobs than {{at the start of the}} current recession. Overcapacity,corporate scandals, and uncertainty have and will continue to weigh down the economy.The tax cut plan proposed by President Bush is not the answer to these problems. Regardless of how one views the specificsof the Bush plan, there is wide agreement that its purpose is a permanent change in the tax structure and not the creationof jobs and growth in the near-term. The permanent dividend tax cut, in particular, is not credible as a short-term stimulus.As tax reform, the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> misdirected in that it targets individuals rather than corporations, is overlycomplex, and could be, but is not, part of a revenue-neutral tax reform effort.Passing these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget outlook, adding to the nation’s projected chronic deficits. Thisfiscal deterioration will reduce the capacity of the government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits as well asinvestments in schools, health, infrastructure, and basic research. Moreover, the proposed tax cuts will generate furtherinequalities in after-tax income.To be effective, a stimulus plan should rely on immediate but temporary spending and tax measures to expand demand,and it should also rely on immediate but temporary incentives for investment. Such a stimulus plan would spur growthand jobs in the short term without exacerbating the long-term budget outlook.|$|E

Most of these <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>were</b> scheduled to expire December 31, 2010.

Our analysis suggests that the revenue losses from capital and labor income tax cuts are the highest when the tax cuts are productive spending-financed and the lowest when transfer payments are used to finance the tax cuts. For plausible parameter values consistent with the US economy, we find that about 47 percent of a transfer-financed capital income <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> self-financing. The corresponding result for a productive spending-financed capital income <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> only 6 percent. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Macroeconomic {{analysis}} of tax reform in dynamic general equilibrium usually assumes that reforms hit the economy unexpectedly and last forever. Here, we explore how previous results change when we allow tax reforms to be pre-announced and of finite duration and these facts are anticipated by households and firms. Interestingly, {{we find that}} the welfare gain of the representative consumer changes only little when pre-announcment is taken into account. This result, however, hides the fact that (possibly large) welfare differentials before and after enactment of a policy change are balancing each other. It implies that the anticipation of tax reforms entails important intergenerational distribution effects. This is even the more true when the termination of a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> anticipated. As a (non-generalizable) rule {{we find that the}} generation that becomes economically active when a temporary <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> terminated benefits most. These benefits are at the expense of older generations already active when a temporarily lower tax rates apply.

40|$|In this paper, {{we use the}} nime {{model to}} assess the {{medium-term}} macro-economic effects for the European Union (eu) of a one percentage point cut in the social security contribution rate, and a one percentage point increase in the labour participation rate.

First, we consider the variant in which the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> ex ante financed by an across the board cut in public outlays. Next, we consider the variant in which the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> ex ante financed by an increase in the indirect tax rates. In the long run, such measures increase unambiguously employment and potential output, thereby raising the standard of living of the eu citizens and reinforcing the sustainability of the social protection system.

40|$|Since 2001 Congress {{has passed}} a major tax bill almost every year.
