5|$|An older {{technique}} to quantify migration involves observing {{the face of}} the moon towards full moon and counting the silhouettes of flocks of birds as <b>they</b> <b>fly</b> at night.|$|E
5|$|Storks are large, heavy, long-legged, long-necked {{wading birds}} with long stout bills and wide wingspans. <b>They</b> <b>fly</b> with the neck extended.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas are {{generally}} encountered in pairs or small groups, though young birds may gather {{in groups of}} 20 or more outside the breeding season. They sometimes share the company of eastern rosellas. <b>They</b> <b>fly</b> in a straight line, making rapid shallow wingbeats and gliding briefly in between.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947 <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> the SR.A/1 fighter {{prototype}}, {{one of the}} world's first jet-powered flying boats, and in 1952 <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> {{the prototype}} Princess airliner, but {{the age of the}} flying-boat was over and the two further Princess examples to be completed were never flown. No further new seaplanes were produced here. Modification work on Short-built flying boats continued at Cowes until 1955.|$|R
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>fly</b> to Yellowstone to {{retrieve}} a map from Charlie with the arks' location. As they leave, the Yellowstone Caldera erupts; Charlie stays behind to cover the eruption and is killed. The group lands in Las Vegas to find a larger plane and meet Yuri, his twin sons Alec and Oleg, his girlfriend Tamara and their pilot Sasha. Sasha finds an Antonov An-500 and pilots it with Gordon, and they leave just as the Yellowstone ash cloud consumes Vegas.|$|E
5|$|Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (most are 1mm long or less), slender insects with fringed {{wings and}} unique {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts. Different thrips species feed mostly on plants by puncturing and sucking up the contents, {{although a few}} are predators. Approximately 6,000 species have been described. <b>They</b> <b>fly</b> only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.|$|E
5|$|Vrataski frees Cage, who {{recruits}} J squad to help {{destroy the}} Omega {{before the invasion}} begins. <b>They</b> <b>fly</b> to Paris, where the other soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski {{can get into the}} Louvre. Just before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to thank him for getting her as far as he did. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he manages to drop a belt of grenades, killing the Omega.|$|E

5|$|Although {{satellite}} {{males are}} on average slightly smaller and lighter than residents, the nutrition of the chicks does not, as previously thought, influence mating strategy; rather, the inherited mating strategy influences body size. Resident-type chicks will, if {{provided with the}} same amount of food, grow heavier than satellite-type chicks. Satellite males do not have to expend energy to defend a territory, and can spend more time foraging, so they {{do not need to be}} as bulky as the residents; indeed, since <b>they</b> <b>fly</b> more, there would be a physiological cost to additional weight.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. <b>They</b> <b>fly</b> through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. <b>They</b> <b>fly</b> back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E
50|$|The 474th {{returned}} to Takhli in September 1972. Three F-111A squadrons (the 428th, 429th and 430th) {{participated in the}} Linebacker II aerial offensive against North Vietnam. <b>They</b> <b>flew</b> bombing missions against targets in North Vietnam and Laos {{in the midst of}} the monsoon season. <b>They</b> <b>flew</b> without RB-66E electronic countermeasures escort aircraft or Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers. On 8 November 1972, <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> 20 strikes over North Vietnam in weather that grounded other aircraft. Four F-111As could deliver the bomb loads of 20 F-4s. The 428th, 429th and 430th TFS flew some 4000 combat missions with excellent success rates in hitting targets even when visibility was near zero. Only six aircraft were lost in action.|$|R

5|$|The team invite Dillon up to {{the control}} room, where they see he has written orders from the very top, showing that the ammonids have long been {{in control of the}} government. They appeal to his human side to allow them to continue, which he does so after Leo tells him the rocket must launch. Despite both being old and unfit, Quatermass and Leo are the only two who have the {{scientific}} knowledge to make such a flight. <b>They</b> <b>fly</b> to the asteroid and land on it, but en route Quatermass finds out that the night the plant exploded Leo was possessed by the ammonids.|$|E
5|$|After the Inhuman leader Jiaying {{refuses to}} risk {{anyone else to}} rescue Campbell, Raina {{receives}} a vision of Skye saving him, and convinces Gordon to take Skye to the Playground, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s base. Coulson reforms his original S.H.I.E.L.D. team of May, Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, and <b>they</b> <b>fly</b> to the Arctic in their old mobile command base, a plane called the Bus. Their approach is detected by Hydra, who shoot down the Bus with missiles, but the team escape in a quinjet and infiltrate the base with Bakshi's help. Coulson, May, and Fitz break into the base's control rooms to steal information about Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker's primary headquarters in the small Eastern European nation of Sokovia, while Skye, Ward, Bakshi, and Simmons rescue Peterson and Campbell. During the rescue, Simmons attempts to kill Ward as she once promised she would, but Bakshi {{gets in the way}} and Simmons murders him instead, and Ward flees after sparing Simmons' life.|$|E
5|$|Common loons eat a {{wide range}} of animal prey {{including}} fish,crustaceans, insect larvae,molluscs, and occasionally aquatic plant life. They swallow most of their prey underwater, where it is caught, but some larger items are first brought to the surface. They are a seasonallymonogamousbreeders. Both members of a pair build a large nest out of deadmarsh grassesand other plants formed into a mound along the vegetated shores of lakes. A singlebroodis raised each year from a clutch of one or two olive-brown ovaleggswith dark brown spots which are incubated for 24 to 25 days by both parents. Fed by both parents, the chicks fledge in 70 to 77 days. The chicks are capable of diving underwater and <b>they</b> <b>fly</b> to their wintering areas before ice forms in the fall.|$|E

5|$|Dozens of Dementors {{emerge from}} the {{darkness}} while one descends and attempts to suck out the riders' souls. This effect is achieved by projecting the riders' faces onto a cloud of fog {{in front of the}} Dementor, blasting cold air towards the riders, and using a heartbeat-like sound played through the sub-woofers built into the benches. After shaking the riders out of the trance, Harry causes the Dementors to flee with a protective Patronus Charm. After the final Dementor, and while Harry uses his Patronus, the riders enter the final video dome segment, where the cliffs outside the Chamber of Secrets cave in. <b>They</b> <b>fly</b> over the Black Lake, back into Hogwarts and through the Main Hall and Grand Staircase, where they are cheered on by a series of onscreen characters from the movies who appear three-dimensional. Professor Dumbledore sends everyone back through the Floo Network to the Room of Requirement, where they exit their bench.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Uncle Vernon punishes Harry, fitting locks to {{his bedroom}} door and bars to the windows. However, Ron Weasley arrives with his twin {{brothers}} Fred and George in their father Arthur’s enchanted Ford Anglia and they rescue Harry, who stays at their family home, the Burrow, {{for the remainder of}} his holidays. Harry and the other Weasleys—mother Molly, third eldest son Percy, and daughter Ginny (who has a crush on Harry)—travel to Diagon Alley. There, they are reunited with Hermione Granger and introduced to Lucius Malfoy, father of Harry’s school nemesis Draco, and Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer who has been appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor after the death of Professor Quirrel. When Harry and Ron approach Platform 9 3/4 in King's Cross station it refuses to allow them pass; instead, <b>they</b> <b>fly</b> Arthur’s car to Hogwarts, where they crash into a sentient willow tree on the grounds.|$|E

Marge reveals that Kang is Maggie's real father and explains how it happened. Kang and Kodos demand that the Simpsons give Maggie to them, and Kang and Homer start to fight until they are taken on The Jerry Springer Show. When an audience member criticizes Kang, he vaporizes her, as well {{as the rest of the}} audience and the film crew. After leaving the studio, Kang and Kodos threaten to destroy every politician in Washington unless given Maggie.

5|$|Space Race is a two-player arcade game. In the game, the {{two players}} each control a spaceship, which <b>they</b> <b>fly</b> {{from the bottom}} of the screen to the top. Along the way are dashes {{representing}} asteroids moving across the screen from left to right, which the players must avoid. Movement controls are limited to moving the spaceship up or down; if the player's ship is hit by an asteroid it disappears for a few seconds before reappearing at the bottom again. The game displays a starfield in the background, as well as each player's score, which increases whenever a player makes it to the top first. Each game is for a set amount of time, represented by a line in the bottom middle of the screen that shortens during the game, with the winner being the player with the higher score when time runs out. Each game costs a quarter. Machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game, and the time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 45 seconds to 3 minutes.|$|E
5|$|That even a dead ala is bad {{is seen in}} {{the legend}} {{explaining}} the origin of the Golubatz fly (Simulium colombaschense), a species of bloodsucking black fly (of the genus Simulium) that can be lethal to livestock. The legend, recorded in the Požarevac District in the 19th century by Vuk Karadžić, tells how a Serbian man, after a chase, caught and wounded an ala, but she broke away and fled into a cave near Golubac (a town in the district), where she died of the wounds. Ever since, her body has bred the Golubatz flies, and in late spring, <b>they</b> <b>fly</b> out of the cave in a big swarm, spreading as far as Šumadija. People walled up the cave’s opening once, but when the time came for the flies to swarm, the wall shattered.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch (Erythrura pealii) is {{a species}} of estrildid finch endemic to Fiji that was {{formerly}} {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the red-headed parrotfinch. This parrotfinch is a small, mainly green bird with a red head and tail and a stubby dark grey bill. It is found in both forested and open habitats, and has adapted well to man-made environments such as grasslands, pasture and gardens. Pairs have a courtship display in which <b>they</b> <b>fly</b> above the trees in an undulating flight, calling constantly. Breeding birds build a domed grass nest with a side entrance, and lay a clutch normally of four white eggs. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, with blue balls at the upper and lower corners of the gape, and black markings inside the mouth; older fledglings resemble the adults, but lack the red head colouring. The Fiji parrotfinch eats seeds, especially of grasses, and also readily feeds on insects and nectar. It forms small flocks of up to six birds after the breeding season.|$|E
