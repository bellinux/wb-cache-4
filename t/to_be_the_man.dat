5|$|Miran Pastourma is a famed pastourma and sujuk charcuterie {{business}} and market in Athens, Greece. The {{market has been}} in operation since 1922. It is considered the charcuterie of the connoisseurs. Despite the Greek economic crisis, Miran is expanding its {{business and}} has doubled in size to accommodate increased demand. The founder of the shop, Miran Kourounlian, is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who brought pastourma to Athens for the first time. Miran is considered the largest company {{of its kind in}} the European Union. The flavour of pastourma coming from the historical enterprise permeates Euripides Street in the centre of Athens. Miran and its neighbor Arapian Cold Cuts are considered two of the historical establishments of Athens. Miran has been in the same spot in Euripidou Street since its opening in 1922. Miran is the recipient of multiple gourmet prizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} Alfano reached {{as far as}} politics. Together with his {{right-hand}} men, the priest Ciro Vitozzi and his associate Giovanni Rapi, Alfano was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> behind the election in 1904 of the Count Vincenzo Ravaschieri Foschi to parliament {{to the detriment of}} the incumbent socialist deputy Ettore Ciccotti. The night before the election dissident voters were intimidated, assaulted, beaten, and sustained knife injuries by ruffians hired and encouraged by both the Camorra and the police, since the authorities equally disapproved of a socialist candidate. Alfano, Rapi and Vitozzi were seen and photographed while actively directing the vote in favour of Count Ravaschieri in the Camorra controlled district of Vicaria in which Ciccotti surprisingly had won in 1900. Ravaschieri won the 1904 election.|$|E
5|$|When Beria told Stalin {{about the}} Manhattan Project and its {{importance}} Stalin handpicked Molotov <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{in charge of}} the Soviet atomic bomb project. However, under Molotov's leadership the bomb, and the project itself, developed very slowly and Molotov was replaced by Beria in 1944 on the advice of Igor Kurchatov. When Harry S. Truman, the American president, told Stalin that the Americans had created a bomb never seen before, Stalin relayed the conversation to Molotov and told him to speed up development. On Stalin's orders the Soviet government substantially increased investment in the project.|$|E

The death in an ambush of Michael Collins intensified the desire of Free State authorities for retribution, and on 28 September 1922 the Dáil introduced the Army Emergency Powers Resolution, establishing martial law powers and listing carrying firearms without a licence a capital offence.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, Baseball {{commissioner}} Bud Selig {{announced that}} Major League Baseball would appoint a representative {{to take over}} all business and day-to-day operations of the Dodgers. The move was likely instigated by media reports that owner Frank McCourt had to arrange a $30 million loan from Fox to cover the teams payroll as well as uncertainty over the teams ownership situation relating to the ongoing divorce litigation. On April 25, Selig appointed former Texas Rangers president Tom Schieffer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{in charge of the}} Dodgers situation.|$|E
25|$|He scored {{hundreds}} in {{the quarter}} final and semifinal of the Duleep trophy, but West Zone lost to South on first innings lead in the latter match. Shastri's only other score over fifty in the season was a particularly dull 125 against Pakistan in the Jaipur Test. He did well enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> of the one day series. In the first one-day match against Pakistan he captained India for the first time, scoring 50 and taking three wickets. He took four wickets at Calcutta and 69* at Hyderabad in two thrilling finishes. Later at Nagpur with India facing a big target, he scored 52 in 40 balls.|$|E

25|$|Some {{time later}} {{he came across}} a man – Carton – and {{recognised}} him from the incident with Anita Grünberg. Carton is revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who fell in the Tube station and dropped the note Anne found. Harry followed Carton to London and Nadina to the Mill House, but insists Nadina was already dead. He realised that the diamonds were probably still on the Kilmorden Castle. Anne confirms that they were, and were handed to Suzanne in her cabin {{on the night of}} the 22nd. Harry's island is attacked that night by a party led by the red-bearded Dutchman, but the two manage to escape, and Anne plans to return to Pedler's party where she can keep an eye on developments. They exchange codes to be used in future communications so that neither can be duped again. Reunited with Suzanne, Anne is told that the diamonds are with luggage sent on with Sir Eustace. She also receives a telegram from Harry telling her to meet him.|$|E
500|$|Following the match, The Times commented favourably on Nash, {{reporting}} [...] "Nash is a short, powerfully built man, … {{made the}} ball kick awkwardly, several balls getting up head-high, {{and in one}} spell before luncheon took three wickets for four runs. Nash has plenty of stamina for a fast bowler and is considered by some <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> for whom the selectors are searching to fill the place of Gregory." ...|$|E
500|$|Luton's cup win was the club's {{first major}} piece of {{silverware}} in its history. A jubilant Harford {{described it as}} [...] "the greatest win in my time at Luton," [...] having thought his team had lost the match when Smith scored. He commended his goalkeeper, saying: [...] "Considering all the circumstances, I think Dibble had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> of the match, {{and as for the}} young boy, [...] Black was sensational. He has so much talent." [...] The stand-in goalkeeper for Luton was delighted with his role in the final, but made it pertinent that he needed regular first-team football, or he would be tempted to leave the following season. Brian Stein spoke of his surprise of scoring the winner, and said: [...] "I asked the referee how long was left and he just blew the whistle." [...] Luton held a civic ceremony two days after the final, where the trophy was presented in front of the club's supporters. It was there the stem of the trophy had become noticeably damaged; Luton the following morning returned it to the competition's sponsors for repairs.|$|E

2500|$|Two Iowa cities, Decorah and Waukon, {{are often}} {{said to be}} named for him, {{although}} Waukon is also said to be named for his son Chief John Waukon. There are other place names, such as Dekorra, Wisconsin, and Decoria Township, Blue Earth County, Minnesota, that are named for his relatives.

He also played at a bowling center his family owned, on a night called [...] "Rock and Roll Bowl". After a multitude of lineup changes – including Craig Jones and Josh Brainard, who would reappear in Slipknot – the band released two demos in 1993: Visceral and Mud Fuchia.|$|E

2500|$|He had two {{outstanding}} matches {{to start}} the 1927-28 Sheffield Shield season. In Adelaide he took 5 for 53 off 29.2 overs as South Australia made 189 for 9 to win the match. A week later, after Bill Ponsford and Bill Woodfull had put on 227 for the first wicket for Victoria in Melbourne, he took 7 for 77 and Victoria were dismissed for 355. The Argus noted that on a perfect pitch, McNamee bowled with both [...] "an out swing and an in turn" [...] and that his performance [...] "marks him as the most promising bowler in Australia, and the importance to Australian cricket is very great". Ponsford thought [...] "it may be that he will prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> for whom Australia is looking. He more than most bowlers today resembles the old type of medium paced trundler, who gained their successes by accuracy of length, spin, and a direct attack on the batsmen's defences." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{formed a}} tag team with The Ultimate Warrior {{known as the}} [...] "Ultimate Maniacs" [...] after both men were {{attacked}} by Flair and Mr. Perfect during their match at SummerSlam. After his title loss shortly after, an injured Savage backed Warrior <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> to dethrone Flair. On the November 8, 1992 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, they took on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Money. Inc. lost by countout but retained their title. Savage and Warrior were scheduled to face Flair and Ramon in a tag team match at Survivor Series. Warrior was fired from the WWF weeks before the event, so Savage chose Mr. Perfect, executive consultant to Flair, as his partner to replace Warrior. Perfect initially laughed off the suggestion, but was angered by Bobby Heenan and his insinuations that he could never again wrestle at his previous level, and accepted the match. Despite initial distrust (an interview prior to the match had Savage admit to Perfect that he neither liked nor trusted him), the duo defeated Flair and Ramon via a disqualification.|$|E
