5|$|In {{its first}} year of operation, McCarran Field served over 35,000 passengers. As Las Vegas' casino {{industry}} grew and air travel became more popular during the 1950s, passenger traffic to the airfield rose significantly, with 959,603 passengers transiting through it in 1959. To cope with the increase, airport officials began planning a new passenger terminal. While the original terminal was located on Las Vegas Boulevard, the new terminal was built on Paradise Road. The terminal, whose design {{was inspired by the}} <b>TWA</b> <b>Flight</b> Center in New York City, opened on March 15, 1963.|$|E
5|$|Trans World Airlines (<b>TWA)</b> <b>Flight</b> 159 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight from New York City to Los Angeles, California, with a stopover in Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Kentucky, that crashed after an aborted takeoff from Cincinnati on 6 November 1967. The Boeing 707 attempted to abort takeoff when the copilot became {{concerned that the}} aircraft had collided with a disabled DC-9 on the runway. The aircraft overran the runway, struck an embankment and caught fire. One passenger {{died as a result}} of the accident.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the crash occurred due to the <b>TWA</b> <b>flight</b> crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff due to {{the speed of the}} aircraft, and that a runway overrun was unavoidable at the 707's speed. The disabled DC-9, a Delta Air Lines flight which had reported that it had cleared the runway when in fact it had not, was a contributing factor in the crash. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish and publicize standards of safe clearance from runway edges for both aircraft and ground vehicles which also take into account the exhaust fumes of jet engines. The board also recommended a reevaluation of training manuals and aircraft procedures in regard to abort procedures.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{presented by the}} NTSB accident report determined {{that the cause of}} the accident was the <b>TWA</b> <b>flight</b> crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed. The NTSB recommended revisions and expansions to airline abort procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures, taking into account jet engine exhaust. In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' said that he would have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|E
5|$|About 19hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which was preceded by {{a tropical storm}} watch six hours prior. As the storm intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical storm warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000people stayed in shelters. Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state. Later, the storm forced the cancellation of part of Bob Dole's bus tour through New York, and postponed {{a search for the}} wreck of <b>TWA</b> <b>Flight</b> 800. Game one of the 1996 World Series was postponed by one day due to the storm.|$|E

50|$|On most <b>TWA</b> <b>flights,</b> Karabu {{could buy}} at a heavy {{discount}} and then sell a certain portion of all TWA's available seats. As a result, TWA was hamstrung {{by the high}} proportion of heavily discounted seats that had been sold and was essentially left with no control over its own pricing. It {{could not afford to}} discount any of its own seats, and if TWA wanted to increase revenue on busy routes by putting a larger plane into service, Karabu would only claim more seats. TWA was losing an estimated $150 million a year in revenue due to this deal.|$|R

50|$|TWA Airlines LLC flew {{its last}} flight on December 1, 2001, with an MD-80 {{aircraft}} (N948TW). The ceremonial last flight was Flight 220 from Kansas City to St. Louis, with CEO Captain William Compton at the controls. The final <b>flight</b> before <b>TWA</b> was 'officially' absorbed by American Airlines was completed between St. Louis and Las Vegas, Nevada, also on December 1, 2001. At 10:00 pm CST on that date, employees began removing all TWA signs and placards from airports around the country, {{replacing them with}} American Airlines signs. At midnight, all <b>TWA</b> <b>flights</b> officially became listed as American Airlines flights. Some aircraft carried hybrid American/TWA livery during the transition, with American's tricolor stripe on the fuselage and TWA titles on the tail and forward fuselage.

Captain Wilkins observed that Flight 15A appeared to initiate a left turn but instead began a series of leftward spirals before crashing into the ground nose first.

50|$|In 1960, Rochester Municipal Airport {{opened at}} its current {{location}} 8 mi south of downtown Rochester. American Airlines began service to Chicago O'Hare in 1988. 1995 saw {{the addition of}} a US Customs post and it became the Rochester International Airport. <b>TWA</b> operated <b>flights</b> to St. Louis in early 2001, but these routes were dropped very soon due to the merger with American Airlines. On September 15, 2005, the primary runway was lengthened from 7,533' to 9,033' following a three-month closure for renovations. At the same time, runway centerline and touchdown zone lighting were both added. The change was made primarily to accommodate large wide body aircraft, which were heavily weight-restricted upon departure prior to the extension.|$|R
40|$|Background: Research into airline {{capacity}} {{management and}} yield optimization at the Flight Transportation Laboratory is being {{performed with the}} support and funding of the Cooperative Research Program. The focus of this research {{over the past six}} months has been on patterns of demand for the different fare products available in airline markets. The objective of this work is to gain insight into the most complex component of the capacity management problem faced by airlines [...] variations in demand. Trans World Airlines, a participant in the Cooperative Research Program, has given us access to reservations data and booking histories from its domestic operations over the past several years. A preliminary analysis of final reservations totals by day and by fare class for a sample of two transcontinental flights was undertaken to explore the database and identify its potential uses. The results of this preliminary analysis are discussed in an FTL report completed in April 1984. The preliminary analysis examined trends in daily booking levels and their variability over the sample period. The reservations totals exhibited traditional seasonal and daily variations, except when disrupted by changes in product pricing and/or marketing. Of potential importance to the capacity management problem was the finding that the frequency distributions of demand over the sample period (and portions thereof) {{did not appear to be}} Normal (Gaussian) in shape, but rather were- positively skewed. An intuitive explanation of such a distribution shape was suggested in the paper, namely that some base level of demand can generally be expected and that extreme values are more likely to be high relative to the mean number of reservations. This issue of demand distribution patterns was pursued with further, more detailed, analysis of reservation data from a larger sample of <b>TWA</b> <b>flights.</b> This paper outlines the analysis that was undertaken and discusses the analysis results in the context of airline capacity management...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} Raman-based method for {{detecting}} oxygen and nitrogen in empty fuel tanks. The need for such a method comes from the potential danger of allowing explosive oxygen-fuel mixtures to accumulate in empty airplane fuel tanks. An explosion resulting from such a mixture is believed to have caused the <b>Flight</b> <b>TWA</b> 800 disaster in 1996. Recently, (e. g., February 17, 2004 press release) the FAA announced its intentions to make fuel tank inerting mandatory. One potential solution to this problem is to use an inert gas such as nitrogen to flood the empty fue 1 tanks {{in order to reduce the}} concentration of oxygen...|$|R
