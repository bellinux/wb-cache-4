40|$|In {{the first}} half of this session we will {{consider}} the following five questions: 1. What is professional advice? 2. What is professional independence? 3. What conditions encourage independence? 4. What are the main threats to professional independence? 5. How can we minimise the threats to independence? 1. What is professional advice? Professional advice is the provision of an unbiased opinion by a person whose training and experience should ensure <b>that</b> the <b>advice</b> is in accordance with the current state of knowledge. It follows <b>that</b> professional <b>advice</b> should be based on both formal training and experience. Further, obtaining advice from a professional does not guarantee <b>that</b> the <b>advice</b> will prove correct. Professionals are not clairvoyants. But the advice should be the best that can be expected given the knowledge <b>that</b> exists. Professional <b>advice</b> should increase the probability that the correc...|$|R

25|$|The best {{treatment}} for cutaneous leishmaniasis is not known. Treatments {{that work for}} one species of leishmania may not work for another; it is recommended <b>that</b> <b>advice</b> of a tropical medicine or geographical medicine specialist be sought. Ideally, every effort {{should be made to}} establish the species of leishmania by molecular techniques (PCR) prior to starting treatment. In the setting of a developing country, there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection. Unfortunately, leishmaniasis is an orphan disease in developed nations, and almost all the current treatment options are toxic with significant side effects. The most sound {{treatment for}} cutaneous leishmaniasis thus far is prevention.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} {{entrepreneurs}} {{to work closely}} with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e., their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success. At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when <b>that</b> <b>advice</b> comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g., measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots, and firm survival). This research also shows that older and larger founding teams, presumably those with more subject expertise, are less coachable than younger and smaller founding teams.|$|E

25|$|The Dublin Council advised Essex {{to attack}} O'Neill's confederates in the east, around the Pale, where the rebels were {{reckoned}} at 3,000 plus 800 mercenaries sent from Ulster. Essex {{seems to have}} taken <b>that</b> <b>advice,</b> ordering 5,000 troops into garrisons along the border of the Pale. To counter the White Knight he reinforced Cork on the south coast, and more troops were ordered into Munster for Sir Thomas Norris (acting president of that province) and into Kilkenny for the Earl of Ormond. In the west the army of the President of Connacht, Sir Conyers Clifford, was increased to 3,000. Conditions on the ground had set Essex in opposition to the Council in London: he put the threat from the north on hold and chose, instead, to head south and subdue Ireland in a roundabout tour - through the Pale into Munster, and heading back to Dublin through south Leinster.|$|E

Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It was terribly hurtful and I think I was doomed before I did [...] I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice.

500|$|After the USS Enterprise-C {{emerges from}} a rift in space-time in [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", the {{timeline}} is changed and Yar is once again alive and in her former position on the Enterprise-D. She works with the older Enterprise's helmsman, Richard Castillo (Christopher McDonald), and the two become close. Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who has some awareness of the timeline that would be restored by the Enterprise-C returning into the rift, confides in Yar that she believes that Yar died senselessly in that timeline. Based on <b>that</b> <b>advice,</b> Yar transfers to the Enterprise-C and returns with it to two decades into the past, and its expected destruction {{at the hands of}} the Romulans while defending the Klingon outpost Narendra III. The alternative universe version of Yar travelled back in time on board the Enterprise-C, and into the main timeline. This process was later described as [...] "world jumping" [...] rather than a typical timeline travel story by critics.|$|E
