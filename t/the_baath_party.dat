5|$|Following Syria's independence, the National Bloc was {{dissolved}} {{and replaced}} by the National Party. Quwatli's leadership, while supported by older politicians like Asali, Jabiri and Haffar, became increasingly challenged by emerging leaders such as Nazim al-Qudsi of the People's Party and Akram al-Hawrani of the Arab Socialist Party as well as <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party,</b> the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian Communist Party (SCP). Antagonistic relations between Quwatli and the Hashemite kings of Iraq and Jordan, Abdullah I and Faisal II, respectively, increased with the latter two seeking to unite Syria, Iraq and Jordan under Hashemite monarchical rule, and Quwatli countering that Iraq and Jordan join a republican Syria under his leadership instead. The Hashemites found support in the People's Party, which became an influential force in Aleppo, a major city and economic hub of Syria, particularly after the 1947 death of Jabiri, Quwatli's Aleppo-based ally.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of oil brought more Christians to Kirkuk, however {{they were also}} affected by the Arabization policy of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party.</b> Their numbers continued to plummet after the American invasion, and they occupy 4% of municipal offices, a percentage thought to be representative of their numbers in the city. They number around 2,000.|$|E
25|$|The Ba'athist {{government}} of Iraq forcibly displaced and culturally Arabized minorities (Kurds, Yezidis, Assyrians, Shabaks, Armenians, Turkmen, Mandeans), {{in line with}} settler colonialist policies, from the 1960s to the early 2000s, in order to shift the demographics of North Iraq towards Arab domination. <b>The</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>party</b> under Saddam Hussein engaged in active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards. In 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burned down and around 200,000 Kurds were deported to {{the other parts of}} the country.|$|E

It was first the regional branch of <b>the</b> original <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> (1947-1966) before it changed its allegiance to <b>the</b> Syrian-dominated <b>Baath</b> movement (1966-present) following the 1966 split within <b>the</b> original <b>Baath</b> <b>Party.</b> <b>The</b> party has ruled Syria continuously since the 1963 Syrian coup détat which brought the Baathists to power.|$|R
50|$|Soon after Feisal's birth, {{his family}} moved back to Baghdad, as the {{situation}} had calmed there. He spent his childhood in the Iraqi capital until 1970, when the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> coup two years previously forced his family to move again, this time to Bloomington, Indiana.|$|R
25|$|Ba'athist Arabization {{campaigns in}} North Iraq were forced {{displacement}} and cultural Arabization of minorities (Kurds, Yezidis, Assyrians, Shabaks, Armenians, Turkmen, Mandeans), {{in line with}} settler colonialist policies, led by the Ba'athist government of Iraq from 1960s to early 2000s, in order to shift the demographics of North Iraq towards Arab domination. <b>The</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>party</b> under Saddam Hussein engaged into active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards. The campaigns {{took place during the}} Iraqi–Kurdish conflict, being largely motivated by the Kurdish-Arab ethnic and political conflict.|$|E
25|$|The 1950s {{also saw}} Syria and Egypt attempt to unify as the United Arab Republic, {{and this was}} {{reflected}} in the Syrian Air Force with growth in personnel and aircraft. The union did not last. With the ascent to power of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> and Hafez Al-Assad, himself a former SAF Commander-in-chief, Syria began looking {{to the members of the}} Warsaw Pact for help and built closer ties with the USSR. This in turn led to a huge influx of Eastern-made equipment to the Syrian Armed Forces, including the Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Al-Jundi, {{like many}} members of his family, joined the Ba'ath Party early in his youth. In 1960 al-Jundi, then a captain in {{the army of the}} United Arab Republic (UAR), became a {{founding}} member of the secretive Military Committee of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party.</b> In the beginning, the Military Committee's goal was to rebuild the Ba'ath Party, which had been dissolved on the orders of Gamal Abdel Nasser when the UAR was founded, and establish a new party leadership. Following the Syrian secessionist coup of 1961 that ended the UAR, the Military Committee started planning its own coup against the secessionist government.|$|E

Then he became a member of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> ruling regional command. In addition, he served {{as the head of the}} party's committee of economic affairs. In 2000, he became a member of the party's central committee.|$|R

In 1987, he was inducted into the Republican Guard as an Armoured and Mechanized Units' officer.|$|R
25|$|The Iraqi Islamic Party {{was formed}} in 1960 as the Iraqi branch of the Brotherhood, but was banned from 1961 during the {{nationalist}} rule of Abd al-Karim Qasim. As government repression hardened under <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> from February 1963, the group was forced to continue underground. After {{the fall of the}} Saddam Hussein government in 2003, the Islamic Party has reemerged as one of the main advocates of the country's Sunni community. The Islamic Party has been sharply critical of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, but still participates in the political process nevertheless. Its leader is Iraqi Vice-President Tariq Al-Hashimi.|$|E
25|$|Barzani {{agreed to}} the ceasefire and fired the {{radicals}} from the party. Following the unexpected death of Arif, whereupon he was replaced by his brother, Abdul Rahman Arif, the Iraqi government launched a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kurds. This campaign failed in May 1966, when Barzani forces thoroughly defeated the Iraqi Army at the Battle of Mount Handrin, near Rawandiz. At this battle, {{it was said that}} the Kurds slaughtered an entire brigade. Recognizing the futility of continuing this campaign, Rahamn Arif announced a 12-point peace program in June 1966, which was not implemented due to the overthrow of Rahman Arif in a 1968 coup by <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1973, the Iraqi {{ministry}} of information appointed Bashir to its culture committee; {{the regime of}} <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>party</b> was not well established {{at that time and}} made Bashir to a cultural figure of integration of the Christian minority. Also because of his international popularity, Bashir, who rather presented himself apolitical, seemed to be a suited personality for representing the different ethnic, religious, and political groups of his home country. In 1981 – Saddam Hussein was already in power and the actual forces passing over to the Sunnites – the regime also supports the formation of Bashir's Iraqi Traditional Music Group that dedicates itself to the diversity of the Iraqi culture.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Sharaa {{became a}} member of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>party’s</b> central committee.

In 1980 he was named deputy foreign minister. In 1984 Sharaa was appointed acting minister of informations. In March 1984, Hafez al-Assad, then president of Syria, named him foreign minister, a position that he held until February 2006.|$|R
25|$|Following the 1966 coup d'état, Salah Jadid {{became the}} undisputed strongman of the country. He began his rule by re-organizing all the {{intelligence}} agencies under the central command of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> National Security Bureau. Jadid appointed al-Jundi, his ally, to head the security bureau, which {{became known as the}} most intimidating apparatus in the country. The bureau, under al-Jundi, acquired a notorious reputation in the country for its brutal methods in rooting out opponents, including arbitrary arrests, torture and infiltrating society with state informers.|$|R

25|$|This {{position}} {{put him at}} {{odds with}} the country's new democratic government led by Nazim al-Kudsi, and he was a political outcast during those years from 1961 to 1963, when a new coup in March of that year brought to power a more nationalist and unionist wing of the Baath. Jamal's own cousin, the future president Nureddin al-Atassi became Minister of the Interior, and Jamal became Minister of Information in the cabinet of Prime Minister Salah al-Din al-Bitar, {{one of the founders of}} <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>party.</b> He was also voted into the party's Revolutionary Command Council. A mere four months later Atassi resigned after coming to the realization that restoration of the UAR was not a party priority. He then formed his own party, the Arab Socialist Union, an umbrella group of dedicated unionists who wanted to restore the UAR and reappoint Nasser as president of Syria.|$|E
500|$|While the Syrian {{constitution}} liberally grants free speech, a {{state of}} emergency in effect since <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> seized power suspends this freedom. Syria has stringently approached dissidents who question its policies in neighboring Lebanon; Syrian authorities detained and imprisoned ten activists who signed the Beirut-Damascus Declaration petition in May 2006. The petition, of which al-Mir was a signatory, advocated the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the normalization of relations between the two countries.|$|E

Yasin retained his post together with other two deputy prime ministers, namely Mustafa Tlass and Mahmoud Qaddour. Yasin was in office until March 2000 and replaced by Khalid Raad. Then Yasin returned to teaching post at Damascus University. Following the death of Hafez Assad he was made a member of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party's</b> regional command in June 2000.|$|R
5000|$|The Iraqi Communist Party's first cell {{was founded}} in Nasiriyah by Yusuf Salman Yusuf (known as [...] "Fahd") in the 1930s.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the 1977 census, Assyrians were being {{incorrectly}} referred to as either Arabs or Kurds. Assyrian Christians were forced to deny their identity as Assyrian nationalism was harshly punished.

2500|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> {{took control}} in 1968 and {{especially}} after Saddam Hussein seized power in 1979, youth groups were retooled {{to serve the}} state. One replacement program, Saddam Cubs, offered [...] "summer camps" [...] where 10- to 15-year-old boys had up to 14-hour days filled with hand-to-hand fighting drills. In 1990, during the period when the Iraq Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Council was recognized by WOSM, there were 12,000 Scouts, however by 1999, Iraq had been expelled from the WOSM.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, the {{inspection}} team {{went to a}} site. It was <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> headquarters, like going to Republican Party headquarters or Democratic Party headquarters.

50|$|Other factions within <b>the</b> New <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> {{oppose a}} strong {{connection}} with JRTN. Senior <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> member Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed {{and his followers}} are politically divided with al-Duri's wing of the party, with the Yunis faction aiming {{to return to the}} political process and re-legitimize the political party while al-Douri advocates the creation of a separate Sunni Arab Iraq. Several New <b>Baath</b> <b>Party</b> members have opposed an affiliation with JRTN as the party becomes reduced to a militant movement that overshadows political efforts.|$|R
5000|$|Though the Iraqi {{political}} leadership blamed Al Qaeda and {{the remnants of}} <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Baath</b> <b>party,</b> Al Qaeda's Islamic State of Iraq {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks saying that during [...] "the month of fasting and jihad launched a new earth-shaking wave targeting headquarters, centres and security barriers for the army and apostate police." ...|$|R
2500|$|Before the {{invasion}} of Iraq sectarian violence between Turkmens {{had not been a}} problem. [...] Their shared cultural background had united Sunni and Shia Turkmens. [...] Political mobilisation in Tal Afar had until then been dominated by <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> <b>party.</b> [...] With no readily available movement to replace Saddam's Baathists, the collapse of the state disrupting everything from food to security and increasing distrust towards the Shia dominated Iraqi government, tensions started to arise.

Guillou and Stagh did the research for the book in 1975 and they assert that, at this time, [...] "the Baath regime is clearly popular and among the most stable in the Arab World" [...] (pp.168–169), the freedom of the press enjoyed in Iraq was more extensive than in most other countries in the world (p.239) and it would come as no surprise to the authors if [...] "well before the year 2000, Iraq will have surpassed European countries in living standards" [...] (p.174).|$|E
