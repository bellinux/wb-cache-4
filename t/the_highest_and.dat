5|$|I-96 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as {{a segment of the}} larger State Trunkline Highway System. In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 201,200vehicles used the highway daily between 6 and 7Mile roads in Livonia. Near Norton Shores, 20,638vehicles did so each day between Airline and Fruitport roads. These are <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>and</b> lowest counts along the highway, respectively.

The segment from Livonia west to I-275 is the Jeffries Freeway, named for a former mayor of Detroit, Edward Jeffries.|$|E

5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like {{creature}} through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a top-down perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells that increase the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>and</b> lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature up or down one plane when touched.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport of ski jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which the skis are held close together and parallel to each other. This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating {{a variation in the}} 1980s with the skis pointed diagonally off to the side in a crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes {{at the mercy of the}} elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of wind that made them lose control at <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>and</b> fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes of ski flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other state}} {{highways}} in Michigan, I-196 is {{maintained by the}} Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 77,500vehicles used the highway daily between Lane Avenue and US131 in Grand Rapids and 12,778vehicles did so each day north of the split with US31 near Holland. These are <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>and</b> lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-196 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In addition, the highway has been named by the Michigan Legislature the Gerald R. Ford Freeway to honor the 38th President of the United States. The original legislation from 1974 extended that name to {{the full length of}} the freeway, but when the various memorial highway names were re-codified in 2001, the name was not applied to the Berrien County segment. From the junction with M-63 north to the split with US31 except for the section that connects the ends of the South Haven business loop, the freeway is also a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT), a tourist route that follows Lake Michigan.|$|E

5|$|Notably, both <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>and</b> lowest judges' {{scores are}} omitted {{to cancel out}} any discrepancy, giving a maximum of 60 style points. A perfect jump on a K200 hill would {{therefore}} garner a minimum of 180 points (120 distance points + 60 style points) or more, depending on bonus points. However, such a scenario is only an example and not representative of the highly variable nature of the sport. Gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare, and five is extremely rare. Generally, a good to excellent jump {{can be expected to}} receive judges' scores of 18 to 19.5. While a lower score for style puts an athlete at the risk of being less competitive, this may be mitigated or even nullified if they have attained substantial bonus points for distance.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{route of}} SR522 is {{designated}} {{as part of}} the National Highway System, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The State of Washington also designates the SR522 corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities throughout the state. The highway is the primary route for Seattle-area residents to access Stevens Pass {{and other parts of the}} Cascade Mountains. SR522 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 96,000 vehicles used SR522 at its interchange with I-405 and 12,000 vehicles used it at its eastern terminus in Monroe, <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>and</b> lowest counts along the highway, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The palace is {{structured}} {{around a large}} and paved courtyard. It has a trapezoidal plan, and the land falls away toward the river Ill. To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the Mansard roof), while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>and</b> the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E
