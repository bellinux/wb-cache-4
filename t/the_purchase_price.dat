5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. <b>The</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> {{for the six}} trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing so would have required a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Due to the team's struggles, Huggins made {{personnel}} {{changes during}} the offseason. The Yankees attempted to trade Pipp to another American League team, {{but could not}} agree on the terms with any team. They put Pipp on waivers, and he was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, who reportedly paid the Yankees a greater sum than the $7,500 waiver price. The Reds, who {{had not had a}} strong starting first baseman since Jake Daubert died in 1924, had attempted to acquire Bill Terry from the Giants, but refused to part with Edd Roush in the transaction, and so acquired Pipp instead.

5|$|General Motors is {{sponsoring}} the Pecan Street demonstration project in Austin, Texas. The project {{objective is to}} learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, {{which is what the}} preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 rebate incentive, which effectively halves <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> of the plug-hybrid electric cars.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{performance}} was disappointing. Jaguar {{had intended to}} produce up to 350 cars, but production ceased in 1994 with 275 production cars produced, not all {{of which had been}} sold; some left-hand drive examples were still available in 1997. The recession left many of those who placed a deposit unable to complete the purchase. The index linking of contracts exacerbated the issue, and added almost £200,000 to <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> between early 1990 and mid-1992. The McLaren F1 suffered from similarly poor sales performance, with just 71 cars sold against McLaren's target of 300. McLaren's F1 program eventually turned a small profit thanks to the sale and servicing of the 28 GTR racing variants produced.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{restrictive}} {{assumptions of}} the trade credit period independent of the order quantity and the retailer`s unit selling <b>price</b> equaled to <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>price</b> per unit are relaxed to fit real business situations. In 1985, Goyal considered the retailer`s inventory replenishment problem under trade credit period independent of the order quantity and the retailer`s unit selling <b>price</b> and <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>price</b> per unit were equal. This article investigates the retailer`s inventory problem under trade credit period dependent of the order quantity and the retailer`s unit selling price not necessarily equals to <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>price</b> per unit within the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) framework. In addition, we use an easy and simple arithmetic-geometric mean inequality approach to determine the retailer`s optimal ordering policy under minimizing the annual total relevant cost. This approach could therefore be used easily to introduce the basic inventory theories to younger students who lack the knowledge of calculus. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed model and its optimal solution...|$|R

5|$|Portland was platted in 1845, then Daniel H. Lownsdale {{purchased}} land {{south and}} west of the original platting. He drew up a plat in 1848 that included 11 narrow blocks, 100×200 feet, instead of the standard 200×200 feet. He then brought on Stephen Coffin and William W. Chapman as partners, and dedicated the South Park Blocks and midtown park blocks in 1852. This made them the first official greenspace in Portland. While they were dedicated to the city, they weren't owned by the city until September 22, 1870, when Mayor Bernard Goldsmith and Chapman agreed on selling the South Park Blocks and the two Plaza Blocks (Chapman and Lownsdale Squares) to the city for $6,250. Most of <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> was for the Plaza Blocks, since the park blocks were {{at the edge of}} the developed city.|$|E
5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. <b>The</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). There is a difference between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card. SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E
5|$|A plan {{to upgrade}} the {{waterways}} to allow the use of 300 to 500-tonne boats {{led to the formation}} of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Limited in November 1888. The cost of the scheme was estimated to be around £1million, in addition to the cost of acquiring the canals from the railway company. The new company obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, creating the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, which was authorised to raise £1.5million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation, or by compulsory purchase if negotiations failed. The railway company was unwilling to sell, and it was not until 1895, after protracted negotiation and legal battles that the transfer was agreed. The Navigation Company had only succeeded in raising £625,000, which was less than <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> of the canals, and therefore the railway company nominated half of the ten directors, while the Aire and Calder Company declined to buy any shares because of railway influence. Many of the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system were hindered by a lack of capital, although some further developments took place.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{spent the}} next five years {{gathering}} supporters for his grassroots movement, traveling at his own expense to gather petition signatures from across the state. On January 14, 1855, Holmes went to the state capital of Lansing to lobby the legislature for an agricultural college. He {{spent the next}} four weeks championing the bill he wrote and cementing support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Though many legislators supported the basic concept of a state-funded agricultural college, there was strong opposition from University of Michigan president Henry Tappan, who wanted the agriculture program to be part of his school. Nevertheless, Holmes prevailed. On February 12, 1855, Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed Act 130, establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the school that would become Michigan State University. The final draft of the bill held only two significant differences from the one that Holmes presented: that <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> not exceed US $15 per acre, rather than the $25 Holmes desired; and that the site must be within ten miles (16km) of Lansing, a provision added to silence the various factions that wanted the new college built in their own backyards.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia’s law {{libraries}} gave Blaine {{the chance}} to at last begin to study the law, but in 1853 he received a more tempting offer: to become editor and co-owner of the Kennebec Journal. Blaine had spent several vacations in his wife’s native state of Maine and had become friendly with the Journal’s editors. When the newspaper’s founder, Luther Severance, retired, Blaine was invited to purchase the publication along with co-editor Joseph Baker. He quickly accepted, borrowing <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> from his wife’s brothers. Baker soon sold his share to John L. Stevens, a local minister, in 1854. The Journal had been a staunchly Whig newspaper, which coincided with Blaine’s and Stevens’ political opinions. The decision to become a newspaperman, unexpected as it was, started Blaine {{on the road to}} a lifelong career in politics. Blaine’s purchase of the Journal coincided with the demise of the Whig party and birth of the Republican party, and Blaine and Stevens actively promoted the new party in their newspaper. The newspaper was financially successful, and Blaine was soon able to invest his profits in coal mines in Pennsylvania and Virginia, forming the basis of his future wealth.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited {{launched}} Octopus Rewards, {{a program}} that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges. The rewards that the program offers are {{in the form of}} points, or reward dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves. The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200; and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase. Once these reward dollars are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar. To redeem the accumulated reward dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> is lower than the amount of reward dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card. Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome.|$|E
