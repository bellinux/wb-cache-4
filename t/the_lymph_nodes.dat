5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} {{the cast and}} told them that he was going into the hospital for a minor operation. In fact, Rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of the jawbone. He spent the weekend before the operation writing one final song for Pipe Dream. The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
50|$|Lymphocytes leave <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> as {{effector}} immune cells, via <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> vessels. Their numbers {{compensate for}} the removal of dead peripheral lymphocytes. B and T lymphocytes leave <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> based on changes in concentration of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). The concentration of S1P in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is maintained at a level lower than that of the blood or <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> under <b>the</b> influence of S1P lyase. This means immune cells may leave <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> along a chemokine gradient.|$|R
50|$|Near the medulla is <b>the</b> hilum of <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> This is <b>the</b> {{place where}} blood vessels enter and leave <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and lymphatic vessels leave <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> <b>Lymph</b> vessels {{entering}} <b>the</b> <b>node</b> do so along the perimeter (outer surface).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> deep {{inguinal}} <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> drain superiorly to <b>the</b> external iliac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> then to <b>the</b> pelvic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{and on to}} <b>the</b> paraaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E
25|$|During {{an immune}} response, {{professional}} antigen-presenting cells (APCs) endocytose foreign material (typically bacteria or viruses), which undergoes processing, then travel from the infection site to <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Once at <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> the APC begin to present antigen peptides that {{are bound to}} Class II MHC, allowing CD4+ T cells that express the specific TCRs against the peptide/MHC complex to activate.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for {{patients}} diagnosed with melanoma to have chest X-rays and an LDH test, {{and in some cases}} CT, MRI, PET and/or PET/CT scans. Although controversial, sentinel lymph node biopsies and examination of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are also performed in patients to assess spread to <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the S-100 protein marker.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of a <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> consists of lymphoid follicles in an outer portion called the cortex. The inner {{portion of the}} node is called the medulla, which is surrounded by the cortex on all sides except for a portion known as the hilum. The hilum presents as a depression {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> causing <b>the</b> otherwise spherical <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> to be bean-shaped or ovoid. <b>The</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> vessel directly emerges from <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> at <b>the</b> hilum. The arteries and veins supplying <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> with blood enter and exit through the hilum.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{are present}} {{throughout}} the body, are more concentrated near {{and within the}} trunk, and are divided {{in the study of}} anatomy into groups. Some <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> can be felt when enlarged (and occasionally when not), such as <b>the</b> axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> under <b>the</b> arm, <b>the</b> cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of <b>the</b> head and neck and <b>the</b> inguinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> near <b>the</b> groin crease. Some <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> can be seen, such as <b>the</b> tonsils. Most <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> however lie within the trunk adjacent to other major structures in the body - such as <b>the</b> paraaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and <b>the</b> tracheobronchial <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} the cell {{population}} {{and the rate of}} cell proliferation in <b>the</b> draining popliteal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was studied in rats injected in the foot with adrenal tissue antigen-adjuvant emulsion and pertussis vaccine. The number of cells in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> quadrupled during <b>the</b> first two days after injection prior to any significant increase in the rate of cell proliferation as measured by the number of cells incorporating 3 H-thymidine in vitro. After the second day proliferation of cells contributed to the growth of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node's</b> cell population. It is suggested that the early sudden {{growth of the}} cell population is brought about partly by an increase in the influx of lymphocytes from the blood into <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and partly by a decrease in the efflux of lymphocytes with <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> from <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node...</b>|$|R
25|$|The lymph {{transports}} antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, to <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{where an}} immune response is stimulated.|$|E

25|$|Lymphoma (lymphosarcoma) is a {{malignant}} cancer that is classified by location, cell type, and histological grade. The {{most common form}} in dogs is multicentric, involving <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|E
50|$|The lymphatic vessels {{follow the}} arteries in a {{retrograde}} fashion. The anterior lymphatic vessels drain into <b>the</b> pancreatoduodenal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> located along <b>the</b> superior and inferior pancreatoduodenal arteries {{and then into}} <b>the</b> pyloric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (along <b>the</b> gastroduodenal artery).The posterior lymphatic vessels pass posterior {{to the head of}} the pancreas and drain into <b>the</b> superior mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Efferent lymphatic vessels from <b>the</b> duodenal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ultimately pass into <b>the</b> celiac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} whether <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> status can be accurately predicted in the preoperative setting, we determined {{the impact of}} cT, tumor grade, ER, PR and HER- 2 on <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> status. Based on these variables, axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> positivity could be predicted with an AUC of 0.64. There is no perfect correlation between the tumor grade on core biopsy and on the resection specimen. Hence, {{it might be that}} the actual AUC is even lower than 0.64. These data demonstrate that an accurate prediction of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> status is not possible in the preoperative setting.|$|R
50|$|Metastasis {{of cancer}} cells to {{cervical}} <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> diminishes <b>the</b> chance of cure. Specially, {{if there is}} evidence of metastasis of cancer cells beyond <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> capsule. Though, some data indicates that the metastasis of cancer cells outside <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> capsule is a bad prognosis for HPV-unrelated oropharynx cancer than it is for HPV-related oropharynx.|$|R
25|$|X-rays {{are taken}} prior to surgery because {{about one in}} five cases of VAS will develop metastasis, usually to the lungs but {{possibly}} to <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> or skin.|$|E
25|$|Y. pestis spreads {{through the}} lymphatic vessels of the {{infected}} human {{until it reaches}} a lymph node, where it stimulates haemorrhagic inflammation that causes <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> to expand. The swollen lymph nodes form the characteristic buboes associated with the disease.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{lymphoid tissue}} {{provides}} {{the environment for}} the foreign or altered native molecules (antigens) {{to interact with the}} lymphocytes. It is exemplified by <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and the lymphoid follicles in tonsils, Peyer's patches, spleen, adenoids, skin, etc. that are associated with the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{enlarged}} <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in {{an elderly}} female patient can have varied etiologies {{as well as}} histologic pictures. We are presenting {{the case of a}} 53 -year-old female who presented with inguinal lymphadenopathy with fever, which was clinically misconstrued as lymphoma. Cytology could not exclude a lymphoma. Histology led to the unusual diagnosis of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> in this case. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is a rare, distinctive reactive proliferative pattern in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> which involves proliferation of the connective tissue elements of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> admixed with lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and histiocytes. Multiple etiologic agents have been suggested in existing literature. Despite extensive search, no definite attributable cause could be sought. It is now widely accepted that inflammatory pseudotumor of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is a non-neoplastic proliferation which has a benign clinical course and excellent prognosis after surgical resection...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lymph</b> carries chemokines (molecular {{chemical}} messengers) and antigens to <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> At <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> passes {{quickly through}} the reticular network to the T cell zone and the high endothelial venules. FRCs express chemokines such as CCL21 and CCL19 which assist the movement of T cells and dentritic cells with CCR7 receptors.|$|R
40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> T cells migrate {{rapidly and}} with {{striking}} versatility {{in a continuous}} scan for antigen presenting dendritic cells. The scanning process is greatly facilitated by <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> structure and composition. In vivo imaging {{has been instrumental in}} deciphering the spatiotemporal dynamics of intranodal T cell migration in both health and disease. Here we review recent developments in uncovering the migration modes employed by T cells in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> <b>the</b> underlying molecular mechanisms, and the scanning strategies utilised by T cells to ensure a timely response to antigenic stimuli...|$|R
25|$|The {{region of}} the lymph node called the {{paracortex}} immediately surrounds the medulla. Unlike the cortex, which has mostly immature T cells, or thymocytes, the paracortex has a mixture of immature and mature T cells. Lymphocytes enter <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> through specialised high endothelial venules found in the paracortex.|$|E
25|$|Melanomas* {{account for}} four to six percent of skin tumors in dogs and are usually benign. They are {{the second most common}} tumor of the toe and are {{malignant}} in this location. Malignant melanoma is also a common oral tumor in dogs. Malignant tumors most commonly spread to <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and lungs.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, {{researchers}} from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France say the chemicals in tattoo ink can travel in the bloodstream and accumulate in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> obstructing their ability to fight infections. However, the authors noted in their paper that most tattooed individuals including the donors analyzed do not suffer from chronic inflammation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lymph</b> from <b>the</b> {{peripheral}} tissues contains soluble antigens and {{arrives at}} <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> via afferent lymphatic vessels. An {{adaptive immune response}} takes place {{in response to the}} presence of the antigen in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Antigen-presenting cells accumulate near high endothelial venules to process soluble antigens. Antigens are also presented on the surface of dendritic cells.|$|R
50|$|The test {{is used to}} help {{determine}} <b>the</b> cause of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> enlargement (swollen glands or lymphadenitis). It may also determine whether tumors in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> are cancerous or noncancerous. Enlarged <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{may be caused by}} a number of conditions, ranging from very mild infections to serious malignancies. Benign conditions can often be distinguished from cancerous and infectious processes by microscopic examination. The pathologist may also perform additional tests on <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> tissue to assist in making a diagnosis.|$|R
50|$|If activated, B cells {{will release}} {{antibodies}}, which will travel out of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> These antibodies are termed immunoglobulins. These target and bind to their target antigens. If this occurs, an immune response {{mediated by the}} complement system will occur. Proliferation of cells within <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> will make <b>the</b> node expand.|$|R
25|$|A lymph {{follicle}} is a dense {{collection of}} lymphocytes, the number, size and configuration of which change {{in accordance with}} the functional state of the lymph node. For example, the follicles expand significantly when encountering a foreign antigen. The selection of B cells, or B lymphocytes, occurs in the germinal center of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Y. pestis bacilli {{can resist}} {{phagocytosis}} and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> can haemorrhage and become swollen and necrotic. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague {{is also known}} to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague.|$|E
25|$|Central memory T cells (TCM cells) express CD45RO, C-C {{chemokine}} receptor type 7 (CCR7), and L-selectin (CD62L). Central memory T cells {{also have}} intermediate to high expression of CD44. This memory subpopulation is {{commonly found in}} <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and in the peripheral circulation. (Note- CD44 expression is usually used to distinguish murine naive from memory T cells).|$|E
40|$|Mice {{infected}} systemically with Mycobacterium lepraemurium (“rat leprosy bacillus”), an obligate intracellular parasite, showed uneven {{spread of}} triglyceride, phospholipids, and certain unsaturated fatty-acids in infected macrophages throughout the lymphoid system (determined histochemically and by chromatographic analysis). Such materials were abundant in parasitised macrophages in the thymus, but little or none were demonstrable in parasitised macrophages in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> medulla; only relatively small amounts {{were present in}} the few affected cells in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cortex. Lipids apparently influenced bacillary multiplication, for multiplication was greater in macrophages in the thymus than in <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> despite much lysosomal activity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Goal: The {{study of}} using <b>the</b> {{sentinel}} <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy with radio nucleoid scan and concordance of the pathological evidences of <b>the</b> sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and other <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in stomach cancer surgery. Methods: There are 10 patients, {{which they had}} stomach cancer involved in the study. As {{a result of this}} study before and during the cancer surgery, they had resectable cancer and they did not involve any <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> clinically. In all patients <b>the</b> sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> or <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> marked with radio nucleoid scan and the biopsy of <b>the</b> sentinel <b>lymph</b> nodeand lymphatic dissection done in standard way, then the patient put under the gastrectomy. At last, the pathology result of <b>the</b> sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and other <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> have been compared and the concordance of them have been analysed. Results: Tumor location in 7 cases was in lesser curvature, one in greater curvature, one in antrum and one in EG junction. In 9 cases <b>the</b> sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was against to the tumor in pregastric area, in one case of GE junction tumor, <b>the</b> sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was in <b>the</b> hilum of spleen, and only in one case there was skip metastasis. As a result of pathology report, in 8 cases <b>the</b> sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was involved with cancer which in final pathologic report there was involvement of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> In other 2 cases <b>the</b> sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was clean which in final pathology report there was no involvement in <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Conclusion: In this study there was a concordance between the pathology report of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement. According to this study we can find out that when <b>the</b> sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is not involved with the cancer we can refuse from wide <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResident {{dendritic}} cells (DC) {{within the}} T cell area of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> take up soluble antigens that enter via the afferent lymphatics before antigen carrying DC arrive from the periphery. The reticular network within <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is a conduit system forming the infrastructure for the fast delivery of soluble substances from <b>the</b> afferent <b>lymph</b> to <b>the</b> lumen of high endothelial venules (HEVs). Using high-resolution light microscopy and 3 D reconstruction, we show here that these conduits are unique basement membrane-like structures ensheathed by fibroblastic reticular cells with occasional resident DC embedded within this cell layer. Conduit-associated DC {{are capable of}} taking up and processing soluble antigens transported within the conduits, whereas immigrated mature DC occur remote from the reticular fibers. The conduit system is, therefore, not a closed compartment that shuttles substances through <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> but represents <b>the</b> morphological equivalent to the filtering function of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node...</b>|$|R
