2500|$|The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) {{became a}} {{significant}} customer of the Sea Fury, {{and many of}} its aircraft were diverted from existing Royal Navy contracts. On 23 June 1948, the first aircraft was accepted at RCAF Rockcliffe. The type was quickly put to use replacing Canada's existing inventory of Seafires, taking on the primary role of fleet air defence operating from the aircraft carrier [...] Two Canadian squadrons operated the Sea Fury, Nos. 803 and 883 Squadrons, which were later renumbered as 870 and 871. Pilot training on the Sea Fury was normally conducted at the RCN's HMCS Shearwater land base. Landing difficulties with the Sea Fury were experienced following the RCN's decision to convert to the US Navy's deck landing procedures, which were prone to overstressing and damaging the airframes as the Sea Fury had been designed for a <b>tail-down</b> <b>landing</b> attitude. The Sea Fury would be operated between 1948 and 1956 by the RCN, at which point they were replaced by the jet-powered McDonnell F2H Banshee. The aircraft themselves were put into storage, and some were subsequently purchased by civilians.|$|E
40|$|Tests {{were made}} of a 1 / 10 -scale {{dynamically}} similar model of the North American XFJ- 1 airplane to study its behavior when ditched. The model was landed in calm water at the Langley tank no. 2 monorail. Various landing attitudes, speeds, and conditions of damage were simulated. The behavior of the model was determined from visual observations, by recording the accelerations, and by taking motion pictures of the ditchings. Data are presented in tabular form, sequence photographs, and time-history acceleration curves. From {{the results of the}} tests it was concluded that the airplane should be ditched at the near-stall, <b>tail-down</b> <b>landing</b> attitude of 12 deg. The flaps should be fully extended to obtain the lowest possible landing speed. The wing-tip tanks should be jettisoned if any appreciable load of fuel remains; if empty, they should be retained for additional buoyancy. In a calm-water ditching the airplane will probably run about 600 feet Maximum longitudinal decelerations of about 2. 5 g and maximum vertical acceleration of about 2 g will be encountered. The nose-intake duct will be clear of the water until practically all forward motion has stopped...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the local 3 D stress analysis of metal front and rear-beam of SARAS composite wing. By the 2 -D global analysis of wing, {{it is found}} that there is stress concentration where pintle pin is attached to the beam. To capture the detail stress distribution around the cylindrical pintle pin-hole surface and to check the safety of the landing-gear-beam attachment area, a fine three-dimensional modeling is done on the beam between sta# 5 to sta# 6. The 3 -D model is integrated to 2 -D model of global wing. For loading purpose, the bearing reactions obtained at pintle-pin area from 2 -D analysis is distributed at the beam interface as sinusoidal variation. The axial-force is applied as pressure under bush collar area of the beam. FE analysis is carried out for all landing and ground handling load cases (21 cases) for ultimate design loading condition. VonMises stress at one of the horizontal gusset of landing- gear-front beam attachment area is found more than the yield-stress of material for <b>tail-down</b> <b>landing</b> spring back load case. Though modification in the gusset is carried out to improve the stress in gusset. Further analysis show that attachments are safe fiom stress point of view. This modification is implemented in detail design...|$|E
