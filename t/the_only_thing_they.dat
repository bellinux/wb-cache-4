5|$|In {{what was}} {{according}} to coach Lou Holtz a prearranged move, New York Jets rookie quarterback Richard Todd {{was replaced by}} Joe Namath {{late in the first}} quarter. Namath responded with a passing display that gave the Jets a 24–0 halftime lead. Saying that his players were “polite” to Namath, coach McKay compared the Buccaneers to a junior-high team, and said that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> did better than the Jets was to be the first team on the field after halftime. Clark Gaines rushed for 103 yards for the Jets. The Buccaneers’ three quarterbacks combined for 171 yards passing, more than the Jets’ quarterbacks, but the Buccaneers failed to score for the fourth time in the season. As the score rose, the press box announcer began calling out records set during the game, which included the Jets’ first shutout in Shea Stadium. This was considered to be the Buccaneers’ last good chance to win a game, with the next four opponents all in playoff contention. The Jets’ 34 points were nearly a third of their season total of 110 after ten games, and a fifth of their season total of 169.|$|E
5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety}} of impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E

Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> fear was FIRE, if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan.

Madonna had listened to Douglas's previous works and had requested studio time with him. Together with the other songwriters, they wrote [...] "Ghosttown" [...] in three days.

50|$|The best stones used by stone-putters are {{untouched}} by tools. They are found naturally {{in the bottom}} of rivers, worn smooth over time by the water. Early athletes used these smooth, round stones in their competitions. The stone-putters can practice their sport practically anywhere at little or no cost, because <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> need are stones and ground. This made the sport easily accessible throughout Scotland, and was often practiced in farmyards and villages.Inferences to stone-putters can be seen throughout Scottish history, beginning with the ‘stone of strength,’ which was placed at highland chieftains’ entrances. The ‘Stone of Strength’ was the earlier version of putting the stone. Later, the ‘Manhood Stone’ was placed at the entrances to homes. A visitor who could lift this stone onto another stone about three or four feet high was assured hospitality and a good welcome.|$|R

500|$|Azaria {{attended}} The Kew-Forest School in Forest Hills. He {{decided to}} become an actor after performing in a school play {{at the age of}} 16, becoming, at the expense of his academic studies, [...] "obsessed with acting." [...] Both of his parents loved all forms of show business, which further spurred him to become an actor. He studied drama at Tufts University from 1981 to 1985, where he met and befriended actor Oliver Platt and noted that [...] "Oliver was a better actor than I was in college, and he really inspired me." [...] Together they both starred in various college stage productions, including The Merchant of Venice, before Azaria trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Although he did not expect the endeavor to be successful, Azaria {{decided to become}} a professional actor, so that later in his life, he would not regret not having tried. Azaria's first acting job was an advertisement for Italian television when he was seventeen years old. He also worked as a busboy. Azaria originally intended to work predominantly as a theatrical actor, and he and Platt set up their own company, named Big Theatre, although Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> ever performed. He decided that television was a better arena and offered more opportunity so, after being offered work with talent agent Harry Gold, Azaria moved to Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Karen Foss, a {{communications}} {{professor at the}} University of New Mexico, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics {{to the fact that}} he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E

In most places where there has been a large Roman colony, remains can be seen of the amphitheatres, where the citizens were wont to assemble for these diversions. Sometimes these are stages of circular galleries of seats hewn out of the hillside, where rows of spectators might sit one above the other, all looking down on a broad, flat space in the centre, under their feet, where the representations took place. Sometimes, when the country was flat, or it was easier to build than to excavate, the amphitheatre was raised above ground, rising up to a considerable height.|$|R

2500|$|Guerrero teachers, {{including}} the students from Ayotzinapa, {{are known for}} their [...] "militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks." [...] The appropriation of the vehicles was, according to the students, routine and temporary. Most of the buses are usually returned after the protests conclude. This tactic has largely been tolerated by law enforcement even though it is inconvenient for other users of public transport. Though federal agents tend not to actively confront students when they [...] "borrow" [...] buses, the practice puts students and teachers at odds with local officials. Other protest tactics used by the students include throwing rocks at police officers, blocking roads, and stealing property. Students claim those tactics are {{the only way to get}} attention and earn funds from the government. Local authorities in Guerrero tend to be suspicious of student protests because they suspect them of having ties with leftist guerrillas or rival political groups. In 1995, the Guerrero state police killed 17 farmers and injured 21 others when they were carrying out a protest. The massacre led to the creation of the Popular Revolutionary Army (Spanish: Ejército Popular Revolucionario), which is believed by some state officials to retain some political influence in Guerrero. Students claim to have no ties with such groups, and that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> have in common with them is their socialist ideology. In addition, in places like Guerrero, where the bus companies are assumed to pay protection money, the student campaigns are seen as threatening to organized crime.|$|E

The Boii occupied the old Etruscan settlement of Felsina, which they named Bononia (modern Bologna). Polybius describes the Celtic way of life in Cisalpine Gaul as follows: They lived in unwalled villages, without any superfluous furniture; for as they slept on beds of leaves and fed on meat and were exclusively occupied with war and agriculture, their lives were very simple, and they had no knowledge whatever of any art or science. Their possessions consisted of cattle and gold, because these were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> could carry about with them everywhere according to circumstances and shift where they chose.
