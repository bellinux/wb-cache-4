40|$|We report new HST and {{ground-based}} {{observations of}} a damped Lyman-alpha <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> toward the QSO 0850 + 4400. The redshift of the <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> is z = 0. 163770 and the neutral hydrogen column {{density of the}} <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> is log N = 19. 81 cm**- 2. The <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> {{is by far the}} lowest redshift confirmed damped Lyman-alpha <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> yet identified, which provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the nature, impact geometry, and kinematics of the absorbing galaxy in great detail. The observations indicate that the <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> is remarkable in three respects: First, the <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> is characterized by weak metal absorption lines and a low metal abundance, possibly less than 4 % of the solar metal abundance. This cannot be explained as a consequence of dust, because the neutral hydrogen column density of the <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> is far too low for obscuration by dust to introduce any significant selection effects. Second, the <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> is associated with a moderate-luminosity early-type S 0 galaxy, although the absorption may actually arise in one of several very faint galaxies detected very close to the QSO line of sight. Third, the absorbing material moves counter to the rotating galaxy disk, which rules out the possibility that the absorption arises in a thin or thick co-rotating gaseous disk. These results run contrary to the expectation that low-redshift damped Lyman-alpha <b>absorption</b> <b>systems</b> generally arise in the gas- and metal-rich inner parts of late-type spiral galaxies. We suggest instead that mounting evidence indicates that low-redshift galaxies of a variety of morphological types may contain significant quantities of low metal abundance gas at large galactocentric distances.

40|$|In indoor swimming-pool facilities, {{the energy}} demand is large due to {{ventilation}} losses with the exhaust air. Since water is evaporated {{from the pool}} surface, the exhaust air has a high water content and specific enthalpy. Because of the low temperature, {{the heat from the}} evaporation is difficult to recover. In this paper, the energy demand for the conventional ventilation technique in indoor swimming pools is compared to two different heat-recovery techniques, the mechanical heat pump and the open <b>absorption</b> <b>system.</b> The mechanical heat-pump is the most widely used technique in Sweden today. The open <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> is a new technique in this application. Calculations have been carried out on an hourly basis for the different techniques. Measurements from an <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> pilot-plant installed in an indoor swimming pool {{in the northern part of}} Sweden have been used in the calculations. The results show that with the mechanical heat pump, the electrical input increases by 63 MWh/year and with the open <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> 57 MWh/year. However, a mechanical heat-pump and an open <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> decrease, the annual energy demand from 611 to 528 and 484 MWh respectively, which correspond to decreases of approximately 14 and 20 % respectively. The electricity input will increase when using heat-recovery techniques. Changing the climate in the facility has also been investigated. An increased temperature decreases the energy demand when using the conventional ventilation technique. However, when either the mechanical heat-pump or the open <b>absorption</b> <b>system</b> is used, the energy demand is increased when the temperature is increased.
