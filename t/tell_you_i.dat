25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E

500|$|Texans {{knew of the}} {{oil that}} lay beneath {{the ground in the}} state for decades, but this was often seen more as a problem than a benefit because it {{hindered}} the digging of water wells. Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and they got me oil. I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was mad, mad clean through. We needed water for ourselves and for our cattle to drink." ...|$|E

500|$|When he {{graduated}} from high school in 1997, Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6' 1". He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I looked at him and said, Well, we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Stop the War Conference 2009, he {{described}} the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as [...] "Imperialist war(s)" [...] and discussed the killing of American and allied troops by Iraqi or foreign insurgents, questioning whether they were in fact freedom fighters, and comparing the insurgents to a British Dad's Army, saying: [...] "If you are invaded {{you have a right}} to self-defence, and this idea that people in Iraq and Afghanistan who are resisting the invasion are militant Muslim extremists is a complete bloody lie. I joined Dad's Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window. Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist?" ...|$|E
500|$|... « Toccata »: In this introduction, we are {{introduced}} to the narrator, and discover how he has ended up in France after the war. He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. He closes the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do what can be done, it's the same for everyone, I am a man like other men, I am a man like you.

500|$|The {{mathematician}} Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, {{stating that}} [...] "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research. King cites the mathematician G. H. Hardy's 1940 essay A Mathematician's Apology. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of classical times as first rate, namely Euclid's proof there are infinitely many prime numbers, and the {{proof that the}} square root of 2 is irrational. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for mathematical elegance: [...] "seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy" [...] (King's italics), and describes the proof as [...] "aesthetically pleasing". The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: [...] "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> know numbers are beautiful." ...|$|E
500|$|Separate {{awards for}} Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance were {{introduced}} in 1990. Beginning that year, Metallica won three consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance for the song [...] "One" [...] from ...And Justice for All, their cover of Queen's [...] "Stone Cold Crazy", and their eponymous album in 1992. When Metallica won the Grammy in 1992, drummer Lars Ulrich referenced the previous award by facetiously [...] "thanking" [...] Jethro Tull for not putting out an album that year, though they actually had released the album Catfish Rising in 1991. A decade after Jethro Tull defeated Metallica, Ulrich admitted: [...] "I'd be lying if I didn't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was disappointed. Human nature is that you'd rather win than lose, but Jethro Tull walking away with it makes a huge mockery of {{the intentions of the}} event." [...] As of 2010, Metallica holds the record for the most wins in the metal category, with a total of six.|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} {{presumptive}} 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump, Cryer shared his feelings on the May 5, 2016, {{episode of the}} podcast Never Not Funny. Cryer stated, [...] "I have been pointing out, and I have been screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the Charlie Sheen of politics. [...] I have to <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> love Charlie Sheen, I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's full of shit. He has been full of shit, you know, he has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and I think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E

500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene. This was refuted by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: [...] "absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other people... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera {{for every one of}} those seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A. Green, the assistant director, also refutes Bass' claim: [...] "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." [...] Roger Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, summarily dismissed the rumor, stating, [...] "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Rosas's {{authority}} and influence spread {{far beyond the}} House of Representatives. He exercised tight control over the bureaucracy {{as well as his}} cabinet, stating: [...] "Do not imagine that my Ministers are anything but my Secretaries. I put them in their offices to listen and report, and nothing more." [...] His supporters were rewarded with positions within the state apparatus, and anyone he deemed a threat was purged. Opposition newspapers were burned in public squares. Rosas created an elaborate cult of personality, presenting himself as an almighty and fatherlike figure who protected the people. His portraits were carried in street demonstrations and placed on church altars to be venerated. Rosismo was no longer a mere faction within the Federalist ranks; it had become a political movement. As early as 1829, Rosas had confided to an Uruguayan diplomatic envoy: [...] "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> am not a Federalist, and I have never belonged to that party." [...] During his governorship, he still claimed to have favoured Federalism against Unitarianism, although in practice Federalism had by that time been subsumed into the Rosismo movement.|$|E
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E

500|$|... "She is enigmatic but I must <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> {{never had}} a bad {{experience}} because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Beyoncé's performance, American {{journalist}} Anderson Cooper who {{was present}} at the Hall and served as a host jokingly asked the crowd, [...] "Is this what happens at the U.N. every Friday night? Because, I've gotta <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> ... <b>I</b> wanna be here every Friday night if this goes on." [...] Diane Warren described the performance as [...] "one of the best experiences ever" [...] in her life. The performance and the music video received positive reviews from critics, who praised Beyoncé's live vocals. Pamela Falk of CBS News described the performance as [...] "breathtaking" [...] and [...] "stunning". Jim Farber of Daily News was also positive about the performance saying that she [...] "delivered a powerful live vocal to the song's musical track". Molly O'Brien of Prefix Magazine commented that the video was [...] "simple and powerful: Beyoncé gives an impeccable live performance of the song... On the album, 'I Was Here' is pompous and a little cloying; live and accompanied by those images, it's got the same change-the-world flavor as Michael Jackson's 'Man in the Mirror.'" [...] Nadeska Alexis of the same publication wrote that Beyoncé belted out her vocals while members of the audience sang along further noting that the moment ended [...] "all too quickly". A writer of OK! magazine praised Beyoncé for being [...] "striking as always" [...] while belting out [...] "I Was Here" [...] in the video. MTV Act's Jose Iniguez described the performance as [...] "phenomenal, flawless, goosebump-inducing, inspiring" [...] adding that it gave him life and made him feel [...] "gobbled up" [...] by the presence of Beyoncé. He added that [...] "I Was Here" [...] couldn't have been a better fit for the campaign and concluded that [...] "Bey was simply flawless. Her voice, her dress, her touching (yet short) address after her performance sent chills down very limb." [...] Mike Larkin from the Daily Mail described the performance as [...] "spectacular" [...] while praising the [...] "virtual galaxy" [...] created on the stage with [...] "lavish" [...] production values, Beyoncé's [...] "spine-tingling" [...] vocal rendition while hitting the high notes and her [...] "fantastic" [...] look complete with [...] "dazzlingly glamorous white frock, which hugged her spectacular post pregnancy body in all the right places".|$|E
