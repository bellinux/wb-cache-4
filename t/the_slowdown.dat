5|$|Dayton's {{population}} declined {{significantly from}} a peak of 262,332 residents in 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010. This was in part due to <b>the</b> <b>slowdown</b> of the region's manufacturing and the growth of Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville. The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010. However, recent census estimates show a 1.3% population increase since 2010, the first increase in five decades.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} mechanism of the stagnation in Japan after 1990, focusing {{on the relationship between}} the credit market and <b>the</b> productivity <b>slowdown.</b> <b>The</b> key mechanism is that the credit market has a function to reallocate the production resources from the less-productive to the more-productive producers, and that if this function is hampered, then the average productivity level of the economy falls and <b>the</b> productivity <b>slowdown</b> occurs. This dissertation consists of three chapters. Chapter 1 estimates the productivity growth rate in Japan, and confirms <b>the</b> productivity <b>slowdown</b> in <b>the</b> 1990 's. Chapter 2 provides a heterogeneous agents model with different productivity levels of the agents, and analyzes how the restriction on collateral liquidation affects <b>the</b> productivity <b>slowdown.</b> This analysis links the feature of the Japanese credit market with <b>the</b> productivity <b>slowdown</b> after 1990. Chapter 3 analyzes the capital- and the investment-output ratios under a credit crunch, and shows that the credit market shock is consistent with the observed feature of these ratios in Japan after 1990...|$|R

In 2013 the Ampera ranked eighth among Europe's top selling plug-in electric vehicles, and its market share fell to about 5%.

40|$|Abstract. Fine-grain Sleep Transistor Insertion (FGSTI) is an {{effective}} leakage reduction method in VLSI design optimization. In this paper, a novel Genetic Algorithm (GA) based FGSTI technique is presented to decide where to put the sleep transistors (ST) when <b>the</b> circuit <b>slowdown</b> {{is not enough to}} assign sleep transistors everywhere in the combinational circuits. Penalty based fitness func-tion with a built-in circuit delay calculator is used to meet the performance con-straint. Although optimal FGSTI problem is proved to be NP-hard, our method can steadily give a flexible trade-off between runtime and accuracy. Further-more a Successive Chromosome Initialization method is proposed to reduce the computation complexity when <b>the</b> circuit <b>slowdown</b> is 3 % and 5 %. Our ex-perimental results show that the GA based FGSTI technique can achieve about 75 %, 94 % and 97 % leakage current saving when <b>the</b> circuit <b>slowdown</b> is 0 %, 3 % and 5 % respectively. ...|$|R

We take into account the fact that commodity prices are characterized by structural breaks, and to this end we make use of novel econometric procedures incorporating the Flexible Fourier Form when testing for causal relations between <b>the</b> PRC <b>slowdown</b> and commodity prices. We find varying degrees of response of <b>the</b> PRC <b>slowdown</b> on different commodity prices. Further, this study determines whether the economic growth in selected developing and emerging Asian countries that are heavily dependent on commodities respond in an asymmetric manner to positive commodity price shocks as opposed to negative price shocks. Adopting a structural dynamic regression and censoring positive and negative shocks, we find limited evidence of any asymmetric response of economic activity to positive and negative commodity price shocks...|$|R
40|$|To balance {{performance}} goals and allow administrators to declaratively specify high-level {{performance goals}}, we apply complete search algorithms to design on-line job scheduling policies for workloads {{that run on}} parallel computer systems.

A wide range of measures are used for performance evaluation, including <b>the</b> average <b>slowdown,</b> average wait, maximum wait, and new measures based on excessive wait. For the workloads studied, our {{results show that the}} best search-based scheduling policy (i. e., DDS/lxf/dynB) reported here simultaneously beats both FCFS-backfill and LXF-backfill, each roughly providing a lower bound on maximum wait and <b>the</b> average <b>slowdown,</b> respectively, among backfill policies...|$|R
