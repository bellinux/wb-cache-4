40|$|The {{vulcanization}} kinetics of Ethylene-propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber {{thermal insulation}} was studied by using rheometer under isothermal condition at different temperatures.

Dry spot formation and air entrapment during filling stage caused by improper design of filling conditions and locations that lead to undesired filling patterns resulting in defective RTM parts. Proper placement of inlet ports and exit vents as well as by adjustment of filling conditions can alleviate the problems during the mould filling stage. The temperature profile used to polymerize the resin must be carefully chosen to reduce <b>the</b> <b>cure</b> <b>time.</b> Instead of trial and error methods that are expensive, time consuming, and non-optimal, we propose a simulation-based optimization strategy for a composite cab front component to reduce the air entrapment and cure stage optimization.

Cure reaction kinetics and chemo-rheology were the submodels developed empirically for an unsaturated polyester resin using experimental data. The simulations were performed using commercial software PAM RTM 2008, developed by ESI Technologies.

It is demonstrated that the amide groups in the 2, 5 -furandicarboxamide moiety are susceptible to participation in a branching reaction with 2 -oxazoline rings.

The increased tendency to form branches or cross-links in 2, 5 -FDCAox based systems is attributed to the occurrence of intra-molecular hydrogen bonding of the 2, 5 -furandicarboxamide moiety. Such an intra-molecular hydrogen bond increases the nucleophilicity of the furanic amide group and makes it more susceptible to participation in an addition reaction with a 2 -oxazoline ring.
