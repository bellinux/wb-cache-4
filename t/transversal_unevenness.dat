40|$|Summarising {{indices of}} road {{condition}} {{are used in}} road maintenance management for aggregating the vast amount of data and for communication purposes. In this paper, a road condition rating based on factor analysis of measured road condition variables is developed to calculate values for an existing or a new condition index. Three factors were extracted from road surface profile and deflection measurements: structural factor, roughness factor and <b>transversal</b> <b>unevenness</b> factor. Factor scores are calculated as {{the mean of the}} standardised values of log-transformed variables in each factor. Condition rating, calculated as the weighted sum of the factor scores, is used for maintenance policy evaluation. ...|$|E
40|$|Road surface {{condition}} measurements are in Austria periodically obtained {{for all the}} federal roads. These measurements refer to 50 m long road sections and {{form the basis for}} an evaluation of {{the current state of the}} road network as well as the subsequent analysis of maintenance strategies and their funding requirements. In order to systematically utilize the information contained in these measurement series, homogeneous sections have to be identified for longitudinal and <b>transversal</b> <b>unevenness</b> as well as skid resistance. For that purpose a recently published segmentation algorithm has been implemented as a stand-alone computer program that is capable of processing huge amounts of data in batch mode. This software takes a measurement series as input and identifies the borders of homogeneous sections by evaluating the statistical properties of the measurement series under study. A variety of quantities representing the homogeneous sections is calculated and can be exported in widely understood file formats for further processing. While the program is able to execute fully automatically, the user has the option to control all aspects of the implemented algorithm and might alter any suggested segmentation using the graphical interface of the application. About 10, 000 km of Austrian federal roads of category B have been successfully processed using this computer program, and homogeneous sections based respectively on measurements of the International Roughness Index, rut depth, and skid resistance have been identified and stored in the Austrian Pavement Management System. The program is available through the web pag...|$|E
