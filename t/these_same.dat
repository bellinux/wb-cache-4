5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{increasing}} isolation from the majority of anti-war anarchists, George Woodcock notes that Kropotkin and anarchists who supported his position drew closer together in the months that preceded the Manifestos creation.

5|$|Sonic 3 {{includes}} a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles the Echidna, race through one {{or all of}} five stages that do {{not appear in the}} main game. In <b>these</b> <b>same</b> stages, a single player can compete against the clock in time attacks.|$|E
5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, <b>these</b> <b>same</b> adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E
5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce <b>these</b> <b>same</b> symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E

5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it was rather simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that <b>these</b> <b>same</b> new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} from Switzerland and the United States published a paper identifying the genetic cause of dominant white spotting in horses from the Franches Montagnes horse, Camarillo White Horse, Arabian horse and Thoroughbred breeds. Each of these dominant white conditions had occurred separately and spontaneously {{in the past}} 75 years, and each represents a different allele (variation or form) of the same gene. <b>These</b> <b>same</b> researchers identified a further seven unique causes of dominant white in 2009: three in distinct families of Thoroughbreds, one Icelandic horse, one Holsteiner, a large family of American Quarter Horses and a family of South German Draft horses.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{diseases}} are not static phenomena, but capable of evolution. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, {{as well as}} pharmaceutical drugs. <b>These</b> <b>same</b> problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance. It is possible that we are facing {{the end of the}} effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.|$|E

5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans.

5|$|Newman {{himself had}} been {{regarded}} as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled {{the headquarters of the}} NFB. Newman was concerned about the idea of releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes, such as Groulx's 24 heures ou plus, at such a tense political time, worried about what the Canadian public would think. Although it was Newman's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of <b>these</b> <b>same</b> films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Now, {{the next}} player {{to the right}} plays a card {{following}} the same rules as the second player: if possible, a card of the same suit as the first player's card must be played, higher than the first two cards if possible; or {{if this is not}} possible, then lower; if no card of the same suit is held, then if possible, a trump card must be played; if no trump card is held, then any card may be played. The fourth player likewise plays a card following <b>these</b> <b>same</b> rules.|$|E

5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what a system is constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern biologist, such teleology describes adaptation {{under the pressure of}} natural selection. The efficient cause is how a system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of <b>these</b> <b>same</b> kinds.|$|E
5|$|The Nerevarine {{is invited}} to the palace of the poet god-king Vivec, {{one of the three}} deities that forms the basis of Morrowind's religion, known as the Tribunal, to discuss the assault on Dagoth Ur's stronghold in the heart of Red Mountain. Vivec {{presents}} the player with the gauntlet 'Wraithguard', an ancient Dwemer artifact that allows the use of the tools Sunder and Keening. These ancient weapons were created by the Dwemer to tap into the power of the fabled Heart of Lorkhan, which they found beneath Red Mountain - and <b>these</b> <b>same</b> tools have been used by the Tribunal and Dagoth Ur to reach their god-like status.|$|E
5|$|The game engine has {{had major}} {{performance}} {{issues on the}} PlayStation 3. These issues have led to unplayable frame-rates when the save game file gets too big or when DLC is installed. Due {{to the nature of}} the game, the longer the player plays, the larger the save file becomes. <b>These</b> <b>same</b> issues plagued , but a performance patch to improve New Vegas seems unlikely. Sawyer said that it is a core-engine issue that can not be so easily patched.|$|E

5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows <b>these</b> <b>same</b> areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E
5|$|Advancements {{in weapons}} {{technology}} enhanced by gunpowder, including {{the evolution of}} the early flamethrower, explosive grenade, firearm, cannon, and land mine, enabled the Song Chinese to ward off their militant enemies until the Song's ultimate collapse in the late 13th century. The Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044 was the first book in history to provide formulas for gunpowder and their specified use in different types of bombs. While engaged in a war with the Mongols, in 1259 the official Li Zengbo wrote in his Kezhai Zagao, Xugaohou that the city of Qingzhou was manufacturing one to two thousand strong iron-cased bomb shells a month, dispatching to Xiangyang and Yingzhou about ten to twenty thousand such bombs at a time. In turn, the invading Mongols employed northern Chinese soldiers and used <b>these</b> <b>same</b> types of gunpowder weapons against the Song. By the 14th century the firearm and cannon could also be found in Europe, India, and the Islamic Middle East, during the early age of gunpowder warfare.|$|E
