50|$|From {{the basic}} {{principles}} that electric current leads to thermal heating and thermal power transfer to the ambient environment requires some temperature difference, {{it follows that the}} current leads to a temperature rise in the conductors. The ampacity, or maximum allowable current, of an electric power cable depends on the allowable temperatures of the cable and any adjacent materials such as insulation or <b>termination</b> <b>equipment.</b> For insulated cables, the insulation maximum temperature is normally the limiting material property that constrains ampacity. For uninsulated cables (typically used in overhead installation), the tensile strength of the cable (as affected by temperature) is normally the limiting material property. The Neher-McGrath method is the electrical industry standard for calculating cable ampacity, most often employed via lookup in tables of precomputed results for common configurations.|$|E
50|$|Network Termination 1 (NT1) or Network Termination type 1 {{refers to}} {{equipment}} in an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) that physically and electrically terminates the network at the customer's premises. The NT1 network termination provides signal conversion and timing functions which correspond to layer 1 of the OSI model. In a Basic Rate Interface, the NT1 connects to line <b>termination</b> (LT) <b>equipment</b> in the provider's telephone exchange via the local loop two wire U interface and to customer equipment via the four wire S interface or T interface. The S and T interfaces are electrically equivalent, and the customer equipment port of a NT1 is often labelled as S/T interface. There are {{many types of}} NT1 available.|$|R

50|$|T-carrier {{technology}} {{dates to}} 1957 and provides data rates {{that range from}} 56 and 64 kbit/s (DS0) to 1.5 Mbit/s (DS1 or T1), to 45 Mbit/s (DS3 or T3). A T1 line carries 24 voice or data channels (24 DS0s), so customers may use some channels for data and others for voice traffic or use all 24 channels for clear channel data. A DS3 (T3) line carries 28 DS1 (T1) channels. Fractional T1 lines are also available in multiples of a DS0 to provide data rates between 56 and 1,500 kbit/s. T-carrier lines require special <b>termination</b> <b>equipment</b> that may be separate from or integrated into a router or switch and which may be purchased or leased from an ISP. In Japan the equivalent standard is J1/J3. In Europe, a slightly different standard, E-carrier, provides 32 user channels (64 kbit/s) on an E1 (2.0 Mbit/s) and 512 user channels or 16 E1s on an E3 (34.4 Mbit/s).|$|E
50|$|A {{domestic}} single British {{telephone line}} installation {{will have a}} single master socket or line box in the premises, which is provided by BT or another service provider: this socket is the demarcation point between the customer-owned and maintained on-premises wiring, and the telephone network. For installations using the NTE5 line box (NTE for network <b>termination</b> <b>equipment),</b> the demarcation point is actually within the socket: {{the lower half of}} the front plate and associated wiring is the customer's, while the permanent wiring on the non-removable section behind this, remains the responsibility of the service provider. Customers are not permitted to access the wiring in a master socket without a removable lower section. Plug-in extension kits are available for customers with this type of installation. The two wires from the exchange are denoted the B leg at −48V relative to ground when the line is not in use and the A leg which is near ground potential when the line is not in use. The A leg goes to pin 5 and the B leg to pin 2 in the master socket. (Although all equipment will work with a reversed line, so a reverse wired socket is not strictly a fault.) When current is flowing on the line, the B leg voltage collapses to nearer ground and the A leg voltage moves nearer to the B leg voltage. The exact voltage drop is a function of the distance to the exchange, and the network wiring type.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 2001 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaJoint Advanced Missile Instrumentation (JAMI), a Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) initiative, is {{developing}} advanced telemetry system components {{that can be}} used in an integrated instrumentation package for tri-service small missile test and training applications.

50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper wire <b>terminations</b> inside utilization <b>equipment,</b> such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|R
40|$|Ethernet is {{evolving}} from {{its origins in}} the local area network into a cost-effective and reliable wide area network technology. Market research shows that business customers are moving away from traditional leased lines and selecting Ethernet as the access network technology of choice due to its low cost, simplicity and flexibility. Developments in Ethernet technology are now offering service providers the opportunity to deliver cost-effective carrier class Ethernet services. In particular, {{a new generation of}} Ethernet network <b>termination</b> <b>equipment</b> (NTE) is emerging which provides remote management, flexible bandwidth and fault diagnosis while supporting access to multiple services delivered over a single physical connection. This paper describes the advantages and potential cost savings of using Ethernet in the access network. A case study for a city demonstrates significant capital expenditure cost savings and highlights the advantages of using new Ethernet NTEs, which can be up to ten times cheaper than SDH technology, delivering equivalent bandwidth. Remote management and fault diagnosis features can also reduce operational expenditure by avoiding unnecessary site visits. A network architecture is presented which supports delivery of Ethernet services over a combination of circuit-switched and packet-switched domains. New standards which are maturing in the IETF, IEEE and ITU to support Ethernet delivery of interoperable services with carrier class reliability are also discussed. 1...|$|E
