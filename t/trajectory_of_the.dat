5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974. In the game, two players each control paddles {{on either side}} of a volleyball net, with a ball dropped {{from the top of the}} screen. The players bounce the ball back and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle. The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings.|$|E
5|$|The L191 (also {{formerly}} {{called the}} SS191) is a tracer cartridge designed for easier bullet spotting in dim light. Combustible chemicals packed {{in the rear}} of the L191 projectile create a light trail visible up to 200m (219yd). The L191 has been manufactured with red and red-on-black tips. The performance and <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> L191 is identical to the SS190. For this reason, it is also classified by the ATF as armor-piercing handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
5|$|Three {{mainstream}} narratives emerged {{after the}} shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire {{had killed the}} boy developed into the position that, because of the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shots, Palestinian gunfire {{was more likely to}} have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2's news editor, is that no one can know who fired the shots.|$|E

5|$|Two {{established}} meteor showers {{originate from}} within Corvus' boundaries. German astronomer Cuno Hoffmeister discovered and named the Corvids in 1937, after observing them between June 25 and July 2. They {{have not been}} seen since, nor was there evidence of a shower when previous records were examined. Hoffmeister noted the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shower {{was similar to that}} of the comet 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, though this was not confirmed by Zhukov and colleagues in 2011. The shower has been tentatively linked with 4015 Wilson–Harrington. In January 2013, the MO Video Meteor Network published the discovery of the Eta Corvids, assigning some 300 meteors seen between January 20 and 26. Their existence was confirmed by data analysis later that year.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E

25|$|The F-11 Tiger {{is noted}} {{for being the}} first jet {{aircraft}} to shoot itself down. On 21 September 1956, during a test-firing of its 20mm (.79in) cannons, pilot Tom Attridge fired two bursts midway through a shallow dive. As the velocity and <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cannon rounds decayed, they ultimately crossed paths with the Tiger as it continued its descent, disabling it and forcing Attridge to crash-land the aircraft; he survived.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{would then}} pull {{away at a}} sharp angle from the flare (and the terminal <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missile) and reduce engine power in attempt to cool the thermal signature. Optimally, the missile's seeker head is then confused by this change in temperature and flurry of new signatures, and therefore follows the flare(s) rather than the aircraft. The most modern IR-guided missiles have sophisticated on-board electronics that help discriminate between flares and targets, reducing the effectiveness of countermeasures.|$|E
25|$|Often {{in areas}} of physics and mathematics, a vector evolves in time, meaning that it depends on a time {{parameter}} t.

Vector-valued functions can be differentiated and integrated by differentiating or integrating {{the components of the}} vector, and many of the familiar rules from calculus continue to hold for the derivative and integral of vector-valued functions.|$|E
