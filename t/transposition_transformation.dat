In all the experiments, subjects were trained to discriminate between a previously unknown target and two non-target distractors presented at a fixed retinal location {{to one side of}} the fixation point. In a subsequent test phase, this performance was compared with the performance when the patterns were presented either centrally at the fixation point or at a location on the other side of the fixation point, opposite to the location where the patterns were learned, but where acuity was identical to what it was at the learned location. Two different experimental paradigms were used. One used an eye movement control device (Experiment 1) to ensure the eye could not move relative to the patterns to be learned. In the other three experiments, presentation duration of the patterns was restricted to a short enough period to preclude eye movements. During the training period in Experiments 1 and 2, presentation location of the patterns was centered at 2. 4 deg in the periphery, whereas in Experiments 3 and 4 presentation eccentricity was reduced to 0. 86 and 0. 49 deg. In all four experiments performance dropped when the pattern had to be recognized at new test positions. This result suggests that the visual system does not apply a global <b>transposition</b> <b>transformation</b> to the retinal image to compensate for translations. We propose that, instead, it decomposes the image into simple features which themselves are more-or-less translation invariant. If in a given task, patterns can be discriminated using these simple features, then translation invariance will occur. If not, then translation invariance will fail or be incomplete...|$|E

It seems that I am listening again more for moments, atmospheres, rather than formulas with their limbs, <b>transpositions,</b> <b>transformations.</b> Certainly both methods conjointly lead to good music. A special concentration and freedom must be trained for listening to the soul's vibrations. (Stockhausen 2006a, 10) ...|$|R
40|$|Zigzag {{persistent}} homology is {{a powerful}} generalisation of persistent homology that allows one not only to compute persistence diagrams with less noise and using less memory, but also to use persistence in new fields of application. However, due {{to the increase in}} complexity of the algebraic treatment of the theory, most algorithmic results in the field have remained of theoretical nature. This article describes an efficient algorithm to compute zigzag persistence, emphasising on its practical interest. The algorithm is a zigzag persistent cohomology algorithm, based on the dualisation of reflections and <b>transpositions</b> <b>transformations</b> within the zigzag sequence. We provide an extensive experimental study of the algorithm. We study the algorithm along two directions. First, we compare its performance with zigzag persistent homology algorithm and show the interest of cohomology in zigzag persistence. Second, we illustrate the interest of zigzag persistence in topological data analysis by comparing it to state of the art methods in the field, specifically optimised algorithm for standard persistent homology and sparse filtrations. We compare the memory and time complexities of the different algorithms, as well as the quality of the output persistence diagrams...|$|R

Each permutation contains a just chromatic scale, however, <b>transformations</b> (<b>transposition</b> and inversion) produce pitches {{outside of the}} primary row form, as already occurs in the inversion of P0. The pitches of each hexachord are drawn from different otonality or utonality on A+ utonality, C otonality and utonality, and E- otonality, outlining a diminished triad.|$|R
40|$|Different {{mechanisms}} by antibiotics selectively kill or inhibit growth and proliferation of pathogen bacteria. Some antibiotics work by interfering {{the process of}} protein synthesis in bacterial ribosome, the machinery that builds proteins amino acid by amino acid for the living bacterial cell. This type of antibiotics which inhibit the protein synthesis include streptomycin, chlor amphenicol and tetracycline which are described in this article. Antibiotic resistencic is a worldwide problem in treating infectious diseases. Multiple factors contribute to the problem, {{but the most important}} ones are the prevalence of resistance genes and the excessive or inappropriate antibiotic use. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics may develop from the natural state of the bacterial genome, or the bacteria can acquire resistance genes by mutation or exchange of genes. Bacteria are able to exchange genes by several mechanisms such as conjugation, transduction, <b>transposition</b> and <b>transformation,</b> in which genetic material caries such plasmids, bacteriophages or transposons play an important role. </p...|$|R

40|$|Griffith's {{experiments}} regarding {{bacterial transformation}} Pneumococcus {{are regarded as}} essential when related to DNA/heredity recognition process. The current study goal is to assess the didactic transposition {{of the concept of}} bacterial transformation since the Griffith¿s descriptions until its current approach on didactic books. We realized that historical context and the relationship between bacterial transformation and DNA recognition as genetic material are poorly explored. The core of our paper is the historical approach of those experiments. By considering the wide richness of knowledge that is ranged on Griffith´s experiments, we suggest a didactic <b>transposition</b> concerning bacterial <b>transformation</b> in the learning process, involving an integration of contents...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{battle between}} humans and the multitude of pathogenic microorganisms in the environment has sought relief {{in the form of}} antimicrobials. But the counter attack by pathogenic organisms in the form of multidrug resistance, acquired by various mechanisms such as <b>transformation,</b> <b>transposition,</b> conjugation and transduction is a major reason for concern. Bacteriophages have contributed in a significant way to dissemination of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, heavy metal resistance and virulence factors through the phenomenon of transduction. This review aims at compiling information about the different mechanisms by which bacteriophages aid in transferring genes involved in antimicrobial resistance to Escherischia coli in various environments. </p...|$|R
50|$|Coin effects include productions, vanishes, <b>transformations,</b> <b>transpositions,</b> teleportations, penetrations, restorations, levitations {{and mental}} magic—some are {{combined}} {{in a single}} routine. A simple effect might involve borrowing a coin, making it vanish, concealing the coin, then reproducing it again unexpectedly and returning it to the owner. More complex effects may involve multiple coins, substituting or switching coins and other objects or props can be employed (i.e. handkerchiefs, glasses) {{as well as the}} coins. However, the power of most coin magic lies in its simplicity and the solidity of the object; the basic skills of sleight of hand and misdirection often appear most magical without complex equipment. Almost any audience will be amazed by the simplest mystery, such as passing a coin through a table.|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} of ermA and ermC genes, {{the two most}} common resistance determinants of erythromycin resistance, was studied with Luria-Bertani broth {{in the absence of}} additional Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + ions. Fifteen human and five poultry isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, which were resistant to erythromycin but carried different genetic markers for erythromycin resistance, were used for conjugation. Since both the donors (Amps-Tetr) and recipients (Ampr-Tets) were resistant to erythromycin, the transconjugants were initially picked up as ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant colonies. The resistance transfer mechanisms of the chromosomally located erythromycin rRNA methylase gene ermA and the plasmid-borne ermC gene were monitored by a multiplex PCR and gene-specific internal probing assay. Four groups of transconjugants, based upon the {{transfer of}} the ermA and/or ermC gene, were distinguished from each other by the use of this method. Selective antibiotic screening revealed only one type of transconjugant that was resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline. A high frequency of transfer (4. 5 × 10 − 3) was observed in all of the 23 transconjugants obtained, and the direction of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance marker transfer was determined to be from poultry to clinical isolates. The transfers of the ermA and ermC genes were via <b>transposition</b> and <b>transformation,</b> respectively...|$|R
40|$|Insertion {{sequences}} (ISs) are mobile {{elements that}} are commonly found in bacterial genomes. Here, the structural and functional diversity of these mobile elements in the genome of the cyanobacterium Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501 is analyzed. The number, distribution, and diversity of nucleotide and amino acid stretches with similarity to the transposase gene of this IS family suggested that this genome harbors many functional as well as truncated IS fragments. The selection pressure acting on full-length transposase open reading frames of these ISs suggested (i) the occurrence of positive selection and (ii) the presence {{of one or more}} positively selected codons. These results were obtained using three data sets of transposase genes from the same IS family that were collected based on the level of amino acid similarity, the presence of an inverted repeat, and the number of sequences in the data sets. Neither recombination nor ribosomal frameshifting, which may interfere with the selection analyses, appeared to be important forces in the transposase gene family. Some positively selected codons were located in a conserved domain, suggesting that these residues are functionally important. The finding that this type of selection acts on IS-carried genes is intriguing, because although ISs have been associated with the adaptation of the bacterial host to new environments, this has typically been attributed to <b>transposition</b> or <b>transformation,</b> thus involving different genomic locations. Intragenic adaptation of IS-carried genes identified here may constitute a novel mechanism associated with bacterial diversification and adaptation. ...|$|R
40|$|The sterile insect {{technique}} (SIT) {{is concerned}} with the mass-rearing and release of sterilized insects which mate with "wild-type" females in the field, producing no viable offspring. The aim {{of this study was to}} use genetic engineering methods to make a strain of the Australia sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina which is suitable for an area-wide sterile-male release program. The main objectives were: development of an efficient germline transformation system for introducing a target gene into Lucilia and development of an inducible female killing system to produce a male only population. The piggyBac and Minos transposons were evaluated as transformation vectors for L. cuprina. Firstly, Drosophila melanogaster was used as a model system to determine if the frequency of both inter-plasmid <b>transposition</b> and germ-line <b>transformation</b> increases with the level of expression of the piggyBac transposase. Expression of the piggyBac transposase gene was controlled with either the α 1 -tubulin, hsp 83 or hsp 70 promoter, which have strong, intermediate and low constitutive activity respectively. The results show that the frequency of piggyBac-mediated germ-line transformation does increase with the level of expression of the transposase. In contrast, there does not appear to be a simple correlation between the level of expression the transposase and the frequency of transposition measured using an inter-plasmid transposition assay. This suggests that this widely used assay may not necessarily predict which is the best "helper" plasmid for germ-line <b>transformation.</b> Secondly, inter-plasmid <b>transposition</b> assays have shown that both piggyBac and Minos transposases are active in blowfly embryos. Thirdly, Drosophila eye color genes and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene were tested as potential markers for identifying transgenic flies. The most promising marker based on transient expression appears to be EGFP driven by the Drosophila polyubiquitin gene promoter (pUb-EGFP). Fourthly, blowfly embryos were coinjected with the piggyBac helper driven by the D. melanogaster hsp 70 promoter and the PUbnlsEGFP marker gene. Two transgenic L. cuprina lines were isolated and characterised by Southern DNA hybridisation analysis and inverse PCR. The transformation frequency was 1. 4 to 1. 9 %. Of the two transformant lines obtained, one had a single copy of the transgene and the other most likely has four copies. This is the first report of germ line transformation of L. cuprina. A tetracycline regulated inducible expression system was adopted to develop a controllable female-killing genetic system based on the D. melanogaster msl 2 gene. One component of the system is the tetracycline dependent transactivator (tTA) gene controlled by a constitutive promoter. The other (tetO-msl 2) is the msl 2 coding region controlled with a promoter bearing seven copies of the tetracycline operator (tetO) sequence. Female D. melanogaster carrying both a promoter-tTA and tetO-msl 2 gene constructs would be predicted to die in the absence of tetracycline due to expression of msl 2. In this study several promoter-tTA constructs were developed including WH-arm which uses the constitutive armadillo promoter. Drosophila carring both WH-arm and tetO-lacZ transgenes were shown by spectrophotometric and histochemical staining assays to express β-galactosidase but only if raised on media that lacked tetracycline. There was a significant decrease in viability of females carrying both WH-arm and tetO-msl 2 gene constructs raised on media lacking tetracycline. However lethality was not 100 %. Assembly of the MSL complex on female X chromosomes (due to expression of msl 2) was confirmed by immuno staining of polytene chromosomes with anti-MSL 3 antibody. Thus it appears that induction of 100 % female lethality will require higher levels of msl 2 expression than obtained with the WH-arm/tetO-msl 2 system for controlling female viability in transgenic Lucilia...|$|R
