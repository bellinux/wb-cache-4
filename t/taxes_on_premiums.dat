40|$|This paper uses an {{aggregate}} modelling approach {{to assess the}} impact of taxes in refined-petroleum products on the Philippine's economy. The approach used in the analysis consists of a general equilibrium model composed of 14 producing sectors, 14 consuming sectors, three household categories classified by income, and a government. The effects of removing the 48 % <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>premium</b> and regular gasoline and the 24 % <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> other refined petroleum products on prices and quantities are examined. The results are revealing. For example, the consequences of a complete elimination of refined petroleum product taxes would be an increase in output by all producing sectors of about 3 Â· 7 % or about 2 Â· 65 hundred billion (2 Â· 65 x 1011) Philippine pesos, a rise in the consumption of goods and services by about 13 Â· 6 % or 4 Â· 2 hundred billion (4 Â· 2 x 1011) Philippine pesos, a rise in total utility by 14 Â· 3 % or 4 Â· 5 hundred billion (4 Â· 5 x 1011) Philippine pesos and a lower tax revenue for the government of 62 Â· 4 % or 2 Â· 8 hundred billion (2 Â· 8 x 1011) Philippine pesos. When subjected to a sensitivity analysis, the results are reasonably robust with regard to the assumption of the values of the substitution elasticities. That is, while the model's equilibrium values do vary in response to different assumptions of the values of these elasticities, the fluctuations are not so large as to suggest that the model is unrealistically sensitive to these parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|Security markets between generations are {{incomplete}} in the laissez-faire economy since {{risk sharing}} agreements cannot {{be made with}} the unborn. But suppose that generations could trade if, for example, {{a representative of the}} unborn negotiated on their behalf today. What would the trades look like? Can government fiscal policy by used to replicate these trades? Would completing this missing market be pareto improving when the introduction of the new security changes the prices of existing assets? This paper characterizes analytically the hypothetical trades between generations. It shows how the government can replicate these trades by taxing the realized equity <b>premium</b> <b>on</b> investments by either a positive amount or a negative amount. When technology shocks are mostly driven by changes in depreciation, a positive <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the equity <b>premium</b> replicates the hypothetical trades; this tax is also driven by changes in productivity, the choice between a positive and negative tax rate is unclear. However, with log utility, Cobb-Douglas production, and a depreciation rate less than 100 percent, the equity premium is to be taxed at a negative rate; this tax is also pareto improving. Finally, simulation analysis is used to consider more complicated cases, including when depreciation and productivity are both uncertain. Under the baseline calibration for the U. S., a positive <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the equity <b>premium</b> is pareto improving. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper shows that, {{contrary}} to the suggestion of some investment advisors, for an individual Canadian investor subject to personal income taxation, the after-tax return on a discount bond is always higher (or, at worse, equal) to the return on an otherwise identical premium bond. This follows because the <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> capital gains {{is lower than the}} <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> coupon income in Canada. It is also shown that a decline in the capital gains tax rate raises the after-tax yield on discount bonds, but reduces the after-tax yield <b>on</b> <b>premium</b> bonds, and may even cause the yield <b>on</b> <b>premium</b> bonds to become negative. Further, a cut in the <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> interest income raises the after-tax yield on all bonds, but raises the yield <b>on</b> <b>premium</b> bonds relative to discount bonds. While the lower after-tax returns on higher coupon bonds might be expected to cause the pre-tax yields on these bonds to rise, no evidence of such tax capitalization is found using a large dataset of matched pairs of Government of Canada bonds for the period 1986 - 2006. The observed near equality of pre-tax yields since 1995 for otherwise equivalent bonds with different coupons implies that individuals in Canada earn a significantly smaller after-tax return from holding premium bonds than discount bonds. The empirical analysis suggests that the marginal investor in the bond market is an investor who pays the same rate of <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> capital gains and interest income, such as professional investors, financial institutions or pension funds, rather than an individual taxpayer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThrough {{the example}} of French flood-control policy, this paper {{illustrates}} the general change {{taking place in the}} relation of societies and governments to risk. Former policies based on structural measures to reduce the alea were found excessively expensive, but liberal approaches based on insurance mechanisms were not suited to face extreme events. Better solutions depend on the re-appraisal of water as a common property and the design of corresponding institutions. In France, these could have been the agences de l'eau, which are now in charge of implementing the Water Framework Directive. But back in 1966, central government refused to involve them in flood control, keeping the latter in its own realm. After 1983, successive Governments preferred to develop cat'nat’, a solidarity scheme based <b>on</b> <b>taxes</b> added <b>on</b> insurance <b>premiums,</b> and <b>on</b> local risk protection plans (PPR-i) constraining land use rights. This system's benefits and shortcomings are discussed, including the discrepancies between national post-disaster solidarity and local pre-disaster vulnerability reduction; it lastly shows recent evolutions towards catchment-based approaches in complex multi-level governance, in which the hydrographic district level, adopted to synthesise the flood risk management plans (FRMPs), is supplemented by catchment programmes on flood risks called PAPI.
