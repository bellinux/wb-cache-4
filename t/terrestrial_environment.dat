5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably incapable of functioning comfortably in a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment.</b> One consequence of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been incapable of building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water {{than it is in}} air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment.</b> Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Devonian period (360 {{million years}} ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as Ichthyostega, may have {{sometimes}} hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal. In the early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and calamites. Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment.</b> There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were {{at the top of the}} food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail. They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{transformation}} of a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment</b> into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals, the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reduced-flow rivers.

Actinostachys pennula is found near rotten tree stumps and litter that is decomposing in highly wet rain forests and baylands (wetlands that are continually reached by tides). It is a perennial plant. Normally found at an elevation of 0-500 feet. Best conditions are in wet, marshy areas with high temperatures and an abundance of sunlight.

25|$|The Danube Delta {{falls within}} the Pannonian steppe {{ecosystem}} of eastern Europe, with Mediterranean influences. As a young region in full process of consolidation, the Danube Delta represents a very favourable place {{for the development of}} highly diverse flora and fauna, unique in Europe, with numerous rare species. It hosts 23 natural ecosystems, but due to the extent of wetlands an aquatic environment is prevalent; a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment</b> is also present on the higher grounds of the continental levees, where xerophile ecosystems have developed. Between the aquatic and terrestrial environments is interposed a swampy, easily flooded strip of original flora and fauna, with means of adaptation to water or land, depending on the season or hydrological regime. At the contact between freshwater and sea water, some special physical, chemical and biological processes take place, which have led biologists to consider this area as a very different ecosystem called beforedelta. Musura Gulf, north of Sulina, and Saint George Gulf are considered the most representative of this type of ecosystem.|$|E
500|$|Although care of {{offspring}} {{is poorly}} understood in frogs, [...] {{up to an}} estimated 20% of amphibian species may care for their young in some way. The evolution of parental care in frogs is driven primarily {{by the size of}} the water body in which they breed. Those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour. Because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies, some frog species started to lay their eggs on land. Once this happened, the desiccating <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment</b> demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival. The subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} land plants {{evolved from}} aquatic plants around [...] (Ma) in the Ordovician period. Many plants {{have adapted to}} iodine-deficient <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment</b> by removing iodine from their metabolism, in fact iodine is essential only for animal cells. An important antiparasitic action {{is caused by the}} block of the transport of iodide of animal cells inhibiting sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Many plant pesticides are glycosides (as the cardiac digitoxin) and cyanogenic glycosides which liberate cyanide, which, blocking cytochrome c oxidase and NIS, is poisonous only for a large part of parasites and herbivores and not for the plant cells in which it seems useful in seed dormancy phase. Iodide is not pesticide, but is oxidized, by vegetable peroxidase, to iodine, which is a strong oxidant, it is able to kill bacteria, fungi and protozoa.|$|E
40|$|The {{solution}} speciation of a metal has {{a critical}} influence on its biological {{activity in the}} environment and is now an important focus of research. In this review, pertinent aspects related to the aqueous speciation and chemistry of cobalt (Co) in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environments</b> are critically assessed. Although {{there is a lack}} of comprehensive data on aqueous Co concentrations in soil porewaters, groundwaters and surface waters, existing reports indicate that natural Co concentrations vary within a picomolar to micromolar range. Cobalt chemistry is dominated by the Co(II) oxidation state in the aqueous phase of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environments</b> primarily due to the extremely low solubility of Co(III). There is no universal agreement on the importance of Co(II) complexation in the solution phase of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environments</b> and, furthermore, on the nature of the major binding organic ligands. The kinetics of Co(II) complexation to, and dissociation from, natural organic complexing ligands are such that the speciation of Co is likely to significantly diverge from estimates based on thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. As a result, an accurate understanding of Co bioavailability, toxicity and transport in <b>terrestrial</b> aquatic <b>environments</b> will only be achieved when thermodynamics can be reconciled with reaction kinetics. © 2010, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

500|$|The {{habitat of}} a species {{describes}} the environment over which a species is known to occur {{and the type of}} community that is formed as a result. More specifically, [...] "habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal." [...] For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment</b> that can be further categorized as a montane or alpine ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population {{of a species}} of tropical lizards (Tropidurus hispidus) has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians, and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. Biotope and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas the latter applies to a species' environment.|$|E
2500|$|Animals {{found in}} the {{formation}} include frogs (including Beelzebufo ampinga), turtles, snakes, lizards, at least seven species of crocodyliforms (including species of Mahajangasuchus and Trematochampsa), abelisaurid theropods Majungasaurus, noasaurid Masiakasaurus, two types of titanosaurian sauropods (Rapetosaurus and an unnamed second form), and at least five species of birds or very bird-like dinosaurs, including Rahonavis. The 6 to 7 meter long (20to 23ft) Majungasaurus was likely the apex predator in the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment.</b> [...] Crocodyliforms were very diverse and abundant.|$|E
2500|$|Living in a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>environment,</b> {{woodlice}} breathe through trachea-like lungs {{in their}} paddle-shaped hind legs (pleopods), called pleopodal lungs.

2500|$|Allochthonous {{energy sources}} are those derived {{from outside the}} lotic system, that is, from the <b>{{terrestrial}}</b> <b>environment.</b> [...] Leaves, twigs, fruits, etc. are typical forms of terrestrial CPOM that have entered the water by direct litterfall or lateral leaf blow. [...] In addition, terrestrial animal-derived materials, such as feces or carcasses that {{have been added to}} the system are examples of allochthonous CPOM. [...] The CPOM undergoes a specific process of degradation. [...] Allan gives the example of a leaf fallen into a stream. [...] First, the soluble chemicals are dissolved and leached from the leaf upon its saturation with water. [...] This adds to the DOM load in the system. [...] Next, microbes such as bacteria and fungi colonize the leaf, softening it as the mycelium of the fungus grows into it. [...] The composition of the microbial community is influenced by the species of tree from which the leaves are shed (Rubbo and Kiesecker 2004). [...] This combination of bacteria, fungi, and leaf are a food source for shredding invertebrates, [...] which leave only FPOM after consumption. [...] These fine particles may be colonized by microbes again or serve as a food source for animals that consume FPOM. [...] Organic matter can also enter the lotic system already in the FPOM stage by wind, surface runoff, bank erosion, or groundwater. [...] Similarly, DOM can be introduced through canopy drip from rain or from surface flows.|$|E
