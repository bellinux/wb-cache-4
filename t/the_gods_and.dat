As such, she is regarded the offspring of <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> demons, created when they churned the cosmic milk ocean and then given to the Saptarishi, the seven great seers. She was ordered by the creator-god Brahma to give milk, and supply it and ghee ("clarified butter") for ritual fire-sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|Krimibhojana/Krimibhaksha (worm-food): As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, it {{is where}} a person who does not share his food with guests, elders, {{children}} or <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> <b>and</b> selfishly eats it alone, and he who eats without performing the five yajnas (panchayajna) is chastised. The Vishnu Purana states that one who loathes his father, Brahmins or <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> who destroys jewels is punished here. This hell is a 100,000 yojana lake filled with worms. The sinful person is reduced to a worm, who feeds on other worms, who in turn devour his body for 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Egyptian {{beliefs about the}} gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, {{most of whom were}} illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> their nature.|$|E

5|$|The {{final step}} in the {{formation}} of Egyptian religion was the unification of Egypt, in which rulers from Upper Egypt made themselves pharaohs of the entire country.

5|$|As {{part of the}} Mycenaean {{heritage}} that survived, {{the names}} of <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> goddesses of Mycenaean Greece became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity.

5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt {{made it impossible for}} him to do so in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> <b>and</b> the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor's {{version of the same}} or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E

50|$|Cochranianism {{revolved}} around the veneration of <b>the</b> Horned <b>God</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mother Goddess, alongside seven deities which are viewed as children of <b>the</b> <b>God</b> <b>and</b> Goddess.

5|$|The French Revolution (17891799) brought {{sweeping}} changes to theatre in France. Banished were the ballets the aristocracy preferred about <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> goddesses of Mount Olympus. Instead, ballets about everyday people, real places, real time, the historical past, {{and the supernatural}} took prominence. These sorts of ballets were preferred by the burgeoning middle class.|$|E
5|$|The ba of a god {{was said}} to {{periodically}} leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god. By inhabiting these images, the gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form. To the Egyptians, a place or object that was ḏsr—"sacred"—was isolated and ritually pure, and thus fit for a god to inhabit. Temple statues and reliefs, as well as particular sacred animals, like the Apis bull, served as divine intermediaries in this way. Dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction. In these states, it was believed, people could come close to <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> sometimes receive messages from them. Finally, according to Egyptian afterlife beliefs, human souls pass into the divine realm after death. The Egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist {{on the same level}} as <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> <b>and</b> fully understand their mysterious nature.|$|E
