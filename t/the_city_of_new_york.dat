5|$|A final {{obstacle}} for the Port Authority {{was getting}} approval from New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the New York City Council, who {{raised concerns about}} the limited extent that the Port Authority involved {{the city in the}} negotiations and deliberations. Negotiations between <b>The</b> <b>City</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and the Port Authority were centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made on August 3, 1966, that the Port Authority would make annual payments to the City, in lieu of taxes, for the portion of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants. In subsequent years, the payments would rise as the real estate tax rate increased.|$|E
5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
