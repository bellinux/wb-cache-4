5|$|While {{making a}} {{delivery}} in the Historic District, Cole is instructed {{to open the}} package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling several city blocks and nearly killing him. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after {{he is accused of}} triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the sealed bridge, only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, who persuades him to return and find John. With her help, Cole restores the district's power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but she is abducted by the Sons before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists what remains of the police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke's incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. Giving in to his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, NBC {{commissioned}} Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti {{to compose}} the first opera ever written for television; Menotti {{came up with}} Amahl and the Night Visitors, a 45-minute work for which he wrote both music and libretto, about a disabled shepherd boy who meets the Three Wise Men and is miraculously cured when he offers his crutch to the newborn Christ Child. It was such a stunning success that it was repeated every year on NBC from 1951 to 1966, when a dispute between Menotti and NBC ended the broadcasts. However, by 1978, Menotti and NBC had patched <b>things</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> an all-new production of the opera, filmed partly on location in the Middle East, was telecast that year.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1998–99 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout {{delayed the}} start of the season, which was {{shortened}} to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28–22 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic, three games to one, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49–33, fifth in the East. Again, the Sixers won their first round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. Though the team was moving in a positive direction, Iverson and Brown continued to clash, and their relationship deteriorated {{to the point where it}} seemed certain Iverson would be traded. A rumored trade to the Los Angeles Clippers fell through, but a complicated four-team deal that would've seen Iverson sent to Detroit was agreed upon, only to see it dissolve due to salary cap problems. When it became clear Iverson was staying in Philadelphia, he and Brown worked to patch <b>things</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> the team would reap the benefits in 2000–01.|$|E

500|$|With Poquita Ropa, Arjona {{wanted to}} {{drastically}} change his musical style.

Arjona talking about the album, stated that [...] "music and women look better with little clothes", and that [...] "they [...] are like women; they get <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty.

500|$|When {{industrial}} metal {{climbed the}} charts {{of the late}} 1990s, its sudden popularity was met with negative reactions from the early innovators of industrial music. Peter Christopherson told The Wire {{that he no longer}} felt any kinship with the industrial scene: [...] "this is not me, this is not what I'm about". Lustmord, a prominent early industrial musician, declared that [...] "Ministry just doesn't interest [...] " [...] and [...] " [...] no time for all this rock and roll shit they're doing now."

500|$|Murray {{was cast}} in August 2014. He noted that, unlike his {{character}} on One Tree Hill, Thompson does not serve as the [...] "moral compass" [...] of the series, which meant {{that he would not}} be [...] "confined to a box" [...] and would instead be allowed to [...] "really play <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> do what's unexpected." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Thompson wears single breasted suits with suspenders. The second season ends on a cliffhanger, with Thompson being shot by an unknown character. The executive producers insisted that Thompson was not necessarily dead, and that his fate would be revealed in a potential third season.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Arjona {{wanted to}} change his musical style; after experimenting with using as few {{instruments}} as possible, he obtained a sound similar to an a capella performance (simplifying his sound) and introduced {{what he called a}} [...] "stripped-down acoustic effort" [...] to his music. This was heard on his twelfth studio album, Poquita Ropa. Arjona produced the album with Dan Warner, who has worked with Shakira, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera. When promoting the album Arjona said, [...] " [...] are like women; they get <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty. The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves, because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them". Poquita Ropa became the first album since Adentro which Arjona recorded without Torres.|$|E

500|$|In April 2016, {{on moving}} the {{universe}} to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, [...] "I {{think there will be}} a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a [...] different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." [...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure is really going to start to be repetitious if we do this again, so what do we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films." [...] A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, [...] "it might be a new thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Jo {{has been}} generally positive. Diana Steenbergen of IGN favored Jo from the beginning, deeming her [...] "tough and direct, and also female, something the boys don't {{have a lot}} of in their lives right now". She also believed that Jo and Dean had a [...] "natural chemistry" [...] between them, which continues even with her reappearance in the fifth season. However, Steenbergen was confused by Jo's anger at Sam and Dean over John Winchester's involvement in her father's death, feeling that the show's producers may have added it to the story as an excuse for Jo's removal from the series. While Tina Charles of TV Guide was at first unsure about the character, she wrote that by the episode [...] "No Exit", [...] "Tal did step <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> kinda won me over". She believed that while Jo did not make a good love interest for Dean, she was good in a [...] "sisterly or friendly fellow-ghostbuster way", deeming her as [...] "someone they can count on in a pinch". Overall, Charles felt that Jo [...] "fit into that world, whether she was a little overzealous or not".|$|E
500|$|In her 2007 book, It's Not My Fault They Print Them, Catherine Deveny slates Paul and Dennis' acting ability stating: [...] "Stefan Dennis as the mustache-twirling panto villain Paul Robinson, is a genius. I {{just wanted}} to yell out 'He's behind you, he's behind you!' It takes sheer {{brilliance}} {{to be able to}} act that badly". Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, describes Paul as being very similar to fictional character J. R. Ewing. Paul is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching Neighbours, with scenes featuring Paul and Gail receiving disapproval from Harold, Amanda opines that she believes the couple are in love. Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail commented on Paul's obsession with Rebecca stating: [...] "You can't help feeling that nothing short of a stake through the heart is going to keep Paul out of Rebecca's life." [...] Stephen later said [...] "Taking advice from Paul is like asking Charlie Sheen to be your spirit guide." [...] Paul Kalina of The Age said Dennis as Paul lightens <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> he prances about like [...] "a pantomime villain minus the moustache and cape." [...] Kalina added [...] "Erinsborough just would not be the same without him." [...] A TVTimes columnist stated [...] "He's no Brad Pitt and he's a devious beggar at the best of times, but Paul Robinson doesn't half get the ladies." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Book Job" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays to shake <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{song and}} third single [...] "Break the Ice" [...] opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's {{been a while}} / I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting / But I'm here now". The song {{features}} a choir and Keri Hilson singing background vocals sounding almost like a duet. Hilson explained the song is about [...] "two people, a girl and a guy, [...] and the girl is saying, 'You're a little cold. Let me warm <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> [...]'" [...] After the chorus, the bridge begins with Spears saying [...] "I like this part" [...] mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The album's fifth track, [...] "Heaven on Earth", is a Euro disco love song with new wave influences. It is inspired by Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] (1977), with three vocal lines taking place over the beat. Nicole Morier commented that the song was written from a very dark place, saying, [...] "I was thinking of someone and thinking they were so perfect and that I have all these imperfections. [...] I think what's touching {{about it is that}} it's from the perspective of someone who feels like they really need this person just to feel safe and feel good." [...] Spears named the song her favorite from Blackout. The sixth track, [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] is an uptempo R song about sex. It is a duet between Spears and Danja, who sings the chorus with his voice distorted to sound like a decaying moan. Spears contributes a series of gasps, sighs and chants and her voice is also distorted.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Black {{joined the}} cast {{full-time}} in season 10. Had Stargate SG-1 not {{been picked up}} for a new season, the producers would have considered the character for a spin-off series. To justify the character in a regular capacity, the producers toned her down and {{tried to find a}} suitable balance of sexual tension, fun and friendship. Claudia Black was convinced that Vala's actual stay with Stargate Command was justified despite the character's personality. Vala's renegade qualification to infiltrate the Ori served as a useful complement to the military-oriented SG teams, and Vala had already proven a degree of allegiance through her actions in [...] "Beachhead", holding off an immediate invasion of the enemy. The writers tested this loyalty through confrontation in the story, and writer Damian Kindler later compared Vala's character growth in season 10 to smuggler Lando Calrissian from Star Wars, a [...] "former swindler who's gone legit". Careful to never have Vala become too earnest, Kindler never saw Vala [...] "as the type of character who should be on the show for five, six, seven years. But definitely the sort of character who could come in for a couple of seasons, spice <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> then move on and come back and forth." [...] Evolving the relationship between Vala and the other SG-1 members, the producers also grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them [...] "end up in a motel room bed together" [...] in the episode [...] "Memento Mori", involving underwear, [...] "handcuffs as well as creamy Twinkies". A scene in the milestone episode [...] "200" [...] also parodied the show's connection to Farscape. In hindsight, Claudia Black would see season 10 as a personal challenge as her baby deprived her of sleep during the filming period. Her relocation to Vancouver and sickness in the family put her on a self-confessed personal and professional low. She nevertheless tried to stay true to her character [...] "and not go for the cheap laugh".|$|E
