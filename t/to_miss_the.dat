5|$|Hašek's injury {{caused him}} <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} regular season and post-season, despite several rumours that he would return in time for the playoffs. He said that if he were to be re-signed, he would play for a base salary of $500,000 with bonuses.|$|E

5|$|After the disappointments of the Bodyline series, Ponsford {{returned}} to domestic cricket in 1933–34, scoring 606 runs {{at an average}} of 50.50. At the end of the domestic season, he was selected for his third tour of England with the Australian team in 1934. Illness again interrupted Ponsford's English summer, causing him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> second Test at Lord's. In the final two Tests of the series, the two record breakers—Ponsford and Bradman—combined in two remarkable partnerships.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} {{neck surgery}} that forced him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> entire 2011 season, Manning {{was released by}} the Colts and signed with the Denver Broncos. Serving as the team's starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015, he contributed to the Broncos reaching {{the top of their}} division each year and his playing career concluded with a victory in Super Bowl 50.|$|E
5|$|Barea {{began the}} season with 21 points and 5 assists against the Sacramento Kings on November 2, 2012. However, in his fourth game, he sprained his left foot, which caused him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> next five games. During December, Barea {{averaged}} more than 25 minutes and 12.7 points per game coming off the bench. He had his best {{game of the season}} on April 12, when he scored 23 points against the Utah Jazz and finished {{the season with}} averages of 11.3 points, 4.0 assists and 2.8 rebounds in 23.1 minutes per game.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) cemeteries and memorials around the wood, including the Hyde Park Corner (Royal Berks) CWGC Cemetery and the Berks CWGG Cemetery Extension with the Ploegsteert Memorial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Missing.</b> <b>The</b> Ploegsteert Memorial commemorates more than 11,000 British and Empire servicemen who {{died during the}} First World War and have no known grave.

5|$|Beginning {{the tour}} with a duck, Kippax {{recovered}} with 89 at Leicester before contracting a {{heavy dose of}} influenza that forced him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> next four matches. On his return, he struggled for form, and was not chosen for the first Test. Kippax was the third selector on tour, and was out-voted by his fellow selectors, so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team. Australia won the game and Kippax failed in the next two tour matches, so he missed out on the next Test at Lord's, which was lost.|$|E
5|$|Craig's {{career was}} {{interrupted}} by final year university studies for a diploma of pharmacy at the University of Sydney and national service, causing him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> entire 1954–55 season, including the home Test series against England, the early 1955 tour to the West Indies and the Sheffield Shield season. He returned to first-class cricket during the 1955–56 Australian season, and a healthy aggregate of 495runs at 45.09 with onecentury. During the season, {{he made his first}} century in the Sheffield Shield, amassing 145 against Queensland. For these performances, he was selected for the 1956 Ashes tour, the last player to be picked.|$|E
5|$|Crosby also {{sustained}} a high ankle sprain on January 18 against the Tampa Bay Lightning and was ruled out for {{six to eight}} weeks. Crosby returned on March 4, playing in three games before being removed from the lineup again on March 12. After missing the next seven games, Crosby returned against the New York Islanders on March 27, after missing 28 games. The injury forced Crosby <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> All-Star Game, {{where he was the}} leading vote-getter {{for the second year in}} a row. Teammate Evgeni Malkin was selected to play for the Eastern Conference team in place of the injured Crosby.|$|E

50|$|The {{memorial}} {{was built}} on land given by Adrien Fizeau, former mayor of Jouarre, in memory of his father Hippolyte Fizeau (1819-1896), a member of both the Institut de France and of the Royal Society. The Fizeau connection is commemorated by bilingual inscriptions {{either side of the}} steps leading up to the river-facing side of the memorial. This memorial was one of only four free-standing (outside proposed permanent war cemeteries) British World War I memorials <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> eventually built on French soil. There had originally been proposals by the Imperial War Graves Commission to build 13 free-standing memorials <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> in France, but this was eventually reduced to four: the Thiepval Memorial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Missing</b> of <b>the</b> Somme, the Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Missing</b> of <b>the</b> Army of India, the Soissons Memorial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Missing</b> that fell in the German offensives in 1918, and this memorial at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Missing</b> of <b>the</b> Marne. This memorial {{was the only one of}} the four where the design was opened to competition. The winning design was by the minor war cemetery architect Major George Hartley Goldsmith MC, who had studied under Sir Edwin Lutyens.|$|R
5|$|During Johansen's {{first full}} {{season with the}} Predators, he {{recorded}} 61 points in 82 games. During the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs, Johansen suffered an acute compartment syndrome in his left thigh in the Western Conference Finals against the Anaheim Ducks. Emergency surgery was required, and Johansen was forced <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the post-season. The Predators reached the Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins, falling in six games to the defending champions.|$|E
5|$|Fowler's {{performance}} in the 1997–98 football season was marred by an anterior cruciate (knee) ligament injury that {{kept him out of}} action for half the season and caused him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> 1998 World Cup. During this period of injury, fellow Liverpool striker, Michael Owen rose to prominence, making his debut in 1997. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler's absence.|$|E
5|$|Hill has {{experienced}} only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after forgetting {{to tie a}} safety rope, she fell 85ft (25m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing {{for a few months}} to recover; she was devastated <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs missed more cricket with {{injuries}} and illnesses in 1929; between 1926 and 1930, he missed {{more than a}} third of Surrey's matches. However, he scored heavily and compiled 2,263 runs at an average of 66.55 to lead the first-class averages. Unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa, he chose <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> next two, and played in the final game, scoring 10 and 52. Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs' scoring throughout the season, and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Tiki Barber {{emerged as}} a solid pass–{{catching}} running back, catching 66 passes. Wide receiver Amani Toomer also had a breakout season, accumulating over 1,100 yards receiving and six touchdowns, and Ike Hilliard finished just shy of 1,000 yards receiving. The defense rebounded, ranking 11th in the league, and Armstead and Strahan again were selected to the Pro Bowl. Though the Giants stood at 7–6 and poised for a playoff berth, they lost their final three games <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, during Atlético's pre-season, Costa {{suffered}} a serious knee injury, going on <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>the</b> {{majority of the}} season.
