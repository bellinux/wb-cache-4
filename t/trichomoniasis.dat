5|$|Risk of {{transmission}} {{increases in the}} presence of many sexually transmitted infections and genital ulcers. Genital ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold. Other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> and bacterial vaginosis, are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk {{of transmission}}.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trichomoniasis</b> is {{a common}} STI that is caused by {{infection}} with a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. <b>Trichomoniasis</b> affects both women and men, but symptoms are more common in women. Most patients are treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, which is very effective.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trichomoniasis,</b> an {{infection}} caused by Trichomonas vaginalis.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main ways {{to test for}} <b>Trichomoniasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Trichomoniasis</b> is {{associated}} with increased risk of transmission and infection of HIV.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trichomoniasis</b> {{may cause}} {{a woman to}} deliver a low-birth-weight or {{premature}} infant.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} new, highly {{specific}} and sensitive <b>trichomoniasis</b> tests present opportunities for new screening protocols {{for both men}} and women. Careful planning, discussion, and research are required to determine the cost-efficiency and most beneficial use of these new tests for the diagnosis and treatment of <b>trichomoniasis</b> in the U.S., which can lead to better prevention efforts.|$|E
25|$|Use of male condoms {{or female}} condoms {{may help prevent}} the spread of <b>trichomoniasis,</b> {{although}} careful studies have never been done that focus on how to prevent this infection. Infection with <b>Trichomoniasis</b> through water is unlikely because Trichomonas vaginalis dies in water after 45–60 minutes, in thermal water after 30 minutes to 3 hours and in d urine after 5–6 hours.|$|E
25|$|Some {{diseases}} transmissible by {{the sexual}} route include HIV/AIDS, chlamydia, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, syphilis, herpes, and <b>trichomoniasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Trichomoniasis</b> (trich) is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. About 70% {{of women and men}} do not have symptoms when infected. When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex. Having <b>trichomoniasis</b> increases the risk of getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of <b>trichomoniasis</b> {{revolves}} around avoiding other people's wet towels and hot tubs, and safe-sex procedures, such as condom use.|$|E
25|$|A {{study at}} the {{hospital}} showed high rates of sexually transmitted diseases among pregnant women including Candidosis (28.76%), Vaginal <b>Trichomoniasis</b> (13.88%), Chlamydia trachomatis (3.37%), HIV (2.38%), Syphilis (0.99%) and Gonococcus (0.40%).|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{estimates}} that 88 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year, {{out of the}} 448 million new cases of all curable STI each year – that also includes syphilis, chlamydia and <b>trichomoniasis.</b> In 2013, it caused about 3,200 deaths, up from 2,300 in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Endocervical and endometrial {{abnormalities}} {{can also}} be detected, as can a number of infectious processes, including yeast, herpes simplex virus and <b>trichomoniasis.</b> However it is not very sensitive at detecting these infections, so absence of detection on a Pap does not mean absence of the infection.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, a {{metallic}} taste, loss of appetite, and headaches. Occasionally seizures or allergies to the medication may occur. Some state that metronidazole {{should not be}} used in early pregnancy while others state doses for <b>trichomoniasis</b> are okay. It {{should not be used}} when breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there are}} no routine {{standard}} screening requirements for the general U.S. population receiving family planning or STI testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends <b>Trichomoniasis</b> testing for females with vaginal discharge and {{can be considered for}} females at higher risk for infection or of HIV-positive serostatus.|$|E
25|$|There {{were about}} 122 million {{new cases of}} <b>trichomoniasis</b> in 2015. In the United States there are about 2 million women affected. It occurs more often in women than men. Trichomonas vaginalis was first {{identified}} in 1836 by Alfred Donné. It was first recognized as causing this disease in 1916.|$|E
25|$|Methods of {{prevention}} include not having sex, using condoms, not douching, and being tested for STIs before {{having sex with}} a new partner. <b>Trichomoniasis</b> can be cured with antibiotics, either metronidazole or tinidazole. Sexual partners should also be treated. About 20% of people get infected again within three months of treatment.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, it was {{estimated}} that 500 million people were infected with either syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or <b>trichomoniasis.</b> At least an additional 530 million people have genital herpes and 290 million women have human papillomavirus. STIs other than HIV resulted in 142,000 deaths in 2013. In the United States there were 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010.|$|E
25|$|There {{were about}} 58 million cases of <b>trichomoniasis</b> in 2013. It {{is more common}} in women (2.7%) than males (1.4%). It is the most common non-viral STI in the U.S., with an {{estimated}} 3.7 million prevalent cases and 1.1 million new cases per year. It is estimated that 3% of the general U.S. population is infected, and 7.5-32% of moderate-to-high risk (including incarcerated) populations.|$|E
25|$|It {{is usually}} due to infection. The three main kinds of {{vaginitis}} are bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal candidiasis, and <b>trichomoniasis.</b> A woman {{may have a}} combination of vaginal infections at one time. Testing for vaginal infections is {{not a part of}} routine pelvic exams. If there is discomfort in the vulvovaginal area, women can request their health care providers evaluate for the presence of an infection.|$|E
25|$|After HPV, <b>trichomoniasis</b> and {{chlamydia}} are {{the most}} common STI diagnoses among 15- to 24-year-olds; combined, they account for slightly more than one third of diagnoses each year. Genital herpes and gonorrhea together account for about 12% of diagnoses. HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B account for less than 1% of diagnoses, however young people aged 13–24 accounted for about 21% of all new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Gonorrhea affects about 0.8% {{of women}} and 0.6% of men. An {{estimated}} 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI – which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and <b>trichomoniasis.</b> Infections in women most commonly occur when they are young adults. In 2015, it caused about 700 deaths. Descriptions of the disease date {{as far back as}} the Old Testament.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole (MNZ), marketed {{under the}} brand name Flagyl among others, is an {{antibiotic}} and antiprotozoal medication. It is used either alone or with other antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and bacterial vaginosis. It is effective for dracunculiasis, giardiasis, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> and amebiasis. It is the drug of choice for a first episode of mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile colitis. Metronidazole is available by mouth, as a cream, and intravenously.|$|E
25|$|For 95-97% of cases, {{infection}} is resolved after one dose of metronidazole. Studies suggest that 4-5% of trichomonas cases {{are resistant to}} metronidazole, which may account for some “repeat” cases. Without treatment, <b>trichomoniasis</b> can persist for months to years in women, and is thought to improve without treatment in men. Women living with HIV infection have better cure rates if treated for 7 days rather than with one dose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trichomoniasis</b> is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection (STI) which is most often spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also spread through genital touching. People who are infected may spread the disease even when symptoms are not present. Diagnosis is by finding the parasite in the vaginal fluid using a microscope, culturing the vagina or urine, or testing for the parasite's DNA. If present other {{sexually transmitted infection}}s should be tested for.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole is {{primarily}} used to treat: bacterial vaginosis, {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (along with other antibacterials like ceftriaxone), pseudomembranous colitis, aspiration pneumonia, rosacea (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, lung abscess, periodontitis, amoebiasis, oral infections, giardiasis, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella species. It is also often used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery.|$|E
25|$|More than 30 {{different}} bacteria, viruses, and parasites {{can cause}} STIs. Bacterial STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis among others. Viral STIs include genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, and genital warts among others. Parasitic STIs include <b>trichomoniasis</b> among others. While usually spread by sex, some STIs {{can also be}} spread by non-sexual contact with contaminated blood and tissues, breastfeeding, or during childbirth. STI diagnostic tests are easily available in the developed world, but this is often {{not the case in}} the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from a {{randomized}} controlled trials for screening pregnant {{women who do}} not have symptoms for infection with <b>trichomoniasis</b> and treating women who test positive for the infection have not consistently shown a reduced risk of preterm birth. Further studies are needed to verify this result and determine the best method of screening. In the US, screening of pregnant women without any symptoms is only recommended in those with HIV as trichomonas infection is associated with increased risk of transmitting HIV to the fetus.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} infections, {{diseases}} and disorders {{that can affect}} the vagina, including candidal vulvovaginitis, vaginitis, vaginismus, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or cancer. Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina, and is attributed to several vaginal diseases, while vaginismus is an involuntary tightening of the vagina muscles caused by a conditioned reflex, or disease, during vaginal penetration. HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus (HPV), genital herpes and <b>trichomoniasis</b> {{are some of the}} STIs that may affect the vagina, and health sources recommend safe sex (or barrier method) practices to prevent the transmission of these and other STIs.|$|E
25|$|The healthy vagina of a {{woman of}} child-bearing age is acidic, with a pH {{normally}} ranging between 3.8 and 4.5.; {{this is due to}} the degradation of glycogen to the lactic acid by enzymes secreted by the Döderlein's bacillus, which is a normal commensal of the vagina. The acidity delays or slows the growth of many strains of pathogenic microbes. An increased pH of the vagina (with a commonly used cut-off of pH 4.5 or higher) can be caused by bacterial overgrowth, as occurs in bacterial vaginosis and <b>trichomoniasis,</b> or rupture of membranes in pregnancy. There are different types of bacterial vaginosis.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} way of preventing STIs is by not having sex. Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV. Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having {{a smaller number of}} sexual partners, and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk. Circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections. Most STIs are treatable or curable. Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, <b>trichomoniasis</b> are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable. Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, about 1.1 {{billion people}} had STIs other than HIV/AIDS. About 500 million were {{infected}} with either syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or <b>trichomoniasis.</b> At least an additional 530 {{million people have}} genital herpes and 290 million women have human papillomavirus. STIs other than HIV resulted in 108,000 deaths in 2015. In the United States there were 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010. Historical documentation of STIs date back to at least the Ebers papyrus around 1550 BC and the Old Testament. There is often shame and stigma associated with these infections. The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease, as it includes {{those who do not}} have symptomatic disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} introduce the birds into Mexico in 2008, however due to import restrictions and permits, the plan was delayed. A stock of viable individuals was kept in the U.S., until finally they were transferred to Mexico in 2013. In 2005 plans were outlined to assess the level of soil erosion on Socorro {{as a result of}} vegetation loss. The Mexican Navy claimed to have reduced the sheep population on the island to around 300 with further plans to eradicate all of the sheep on the island between 2008 and 2009. This was accomplished in 2010. Avian Malaria and <b>trichomoniasis</b> were detected during screens other dove populations on neighboring islands in December 2003 and January 2004. As a result, recommendations for protection of the reintroduction population were put forward. In 2008 the Edinburgh and Paignton Zoos sent 12 chicks from their breeding program to the Albuquerque Zoo as part of the collective aggregation effort. In 2006, there was an outbreak of avian influenza in Europe, and therefore 12 doves were sent to Albuquerque Biological Park to create a separate reserve population. Construction of aviaries on Socorro Island began in 2003 and ended in 2005.|$|E
500|$|The samaras {{are also}} used in modern Chinese {{medicine}} under the name feng yan cao (...) , meaning [...] "herbal phoenix eye". They are used as a hemostatic agent, spermatorrhea and for treating patients with blood in their feces or urine. It was clinically shown {{to be able to}} treat <b>trichomoniasis,</b> a vaginal infection caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. In the West, an extract of the bark sold under the synonym A. glandulosa is sometimes used as an herbal remedy for various ailments including cancer.|$|E
