5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens the interval in which <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> length. After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E
