5|$|FreeBSD {{has several}} unique {{features}} related to storage. Soft updates can protect <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UFS filesystem (widely {{used on the}} BSDs) {{in the event of}} a system crash. Filesystem snapshots allow an image of a UFS filesystem at an instant in time to be efficiently created. Snapshots allow reliable backup of a live filesystem. GEOM is a modular framework that provides RAID (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), full disk encryption, journaling, concatenation, caching, and access to network-backed storage. GEOM allows building of complex storage solutions combining ("chaining") these mechanisms.|$|E

This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also causes a change in <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, Abhay Ashtekar reformulated Einstein's general {{relativity}} {{in a language}} closer {{to that of the}} rest of fundamental physics. Shortly after, Ted Jacobson and Lee Smolin realized that the formal equation of quantum gravity, called the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, admitted solutions labelled by loops when rewritten in the new Ashtekar variables. Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin defined a nonperturbative and background-independent quantum theory of gravity in terms of these loop solutions. Jorge Pullin and Jerzy Lewandowski understood that the intersections of the loops are essential for <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory, and the theory should be formulated in terms of intersecting loops, or graphs.|$|E

25|$|Female Galápagos green turtles {{most often}} only lay eggs every 2–3 years {{and spend the}} time between resting and foraging. Fertilization occurs under water with only females {{emerging}} for nesting. Mating has not been witnessed outside of the nesting season and usually occurs off shore near the nesting sites. Nesting space can be somewhat limited due to <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beaches in the Galápagos, being of volcanic origin. Many rocky areas and cliffs are present, with limited space on sandy beaches. Also, the sandy areas tend to be quite dry, and this causes many cave-ins of the nests. Females in the Galápagos have modified their nesting habits due to this factor and usually keep one hind flipper in the nest while depositing the eggs to prevent the unwanted cave-in. Clutch size varies from 50 to 200 eggs per nest and {{can take up to}} three hours to accomplish. However, Galápagos green turtles are known to have smaller clutch sizes than other populations. After the eggs are laid, the female covers them with sand and presses down with her plastron for compaction. They have also been noted to make a false nest next to their primary nest to try to fool predators. When leaving, the female turtle attempts to cover any trace of her presence by flinging sand around in the nest area.|$|E
