40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. April 2009. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Ramesh Harjani. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 129 pages. Ill., (some col.) One {{of the primary}} challenges in high-speed chip-to-chip serial link design is maintaining signal integrity {{in the presence of}} inter-symbol interference and crosstalk. Far-end crosstalk (FEXT), the interference from an adjacent aggressor line, has become a major noise source as data rates continue to increase. In addition to reducing the effective signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SNIR), FEXT introduces deterministic crosstalk-induced jitter (CIJ) in the received signal, thereby degrading the receiver's bit error rate (BER). By mitigating FEXT, inter-chip I/Os can have higher aggregate data throughput and interconnects can be placed closer together, which reduces the board area needed and the cost associated with it. In this thesis, two different techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effect of FEXT. The first technique employs FIR filters to implement FEXT cancellation (XTC) at the <b>transmit</b> <b>end,</b> which removes FEXT on each channel to further improve the SNIR of the received data and reduce the CIJ. The second technique staggers the multilane I/Os by adding a variable delay to every other channel at the <b>transmit</b> <b>end,</b> thus shifting the coupled FEXT away from the zero-crossing points of the victim channel. Although I/O staggering can lower CIJ and increase timing margin with relatively little added power, it comes at a cost of decreasing the existing voltage margin. The proposed techniques provide the required groundwork for developing MIMO communication methods that will effectively extricate additional information from FEXT to further reduce the BER during data detection. New I/O transceiver designs with the two techniques have been implemented and fabricated in CMOS processes. In addition, an accurate FEXT model has been developed using a two-pole moment matching technique. As data rates approach higher speeds and FEXT becomes a dominant noise source, the research presented has shown that FEXT mitigation is critical to enhance jitter performance and improve eye openings in high-speed serial links...|$|E

For a given MIMO channel matrix, the optimality of beamforming with the dominant right-singular vector (RSV) at the <b>transmit</b> <b>end</b> and with the matched filter to the RSV at the receive end has been well-understood. When the channel matrix can be accurately captured by a physical (geometric) scattering model across multiple clusters/paths {{as is the case in}} mmW MIMO systems, we provide a physical interpretation for this optimal structure: beam steering across the different paths with appropriate power allocation and phase compensation. While such an explicit physical interpretation has not been provided hitherto, practical implementation of such a structure in a mmW system is fraught with considerable difficulties (complexity as well as cost) as it requires the use of per-antenna gain and phase control. This paper characterizes the loss in received SNR with an alternate low-complexity beamforming solution that needs only per-antenna phase control and corresponds to steering the beam to the dominant path at the transmit and receive ends. While the loss in received SNR can be arbitrarily large (theoretically), this loss is minimal in a large fraction of the channel realizations reinforcing the utility of directional beamforming as a good candidate solution for mmW MIMO systems.

40|$|Abstract—Keyhole multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) {{channels}} {{have recently}} received significant attention since they can model, {{to a certain}} extend, some practically important propagation scenarios and also relay channels in the amplify-and-forward mode. This paper investigates instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and outage capacity distributions of spatially correlated keyhole MIMO channels with perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receive end and with or without CSI at the <b>transmit</b> <b>end.</b> For {{a small number of}} antennas, the impact of correlation on the capacity distribution can be characterized by the effective average SNR. This SNR, as well as the outage capacity, decreases with correlation. For a large number of transmit (receive) antennas, the keyhole channel is asymptotically equivalent (in terms of capacity) to the Rayleigh diversity channel with a single transmit (receive) antenna and multiple receive (transmit) antennas. The outage capacity of the keyhole channel is upper-bounded by that of the equivalent Rayleigh diversity channel. When the number of both transmit and receive antennas is large, the outage capacity distribution of the keyhole channel is asymptotically Gaussian. In some cases, the asymptotic Gaussian approximation is accurate already for a reasonably small number of antennas. The perfect transmit CSI is shown to bring a fixed SNR gain. A more general channel model with multiple keyholes is proposed. For a large number of antennas, the capacity of a multikeyhole channel is a normally distributed sum of the capacities of single keyhole channels. The fact that, despite the strong degenerate nature of the keyhole channel, its outage capacity distribution is asymptotically normal indicates that Gaussian distribution has a high degree of universality for the capacity analysis of MIMO channels.
