Roughly 65% of ReTool's goods were {{purchased}} from people, while the remainder was purchased from factories that produced too many tools or from closing businesses. CEO John Morgan said in an October 2000 interview <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> did not sell tools they did not use so {{it was hard to}} accumulate used tools at ReTool.

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up {{a large majority of}} people coming to Australia, meaning <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain. The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, was part of the eastern half of Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, GMG radio {{conducted}} {{market research}} into the type of music that listeners in the north-west of England wanted to hear on the radio.

5|$|The {{trials for}} the Columbia County {{residents}} held at Fort Mifflin {{were held in}} October and November 1864. At least three of those tried admitted to having been at a secret meeting on August 14, <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were armed at the meeting, and that {{the people at the}} meeting intended to resist the soldiers in Bloomsburg. However, most of the prisoners were released on or before January 1865, although a few were held until May 1865. No one was charged for the murder of Lieutenant Robinson until 1891, when Elias Young was arrested and charged. Although Young admitted to firing a gun, he stated that two people in the party searching for deserters had fired first. The court ruled that Young was acting in self-defense, and he was declared not guilty.|$|E

Historically, Steinkjer has produced a higher than average amount of university students. Only 25% of the students return to Steinkjer. Steinkjer is therefore a municipality <b>that</b> produces <b>many</b> <b>people</b> with higher education students. In Norwegian, municipalities such as Steinkjer <b>that</b> produce <b>many</b> <b>people</b> with higher education who leave the municipality are known as oppvekstkommuner (lit. upbringing municipalities).|$|R

5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E

50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that happiness {{is at least}} in part mediated through dopaminergic, adrenergic and serotonergic metabolism. A correlation has been found between hormone levels and happiness. SSRIs, such as Prozac, are used to adjust the levels of serotonin in the clinically unhappy. Researchers, such as Alexander, have indicated <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>peoples</b> usage of narcotics may be the unwitting result of attempts to readjust hormone levels to cope with situations that make them unhappy.|$|R
5|$|In {{recognition}} of the fact <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, {{and there was some}} evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} was criticised for {{its approach to}} the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing political parties accused it of betrayal and of deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure international recognition for Croatia. The only explanation <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were willing to accept for the town's fall was {{that it had been}} given up as part of a conspiracy. The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.|$|E
