5|$|After independence, the Darawishta {{merged with}} the former British Somaliland Scouts to form the 5,000 strong Somali National Army.

Officers were trained in the United Kingdom, Egypt and Italy. Despite <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> benefits associated with military service, the armed forces began to suffer chronic manpower shortages {{only a few years}} after independence.|$|E

5|$|In 1826 commissioners for <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> {{improvement}} of Oldham were established. The town was made {{part of a}} parliamentary borough, in 1832, though it was in 1849 when Oldham was incorporated as a municipal borough, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom, and in 1850 the Borough Council obtained {{the powers of the}} improvement commissioners. In 1880, parts of the Hollinwood and Crossbank areas of Chadderton and Ashton-under-Lyne townships were added to the Borough of Oldham. Oldham Above Town and Oldham Below Town were, from 1851 until c. 1881, statistical units used for the gathering and organising of civil registration information, and output of census data.|$|E
5|$|The botched mission furthered Castro’s {{opposition}} to the Grau administration, and returning to Havana, he took {{a leading role in}} the student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards. The protests, accompanied by a U.S.-imposed crackdown on those considered communists, led to violent clashes between protesters and police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten. At this point his public speeches took on a distinctively leftist slant, condemning <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> inequalities of Cuba, something in contrast to his former public criticisms, which had centered on condemning corruption and U.S. imperialism.|$|E

5|$|Following the Black Death, the {{invasion}} of Gotland by Valdemar IV of Denmark and the Battle of Visby in 1361, and a general decrease in trade, Gotland entered a period of decline. From about 1361, building activity therefore dropped. The inauguration of Sankta Karin in 1412 {{marks the end of}} church building activity in Visby. When troops from Lübeck pillaged the city in 1525, and probably damaged several of the churches, <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> rationale for sustaining them had vanished. With the advent of the Reformation soon afterwards, the religious rationale to sustain the upkeep of the many churches also permanently disappeared. All monasteries were abolished and all churches within the city walls except one (present-day Visby Cathedral) were abandoned and left to decay. During the following centuries, some church ruins were used as quarries. In 1805 the church ruins were protected by law and in 1863 the Swedish state for the first time allocated money for their conservation.|$|E
5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as a role model for his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a {{tradition}} of political activism. Edmund Burke, MP for the Bristol constituency for six years beginning in 1774, insisted that {{he was a member of}} parliament first and a representative of his constituents' interests second. Women's-rights advocate Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867–1954) was born in Bristol, and left-wing politician Tony Benn was MP for Bristol South East in 1950–1960 and 1963–83. In 1963 the Bristol Bus Boycott, following the Bristol Omnibus Company's refusal to hire black drivers and conductors, drove the passage of the UK's 1965 Race Relations Act. The 1980 St. Pauls riot protested against racism and police harassment and showed mounting dissatisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> circumstances of the city's Afro-Caribbean residents. Local support of fair trade was recognised in 2005, when Bristol became a Fairtrade zone.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of the Kangchu was not recognised by the British colonial government, even though they exercised a similar degree of autonomy as their counterparts in Johor. Nevertheless, the Kangchu in Singapore had easy access to forested land in Singapore compared to their counterparts in Johor, as the British colonial government adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the Kangchu and imposed very little regulation on their agricultural activities. However, the British were wary {{of the fact that}} many Kangchu in Singapore were members of the Ngee Heng Kongsi, which was illegal in Singapore and enjoyed monopoly rights over the regional opium trade. The British appointed a Chinese official among the Kangchu to oversee <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> affairs of the gambier and pepper plantations in Singapore and to act as the intermediary.|$|E
