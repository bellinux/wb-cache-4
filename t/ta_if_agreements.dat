The present writer tries to illustrate that, in the process of classification, the suffix ?i, which seems to have a structural meaning in the ［B］-group verbs while it has, of course, a conjunctive status, has its role in a) the infinitive form, in b) the nominalized form (compound nouns), and in c) the phonological change which occurs regularly in the process of preteritalization with the suffix ?<b>ta.</b> <b>If</b> this hypothesis is correct, it will serve not only to simplify the morphological description of the regular verbs but also to teach, from the linguistic point of view, the Japanese language for both the foreigners and the Japanese...|$|R
