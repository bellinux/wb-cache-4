25|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 - 1829) was {{the first}} {{biologist}} to describe a complex theory of evolution. His theory substantially comprised two statements: first, that animal organs and behaviour can change according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are used; and second, that those characteristics can transmit {{from one generation to}} the next (the example of the giraffe whose neck becomes longer while trying to reach the upper leaves of a tree is well-known). The second statement is that every living organism, humans included, tends to reach a greater level of perfection. When Charles Darwin went to the Galápagos Islands, he was well aware of Lamarck's theories and was influenced by them.|$|E
25|$|The idea to {{transform}} the UK programme into a global franchise was conceived by British television producer Paul Smith.

However, some of Smith's rules have been slightly relaxed over the years as the franchise's history has progressed.|$|E

While agreeing that IQ tests predict performance equally well for all racial groups, Nicholas Mackintosh {{also points out that}} there may still be a bias inherent in IQ testing if the education system is also systematically biased against African Americans, in which case educational performance may in fact also be an underestimation of African American children's cognitive abilities.

25|$|The Treaty of Zuhab, {{concluded}} on 17 May 1639, {{finally settled}} the Ottoman–Persian frontier, with Iraq permanently ceded to the Ottomans. Mesopotamia, which had formed {{an important part}} of various Persian empires {{from the time of the}} Achaemenids, was thereby irrevocably lost. The rest of the borders were restored roughly according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> were in 1555, with Eastern Armenia, Dagestan, eastern Georgia, and the contemporary Azerbaijan Republic remaining Persian, while Ottoman gains in Western Georgia and Western Armenia were made decisive. In broad terms, the Treaty of Zuhab reconfirmed the provisions of the 1555 Peace of Amasya. Eastern Samtskhe (Meskheti) was irrevocably lost to the Ottomans as well, making Samtskhe in its entirety an Ottoman possession. The peace established a permanent equilibrium of power in the region, and despite future conflicts and minor adjustments, the frontier postulated by the treaty remains to this day the western border of Iran with Iraq and Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Bejant is a {{term used}} to refer to first year male students; females being {{described}} as Bejantines. Second-year students are known as a Semis, a student in their third year may be referred to as a Tertian, and in their final year as a Magistrand. These terms are thought to be unique to St Andrews. When wearing their traditional red gowns, students in each year may be identified according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> wear their gowns. In the first year, the gown is worn on the shoulders, in the second year it is worn slightly off the shoulders. In the third year arts students wear their gowns off their left shoulders, and science students off their right shoulders. Finally, fourth years wear their gowns right down to their elbows, ready to shed their scarlet gowns for the black graduation gown. The gown is never to be joined at the top as this is considered bad luck.|$|E

25|$|Salomon {{realised}} {{that his}} nephew had no talent for trade {{and it was}} decided that Heine should enter the law. So, in 1819, Heine went to the University of Bonn (then in Prussia). Political life in Germany was divided between conservatives and liberals. The conservatives, who were in power, wanted to restore things <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> were before the French Revolution. They were against German unification because they felt a united Germany might fall victim to revolutionary ideas. Most German states were absolutist monarchies with a censored press. The opponents of the conservatives, the liberals, wanted to replace absolutism with representative, constitutional government, equality before the law and a free press. At the University of Bonn, liberal students were at war with the conservative authorities. Heine was a radical liberal {{and one of the first}} things he did after his arrival was to take part in a parade which violated the Carlsbad Decrees, a series of measures introduced by Metternich to suppress liberal political activity.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{dancing is}} a strong {{influence}} {{in many of the}} books. From Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914) and At School with the Roundheads (1915) until The Girls of the Abbey School (1921), it was shown as a fairly easy thing for girls to do, and to teach each other. By the time of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (1922) it is apparent that Oxenham herself had come into contact with the English Folk Dance Society and realised that the dances were not so simple after all. The books written from this time for the next six years or so, until Abbey Girls Win Through (1928) depict members of the EFDS hierarchy with affection and almost reverence. It seems that something happened to spoil this relationship, as after 1930 these characters do not appear in the books, and are hardly referred to again, certainly not in such glowing terms. The EFDS makes a brief appearance in An Abbey Champion (1946), but the personnel are no longer named. It may have been as simple as the move to Worthing and the impossibility of maintaining as close a friendship at a distance of some sixty miles, but it has been conjectured that 'Madam' (Helen Kennedy North) and 'The Pixie' (Daisy Caroline Daking) may have objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> were being portrayed. Oxenham never lost the love of folk dancing itself, however, and always shows it as a healthy form of exercise, and a way of lifting oneself out of depression.|$|E

The restaurant becomes a huge success among handicapped customers, but Peter is disappointed that {{what was supposed to be}} a cool restaurant has become a [...] "cafeteria at the veterans hospital," [...] and did not want to take the profits for granted. Angered, Peter bans them from entering with a [...] "no shirt, no shoes, no legs, no service" [...] policy. Joe is perplexed why Peter would turn away loyal paying customers, much less a good friend like Joe, but Peter stubbornly refuses to allow handicapped customers.

Stewie eventually takes matters into his own hands and defeats CrippleTron, which falls on Peter, breaking one of his legs. After being taken to the hospital, Peter needs to use a wheelchair for two weeks while his broken leg heals. Peter apologizes to Joe, who accepts his apology on the basis that he is glad to see Peter understand the difficulties of being disabled and that he does not want to continue holding a grudge against Peter.

500|$|SST {{was one of}} {{the first}} oceanographic {{variables}} to be measured. [...] Benjamin Franklin suspended a mercury thermometer from a ship while travelling between the United States and Europe in his survey of the Gulf stream in the late eighteenth century. [...] SST was later measured by dipping a thermometer into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface. [...] The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships, which was underway by 1963. [...] These observations have a warm bias of around [...] due to the heat of the engine room. [...] This bias has led to changes in the [...] perception of global warming since 2000. [...] Fixed weather buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of [...] Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> were taken. In the nineteenth century, measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship. However, there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets. Samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket, but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket. The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure. The samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night. Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design, and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies. [...] These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution. [...] A large network of coastal buoys in U.S. waters is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). [...] Between 1985 and 1994, an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean designed to help monitor and predict the El Niño phenomenon.|$|E

Sabrina refuses to help Shannon financially, despite Shannon winning a prestigious yet non-paying internship to the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York.

During one con in Sydney, her [...] "abusive boyfriend" [...] ruins Shannon's ruse after Boone cuts him a check. Boone storms off to his hotel room and plans to return to the States.
