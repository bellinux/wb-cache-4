500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} rumours began to {{circulate}} that Blyton had not written {{all the books}} attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed {{her that she had}} attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated [...] "a 'company' of ghost writers" [...] persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.|$|E

[...] As Peter phones Elizabeth <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> that she was correct, Ben visits the Burke home and vaguely threatens Elizabeth.

[...] In order {{to get closer to}} the suspects, Neal visits Ben’s parole office under the alias Nick Halden. [...] Using information gathered by Neal, Peter quickly realizes that the target of the heist is a luxury hotel. [...] Peter and Neal hurry to the hotel, barely missing Ben and Connor.

Davuluri denied making these comments, later saying that [...] "Mallory and I are good friends." [...] An official from the Miss America pageant also stated that the [...] "situation was investigated fully back in July and there is no validity to the story whatsoever. Miss New York spoke to Mallory Hytes Hagan <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> there was no validity and to apologize if she was offended in any way."

500|$|Because Poe did {{not have}} visitors, Moran was {{probably}} {{the only person to}} see the author in his last days. Even so, Moran's credibility has been questioned repeatedly, if not considered altogether untrustworthy. Throughout the years after Poe's death, his story changed as he wrote and lectured on the topic. He claimed (in 1875 and again in 1885, for example) that he had immediately contacted Poe's aunt (and mother-in-law), Maria Clemm, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> about Poe's death; in fact, he wrote to her only after she had requested it on November 9, almost a full month after the event. He also claimed that Poe had said, quite poetically, as he prepared to draw his last breath: [...] "The arched heavens encompass me, and God has his decree legibly written upon the frontlets of every created human being, and demons incarnate, their goal will be the seething waves of blank despair." [...] The editor of the New York Herald, which published this version of Moran's story, admitted, [...] "We cannot imagine Poe, even if delirious, constructing [...]" [...] Poe biographer William Bittner attributes Moran's claim to a convention of assigning pious last words to console mourners.|$|E
500|$|In 1890, the Queen had Karim's {{portrait}} {{painted by}} Heinrich von Angeli. According to the Queen, von Angeli was keen to paint Karim {{as he had}} never painted an Indian before and [...] "was so struck with his handsome face and colouring". On 11 July 1890, she wrote to Lansdowne, and the Secretary of State for India Lord Cross, for [...] "a grant of land to her really exemplary and excellent young Munshi, Hafiz Abdul Karim". The ageing Queen did not trust her relatives and the Royal Household {{to look after the}} Munshi after she was gone, and so sought to secure his future. Lansdowne replied that grants of land were given only to soldiers, and then only in cases of long and meritorious service. [...] Nevertheless, the Viceroy agreed to find a grant for Karim that would provide about 600 rupees annually, the same amount that an old soldier could expect after performing exceptionally. [...] Victoria wrote to Lansdowne repeatedly between July and October, pressuring him on the land grant. Apart from wasteland, there was little government-controlled land near Agra; thus Lansdowne was having trouble finding a suitable plot. On 30 October, the Munshi left Balmoral for four months' leave in India, travelling on the same ship as Lady Lansdowne. On the same day, Lord Lansdowne telegraphed the Queen <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> that a grant of land in the suburbs of Agra had been arranged. Lansdowne made a point of informing the Queen: ...|$|E

At a conference in the autumn of 1946, Weill introduced her to Marcel Mathieu, a director of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), the network of institutes that comprise the major part of the scientific research laboratories supported by the French government. This led to her appointment with Jacques Mering at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'État in Paris. She joined the labo (as referred to by the staff) of Mering on 14 February 1947 as one of the fifteen chercheurs (researchers).|$|E

The {{producer}} and head of security gave him chances to walk out, saying he was now trespassing, but Josh refused so he was forcibly removed by security, when even there, he hesitated. Jordan ran out, yelling at Josh that he had to leave ("Youre a tool, youve been expelled, get the fuck out!"). Security led him out the backway. Josh and Jamie wouldnt leave because Josh wanted the car to be brought to him. Jamie decided to stay with Josh after he said [...] "honest" [...] <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>letting</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> he was telling the truth.|$|R

2500|$|After {{a series}} of legal {{proceedings}} the Federal District Court ordered the Little Rock School District to proceed with its integration plans when school opened on September 4, 1957. Governor Orval Faubus ordered the Arkansas National Guard to Little Rock Central High School on September 4, 1957, because {{he said he had}} evidence (although none was shown) that there was [...] "...imminent danger of tumult, riot and breach of peace and the doing of violence to persons and property." [...] The governor initially ordered to state duty the State Headquarters Detachment, the Base Detachment at Adams Field and any other units the Adjutant General felt necessary to [...] "accomplish the mission of maintaining or restoring law and order and to preserve the peace, health, safety and security of the citizens of Pulaski County, Arkansas." [...] On September 4, Elizabeth Eckford was the only student to enter the school due to lack of communication. It is commonly mistaken that she was taking this stand on her own but rather it was because she was the only student who didn't have a phone so nobody could contact her <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> the integration wasn't happening until the next day.|$|E
2500|$|Andi Prendergast (played by Missy Peregrym in {{the series}} and Nikki Reed in the unaired pilot) is Sam's girlfriend and, for a time, manager. Initially unaware of Sam's Reaper duties, she is let down {{multiple}} times when Sam is called away from dates to capture souls.

Sam is warned by the Devil to ensure she remains unaware of his activities, but eventually he receives permission <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> what he does. With help from Sam's neighbor (and demon) Tony, {{as well as from the}} escaped soul at the time, Sam convinces Andi of his [...] "job". Andi reacts poorly, but eventually accepts Sam's fate and becomes his third assistant in hunting souls, though her assistance seems more focused on research rather than actual confrontation. In season 2, Andi was promoted to manager of the Work Bench when Ted was fired because of harassing a [...] "secret shopper". She was later demoted in [...] "My Brother's Reaper", for allowing the Work Bench to be used for a bachelor party.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, NBC {{executive}} Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran {{the idea}} of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted {{he did not want}} to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to Tonight Show producer Debbie Vickers' office <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> he felt as if he had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of The Tonight Show; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. [...] "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,” Leno said. “You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don’t want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who’s better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!" ...|$|E
