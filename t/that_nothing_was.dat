5|$|At 21:00, the British moved out. No one {{except the}} commanders {{knew of the}} plan. Clinton led a crack brigade of light {{infantry}} with fixed bayonets in front, followed by Cornwallis who had eight battalions and 14 artillery pieces. Cornwallis was followed by Howe and Hugh Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage. The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> happening. The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots, when it headed directly north toward the heights.|$|E
5|$|After Wizkid tweeted a {{subliminal}} {{message and}} tweaked his Twitter account, reports about his departure from E.M.E went viral. Wizkid {{moved out of}} the E.M.E mansion in Lagos and acquired his own home in the Lekki Phase 1 area. Prior to Wizkid's subliminal tweets, Banky W pacified fans by assuring them <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> amiss. Furthermore, it was reported that troubles within E.M.E started as early as the 2012 E.M.E all stars concert. It was also reported that money was at the centre of the controversy. On 20 February 2013, Information Nigeria reported that Wizkid was getting 25 percent from every performance, while Banky W and Segun Demuren were getting 50 percent. Osagie, Wizkid's former manager, was getting the remaining 25 percent. After firing Osagie and hiring Godwin Tom (whom he parted ways with in April 2014), Wizkid wanted a 50–50 share with Banky W. The source revealed that Banky W refused to accept Wizkid's proposal. Moreover, it was reported that Banky W wanted to find a manager for Wizkid who would accept 25 percent. It was also reported that things started getting sour as a result of both parties disagreement. Information Nigeria went on to report that Wizkid was doing three shows weekly and bringing in close to ₦24 million monthly. On 30 April 2013, Nigerian Entertainment Today reported that Wizkid and E.M.E reunited after contract negotiations. The news source also reported that Wizkid performed alongside label mates Shaydee and DJ Xclusive in The Republic of Benin. In August 2014, Wizkid told Olisa Adibua that he will depart the label following the release of his second studio album, Ayo.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome was}} that the Casket letters were {{accepted}} by the English commissioners as genuine after {{a study of the}} handwriting, and of the information contained therein. However, Queen Mary's commissioners were refused access to the letters to review or to study them.

The outcome of the enquiry was to prolong doubts about Mary's character that Elizabeth used to prevent the Queens meeting.|$|E

25|$|Ziaul Ahsan, {{a detective}} with the RAB, said {{investigators}} believed the murder was pre-meditated and committed {{by someone who}} knew the victims.

25|$|At the French {{embassy in}} London on Sunday December 1, David Lloyd George and Clemenceau had {{a private meeting}} where the latter {{surrendered}} French rights to Mosul and to Palestine that had been given by the Sykes–Picot Agreement. There are conflicting views {{as to whether or}} not France received anything in exchange. Although Lloyd George and others have suggested <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> given in return, according to Rutledge and others, Lloyd George promised at least one or even all of, support for French claims on the Ruhr, that when oil production in Mosul began, France would receive a share and that Sykes–Picot obligation would be maintained as regards Syria.|$|E
25|$|The police further {{speculated that}} the victims did not {{initially}} realize the danger they were facing, {{the location of the}} bodies in the estate's second floor indicated that they did not consider escaping when they faced their intruder, and in spite of the unexpected and dramatic break-in nobody made any effort to alert the police or others. One explanation may be that the victims initially did not feel the intruder to be threatening or did not see it necessary to contact the police. The fact that Kristian Orderud was killed while lying in his bed, indicated that the perpetrator was not a random predator without intimate knowledge of the family, but rather knew exactly who his victims were. This was backed up by the fact <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> missing from the house, ruling out a robbery.|$|E

25|$|The treaty did {{not answer}} vital {{questions}} such as whether the Persian army would be disarmed or be able to regroup. It was known to both sides that Persia would strike again because they considered the regions rightfully theirs and were furious about Russia’s treatment {{of the land and}} people. The war was becoming costly in terms of troops and finance, so the Treaty of Gulistan led to over a decade of nominal peace (1813–1826) between Russia and Persia, mainly for the clause regarding trade: both governments saw much potential with it and used it to their advantage. Permanent diplomatic missions were set up in Persia as well as Russia in order to keep trade open as long as possible. It was a period of tense stability, though, as both countries understood that the treaty was written very vaguely and <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> written about provisions for the military mainly to prevent Persia from trying to regain the regions of Georgia or the Caucasus, thus leaving open the possibility of another future war. It is likely that neither the Iranian Shah (king) nor the Tsar regarded the treaty of Gulistan as definitive.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September, Seddon {{went to the}} {{undertaker}} {{and arranged}} a cheap funeral, keeping the small commission for himself. Barrow's burial {{took place in a}} common burial plot, although her family had a vault in Islington. Seddon's later explanation for this was that Barrow's family had snubbed his daughter during an earlier visit and he was not prepared to allow his family to be treated in the same way again, and that if Barrow's family missed the funeral it might teach them better manners for the future. Immediately after the funeral the Seddon family left for Southend for a fortnight's holiday. Barrow's cousin, Frank Vonderahe, suspicious over the suddenness of the death and how quickly the funeral arrangements had been made, arrived to take over possession of her estate. However, Seddon informed him <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> left as he had paid the substantial funeral expenses and the cost of Ernest Grant's upkeep himself. The Vonderahe family then went to the police and voiced their suspicions. Barrow's body was exhumed on 15 November 1911, and an examination of it by Sir William Willicox, the senior Home Office specialist, and young pathologist Bernard Spilsbury, who had already {{made a name for himself}} in the Crippen case, discovered about two grains of arsenic. As in the Crippen trial, Spilsbury showed himself to be an outstanding witness for the prosecution, easily dealing with cross-examination by the junior defence barrister and demonstrating highly effective forensic techniques.|$|E

The king referred to the so-called [...] "Gun Powder Conspiracy" [...] uncovered in 1536, which aimed at murdering him by a blasting charge hidden under his chair in the church. This resulted in various death sentences and expatriations, including Mint Master Anders Hansson who was accused of being a counterfeiter.|$|E

500|$|Gian Gastone {{died from}} [...] "an {{accumulation}} of diseases" [...] on 9 July 1737, surrounded by prelates and his sister. Anna Maria Luisa {{was offered a}} nominal regency by the Prince de Craon, the Grand Duke's envoy, until Francis III could arrive in Florence, but declined. At Gian Gastone's demise, all the House of Medici's allodial possessions, including £2,000,000 liquid cash, a vast art collection, robes of state and lands in the former Duchy of Urbino, were conferred on Anna Maria Luisa. In regards to this, her most notable act was the Patto di Famiglia ("Family Pact"), signed on 31 October 1737. In collaboration with the Holy Roman Emperor and Francis of Lorraine, she willed all the personal property of the Medici's to the Tuscan state, provided <b>that</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> ever removed from Florence.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the commissioners accepted the casket letters as genuine after a study of their contents and comparison of the penmanship with examples of Mary's handwriting.

For overriding political reasons, Elizabeth wished neither to convict nor acquit Mary of murder, and {{there was never any}} intention to proceed judicially; the conference was intended as a political exercise. In the end, Moray returned to Scotland as its regent, and Mary remained in custody in England. Elizabeth had succeeded in maintaining a Protestant government in Scotland, without either condemning or releasing her fellow sovereign.
