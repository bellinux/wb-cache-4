50|$|A {{test probe}} is a {{physical}} device used to connect electronic test equipment to a device under test (DUT). Test probes range from very simple, robust devices to complex probes that are sophisticated, expensive, and fragile. Specific types include <b>test</b> <b>prods,</b> oscilloscope probes and current probes. A test probe is often supplied as a test lead, which includes the probe, cable and terminating connector.|$|R
50|$|Deployment {{architectures}} vary significantly, but broadly, the tiers are bookended {{by starting}} at development (DEV) and ending at production (PROD). A common 4-tier architecture is development, testing, staging, production (DEV, <b>TEST,</b> STAGING, <b>PROD),</b> with software being deployed to each in order. Other common environments include Quality Assurance (QA), for acceptance testing; sandbox or experimental (EXP), for experiments {{that are not}} intended to proceed to production; and Disaster Recovery, to provide an immediate fallback in case of problems with production. Another common architecture is development, testing, acceptance and production (DTAP), consisting of dev/test/qa/prod.|$|R
40|$|Gene {{regulation}} {{is a series}} of processes that control gene expression and its extent. The connections among genes and their regulatory molecules, usually transcription factors, and a descriptive model of such connections are known as gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Elucidating GRNs is crucial to understand {{the inner workings of the}} cell and the complexity of gene interactions. To date, numerous algorithms have been developed to infer gene regulatory networks. However, as the number of identified genes increases and the complexity of their interactions is uncovered, networks and their regulatory mechanisms become cumbersome to <b>test.</b> Furthermore, <b>prodding</b> through experimental results requires an enormous amount of computation, resulting in slow data processing. Therefore, new approaches are needed to expeditiously analyze copious amounts of experimental data resulting from cellular GRNs. To meet this need, cloud computing is promising as reported in the literature. Here, we propose new MapReduce algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks on a Hadoop cluster in a cloud environment. These algorithms employ an information-theoretic approach to infer GRNs using time-series microarray data. Experimental results show that our MapReduce program is much faster than an existing tool while achieving slightly better prediction accuracy than the existing tool...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the history and {{evolution}} of tris(dithiolene) chemistry. Attaching the dithiolene ligands to metal ions is rather trivial {{in comparison to the}} synthesis of the ligands themselves. The vast majority of tris(dithiolene) complexes are prepared from combining the correct stoichiometric ratio of free dithiol or dialkali dithiolate with an appropriate metal reagent, principally metal chlorides. Alternative methods include transmetalation and alkyne reduction by a metal sulfide. The chapter discusses the electrochemistry, magnetometry and spectroscopy of tris(dithiolene). A vast array of spectroscopic instrumentation have been employed to <b>test,</b> poke, and <b>prod</b> tris(dithiolenes) over the decades in order to unlock the intricacies of their molecular and electronic structure. The techniques range from vibrational and electronic absorption, to magnetic resonance and element specific probes (e. g., XAS and Mössbauer spectroscopy) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Enterprise GIS {{projects}} are complex. These projects involve coordination and communications between multiple parties. These parties include stakeholders, project teams, IT organizations and external vendors, etc. These projects start with stakeholder interaction and lead into complex technofunctional tasks associated with data conversion/ migration, software development, testing, acceptance and deployment. The teams {{are required to}} coordinate and integrate the deliverables from {{internal and external parties}} in a concerted sequence to achieve the overall objectives. This paper presents a unique process-based methodology, to establish the configuration management for enterprise scale technology implementation projects. In particular, this paper will cover task assignment and processes for communications, requirements management, environment utilization (dev / stage / <b>test</b> / <b>prod),</b> data loading/merge, data quality assurance and acceptance, backlog posting, software functional testing, software acceptance etc. Note: The reader of this paper is assumed to have knowledge of ESRI technology and terminology. Some of the concepts and tasks described in this paper are technical in nature, assuming some knowledge of IT coordination, management and implementation. This paper attempts to identify the challenges in multiple areas but focus more on the process and collaboration needs. This paper also expresses several viewpoints of the author based on his experience. Many thanks to our customers utilizing this BPM approach; management of Avineon; ESRI for hosting the conference and my colleagues for reviewing and validating the approach presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper argues {{from the}} {{standpoint}} that embedding Indigenous knowledge and perspectives in Australian curricula occurs within a space of tension, ‘the cultural interface’ (Nakata, 2002), in negotiation and contestation with other dominant knowledge systems. In this interface, Indigenous knowledge (IK) {{is in a state}} of constancy and flux, invisible and simultaneously pronounced depending on the teaching and learning contexts. More often than not, IK competes for validity and is vexed by questions of racial and cultural authenticity, and therefore struggles to be located centrally in educational systems, curricula and pedagogies. Interrogating normative western notions of what constitutes authentic or legitimate knowledge is critical to teaching Indigenous studies and embedding IK. The inclusion (and exclusion) of IK at the interface is central to developing curriculum that allows teachers to <b>test</b> and <b>prod,</b> create new knowledge and teaching approaches. From this perspective, we explore Indigenous Australian pre-service teachers’ experiences of pedagogical relationships within the teaching habitus of Australian classrooms. Our study is engaged with the strategic transgressions of praxis. We contend that tensions that participant Indigenous Australian pre-service teachers experience mirror the broader (and unresolved) political status of Indigenous people and thus where and why IK is strategically deployed as ‘new’ or ‘old knowledge within Australian liberal democratic systems of curriculum and schooling. It is significant to discuss the formation and transformation of the pedagogical cultural identity of the teaching profession within which Indigenous and non-Indigenous pre-service teachers are employed...|$|R
40|$|In this study, young rats were {{deprived}} of early social interactions during weeks 4 and 5 of life. Different behavior al {{tests were conducted}} in adulthood to study the behavioral responses of rats lacking ear ly social experiences. Juvenile deprivation resulted in decreased social activity and an altered sexual pattern, but did not affect locomotor activity or the performance in the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, behavioral and neuroendocrine responses of juvenile isolated rats were dramatically altered when they were confronted with territorial aggression. Juvenile deprived rats did not readily display a submissive posture {{in response to the}} resident and showed no immobility behavior after being returned to the resident's territory, while their plasma corticosterone and adrenaline concentrations;were significantly increased compared to nonisolated controls. In contrast, behavioral responses in the shock <b>prod</b> <b>test</b> were not affected by previous isolation. The results suggest that early social experiences are vital for interactions with conspecifics later in life, i. e., aggression, sexual, and social interactions; (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Environmental stimuli {{during early}} stages of life can {{influence}} {{the development of an}} organism and may result in permanent changes in adult behaviour and physiology. In the present study we investigated the influence of early postnatal handling on adult neuroendocrine and behavioural stress reactivity in Wistar rats. Pups were subjected to handling from postnatal day 1 – 21. The young were taken from the nest every day for 15 min and each of the pups was handled separately. Control nests were left undisturbed. When the animals had reached an adult age of 3 – 4 months they were individually housed and subjected to a series of tests to measure their stress reactivity. In the first experiment we established adult behavioural coping with stressors and anxiety in the following series of tests: open field <b>test,</b> shock <b>prod</b> defensive burying <b>test,</b> elevated plus maze and conditioned fear test. Collectively, the data clearly indicate that handled animals are characterized by a lower stress-induced anxiety. Yet, handled and control animals do not differ in their general way of coping with stressors. Although the lower anxiety in handled animals is often reflected in a higher activity, they are not more active per se. In a second experiment, animals were provided with a permanent jugular vein canula for repeated blood sampling to determine stress hormones: noradrenaline, adrenaline, prolactin and corticosterone. Animals were subjected to a novelty test and a conditioned fear test. The neuroendocrine response profile is consistent with the conclusion that handled animals are less anxious than controls but are not different in their general strategy of coping with stressors. The handled animals showed an attenuated adrenaline, prolactin and corticosterone response. Yet, in neither of the two tests there was a difference in noradrenaline response, a typical marker for an active coping strategy. Interestingly, the differences in neuroendocrine reactivity already appeared in response to a mild novelty challenge when there were no clear behavioural differences yet. The neuroendocrine measures are in line with the behavioural data but more sensitively reflect the differences between handled and control animals. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{benefits}} that the Pre-Production Service (PPS) can offer to VOs and new users will be shown. Current PPS processes will be described {{so they have}} a better understanding of the PPS environment. PPS offers a proper place where VOs can test their applications and check their compatibility with upcoming middleware releases. PPS could help VOs improve their applications and at the same time, VOs would be helping PPS to produce better tested middleware releases that would go into Production (PROD) Currently a well-defined set of procedures is followed in PPS, beginning with the pre-deployment activity and finishing with the approval of a new middleware release that can go into PROD. The PPS Coordination Team takes care of supervising all these steps, mainly trying to spot possible bugs in the middleware before it goes into PROD. Unfortunately, VO contribution in this part of the deployment is currently very limited and the PPS team does not have a full feedback from these important groups. One of the problems is that PPS is not very well-known for many VOs and users and this situation should change. When a VO has a new application or there is an upcoming middleware upgrade, they should be aware that they can test it in PPS, helping to discover possible problems before going into PROD. Indeed, PPS sites have a great quantity of free resources that can and should be used. Finally, VO and users should remember that PROD is a critical service not to be used for testing purposes. The PPS team tries to find all possible bugs that could be encountered in upcoming middleware versions before these versions are submitted to PROD. This is a critical process in the middleware release cycle because the fact that the final software released to Production works correctly depends on the effort made in PPS in order to find all possible failures. Regarding VO's software, at this moment it is only <b>tested</b> in <b>PROD</b> sites (with all the risks that this entails). Applications are not tested against upcoming middleware versions before they are actually deployed into PROD. This means that problems are usually detected too late. If VOs and users start to test their applications in PPS they check their compatibility with new middleware before it is actually released to PROD. At the same time they would be helping to discover possible bugs in the middleware that could be corrected before it is released. At the end everybody will benefit from a better production environment. PPS could be the proper place where VO can test their applications and check in advance the compatibility with new middleware releases; helping at the same time with their work to discover bugs in the middleware before it is deployed to production. As well PPS could be a good place for VOs to deploy new versions of their applications or even new services before they are moved to the production environment. We hope that after seeing the poster more VOs and users will be interested in using PPS...|$|R
