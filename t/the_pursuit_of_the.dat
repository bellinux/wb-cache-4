On October 18, the Normans engaged a Byzantine army under Alexios I Komnenos outside Dyrrhachium. The battle began with the Byzantine right wing routing the Norman left wing, which broke and fled. Varangian mercenaries joined in <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleeing Normans, but became separated from the main force and were massacred.

Iowa was then detached to bombard enemy installations on Saipan and Tinian on 13–14 June, {{which resulted in the}} destruction of a Japanese ammunition dump. On 19 June, in an engagement known as the Battle of the Philippine Sea, Iowa, as part of the battle line of TF 58, helped repel four massive air raids launched by the Japanese Middle Fleet. This resulted in the almost complete destruction of Japanese carrier-based air-forces, with Iowa claiming the destruction of three enemy aircraft.

5|$|In {{the sources}} {{considered}} so far, Troilus' only narrative function is his death. The {{treatment of the}} character changes in two ways {{in the literature of}} the medieval and renaissance periods. First, he becomes an important and active protagonist in <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trojan War itself. Second, he becomes an active heterosexual lover, rather than the passive victim of Achilles' pederasty. By the time of John Dryden's neo-classical adaptation of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida it is the ultimate failure of his love affair that defines the character.|$|E

5|$|Primarily a coming-of-age story (Bildungsroman) {{and family}} saga, the novel chronicles {{the effect of}} a mutated gene on three generations of a Greek family, causing momentous changes in the protagonist's life. According to scholars, the novel's main themes are nature versus nurture, rebirth, and the differing {{experiences}} of what society constructs as polar opposites—such as those found between men and women. It discusses <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Dream and explores gender identity. The novel contains many allusions to Greek mythology, including creatures such as the Minotaur, half-man and half-bull, and the Chimera, a monster composed of various animal parts.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of the debris of the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him {{would have to be a}} much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy.

5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights {{had been}} {{a victory for the}} militia; no regular {{soldiers}} of the U.S. Army had been present.

The British Band was moving slow, encumbered with wounded warriors and people dying of starvation. The Americans followed the trail of dead bodies, cast off equipment, and the remains of horses the hungry Natives had eaten.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss and Gascon {{infantry}} {{proceeded to}} slaughter the remaining landsknechte—whose tight order precluded a rapid retreat—as {{they attempted to}} withdraw from the battlefield. The road to Ceresole was littered with corpses; the Swiss, in particular, showed no mercy, as they wished to avenge the mistreatment of the Swiss garrison of Mondovì the previous November. Most of the landsknechts' officers were killed; and while contemporary accounts probably exaggerate the numbers of the dead, {{it is clear that the}} German infantry had ceased to exist as a fighting force. Seeing this, Sanseverino decided that the battle was lost and marched away to Asti with the bulk of the Italian infantry and the remnants of Baglioni's Florentine cavalry; the French light cavalry, meanwhile, joined in <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landsknechts.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian troops continued. On 7 February 1807, the French arrived {{outside the}} village of Eylau, as night was falling. In some confusion, the Imperial coach rumbled into the village, {{although}} the Emperor was setting up his camp a few kilometers away. The Russian patrol in the village chased off the coach driver and his men and plundered the Emperor's belongings; in turn, the Imperial escort chased them off. More and more men were sent into the engagement, {{and in the end}} the French took the village when the Russians withdrew. Both sides lost 4,000 men in the contest for the village and the Emperor's nightshirt. Settling for the night, they prepared to engage the next day.|$|E
5|$|Union troops retreated in {{different}} states of order. The brigades on Seminary Ridge {{were said to}} move deliberately and slowly, keeping in control, although Col. Wainwright's artillery was not informed of the order to retreat and found themselves alone. When Wainwright realized his situation, he ordered his gun crews to withdraw at a walk, not wishing to panic the infantry and start a rout. As pressure eventually increased, Wainwright ordered his 17 remaining guns to gallop down Chambersburg Street, three abreast. A.P. Hill failed to commit any of his reserves to <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seminary defenders, a great missed opportunity.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} the British forces under general Pritzler pursued the Peshwa, who fled southwards towards Karnataka with the Raja of Satara. The Peshwa {{continued}} his flight southward throughout {{the month of}} January. Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore, the Peshwa doubled back and passed General Pritzler to head towards Solapur. Until 29 January <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peshwa had not been productive. Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British, Gokhale and his light troops hovered around the Peshwa and fired long shots. Some skirmishes took place, and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery. There was, however, no advantageous result to either party. On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas. He symbolically raised the British flag. The next day, the Bhagwa Zenda —the flag of Shivaji and the Marathas— was raised in its place. To gain {{the support of the}} population, the British declared that they would not interfere with the tenets of any religion. They announced that all Watans, Inams, pensions, and annual allowances would be continued provided that the recipients withdrew from the service of Baji Rao. During this time Baji Rao remained in the vicinity of Solapur.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} Rogers {{was informed}} by a passing American merchant ship of {{a fleet of}} British merchantmen en route to Britain from Jamaica. Congress sailed along in pursuit, but was interrupted when President began pursuing HMS Belvidera on 23 June. Congress trailed behind President during the chase and fired her bowchasers at the escaping Belvidera. Unable to capture Belvidera, the squadron returned to <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jamaican fleet. On 1 July they began to follow a trail of coconut shells and orange peels the Jamaican fleet had left behind them. Sailing to within one day's journey of the English Channel, the squadron never sighted the convoy and Rodgers called off the pursuit on the 13th. During their return trip to Boston, Congress assisted in the capture of seven merchant ships, including the recapture of an American vessel.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, the 9th Division and the RAAF squadrons in {{the area}} {{took part in the}} Second Battle of El Alamein. After a lengthy period of preparation, the Eighth Army {{launched}} its major offensive on 23 October. The 9th Division was involved in some of the heaviest fighting of the battle, and its advance in the coast area succeeded in drawing away enough German forces for the heavily reinforced 2nd New Zealand Division to decisively break though the Axis lines on the night of 1/2 November. The 9th Division suffered a high number of casualties during this battle and did not take part in <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retreating Axis forces. During the battle the Australian Government requested that the division be returned to Australia as {{it was not possible to}} provide enough reinforcements to sustain it, and this was agreed to by the British and US governments in late November. The 9th Division left Egypt for Australia in January 1943, ending the AIF's involvement in the war in North Africa.|$|E
