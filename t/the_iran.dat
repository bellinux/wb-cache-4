5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iran</b> Department of Meteorology {{declared}} storm warnings for the country's southeastern coastline; {{the agency}} anticipated {{moderate to severe}} precipitation and gusty winds. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the cyclone, about 40,000people, including around 4,000students at the International University of Chabahar, evacuated coastal areas of the country to at least 1km (0.6mi) inland. All flights {{in and out of the}} Konarak Airport were canceled during a 48-hour period. Additionally, all hospitals in Sistan and Baluchestan Province were put on red alert. <b>The</b> <b>Iran</b> chapter of the Red Cross advanced the delivery of necessary relief supplies.|$|E
5|$|According to Oan Ali Mohammed, {{suppression}} of the Arab sovereignty movement was the spark {{that led to his}} desire to attack the Iranian Embassy in London. The plan was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>Iran</b> hostage crisis in which supporters of the revolution held the staff of the American embassy in Tehran hostage.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of the cyclone, <b>the</b> <b>Iran</b> chapter of the Red Cross and its volunteers worked in {{conjunction}} with the military to distribute relief supplies to villages using trucks and helicopters.

In total, 61,558families received aid from the Red Cross in Iran. The Iranian government provided monetary relief to the affected people. Officials worked to restore roads, bridges, and power systems in the affected areas, although repairs were more difficult in some locations; by a week after the storm, several villages remained surrounded by floodwaters.|$|E

5|$|Reagan {{ran against}} Democratic {{incumbent}} Jimmy Carter and independent candidate John B. Anderson. He was praised by supporters {{for running a}} campaign of upbeat optimism. Aided by <b>the</b> <b>Iran</b> hostage crisis and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation, Reagan won the election in a massive landslide. The 1980 presidential election {{marked the beginning of}} the Reagan Era, and signified a conservative realignment in national politics. At 69 years old, Reagan became the oldest person ever elected U.S. president until 2017, when President Donald Trump was sworn in at the age of 70.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during <b>the</b> <b>Iran</b> hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} Operation Eagle Claw during <b>the</b> <b>Iran</b> hostage crisis in 1980 underscored the {{requirement}} for a new long-range, high-speed, vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense. In response, the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties {{of being the first}} tiltrotor for military service led to many years of development.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the late-1970s and the 1980s, the Nazareth-based firm Beatty Contractors erected {{the candle}} each year. The firm {{originally}} did {{the project for}} free, but began charging $2,000 in 1981 when the cost of fuel started to rise. During the Peace Candle lighting ceremony on November 28, 1980, Easton Mayor Philip Mitman dedicated the candle to the 52 American hostages being held in Iran during <b>the</b> <b>Iran</b> hostage crisis. During a storm on December 6, 1983, 47 mile-per-hour winds caused the Peace Candle to start tilting in place. When city workers removed the flame next day, they realized the bugler statue atop the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument had moved on its base and would have toppled over {{had it not been}} leaning against the candle structure. One of the candle's anchor cables was also snapped by the wind and torn out of the brickwork. The cable was repaired and the bugler statue, which was previously held by its own weight, was reinforced with grouting. A sixteen-pound chunk of granite was also dislodged {{from the top of the}} statue, although in an area that most spectators cannot see from ground level. The candle suffered similar damage in 1988, when high winds loosened parts of the structure and snapped support wires. As a result, it had to be taken down early on January 5, 1989. In 1985, the Easton Area Christmas Committee was renamed to the Easton Holiday Committee.|$|E
