5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context {{may be much}} less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.|$|E

5|$|In the 1923 season, under <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood {{concentrated}} on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew {{a few inches}} in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating {{the ball in the}} air to produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predator.|$|E
5|$|Shooting in Venice {{took place}} on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody {{greeting}} Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists {{for as long as}} possible. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library's exterior. The next day, filming moved to the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh (The Treasury) stood in for the temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of King Hussein and Queen Noor. The Treasury had previously appeared in Sinbad and <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tiger.

Forecasters advised those in The Bahamas to quickly complete preparations, though <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane did not pass over the archipelago until four days later. When Flora turned to the northeast out to sea, forecasters again advised Bahamian citizens to prepare for the hurricane, and on October 9, weather advisories advised the southeastern Bahamas to prepare for gale-force winds and strong tides. One advisory considered there to be less than a 50% chance of the hurricane reaching southeastern Florida, though weather bulletins advised Florida citizens to monitor the hurricane. At its closest approach to Florida, the hurricane remained 330miles (530km) away, though gale warnings were issued from Stuart to Key West due to the hurricane's large size.|$|E
5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} gained sufficient shower activity and organization to be renamed as a tropical cyclone at 1800UTC on 10 March while located {{southwest of the}} Solomon Islands capital of Honiara. Erica gradually intensified, attaining the equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) Originally moving to the southeast at a slow pace, Erica began to accelerate due to the influence of weak mid–level ridge to its east. Continuing to intensify, the cyclone reached its peak intensity on 13 March with a minimum barometric pressure of , and peak winds of 260km/h (150mph 1-minute sustained). <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclone began to shrink in diameter and become symmetrical.

5|$|After {{attaining}} typhoon status, Paka strengthened fairly quickly, and by December 12 {{it reached}} sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) for a ten-minute (10 min) duration, or 215km/h (135mph) over a one-minute (1 min) duration. Subsequently, it briefly weakened as its forward motion increased. However, Paka again re-intensified, and at 1200UTC on December 14 it attained the unofficial ranking of super typhoon status while over the open Pacific Ocean. At the same time, the JMA classified it with 10 min sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph). After reaching its initial peak intensity, Typhoon Paka began to weaken as it approached the southern Mariana Islands; the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar from Guam revealed {{the presence of}} a primary eyewall of 74km (46mi) in diameter, with a fragmented inner wall cloud of 19km (11mi) in diameter. Additionally, satellite imagery indicated an eyewall mesovortex within <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typhoon. It slowed and began to re-intensify as it continued westward, and at 0530UTC on December 16 the northern portion of the outer eyewall of Paka passed over the island of Rota; 20minutes later, the southern portion of the inner wall cloud moved across northern Guam. As it tracked through the Rota Channel, the center of Paka passed about 8km (5mi) north of the northern tip of Guam, its closest approach to the island.|$|E
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{period of}} rapid deepening began early on September30 as a well-defined eye became clearly visible on satellite imagery. Ophelia intensified into a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h) by 0600UTC {{and became the}} season's third major hurricane—a Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale—twelve hours later. Cloud tops continued to cool in the system's eyewall late on October1, with cloud tops in <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system warming. Ophelia intensified into a Category4 hurricane at 0000UTC on October2 and simultaneously attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 940mb (hPa; 27.76inHg) as it passed east of Bermuda. Weakening ensued the following day as the hurricane entered cooler sea surface temperatures and an environment characterized by significantly more stable air. Ophelia weakened below major hurricane intensity by 1800UTC and became a tropical storm for the final time by 0600UTC on October3. The system lost its tropical characteristics and was subsequently declared an extratropical cyclone four hours later while positioned just southwest of Newfoundland. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger weather system by the afternoon hours of the following day.|$|E
5|$|Book Four, The Alchemist, {{takes place}} in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid, {{attempts}} to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone (which supposedly can turn Lead into Gold), but his fraud is uncovered and his hand is chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with Alchemy (the prevailing belief of the scholars of the time) and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books (which come to Samarkand via the trade routes {{from all over the}} known world). However, his friends Iwang (a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician) and Bahram (a Sufi blacksmith) instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims in the books and thus see if there is any true wisdom to be gained. They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly improve knowledge of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create the scientific method. Their discoveries create interest (and alarm) amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East.|$|E
