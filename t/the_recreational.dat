5|$|Recreational diver {{training}} and dive leading are industry regulated in some countries, and only directly regulated by {{government in a}} subset of them. In the UK, HSE legislation includes recreational diver {{training and}} dive leading for reward; in the US and South Africa industry regulation is accepted, though non-specific health and safety legislation still applies. In Israel recreational diving activities are regulated by <b>the</b> <b>Recreational</b> Diving Act, 1979.|$|E

In 1938, the Department of Physical Education was established and Physical education became a specialty area for high school teachers.|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} {{to hold the line}} only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Recreational</b> Dive Planner (or RDP) {{is a set}} {{of devices}} marketed by PADI with which no-stop time {{underwater}} can be calculated. The RDP was developed by DSAT and was the first dive table developed exclusively for recreational, no stop diving. There are four types of RDPs: the original table version first introduced in 1988, The Wheel version, the original electronic version or eRDP introduced in 2005 and the latest electronic multi-level version or eRDPML introduced in 2008.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the tenders were submitted, it turned out only NSB, DSB and Veolia had chosen bid. The tender was won by NSB Anbud on 30 May 2005, wanting NOK 70 million {{annually}} for the contract, ten million less than with the former agreement. After the contract was won, NSB Anbud announced the schedule for the Gjøvik Line. The number of train services would increase by 40%. Three stations serving <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> area Nordmarka outside Oslo would be dropped—Elnes, Stryken and Bjørgeseter. Skogsholm tried to make an agreement with NSB to not abandon all the stations, but since this had not {{been part of the}} PSO tender, an agreement could not be made and the service was canceled.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E

5|$|Many U.S. state {{fish and}} game {{departments}} allow non-commercial taking of painted turtles under a creel limit, and require a fishing (sometimes hunting) license; others completely forbid <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> capture of painted turtles. Trapping is not allowed in Oregon, where western painted turtle populations are in decline, and in Missouri, where there are populations of both southern and western subspecies. In Canada, Ontario protects both subspecies present, the midland and western, and British Columbia protects its dwindling western painted turtles.|$|E
5|$|North of Ullevål stadion, {{just before}} {{reaching}} Berg, the Ring Line with services 3 and 4 branches off. The Ring Line serves three stations, Nydalen, Storo and Sinsen {{before reaching the}} Grorud Line. From Berg to Tåsen, the line runs parallel to the motorway Ring 3. North of Berg, the Sognsvann Line mainly serves residential areas, including student dormitories at Sogn and Kringsjå. The Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the National Archival Services of Norway is served by Sognsvann Station. The station also serves <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> area Nordmarka and the lake Sognsvann.|$|E
5|$|Only 4.46% of <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> diving {{fatalities}} in a 1997 {{study were}} attributable {{to a single}} contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose {{as a result of}} a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E

5|$|Pelicans {{have been}} persecuted by humans for their {{perceived}} competition for fish, {{despite the fact}} that their diet overlaps little with fish caught by people. Starting in the 1880s, American white pelicans were clubbed and shot, their eggs and young were deliberately destroyed, and their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by water management schemes and wetland drainage. Even in the 21st century, an increase in the population of American white pelicans in south-eastern Idaho in the US was seen to threaten <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> cutthroat trout fishery there, leading to official attempts to reduce pelican numbers through systematic harassment and culling.|$|E
5|$|Ranch Road 1 is {{classified}} by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) as a Ranch Road, {{and is the}} only highway in the state to be currently categorized as so. The route is not officially part of the state's Farm and Ranch to Market Road System, although it is considered similar to the Farm to Market Road system. RR 1 is signed with a shield similar to a Ranch to Market Road. The highway fits almost perfectly with <b>the</b> <b>Recreational</b> Road classification, but is not considered part of the system.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of the most liberal cities in the United States, even surpassing its neighbor, Portland, Oregon. In the 2012 U.S. general election, a majority of Seattleites voted to approve Referendum 74 and legalize gay marriage in Washington state. In the same election, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> use of cannabis in the state. Like much of the Pacific Northwest (which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism), church attendance, religious belief, and political influence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of America.|$|E

5|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a work relief {{program for}} young men from {{unemployed}} families, established in 1933. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, {{it was designed to}} combat unemployment during the Great Depression. The CCC operated in every U.S. state. <b>The</b> <b>recreational</b> development of the park began in 1933, when four CCC camps were built in Sullivan County. One of these, CCC Camp S-95, built many of the park facilities, such as the dam for the swimming area, the cabins, hiking trails and roads. The CCC workers blasted out bedrock in the creek for the swimming area and built the Canyon Vista road and lookout.|$|E
5|$|The Omaha Belt Line {{was formed}} in 1883 by the Union Pacific; some shady {{dealings}} by Jay Gould brought the Belt Line into {{the control of the}} Missouri Pacific Railroad by 1885, when it was constructed with Union Pacific materials {{under the control of the}} MoPac. Stations along with Line included the Florence Depot, Webster Street Station and the Ralston Station. Operated by that company until the early 1960s, today the Line is largely abandoned, with a section redeveloped into <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> MoPac Trail.|$|E
5|$|The line {{opened on}} 10 October 1934 {{as a light}} rail. In 1993, it was {{upgraded}} to metro standard as the first light rail west of Oslo, with two stations being closed. The Ring Line opened in 2003. Forskningsparken has transfer to the Oslo Tramway and serves Rikshospitalet. Forskningsparken and Blindern both serve the University of Oslo, while Ullevål stadion serves Norway's largest football venue. North of there the line mainly serves residential areas. Sognsvann serves the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and <b>the</b> <b>recreational</b> area Nordmarka.|$|E
