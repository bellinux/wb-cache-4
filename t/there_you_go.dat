500|$|While {{returning}} to Hershel's farm, Shane stares at a walker {{in an abandoned}} field. Kirkman stated the walker symbolizes the growing scope of the zombie virus. [...] "We're really just trying to show {{that that kind of}} thing is inescapable," [...] he said. [...] "You're just driving down the street, you look over and, 'Oh, <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> there’s a zombie.' We're trying to show that this world {{is becoming more and more}} populated by zombies. Our thinking is that large population centers like Atlanta are really where the heart of this began and as [...] moved out to Hershel’s farm they didn’t really encounter very many walkers because they are moving out of the city center at a faster rate than the zombie population. And that zombie population is starting to catch up with them. The area is starting to become more and more dense with walkers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Survival {{published}} the book <b>There</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go!</b> (Oren Ginzburg), which depicted a tribal society being harmed by development. In the book's foreword, Stephen Corry wrote: [...] "The 'development' of tribal peoples against their wishes – really to let others get {{their land and}} resources – is rooted in 19th century colonialism ('We know best') dressed up in 20th century 'political correct' euphemism. Tribal peoples are not backward: they are independent and vibrant societies which, {{like all of us}} always, are constantly adapting to a changing world. The main difference between tribal peoples and us is that we take their land and resources, and believe the dishonest, even racist, claim that it's for their own good. It's conquest, not development. If you really want to understand what's going on, read this book." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That sounds {{easy and}} {{satisfactory}} enough, Dick," [...] Mr Humphreys said, laughing; [...] "but {{one does not}} jump into these things in a moment. <b>There,</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> off to bed, and I will talk the matter further over with Mr Harvey." ...|$|E
