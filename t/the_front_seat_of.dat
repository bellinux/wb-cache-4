Harris was required to attend anger management classes where, again, he made a favorable impression.

You changed the outcome by measuring it", a reference to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In the season six episode [...] "Law and Oracle", Fry and the robot peace officer URL track down a traffic violator who turns out to be Erwin Schrödinger, the 20th-century quantum physicist. On <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the car is a box, and when questioned about the contents, Schrödinger replies [...] "A cat, some poison, and a cesium atom". Fry asks if the cat is alive or dead, and Schrödinger answers [...] "It's a superposition of both states until you open the box and collapse the wave function." [...] When Fry opens the box, the cat jumps out and attacks him. The run is a reference to the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment of quantum mechanics. The series makes passing references to quantum chromodynamics (the appearance of Strong Force-brand glue), computer science (two separate books in a closet labeled P and NP respectively, referring to the possibility that P and NP-complete problem classes are distinct), electronics (an X-ray— or more accurately, an [...] "F-ray"— of Bender's head reveals a 6502 microprocessor), and genetics (a mention of Bender's [...] "robo- or R-NA"). The show often features subtle references to classic science fiction.
