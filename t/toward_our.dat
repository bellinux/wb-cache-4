25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement <b>toward</b> <b>our</b> viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.|$|E

In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay in bed for a week. And do you know why he is like that? He told me. The pogibaoci [...] from surrounding villages drive the clouds <b>toward</b> <b>our</b> village, and Petar will not let hail beat us.

2500|$|Commentators have in {{the late}} 20th and early 21st centuries stated that {{contemporary}} Canadians had and have a poor understanding of the Canadian monarchy, Michael D. Jackson saying in his book The Crown and Canadian Federalism that {{this is part of}} a wider ignorance about Canadian civics. While David Smith researched for his 1995 book The Invisible Crown, he found it difficult to [...] "find anyone who could talk knowledgeably about the subject". Former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson said there is [...] "an abysmal lack of knowledge about the system" [...] and Senator Lowell Murray wrote in 2003: [...] "The Crown has become irrelevant to most Canadian's understanding of our system of Government", which he attributed to the [...] "fault of successive generations of politicians, of an educational system that has never given the institution due study, and of past viceregal incumbents themselves". These comments were echoed by teacher and author Nathan Tidridge, who asserted that, beginning in the 1960s, the role of the Crown disappeared from provincial education curricula, as the general subject of civics came to receive less attention. He said Canadians are being [...] "educated to be illiterate, ambivalent, or even hostile <b>toward</b> <b>our</b> constitutional monarchy". Michael Valpy also pointed to the fact that [...] "The crown's role in the machinery of Canada's constitutional monarchy rarely sees daylight. Only a handful of times in our history has it been subjected to glaring sunshine, unfortunately resulting in a black hole of public understanding as to how it works." [...] He later iterated: [...] "the public's attention span on the constitutional intricacies of the monarchy is clinically short".|$|E
