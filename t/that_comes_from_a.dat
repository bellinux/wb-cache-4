5|$|The {{spectrum}} of light <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for {{features in the}} spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the {{spectrum of}} various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If {{the same pattern of}} intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E

25|$|The first root <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{plant is}} called the radicle. A root's four major {{functions}} are 1) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, 2) anchoring of the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, 3) storage of food and nutrients, 4) vegetative reproduction and competition with other plants. In response to the concentration of nutrients, roots also synthesise cytokinin, which acts as a signal as to how fast the shoots can grow. Roots often function in storage of food and nutrients. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi to form mycorrhizae, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria also closely associate with roots.|$|E

500|$|On its {{original}} release in March 1995, The Beacon Street Collection was only available in local record stores in Orange County, California and at No Doubt's shows. Its rawer sound proved {{popular with the}} band's fans and the band's first batch of one thousand copies sold out within {{only a few months}} after its release. Interscope realized the band's potential and allowed them to record their third album, Tragic Kingdom in various Los Angeles studios, [...] "wherever they could get a deal on a studio". During a recording session, the band was introduced to Paul Palmer, who was interested in mixing the new album. He owned his own record label Trauma Records, which was associated with Interscope. Interscope willingly sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1995 and Tragic Kingdom got the personal focus <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> small company.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, her {{performance}} opposite Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro in director Alejandro González Iñárritu's 2003 drama 21 Grams earned Watts an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress later that year. In the story, told in a non-lineal manner, she portrayed Cristina Peck, a grief-stricken woman living a suburban {{life after the}} killing {{of her husband and}} two children by Jack Jordan (Benicio del Toro), who started a relationship with the critically ill academic mathematician Paul Rivers (Sean Penn). She said of the nomination, [...] "It's far beyond what I ever dreamed for – that would have been too far fetched". She also was nominated for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, as well as many other nominations and acclaim. The New York Times praised her: [...] "Because Ms. Watts reinvents herself with each performance, it's easy to forget how brilliant she is. She has a boldness <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lack of overemphasis, something actresses sometimes do to keep up with Mr. Penn". The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Watts is riveting, but she's much better in scenes of extreme emotion than in those requiring subtlety." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to its {{balanced}} {{statistics and}} ability to learn any move <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Technical or Hidden Machine, Mew is {{regarded as one of}} the best Pokémon in Red, Blue, and Yellow. Studies on the impact of fictional characters on children, such as those in Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon, have noted Mew as popular with younger female children who tend to be drawn to [...] "cute" [...] characters; Mewtwo in comparison was described as a polar opposite, popular with older male children who tend to be drawn to [...] "tough or scary" [...] characters. The book Media and the Make-believe Worlds of Children noted a similar comparison, describing Mew as [...] "child-like and gentle, combining characteristics of power and cuteness" [...] and emphasizing the importance of the contrast for children between it and Mewtwo, and its role as a source of appeal for the character. IGN listed Mew as one of the best Psychic types, alongside Mewtwo, Alakazam, and Starmie. They called it a good contender to Mewtwo, as well as an unpredictable Pokémon due to its ability to use any TM or HMs, items that teach Pokémon attacks.|$|E
500|$|In the Zone {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. It holds {{a score of}} sixty-six out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on thirteen critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Jason Shawhan of About.com gave a positive review, saying that while the album's vibe is sexy, {{the result is a}} personal statement from Spears. He also added, [...] "T's another thing about Spears' new record, as none of her previous albums ever managed to produce any kind of sustained emotional response than the pleasure <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> good pop record. I miss Max Martin, for sure, but it feels like Ms. S. has been paying attention to La Ciccone. To put it another way, this is Britney's True Blue." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that the album [...] " [...] all club-ready, but despite some hints of neo-electro and the Neptunes, it doesn't quite sound modern—it sounds like cuts from 1993 or Madonna's Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light. Production-wise, these tracks are not only accomplished but much more varied than any of her previous albums." [...] Ruth Mitchell of BBC Online called [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] the best track of the album, but added, [...] "Sadly, her attempts to prove her new-found maturity are what overwhelm and cloud all that is good about In The Zone." [...] Mim Udovitch of Blender commented, [...] "This I’m-coming-out record is an unhesitant move from songs of the heart to songs of the groin [...] No longer a girl, freed from slavery, now fully a woman, she makes a pretty convincing mistress." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] the best and most straightforward moments of the album, but added that [...] "On a CD intended to celebrate her lurch into adulthood, Spears remains distant and submerged. For all her freedom, she's still finding her way." ...|$|E
