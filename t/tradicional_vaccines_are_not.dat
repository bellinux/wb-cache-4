25|$|The {{following}} <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> recommended due {{either to}} lack of evidence of effectiveness or to a high chance of adverse reaction.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>vaccines</b> must <b>be</b> {{stored at}} low temperatures, some below -15°C, and others between 2 and 8°C. If <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> stored {{correctly}} they can lose their effectiveness.|$|R
50|$|Prevention {{involves}} avoiding tick bites. A <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> commercially available. Treatment {{is typically}} with supportive care. The medication ribavirin may also help.|$|R
50|$|M. bovis uses several {{different}} serotyped fimbriae as virulence factors, consequently pharmaceutical companies have exploited this to create vaccines. However, currently available <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> reliable.|$|R
50|$|Vaccination {{of young}} cattle {{can reduce the}} {{severity}} and incidence of disease. Multiple doses are required and are usually combined with other agents. The <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> available worldwide.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} some vaccine-preventable diseases, which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> on the WHO-list, {{probably}} either since the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> very good according to present standards, or the disease <b>is</b> <b>not</b> any longer a threat.|$|R
50|$|In USA : The CDC has {{indicated}} that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also called the nasal spray <b>vaccine,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recommended for the 2016-2017 flu season, in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{occurrence}} of serogroup X {{has been reported}} in North America, Europe, Australia, and West Africa. Current meningoccocal meningitis <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> known to protect against serogroup X N. meningitidis disease.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{two months}} of University of Wollongong {{publishing}} the thesis {{it was reported that}} Wilyman was claiming her [...] "PhD provides evidence that all <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> safe and effective and that the combined schedule of <b>vaccines</b> <b>is</b> doing more harm than good in the population through the increase in chronic illness".|$|R
50|$|It {{theoretically}} should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> given during pregnancy. However, {{more than}} a thousand women have <b>been</b> given the <b>vaccine</b> when they did not realize that they were pregnant and no negative outcomes occurred. Testing for pregnancy before giving the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> needed.|$|R
25|$|In the Gardasil {{clinical}} trials, 1,115 {{pregnant women}} received the HPV vaccine. Overall, {{the proportions of}} pregnancies with an adverse outcome were comparable in subjects who received Gardasil and subjects who received placebo. However, the clinical trials had a relatively small sample size. Currently, the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recommended for pregnant women. The long-term effects of the <b>vaccine</b> on fertility <b>are</b> <b>not</b> known, but no effects are anticipated.|$|R
50|$|HHS shall {{determine}} whether an anthrax <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> eligible {{to be provided}} to DHS for the program based on determinations that the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> otherwise allotted for other purposes {{and the provision of}} the vaccine will not reduce or otherwise adversely affect the capability to meet projected requirements for such product during a public health emergency.|$|R
5000|$|Leprosy: BCG has a {{protective}} effect against leprosy {{in the range}} of 26 to 41% based on controlled trials. The protective effect is somewhat larger based on case control and cohort studies—about 60%. [...] However BCG <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> used specifically to control leprosy.|$|R
50|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} the first dose of <b>vaccine</b> <b>be</b> given right after 6 weeks of age. Two or three doses {{more than a}} month apart should be given, depending on the vaccine administered. Because the majority of cases occur between six months and two years of age, the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recommended for use in children over two years of age.|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> generic {{products}} and it cannot {{be assumed that}} all such <b>vaccines</b> can <b>be</b> used in reduced doses {{in order to save}} costs. Any use of vaccines in an unlicensed manner should only be performed {{in the context of a}} study that is approved by the national control authority and appropriate ethical review committees...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>vaccine</b> against TBE <b>was</b> {{developed}} in 1937. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Per dose it costs between 50 and 70 British Pounds in the United Kingdom. The <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> available in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{surgical}} treatment {{may be helpful}} for issues related to scrotal elephantiasis and hydrocele. However, surgery is generally ineffective at correcting elephantiasis of the limbs. A <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet available but in 2013 the University of Illinois was reporting 95% efficacity in testing against B. malayi in mice.|$|R
40|$|In a {{comparison}} of dengue type 2 immune mouse ascitic fluid immunization schedules, a schedule in which adjuvant <b>vaccines</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> used produced neutralizing antibody titers that were specific and a mouse mortality rate that was lower, resulting in a greater yield of ascitic fluids. In the schedules in which emulsified adjuvant <b>vaccines</b> <b>were</b> used, {{the quality of the}} emulsion had little effect on antibody titer produced...|$|R
50|$|In May 2011, a new {{analysis}} initiated at Duke University {{showed that}} there is a 29% chance that the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> effective (although {{it must be noted that}} this posterior probability is very different conceptually from a p-value, and cannot be directly compared to the p=.04 from the original analysis).|$|R
40|$|This audit {{concluded}} that Illinois' preocurement of flu <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> adequately planned or monitored {{and led to}} financial liability for vaccine that the state did not receive.

50|$|The <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> {{injected}} either {{under the}} skin or into a muscle at least seven days before traveling to the typhoid-affected area (the CDC recommend 14 days). The <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> effective in {{children under the age}} of two; {{children under the age of}} two would normally have all their food regulated by their parents and should therefore be expected to be at low risk of exposure to typhoid.|$|R
5000|$|Coley's <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a <b>vaccine</b> in {{the usual}} sense, namely that it {{prevents}} an infection. Rather than that, it triggers infection-like reactions. However, Coley's vaccine may work like many ordinary vaccines: it induces an immune response, in this case against the cancer. In this sense, it predates current attempts to develop cancer vaccines.|$|R
50|$|Hib {{conjugate}} <b>vaccines</b> have <b>been</b> {{shown to}} be universally effective against all manifestations of Hib disease, with a clinical efficacy among fully vaccinated children estimated to be between 95-100%. The <b>vaccine</b> has also <b>been</b> {{shown to be}} immunogenic in patients {{at high risk of}} invasive disease. Hib <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> effective against non-type B Haemophilus influenzae. However, non-type B disease is rare in comparison to pre-vaccine Haemophilus influenzae type B disease.|$|R
40|$|Human papillomaviruses are {{the primary}} {{etiologic}} agents of cervical cancer. Thus, cervical cancer and other Human papillomavirus associated malignancies might be prevented by Human papillomavirus vaccines. Currently, two Human papillomavirus L 1 Virus-Like Particle vaccines namely Gardasil ®- quadrivalent (Merck) and Cervarix ™-bivalent (GlaxoSmithKline) are widely marketed internationally. These HPV <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> commercially available. The advisable period of Human papillomavirus vaccination is {{before the onset of}} sexual activity. Human papillomavirus <b>vaccines</b> should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> given to people who have experienced severe allergic reactions after a previous vaccine dose or to a component of the <b>vaccine.</b> These <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> recommended for use in pregnant females. The mechanisms by which these <b>vaccines</b> induce protections <b>are</b> <b>not</b> fully defined but involve both cellular immunity and neutralizing immunoglobulin G antibodies. This review brings up to date information on the two commercially available prophylactic Human papillomavirus vaccines...|$|R
50|$|Vaccination with inactivated {{trivalent}} influenza <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> {{cost saving}} relative to providing supportive care {{alone in the}} pregnant population, but a 2009 review {{concluded that there was}} insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of it during the first trimester of pregnancy. Inactivated <b>vaccines</b> for influenza <b>are</b> considered safe at any gestational age. On the other hand, live attenuated influenza vaccines such as the nasal spray <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recommended in pregnancy. Preservative-free <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> available in case of hypersensitivity to eggs or to vaccine components.|$|R
25|$|As of 2016 {{there is}} no commercially {{available}} <b>vaccine</b> that <b>is</b> effective for hantavirus. A vaccine known as Hantavax has been under study since 1990. As of 2016, the development is in clinical phase 3 trial stage. This inactivated <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> thought <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> effective against European hantaviruses like the Puumala (PUUV) virus. There is no FDA approved vaccine available and a killed-virus <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> being pursued because of the dangers associated with mass production under high containment {{as well as the}} unresolved questions about the efficiency of the vaccine. However, a number of labs have been working towards a vaccine that would deliver viral antigens by either DNA vectors or as recombinant proteins. While these recombinant <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> being developed they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> currently available nor will they be in the near future.|$|R

The protective effect is somewhat larger based on case control and cohort studies—about 60%. [...] However BCG <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> used specifically to control leprosy. Further, BCG does not protect from the reactivation of latent tuberculosis.|$|R
50|$|Children in {{some areas}} of India are weaker and often had diarrhoea, which reduced the {{efficiency}} of the vaccine. Open defecation, monsoon flooding, and a lack of water treatment made it easier for a child to swallow more polio virus. As a result, children with too few doses of <b>vaccine</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> fully protected and sometimes got polio.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Ammann {{left his}} {{position}} at UCSF {{in order to}} work with the biotechnology firm, Genentech. There he developed clinical products focused on HIV/AIDS, and although while with Genentech a successful <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> developed, the discoveries made by Ammann's research team were used by other researchers in a partially successful study performed in Thailand in 2009.|$|R
40|$|Live <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{safe for}} {{immuno-compromised}} patients and should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> given {{to patients with}} systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition, all <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> recommended for systemic lupus erythematosus patients when their disease is very active and mainly for patients with very active lupus nephritis. Systemic lupus erythematosus patients with quiescent or mildly active disease {{should be encouraged to}} receive vaccination according the recommen-dations given by the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee. Among this group of systemic lupus erythematosus patients, <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> safe and they do not affect the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus including renal features, disease activity, or the requirement for steroids or cytotoxic drugs. However, vaccines may trigger the generation of autoantibodies which is usually short term and has no clinical significance. In individual cases vaccines exacerbate systemic lupus erythematosus; however, no specific clinical or lab-oratory variables have been identified to be associated with flare of systemic lupus erythema-tosus following vaccination.

50|$|While {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> highly reactogenic, and causes motor neuron death in mice, {{there is no clear}} evidence or epidemiological studies on Gulf War veterans linking the vaccine to Gulf War Syndrome. Combining this with the lack of symptoms from current deployments of individuals who have received the vaccine led the Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses to conclude that the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a likely cause of Gulf War illness for most ill veterans.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{bluetongue}} virus serotype 8 (BTV- 8) epidemic in Western Europe struck hard.
