50|$|Symphurus thermophilus is {{a species}} of tonguefish notable for being the only {{flatfish}} known to be an obligate inhabitant of hydrothermal vents. It is known from several widely dispersed locations in the western Pacific Ocean and occurs in great numbers. They are tolerant of harsh conditions and are often found in close association with elemental sulfur, including molten sulfur pools that exceed 180°C in temperature. As they are not significantly different in appearance and feeding habits from other <b>tonguefishes,</b> they {{are thought to be}} relatively recent colonizers of vent ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tonguefishes</b> are {{flatfishes}} in {{the family}} Cynoglossidae. They are distinguished {{by the presence of}} a long hook on the snout overhanging the mouth, and the absence of pectoral fins. Their eyes are both {{on the left side of}} their bodies, which also lack a pelvic fin. This family has three genera with a total of more than 140 species. The largest reaches a length of 66 cm, though most species only reach half that size or less. They are found in tropical and subtropical oceans, mainly in shallow waters and estuaries, though a few species found in deep sea floors, and a few in rivers.|$|E

50|$|Like other <b>tonguefishes,</b> S. thermophilus has a {{laterally}} flattened {{body with}} united dorsal, caudal, and anal fins. Both eyes, which are fairly large and rounded in this species, {{are located on}} the left side of the head in adults. The pectoral fins and lateral line are absent, and there is only a single, right-side pelvic fin. The head is moderately long, with a blunt snout and long, broadly arched jaws. There are 4-5 rows of teeth on the upper and lower jaws of the blind side, and 2-3 and 1 rows on upper and lower jaws respectively of the eyed side. The teeth are sharp and recurved, and better developed on the blind-side jaws.|$|E
50|$|Careful {{examination}} allows A. lineatus {{and other}} right-eyed achirids to {{be distinguished from}} all co-occurring flatfish of the families Bothidae (lefteye flounders) and Cynoglossidae (<b>tonguefishes),</b> {{all of which have}} the left side up. The right-eyed flounders of family Pleuronectidae typically inhabit colder waters than A. lineatus. Within the Achiridae, the absence of vertical body bars should be sufficient to distinguish A. lineatus from three co-occurring species, the naked sole (Gymnachirus melas) and fringed sole (G. texae). The lined sole is sometimes confused with the hogchoker, (Trinectes maculatus) which is distinguished (at over 15 mm total length) by the latter's total lack of pectoral fin rays. Lined sole are also easily differentiated from scrawled sole (Trinectes inscriptus), whose side-up body is covered by a network of irregular dark lines.|$|E
50|$|The river has {{frequently}} suffered from human intervention, {{as seen in}} the dredging of its bottom, the building of docks on both banks and especially in the Deusto canal, an artificial waterway dug between 1950 and 1968 in the district of Deusto as a lateral canal, with the aim of facilitating navigation, sparing ships from the natural curves of the estuary. The project was stopped with 400 m left to complete, and it was decided to leave it as a dock. However, in 2007, a plan was approved to continue the canal and form the island of Zorrozaurre. This human intervention has also brought negative results in the quality of the water, after decades of toxic waste dumping causing a situation of anoxia (lack of oxygen), which almost eliminated the entire fauna and flora. However, in recent years this situation is being reversed, thanks to a dumping ban and natural regeneration. now it is possible to observe algae, <b>tonguefishes,</b> crabs, and seabirds, as well as occasional bathers in the summer months.|$|E

40|$|Feeding ecology was {{compared}} {{among the three}} <b>tonguefishes</b> Cynoglossus abbreviatus, C. joyneri and C. robustus, collected from Seto Inland Sea, Japan, from June 2000 to May 2001. They are benthivores, consuming mainly gammarid amphipods, shrimps, crabs, gastropods, bivalves and ophiuroids. C. abbreviatus consumed greater proportions of ophiuroids whereas C. joyneri and C. robustus ate more amphipods and shrimps. While C. abbreviatus consumed mostly ophiuroids in all size classes, the diets of C. joyneri and C. robustus showed ontogenetic changes in feeding habits; smaller individuals of C. joyneri and C. robustus consumed gammarid amphipods, whereas larger C. joyneri ate shrimps and gastropods, and larger C. robustus fed mainly on gastropods, crabs, bivalves and polychaetes. Cluster analysis based on diet similarities emphasized that the three Cynoglossus species could be categorized on a size-related basis into three feeding groups: smaller C. joyneri and C. rubustus (25 cm TL) as group B, whereas C. abbreviatus was categorized as group C. This means that some degree of resource partitioning can occur among the three Cynoglossus species. The seasonal changes in the diets were also significant for the three Cynoglossus species. 12 page(s...|$|E
