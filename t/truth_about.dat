40|$|Presentists, {{who believe}} that only present objects exist, face a problem {{concerning}} <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the past. Presentists should (but cannot) locate truth-makers for <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the past. What can presentists say in response? We identify two rival factions: ‘upstanding’ and ‘nefarious’ presentists. Upstanding presentists aim to meet the challenge, positing presently existing truth-makers for <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the past; nefarious presentists aim to shirk their responsibilities, using the language of truth-maker theory but without paying any ontological price. We argue that presentists should be nefarious presentists...|$|R

40|$|Constructivists {{hold that}} <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> {{practical}} reasons {{are to be}} {{explained in terms of}} <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the correct exercise of practical reason (rather than vice versa). But what is the normative status of the correctness-defining standards of practical reason? The problem is that constructivism appears to presuppose the truth of two theses that seem hard to reconcile. First, for constructivism to be remotely plausible, the relevant standards must be genuinely (and not merely formally or minimally) normative. Second, to avoid circularity, the relevant standards must be non-reason-involving, i. e. prior to and independent of practical reasons. From the standpoint of the contemporary philosophy of normatively, this is a surprising combination to say the least. What could these genuinely normative but non-reason-involving standards possibly be? The standard constructivist response is to insist that the relevant standards possess a special kind of necessity inasmuch as we only count as occupying the “deliberative standpoint” or as a “deliberative agent” insofar as we comply with or accept the relevant standards. I offer a different response. My response holds that the special normative status of the relevant standards consists in their exhibiting a distinctive kind of practical necessity that derives from the fact that they determine what I have called elsewhere <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> “the thing to do” – namely, <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> correct answers {{to the question of what}} to do. Understanding the norms of practical reason in these terms vindicates the idea that standards of practical reason are genuinely normative since <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the thing to do plausibly possess the hallmarks of genuine normativity. And it vindicates the idea that the standards are not reason-involving since <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the thing to do are plausibly prior to and independent of <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> practical reasons...|$|R

40|$|Defenders of the Knowledge Argument {{contend that}} {{physical}}ism is false because knowing all the physical truths {{is not sufficient}} to know all the <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the world.

This dissertation is a defense of the Knowledge Argument. Chapter one characterizes what physicalism is and provides support for the claim that if knowing all the physical truths {{is not sufficient to}} know all the <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the world, then physicalism is false. In chapter two, I defend the claim that knowing all the physical truths is not sufficient for knowing all the <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the world.
