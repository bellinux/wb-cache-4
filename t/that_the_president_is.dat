5|$|On Spectrum's {{airborne}} headquarters, Cloudbase, Spectrum commander-in-chief Colonel White {{concludes that}} Brown was a traitor and was concealing a bomb on his person. Unaware of the Mysterons' subversion of his officers, he orders Scarlet's reconstruction {{to fly the}} President to a second Maximum Security Building in London. When {{the body of the}} original Brown is discovered {{at the scene of the}} SPC crash, it dawns on White <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> in the hands of an impostor, and that the person whom he believed to be Scarlet is not human. Ignoring instructions to return to Cloudbase, with his Spectrum Jet under fire from the Angel fighter squadron, the Scarlet duplicate ejects himself and the President over southern England; on the ground, both the duplicate and the President, the latter being held hostage, set off towards London in a stolen car.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of East Timor states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> the supreme {{commander of the}} defence force and {{has the power to}} appoint the F-FDTL's commander and chief of staff. The Council of Ministers and National Parliament are responsible for funding the F-FDTL and setting policy relating to East Timor's security. Cirilo José Cristovão serves as the current minister of Defence and Security, and Julio Tomas Pinto is the Secretary of State for Defense. Both men were sworn into these roles on 8 August 2012. A Superior Council for Defence and Security was established in 2005 to advise the president on defence and security policy and legislation and the appointment and dismissal of senior military personnel. The council is chaired by the president and includes the prime minister, the defence, justice, interior and foreign affairs ministers, the heads of the F-FDTL and PNTL a national state security officer and three representatives from the national parliament. The council's role is not clear, however, and neither it nor the parliament served as a check against the decision to sack large numbers of F-FDTL personnel in 2006. A parliamentary committee also provides oversight of East Timor's security sector. Major General Lere Anan Timor is the current commander of the F-FDTL, and was appointed to this position on 6 October 2011.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, it was {{reported}} that an aide to Steven Chu, the US Energy Secretary, had fallen ill from the virus after helping arrange President Barack Obama's trip to Mexico. However, the White House stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> not at risk of obtaining the flu.|$|E

5000|$|<b>That</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> should <b>be</b> elected {{directly}} by the people, rather than by Parliament; that a position of Vice-President <b>be</b> established; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> Vice-President and Cabinet no longer be susceptible to removal from office by a parliamentary vote of no confidence; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>be</b> a natural-born citizen, thus barring naturalised citizens from this office.|$|R
50|$|Although Ari Fleischer insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> in no danger, The Capitol Police {{took the}} matter seriously as {{a breach of}} security.|$|R
25|$|The {{constitution}} states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> {{an elected}} office, {{there is no}} directly elected presidential line of succession. If the President is unable to execute his/her powers and duties, the Marshal of the Sejm will have the powers of a President for a maximum of 60 days until elections are called.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr {{resigned}} {{as well in}} support of the anti-government protesters. The presidency rejected the Egyptian Army's 48-hour ultimatum vowing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> sticking with his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. Defense Minister General Abdul Fatah al-Sisi was also said to have told Morsi that he would impose a military solution if a political one could not be found by the next day.|$|E
25|$|FairVote {{supports}} {{modification of}} state laws governing the Electoral College so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> elected by national popular vote. FairVote advocates the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an agreement among {{states and the}} District of Columbia to award their electoral votes to the candidate with the highest popular vote total in all 50 states and DC. FairVote has played {{an active role in}} lobbying state officials to join the compact. New York Assemblyman Fred Thiele said he first proposed New York's entrance into the compact after being approached by FairVote.|$|E

5000|$|In recent times, on August 14, 2009, an 11-year-old TV reporter, Damon Weaver, from South Florida interviewed President Barack Obama and {{declared}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> now his [...] "homeboy".|$|R
25|$|In contrast, the Taoiseach {{created in}} 1937 {{possesses}} {{a much more}} powerful role. He can both advise the President to dismiss ministers and dissolve Parliament on his own authority—advice <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> almost always required to follow by convention. His role is greatly enhanced because under the Constitution, he is both de jure and de facto chief executive. In most other parliamentary democracies, {{the head of state}} is at least the nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In Ireland, however, executive power is explicitly vested in the Government, of which the Taoiseach is the leader.|$|E
25|$|Under Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, {{the vice}} president, in {{conjunction}} with a majority of the Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> unable to discharge the presidential powers and duties. If this occurs, then the vice president will assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president; however, the president can declare that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties. If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim, it is up to Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in session, to decide the merit of the claim.|$|E
500|$|The Marine Corps {{would not}} receive the {{authorization}} from Congress for brevet promotions until 1814 stating [...] "... <b>That</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> hereby authorized to confer brevet rank on such officers of the Marine Corps as shall distinguish themselves by gallant actions and meritorious conduct or shall have served ten years in any one grade...".|$|E

5000|$|Photos {{taken after}} the third presidential debate fuel the [...] "Bush bulge" [...] theory, which started with photos taken during the second presidential debate, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> wearing a radio {{receiver}} and was fed his lines.|$|R
50|$|In July 1974 the Committee, by a bi-partisan vote, {{voted to}} {{recommend}} to the House of Representatives <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>be</b> impeached. Shortly thereafter, in August 1974, President Nixon resigned. After <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> resignation Nussbaum rejoined his law firm.|$|R
500|$|Should the Vice President and a {{majority}} of the Cabinet believe the President is still [...] "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office", they may within four days of the President's declaration submit another declaration <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> incapacitated. If not already in session, the Congress must then assemble within 48 hours. The Congress has 21 days to decide the issue. If within the 21 days two-thirds of each house of Congress vote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> incapacitated, the Vice President would [...] "continue" [...] to be Acting President. Should the Congress resolve the issue in favor of the President, or make no decision within the 21 days allotted, then the President would [...] "resume" [...] discharging the powers and duties of his office. The use of the words [...] "continue" [...] and [...] "resume" [...] imply that the Vice President remains Acting President while Congress deliberates.|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} film adaptation, {{directed}} by Venezuelan Rómulo Guardia Granier and produced by RCTV (Radio Caracas Televisión Internacional), {{was released in}} November 2007 and is the first film produced by RCTV in more than twentyyears. This version paints {{the picture of a}} hopeless love story—one that is unable to succeed under the terrorizing and corrupt dictatorship. [...] It therefore plays up what is only hinted at in the novel itself, the possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> driven at least in part by sexual desire.|$|E
500|$|On March 6–7, 2013, Paul {{engaged in}} a {{filibuster}} to delay voting on the nomination of John O. Brennan as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Paul questioned the Obama administration's use of drones and the stated legal justification for their potential use within the United States. Paul held the floor for 12 hours and 52 minutes. He ceded to several Republican senators and Democratic senator, Ron Wyden, who generally also questioned drone usage. Paul said his purpose was to challenge drone policy in general and specifically as it related to noncombatants on U.S. soil. He requested a pledge from the Administration that noncombatants would not be targeted on U.S. soil. Attorney General Eric Holder responded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> not authorized to deploy extrajudicial punishment without due process, against non-combatant citizens. Paul answered that he was [...] "quite happy" [...] with the response. The filibuster was ended with a cloture vote of 81 to 16, and Brennan was confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 63 to 34.|$|E
5000|$|NAACP {{president}} Cornell William Brooks said Trump's second statement {{stuck to}} a [...] "rhetorical minimum" [...] of a condemnation, and [...] "gave <b>the</b> impression <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to have}} his hate {{cake and eat it}} too".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{committee}} proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>be</b> {{required to}} appoint {{one or more}} vice-presidents within 60 days of taking office, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> shall determine them and of the vice-president. If the vice-president is dismissed from office, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> must appoint a replacement.|$|R
50|$|Adam Burch, a {{minister}} in Washington, D.C., whose parishioners include <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of <b>the</b> United States, sometimes tailors his sermons specifically for <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> {{only to learn}} later <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> unable to attend services that day. Scolded to speak for all rather than to one, Rev. Burch gives the sermon of his life, and then learns to his surprise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> present on <b>that</b> day and heard every word. Miss Coleman, a school teacher in San Francisco, discovers that her pupil Joey needs glasses. Joey's father, Mr. Esposito, believes they are not necessary and will only bring Joey ridicule from his peers. In the end, it is the father who learns an important lesson.|$|R
500|$|Asturias blurs the {{separation}} {{between dream and reality}} throughout , {{making it one of the}} novel's most prominent themes. Latin American writer and critic Ariel Dorfman notes that the mixing of dream and reality is partly a result of Asturias's frequent use of figurative language. This stylistic choice is reflected in the content of the story itself, which suggests that an important effect of dictatorial power is the blurring of dreams and reality. Dorfman also notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> sustained by fear, which further blurs the distinction between reality and dream. This fear grants him the voluntary or involuntary support of others, enabling the President to exercise his mandates. Dorfman asserts that the President's use of fear elevates his mandates to legends. These legends are then able to [...] "impose itself upon reality because men live it fully in a way to make sense of their humanity". One example of this theme, elucidated by Eckart, is a series of scenes leading to the arrest of the lawyer Carvajal. When the President decides to blame Carvajal for the murder of Colonel Sonriente, it is clear that Carvajal is confounded by the charges. Moreover, despite being a lawyer, Carvajal is unable to defend himself during the sham trial with [...] "the members of the tribunal so drunk that they cannot hear him". As Eckart asserts, [...] "to be captured and tortured without ever knowing why is another horrible feature of a dictatorship. For the victim, reality unexpectedly becomes unreality, no longer comprehensible by a logical mind." [...] Therefore, the use of fear by a dictatorship blurs the line between reality and dream for the people being ruled.|$|E
2500|$|Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele {{released}} a statement through his spokesperson saying, [...] "Chairman Steele believes {{that this is an}} unnecessary distraction and believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> a U.S. citizen".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{landmark}} decision Nixon v. General Services Administration, Justice William Rehnquist, afterwards the Chief Justice, [...] declared in his dissent {{the need to}} [...] "fully describe the preeminent position that the President of the United States occupies with respect to our Republic. Suffice it to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him {{as well as the}} duties imposed upon him are indeed a powerful and incredible responsibility but as well as a great honor." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the week}} {{prior to the}} game against Panathinaikos, the club was {{disrupted}} when the directors complained to <b>the</b> police <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> embezzling funds. He was remanded in custody and forced to resign, eventually being released by the police without charges.|$|R
2500|$|It is well {{established}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> constitutionally charged with protecting information relating to national security. As the Supreme Court has stated, [...] "the authority to protect such information falls upon the President {{as the head of}} the Executive Branch and as Commander in Chief." [...] The state secrets privilege is not a mere [...] "common law" [...] privilege. Instead the courts have long recognized the privilege has a firm foundation in the Constitution as was noted in United States v. Nixon [...] where the Supreme Court noted the claim of privilege [...] "relates to the effective discharge of the President's powers, it is constitutionally based." ...|$|E
2500|$|The President can {{be removed}} from office in two ways, neither of which has ever been invoked. The Supreme Court, in a sitting of at least five judges, may find the President [...] "permanently incapacitated", while the Oireachtas may remove the President for [...] "stated misbehaviour". [...] Either house of the Oireachtas may {{instigate}} the latter process by passing an impeachment resolution, provided at least thirty members move it and at least two thirds support it. The other house will then either investigate the stated charges or commission a body to do so; following which at least two thirds of members must agree both <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> guilty and that the charges warrant removal.|$|E
2500|$|However, Shanmugam {{expressed}} {{the view that}} where an issue concerns the discretionary powers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> explicitly endowed with, such as fiscal reserves and appointment of key public holders, it is appropriate for the President to speak up publicly even without the Cabinet's sanction. This {{is in line with}} the views expressed in Parliament in 1999 by Goh Chok Tong on Ong Teng Cheong's press conference. Goh said: [...] "We should not regard it as unusual for the President to publicly acknowledge differences between him and the Government. It shows the independence of the presidency in the two areas in which he is vested with custodial powers, and this will help future presidents". Also, in response to NMP Zulkifli bin Baharudin, who had inquired about the legitimacy of the President's actions, PM Goh stated that it was for the President to choose the means to communicate these issues to Singaporeans.|$|E
