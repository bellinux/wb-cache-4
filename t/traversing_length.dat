Two roughness parameters, namely average roughness (Ra) and maximum roughness (maximum height of profile, Rz) were used to evaluate surface roughness of the specimens.

40|$|A new {{instrument}} {{bridging the gap}} between atomic force microscopes (AFMs) and stylus profiling instruments is described. The constant force profiler is capable of subnanometer resolution over a 15 -mum vertical range with a horizontal <b>traverse</b> <b>length</b> of 50 mm. This long <b>traverse</b> <b>length,</b> coupled with the possibilities of utilizing standard radius, diamond measurement styli, make the force profiler more compatible with existing profiling instrument standards. The forces between the specimen and a diamond stylus tipped cantilever spring are sensed as displacements using a capacitance bridge. This displacement signal is then fed through a proportional plus integral controller to a high stability piezoelectric actuator to maintain a constant tip-to-sample force of approximately 100 nN. Much of the sensor head and traverse mechanism is made of Zerodur glass-ceramic to provide the thermal stability needed for long travel measurements. Profiles of a 30 -nm silica step height standard and an 8. 5 -mum step etched on Zerodur are presented...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{high-speed}} traversing mechanism {{using two}} electro-rheological clutches is described. An {{application of the}} traversing mechanism is in winding textile filaments onto spinning or weaving bobbins. The design specifications are a traverse speed of 5 m/s; a turn round period of 10 – 20 ms and a <b>traverse</b> <b>length</b> of 250 mm. The turn round position must be controllable and repeatable within 1 mm and the <b>traverse</b> <b>length</b> requires to be periodically varied in order to shape {{the ends of the}} resulting bobbin. These combined criteria of high speed and controllability makes the use of electro-rheological fluids an attractive proposition. The paper considers the effects of the main geometric and fluid parameters on the performance of the mechanism and uses this to outline the limiting performance of the mechanism, together with the effects on the precision of the mechanism. The paper also outlines control aspects of the mechanism and uses this to indicate important areas for consideration in the future development of electro-rheological fluids.
