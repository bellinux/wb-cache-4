5|$|The work, {{despite its}} attempt to depict Napoleon realistically, was criticised by several {{authorities}} {{for a variety of}} reasons.

5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake) had a rivalry {{dating back}} to a match aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling on July 20, 1992.

Perfect and Beefcake wrestled each other at WrestleMania VI, and Beefcake won the match. Perfect won the Intercontinental Championship on April 23, 1990 in a tournament final. He had caused Beefcake to be eliminated from the tournament by interfering in his match. Beefcake and Perfect {{had a series of}} matches at house shows leading up to their planned SummerSlam match. Shortly before SummerSlam, Beefcake was injured while he was standing on a beach and a female friend's knees hit him in the face while she was parasailing. Several bones in his face were legitimately broken, including his jaw and nose. As a result, the Texas Tornado replaced Beefcake in the SummerSlam match.|$|E
5|$|While the {{painting}} largely representedand {{was one of}} the pioneers ofan emerging style, the work was criticised by several authorities on the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche's depiction of the scene to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many of those who were in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.|$|E

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express is {{the first}} game in the Agatha Christie series to feature Hercule Poirot, Christie's most popular and famous detective. David Suchet, whose {{portrayal}} of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some have criticized the game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers explained this choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game do not reflect <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> of Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.|$|E
5|$|Physically, Britten {{was never}} robust. He walked and swam {{regularly}} and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, {{a few of}} them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world. He was not always confident that he was <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else.|$|E
5|$|The tag team {{championship}} match came next, {{which saw}} the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake) attack the Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) before the bell. The Disasters used {{their size and}} strength to gain the advantage, but Earthquake accidentally performed an avalanche on Typhoon. The Beverlys controlled the match for several minutes, with Blake executing a splash and a front facelock. Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents {{but was unable to}} tag in Earthquake. Later, Typhoon tried to tag again, but Beau distracted Earthquake; while the referee's back was turned, The Beverlys' manager, <b>The</b> <b>Genius</b> handed Blake a metal scroll, which Blake used to hit Typhoon. Typhoon recovered, however, and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled the remainder of the match. He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake splash.|$|E

5|$|After the Deluge, {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows {{a scene from the}} story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in <b>The</b> <b>Genius</b> of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Prize medals, minted by Myntverket in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are {{registered}} trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal has {{an image of}} Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design. The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of Nature, as a Goddess, whose veil is held up by <b>the</b> <b>Genius</b> of Science. These medals and the ones for Physiology/Medicine and Literature were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902.|$|E

During the mission, Corvo meets Granny Rags and Slackjaw. Corvo removes the High Overseer and discovers that Emily is being held in a brothel called the Golden Cat under the supervision of twins Custis and Morgan Pendleton. Corvo rescues Emily and eliminates the brothers. After returning to the pub, Emily is taken into the care of Callista to prepare her for becoming Empress, while Corvo is sent to abduct <b>the</b> <b>genius</b> scientist Sokolov, who is responsible for the Lord Regent's powerful technologies. Sokolov {{is taken to}} the pub for interrogation, under which he divulges the identity of the Lord Regent's financier, Lady Boyle.

5000|$|The {{central concern}} in All Religions are One {{is the notion}} of the [...] "Poetic Genius", which is roughly {{analogous}} to the imagination. Blake argues that <b>the</b> Poetic <b>Genius</b> is greater than all else and [...] "is the true man." [...] <b>The</b> Poetic <b>Genius</b> thus replaces traditional concepts of divinity insofar as [...] "The body or outward form of Man is derived from <b>the</b> Poetic <b>Genius</b> ... <b>the</b> forms of all things are derived from their <b>Genius.</b> which by <b>the</b> Ancients was call'd an Angel & Spirit & Demon." [...] Thus, <b>the</b> Poetic <b>Genius</b> supplants theological belief. This Poetic Genius is universal, common to all Mankind; [...] "as all men are alike in outward form ... all men are alike in the Poetic Genius." [...] Similarly, all philosophies are derived from the Poetic Genius; [...] "all sects of Philosophies are from <b>the</b> Poetic <b>Genius</b> adapted to <b>the</b> weaknesses of every individual", and so too are all religions, which are merely expressions of the Poetic Genius; [...] "the Religions of all Nations are derived from each Nations different reception of <b>the</b> Poetic <b>Genius</b> which is everywhere call'd the Spirit of Prophecy," [...] again emphasising the theological character of <b>the</b> Poetic <b>Genius.</b> Even <b>the</b> Bible originates with the Poetic Genius; [...] "The Jewish & Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius." [...] Thus, as all Men are alike in their Poetic Genius, and as all religions originate with <b>the</b> Poetic <b>Genius,</b> so too must all religions be alike, thus all religions are one.|$|R
