He strengthened the new alliance with the psychiatrist Stunkard, and extended his links to psychologist colleagues such as Seymour Feshbach and Irving Sigel, thus keeping abreast of developments in cognitive psychology, as he did also from the new Center for Cognitive Science at Harvard University. He was particularly engaged with George Kelly's personal construct theory and Jean Piaget's schemas. Beck's first articles on the cognitive theory of depression, in 1963 and 1964 in the Archives of General Psychiatry, maintained the psychiatric context of ego psychology but then turned to concepts of realistic and scientific thinking {{in the terms of}} the new cognitive psychology, extended to become a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>need.</b>|$|E

40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} concerning the long term outcome of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Thus 109 patients with reflux symptoms (33 with erosive oesophagitis) with a diagnosis of GORD after clinical evaluation and oesophageal testing were studied. All patients were treated with a stepwise approach: (a) lifestyle changes were suggested aimed at reducing reflux and antacids and the prokinetic agent domperidone were prescribed; (b) H 2 blockers were added after two months when symptoms persisted; (c) anti-reflux surgery was indicated {{when there was no}} response to (b). Treatment was adjusted to maintain clinical remission during follow up. Long term treatment need was defined as minor when conservative measures sufficed for proper control, and as major if daily H 2 blockers or surgery were required. The results showed that one third of the patients each had initial <b>therapeutic</b> <b>need</b> (a), (b), and (c). Of 103 patients available for follow up at three years and 89 at six years, respective therapeutic needs were minor in 52 % and 55 % and major in 48 % and 45 %. Eighty per cent of patients in (a), 67 % in (b), and 17 % in (c) required only conservative measures at six years. A decreasing lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (p < 0. 001), radiological reflux (p = 0. 028), and erosive oesophagitis (p = 0. 031), but not initial clinical scores, were independent predictors of major <b>therapeutic</b> <b>need</b> as shown by multivariate analysis.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Preclinical {{research}} in epileptology {{has been very}} successful in producing effective drugs. Unfortunately, however, seizures are still not adequately controlled in {{a third of the}} affected individuals, and comorbidities still impose a major burden on quality of life. New preclinical and clinical drug development strategies are needed to identify drugs that target these unmet medical needs. Recent findings Even in recent years, the antiseizure approach based on screenings has contributed to the identification of new drugs. Thus, it should not be abandoned. However, we propose that a radically new approach, specifically designed to tackle the existing gaps in care, should be developed to complement the traditional screening. This new approach will require integrated strategies for preclinical screening and experimental trial design. In this review, we will attempt to address {{some of the issues that}} must be resolved to engage this effort. Are there suitable models to tackle the unmet <b>therapeutic</b> <b>needs</b> in epilepsy? Are there ways de-risk the transition from pre-clinical to clinical studies? Are there ways to improve the efficiency of clinical trials and to design ad hoc trials for the unmet <b>therapeutic</b> <b>needs?</b> Summary Development and validation of a new, integrated strategy for anti-epilepsy drug development is needed to identify truly innovative drugs...|$|R

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a leading}} cause of {{disability}} in middle-aged and older adults with the prevalence expected to increase by 40 % by 2025.

Consequently, there is a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>need</b> for alternative knee OA treatments that directly address joint overload to fill the gap between ineffective conservative care and invasive joint-modifying surgical procedures.

This review examines the significance of relevant AQPs in stroke injury and subsequently explores neuroprotective strategies aimed at modulating AQP expression, with a particular focus on AQP 4, the most abundant AQP in the central nervous system...|$|E
