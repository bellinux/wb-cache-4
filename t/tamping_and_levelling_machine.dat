Cost estimation is either based on {{a model of the}} parallel algorithm or on a model of the actually generated machine code.

40|$|Abstract- Simulation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} methods in the Design of Manufacturing Systems. Typical reasons for the simulation of a manufacturing system includes evaluating the capacity and equipment utilisation, identifying bottlenecks in the system, comparing the performance of alternative designs [1]. The potential benefits in using simulation are very large. Simulation can help users by contributing in design, in management and in the decision making of production systems. It is also able to model all kinds of company processes: physical, informational and decisional. Simulation models can be built at all hierarchical (operational, tactical, strategic) <b>and</b> detailing <b>levels</b> (<b>machine,</b> cell, shop, etc…). Moreover, the whole manufacturing system life cycle can be modelled and simulated (design, analysis, implementation, operation, etc…). This paper discusses case studies where modelling and simulation were used to evaluate and improve the performance of manufacturing systems. In all cases ProModel simulation package was used...|$|R

5000|$|Early {{machines}} only {{lifted the}} track and packed the ballast. More modern machines, sometimes known as a tamper-liner or <b>tamping</b> <b>and</b> lining machine, also correct the alignment of the rails to make them parallel <b>and</b> <b>level,</b> {{in order to achieve}} a more comfortable ride for passengers and freight and to reduce the mechanical strain applied to the rails by passing trains. This is done by finding places where the sleepers have sunk from the weight of the passing trains or frost action, causing the track to sag. The tamper lifts each sleeper and the rails up, and packs ballast underneath. When the sleeper is laid down again, the sagged rails now sit at the proper level. In cases where frost action has caused adjacent rails to rise higher, ballast tampers can raise rails above their original level to make the line level again. [...] "Lining" [...] rails doesn't involve ballast tamping, it merely ensures the rails are perfectly parallel and straight as possible. Combining <b>tamping</b> <b>and</b> lining into a single machine saves time and money, as only one machine needs to be run over the track to perform both functions.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tamping</b> <b>and</b> {{cleaning}} {{operations have}} the adverse effect {{of reducing the}} resistance of the track to lateral movement.

5000|$|The terms {{high-level}} and low-level {{are inherently}} relative. Some decades ago, the C language, and similar languages, were most often considered [...] "high-level", as it supported {{concepts such as}} expression evaluation, parameterised recursive functions, and data types and structures, while assembly language was considered [...] "low-level". Today, many programmers might refer to C as low-level, as it lacks a large runtime-system (no garbage collection, etc.), basically supports only scalar operations, and provides direct memory addressing. It, therefore, readily blends with assembly language <b>and</b> the <b>machine</b> <b>level</b> of CPUs <b>and</b> microcontrollers.|$|R

40|$|CEBAF has {{recently}} upgraded its accelerator control sys-tem to use EPICS, a control system toolkit {{being developed by}} a collaboration among laboratories in the US and Europe. The migration to EPICS has taken place during a year of intense commissioning activity, with new and old control systems operating concurrently. Existing CAMAC hardware was pre-served by adding a CAMAC serial highway link to VME; newer hardware developments are now primarily in VME. Software is distributed among three tiers of computers: first, workstations and X terminals for operator interfaces <b>and</b> high <b>level</b> applications; second, VME single board computers for distributed access to hardware and for local control processing (complex sequences, limit checking, some process control); third, embedded processors where needed for faster closed loop operation. In some cases, multiple VME processors trans-parently access a single serial highway for improved perfor-mance. This system has demonstrated the ability to scale EPICS to controlling thousands of devices, including hundreds of embedded processors, with control distributed among doz-ens of VME processors executing more than 125, 000 EPICS database records. To deal with the large size of the control sys-tem, CEBAF has integrated an object oriented database, pro-viding data management capabilities for both low level I/O (calibration, alarm limits, etc.) <b>and</b> high <b>level</b> <b>machine</b> model-ling (optics properties, etc.).
