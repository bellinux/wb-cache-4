5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 began photographing Jupiter in January 1979 {{and made}} its closest {{approach}} on March 5, 1979, {{at a distance}} of 349,000km from Jupiter's center. This close approach allowed for greater image resolution, though the flyby's short duration meant that most observations of Jupiter's moons, rings, magnetic field, and radiation environment were made in the 48-hour period bracketing the approach, even though Voyager1 continued photographing the planet until April. It was soon followed by Voyager2, which made its closest approach on July 9, 1979, 576,000km away from the planet's cloud tops. The probe discovered Jupiter's ring, observed intricate vortices in its atmosphere, observed active volcanoes on Io, a process analogous <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics on Ganymede, and numerous craters on Callisto.|$|E

50|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} (PM) {{components are}} sealed prior <b>to</b> <b>plating</b> and <b>to</b> reduce internal corrosion. Plating operations typically involve submerging the parts in acid solutions. After plating, residual acid internal {{to the part}} can promote corrosion and/or preclude an acceptable plating finish. The {{solution to this problem}} is to seal the internal voids prior <b>to</b> <b>plating.</b> As explained above, the porosity is saturated with monomer and is then rinsed completely clear of the surface. The resin cures to a durable polymer. Thus, the exposed surface metal is free <b>to</b> be <b>plated</b> while the interior spaces are sealed dry.|$|R
25|$|How mantle {{convection}} {{directly and}} indirectly relates <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> motion {{is a matter of}} ongoing study and discussion in geodynamics. Somehow, this energy must be transferred to the lithosphere for tectonic plates to move. There are essentially two main types of forces that are thought to influence plate motion: friction and gravity.|$|E
25|$|The weak {{visibility}} of the postulated plume in tomographic {{images of the}} lower mantle and the geochemical evidence for eclogite in the mantle source {{have led to the}} theory that Iceland is not underlain by a mantle plume at all, but that the volcanism there results from processes related <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics and is restricted to the upper mantle.|$|E
25|$|Another type plating out organisms, next to streaking, on {{agar plates}} is the spot {{analysis}}. This type of analysis {{is often used}} to check the viability of cells and performed with pinners (often also called froggers). A third used technique is the use of sterile, glass, beads <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> out cells. In this technique cells are grown in a liquid culture of which a small volume is pipetted on the agar plate and then spread out with the sterile, glass beads. Replicate plating is another technique in order <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> out cells on agar plates. These four techniques are the most used ones, but others are also possible. It is crucial to work in a sterile manner in order to prevent contamination on the agar plates. Plating is thus often done in a laminar flow cabinet or on the working bench next to a bunsen burner.|$|E

25|$|It {{was only}} from the 11th century that Norman swords began to develop the crossguard (quillons). During the Crusades of the 12th to 13th century, this {{cruciform}} type of arming sword remained essentially stable, with variations mainly concerning {{the shape of the}} pommel. These swords were designed as cutting weapons, although effective points were becoming common to counter improvements in armour, especially the 14th-century change from mail <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> armour.|$|E

25|$|Plating, painting, and the {{application}} of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of corrosion-resistant material between the damaging environment and the structural material. Aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high temperature. Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For this reason, it is often wise <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> with active metal such as zinc or cadmium.|$|E
25|$|ESL in {{industrial}} capacitors is {{mainly caused by}} the leads and internal connections used <b>to</b> connect the <b>plates</b> <b>to</b> the outside world.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of pollution prevention techniques that apply <b>to</b> <b>plating</b> lines within metal finishing operations. As described in Overview of the Metal Finishing Industry, the plating line is the part of the metal finishing process where metal is applied to a substrate. The first section of this chapter describes general pollution prevention techniques for plating solutions and covers housekeeping, monitoring, additives, equipment modification, and on-site recycling and recovery. The next section covers general issues in pollution prevention for cyanide-based plating. The next seven sections cover pollution prevention options for plating specific metals such as brass, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, precious metals, and zinc. The sections that follow cover additional types of plating including electroless, aluminum, chemical and electrical conversion, and others. General Pollution Prevention Techniques for Plating Solutions Common Pollution Prevention Practices presented a number of general pollution prevention techniques for all types of metal finishing operations. These general techniques can apply in a variety ways <b>to</b> <b>plating</b> lines. The following are some specific applications of these techniques <b>to</b> <b>plating</b> baths...|$|R
25|$|PYRO-A is a {{means of}} {{separating}} actinides (elements within the actinide family, generally heavier than U-235) from non-actinides. The spent fuel is placed in an anode basket which is immersed in a molten salt electrolyte. An electric current is applied, causing the uranium metal (or sometimes oxide, depending on the spent fuel) <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> out on a solid metal cathode while the other actinides (and the rare earths) can be absorbed into a liquid cadmium cathode. Many of the fission products (such as caesium, zirconium and strontium) remain in the salt. As alternatives to the molten cadmium electrode it is possible to use a molten bismuth cathode, or a solid aluminium cathode.|$|E
25|$|Good {{practices}} in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate {{that there be}} good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to sill plate to vertical studs <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, {{each of which is}} secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.|$|E
25|$|For {{a period}} {{following}} {{the second world}} war, pure nickel was electroplated as a lining to copper cookware. Nickel {{had the advantage of}} being harder and more thermally efficient than tin, with a higher melting point. Despite its hardness nickel's wear characteristics were similar to that of tin, as nickel would be plated only to a thickness of <20 microns, and often even less owing to nickel's tendency <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> somewhat irregularly, requiring milling to produce an even cooking surface, albeit sticky compared to tin and silver. Copper cookware with aged or damaged nickel linings is eligible for retinning, or possibly replating with nickel, although this service is difficult if not impossible to find in the US and Europe in the early 21st century. Nickel linings began to fall out of favor in the 1980s owing to the isolation of nickel as an allergen.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1st century BC or early 1st century AD a new design {{appeared}} in some bow type fibulae. A separate pin {{was attached to}} the head-end of the bow with a small hinge. In {{the second half of the}} 1st century AD, hinges were introduced <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> type fibulae. One or two small plaques were cast on the back of the plate and a pin {{was attached to the}}m by a small hinge. Previously, plate type fibulae had bilateral springs attached to the back. In the 3rd century AD, the hinge was placed in the centre of a long transverse bar creating the famous crossbow fibula design. A few fibulae from a much earlier date also had hinges, although this design feature was very rare and soon died out for nearly five centuries. For example, the Asia Minor Decorated Arc Fibula (Blinkenberg Type XII Variation 16) dating to the 5th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to final}} assembly, the {{manufacturers}} usually apply a thin coating of clear or colored acrylic lacquer or silver plate over the brass. The lacquer or plating serves {{to protect the}} brass from oxidation and maintains its shiny appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used over the years. It is also possible <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> the instrument with nickel or gold, {{and a number of}} gold-plated saxophones have been produced. Plating saxophones with gold is an expensive process because gold does not adhere directly to brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold. Some saxophonists, sellers, and repair technicians argue that the type of lacquer or plating or absence thereof may enhance an instrument's tone quality. The possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from the other variables that affect an instrument's tone colors. In any case, what constitutes a pleasing tone is a matter of personal preference.|$|E
25|$|In {{the top of}} {{the first}} Matt Lipka, the first batter of the game, was walked by Braves pitcher Mike Minor. After {{stealing}} second and advancing on an error, Lipka scored on a groundout that gave the Future Stars an early lead. Braves starting second baseman Dan Uggla launched a solo home run {{in the bottom of the}} second off Futures starter Sean Gilmartin to tie the game at one. The home run was Uggla's seventh of the Spring, tying him for the Major League lead. Liván Hernández, who was acquired in a trade only a few days before, relieved Minor in the fourth, throwing a scoreless frame. Reliever Cristhian Martínez followed in the fifth, allowing the Futures two runs to give them a lead of 3–1. In the bottom of the inning, an RBI double by starting center fielder Michael Bourn plated Juan Francisco, also just acquired in a trade a few days prior. Martín Prado continued the scoring with an RBI triple to score Bourn and starting catcher Brian McCann followed with an RBI double <b>to</b> <b>plate</b> Prado, giving the Major League team a 4–3 advantage. After scoreless outings by Kris Medlen and Eric O'Flaherty, the remainder of the game was canceled due to rain. Manager Fredi González stated that Jonny Venters and Craig Kimbrel would have pitched the eighth and ninth innings, respectively.|$|E
