500|$|Reddick drew {{inspiration}} for the episode from undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone, whom he met while filming the TV series Falcone. Pistone recommended his autobiography , and Reddick found many parallels to it and the episode. [...] "In the book, [...] talked about how while being undercover in the Mafia, he had to separate his personal feelings from his professional and moral sense of responsibility. There were certain guys he really couldn’t stand, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> he genuinely liked, even though ultimately he had to bring them down. I think Col. Broyles {{feels the same way}} about Olivia. On various occasions, she has performed heroically to earn his respect, and in tonight’s episode, that appreciation — and the angst that goes with it — reaches a new level".|$|E
500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Al-Zahrawi was {{not afraid}} to depart from old practice, for example, he openly disparages the opinion that {{cauterization}} should only {{be used in the}} spring season: “…the Ancients… that spring was the best. Myself, I say that cautery is suitable at all times”. Four pages later, he again opposes the opinion that gold is the best material for cauterization, stating that iron is actually his preferred metal: “therefore in our own opinion cauterization is swifter and more successful with iron”. In chapter twenty-nine, [...] "On cauterization for pleurisy", he states: “Now one of the Ancients mentioned that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus…but in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may raise at the place”.|$|E

He was also appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Guiyang Commandery (桂陽郡; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan), replacing Zhao Fan. Zhao Fan had a widowed elder sister-in-law who was known for her beauty, {{and he wanted to}} arrange for a marriage between her and Zhao Yun. However, Zhao Yun declined, [...] "I share the same family name as you. Your elder brother is also like an elder brother to me." [...] <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who urged Zhao Yun to accept the marriage, but he said, [...] "Zhao Fan was forced to surrender, so his intentions are unclear. There're so many other women in this world." [...] Not long later, Zhao Fan escaped, and Zhao Yun was able to avoid any association with him because he did not agree to the marriage.|$|E

60|$|Some of {{the guests}} from the hotel came to the funeral, but others who were not in good health {{remained}} away, {{and there was a}} general sense among them, which imparted itself to Westover, that Jackson's dying so, {{at the beginning of the}} season, was not a fortunate incident.
