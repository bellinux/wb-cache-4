6000|$|The maimed gasman's foot is much swollen, but he limps {{about and}} does his work. I have doctored {{him up with}} arnica. During the [...] "Boy" [...] last night there was an escape of gas {{from the side of}} my <b>top</b> <b>batten,</b> which caught the copper-wire and was within a thread of {{bringing}} down the heavy reflector into the stalls. It was a very ticklish matter, though the audience knew nothing about it. I saw it, and the gasman and Dolby saw it, and stood at that side of the platform in agonies. We all three calculated that there would be just time to finish and save it; when the gas was turned out the instant I had done, the whole thing was at its very last and utmost extremity. Whom it would have tumbled on, or what might have been set on fire, it is impossible to say.|$|E
50|$|For decades, Dabchicks {{all were}} built of marine plywood. Though {{fiberglass}} boats {{are now being}} built, hundreds of wooden boats are still being sailed competitively. At the 2007 AGM, the class rules were modified to allow Mylar sails with a full length <b>top</b> <b>batten.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Stratos can be reefed in {{less than}} a minute to reduce the amount of power from the mainsail. The Stratos' Combi-Tec Mainsail {{includes}} short battens and a full-length <b>top</b> <b>batten.</b> The Stratos also has a furling jib, which means the Stratos can be fully depowered {{in less than}} ten seconds.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} the vibration control capabilities of three configurations of an active truss is presented. The truss studied is composed of two bays of an octahedral-octahedral configuration. The three configurations of the active truss studies are: all six battens activated (6 DOF), the <b>top</b> three <b>battens</b> activated (3 DOF), and the bottom three battens activated (3 DOF). The closed-loop vibration control response of these three configurations are studied with respect to: vibration attenuation, energy utilized, {{and the effects of}} motor drive amplifier saturation non-linearities...|$|R
50|$|The south entry, {{almost to}} the {{property}} boundary, has twin double timber doors with arched fanlights and an asbestos cement tile awning supported by paired timber brackets. The gable above has a triple lancet window with leadlight panels and an arched timber surround, a <b>battened</b> <b>top</b> panel and paired timber brackets.|$|R
50|$|The tableau, tab, or tabbed curtain, {{also called}} opera drapes, though iconic {{of the theater}} setting, is the rarest of {{curtains}} to actually be employed on the stage. It consists of two overlapping panels (often but not always pleated) secured along the <b>top</b> to a <b>batten,</b> with the lower onstage corners or center points of the panel edges attached to lines or cables. These lines run through series of rings behind each curtain diagonally, and then through pulleys in the batten {{and down to the}} floor. When the cord is pulled, the fabric is lifted diagonally up and out, away from the center. In this position, it does not fully clear the stage, instead creating a frilled tent-like viewing frame for the performance- it is because of this tendency to limit the audience's view that it is rarely used except in very small venues. However, as the top of the curtain never moves, it requires no track (like a traveler curtain) and as the curtain itself is never actually raised, neither does it require any sandbag counterweights (like an oleo or an Austrian).|$|R
5000|$|The early F11s {{were not}} as {{attractive}} or sophisticated as today - the clew of the genoa was 16" [...] above the gunwale — the mainsail hung from one full length <b>top</b> <b>batten,</b> with some short leech battens, all battens were made of cane, and the venturis, which were tube and box type with corks, would today be regarded as museum pieces.|$|E
5000|$|The sheet is {{attached}} midway along the boom {{or at the}} free end, typically {{by means of a}} block. The block is typically attached to the boom by means of a bail, which is a U-shaped piece of metal, flattened at the ends to allow attachment with screws or rivets. In smaller boats such as dinghies it is used to control the angle of the sail to the wind on each point of sail. On largest boats this function is largely assumed by the traveller and the main sheet is used to adjust the twist of the sail to present the luff of the sail to the wind all of the way up the mast. Easing the main sheet increases twist and the twist is usually adjusted so that the aft end of the <b>top</b> <b>batten</b> in the main sail runs parallel to the boom. The traveller is a track running {{from one side of the}} boat to the other upon which sits a car to which the other end of the sheet {{is attached}}. Moving the car from side to side alters the angle of the boom to the centreline of the boat while minimising the effect on the twist of the sail.|$|E
5000|$|The sails {{include several}} {{horizontal}} members, called [...] "battens", which in principle could provide shape and strength but in practice, {{because of the}} available materials and technology, did neither. Junk sails are controlled at their trailing edge by lines much {{in the same way}} as the mainsail on a typical sailboat, but in the junk sail each batten has a line attached to its trailing edge where on a typical sailboat a single line (the sheet) is attached only to the boom. The sails can also be easily reefed to accommodate various wind strengths, but there was traditionally no available adjustment for sail shape for the reasons given to do with traditional materials. The battens also make the sails more resistant than other sails to large tears, as a tear is typically limited to a single [...] "panel" [...] between battens. In South China the sails have a curved roach especially towards the head, similar to a typical balanced lug sail. The main drawback to the junk sail is its high weight caused by the 6 to 15 heavy full length battens. With high weight aloft and no deep keel, junks were known to capsize when lightly laden due to their high centre of gravity. The <b>top</b> <b>batten</b> is heavier and similar to a gaff. In principle junk sails have much in common with the most aerodynamically efficient sails used today in windsurfers or catamarans. In practice, because of the comparatively low tech materials, they had no better performance characteristic than any other contemporary sail plan, whether western, Arab, Polynesian or other.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Faculty Technology FATEC - Wilderness Center {{in the city of}} Quixeramobim - CE, and was divided into two stages. The goal of the first phase conducted from February to April 2010 was to evaluate the influence of rearing for royal jelly production and larval weight of Apis mellifera transferred. The second step was evaluated important aspects in the production of queens as the influence of the growing weight of emerging queens, their morphometric characteristics, and dry weight of their ovaries, being conducted from October 2010 to February 2011. Two apiaries were used, a small apiary that received colonies the four models used in the study: Doolittle, Orfanos with a hive, Mini-hive and Chinese, and others to support the same with 25 colonies. Colonies each received a door-frame dome domes containing 32 plastic artificial color blue, 16 in the <b>top</b> <b>batten</b> and the bottom 16. Data collection was done in two days of the week in {{the first phase of the}} trial and three days in the second stage. In the first phase, 448 transfers were performed for each larval rearing, a total of 1792 larvae transferred. In the second phase were produced in 263 colonies all the queens. The results showed no significant difference (p > 0, 05) in acceptability and weight of larvae transferred, as well as in royal jelly production by growing, but there was a positive correlation between these parameters. There were also the same statistical differences and correlations for the weight of the ovaries and dry matter. The production of royal jelly dome, the weight of the queen to emerge and their morphometric measurements showed statistically significant differences (p 0, 05) na aceitaÃÃo e no peso das larvas transferidas, assim como na produÃÃo de gelÃia real por recria, porÃm ocorreu uma com correlaÃÃo positiva entre estes parÃmetros. Observaram-se tambÃm as mesmas diferenÃas estatÃsticas e correlaÃÃes para o peso dos ovÃrios e sua matÃria seca. A produÃÃo de gelÃia real por cÃpula, o peso da rainha ao emergir e suas medidas morfomÃtricas apresentaram diferenÃas estatÃsticas significativas (p < 0, 05), tendo a recria Doolittle se destacado positivamente na produÃÃo de gelÃia real, enquanto que a recria Chinesa demonstrou a produÃÃo de rainhas menores e mais leves. Conclui-se que recrias Doolittle sÃo mais indicadas para a produÃÃo de gelÃia real, desde que se utilize um nÃmero superior ao de cÃpulas usadas neste estudo, e que as mini-recrias se destacaram na produÃÃo de rainhas...|$|E
