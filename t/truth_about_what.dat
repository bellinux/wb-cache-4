When Ruth listened to a {{voicemail}} from her daughter, it reminded her of home and she called Sam to say she could not be with him. Ruth then turned to Usha for support, before returning home to David, who observed Ruth's emotional state. After Sam quit his job, Ruth eventually told David the <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened. Bentinck explained that when he and Finch finished recording the scene, they were both crying as it had been very distressing. David was initially unable to forgive Ruth for her actions, but after speaking to Usha and gaining some perspective, over time things between himself and Ruth became easier.|$|E

Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close and loving relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry.|$|E

Serph, Cielo, Argilla and Gale learn that Sera is the captive of Angel and Madame Cuvier at the Karma Society headquarters. With the help of Roland and a young boy named Fred, the group infiltrate the Karma Society's building. While they attempt to rescue Serah, Angel plans to subvert Cuvier and use the demon virus to create a society ruled by the strong. The Embryon are also faced by Heat, who is working with Cuvier {{on the promise of}} Sera's safety. Reaching the EGG, a man-made replica of God, the party rescue Sera, but Heat appears and seems to kill Serph. Both fall into the EGG, and God begins absorbing the Earth's data: in the chaos, Angel kills Cuvier, while the remaining Embryon and Sera, now able to assume a demon form herself, shut down the Power Plant in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the EGG. In the process, both Roland and Argilla are killed by a powerful demon. Returning to the EGG so Sera can speak with God, they are confronted by Heat, who has fused with the EGG and gone berserk.

500|$|The {{affidavit}} {{filed by}} authorities supporting the arrest warrant for Ward showed that investigators had concluded {{the men were}} not telling the <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened. The report states [...] "The evidence demonstrates that Robert Wone was restrained, incapacitated, sexually assaulted, and murdered inside 1509 Swann Street," [...] and there exists [...] "overwhelming evidence, far in excess of probable cause" [...] that Price, Zaborsky, and Ward [...] "obstructed justice by altering and orchestrating the crime scene, planting evidence, delaying the reporting of the murder to the authorities, and lying to the police about the true circumstances of the murder." [...] Lawyers for the three accused men have called the affidavit [...] "speculation, innuendo, assumptions, and irrelevant inflammatory comments" [...] and maintain their clients' innocence. Price and Zaborsky were domestic partners, and the affidavit alleges that Price had previously had {{a sexual relationship with}} Ward. Washington attorney Dale Sanders opined that the release of the extensively detailed affidavit was intended to turn one of the housemates, presumably Ward, against the others, and hypothesized that it indicated prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to charge any of the housemates with additional crimes without the cooperation of a witness.|$|E
500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he can do and what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. {{has been}} a {{supporter}} of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. In her own book, M.I.A. wrote regarding Wikileaks, [...] "So obviously I love Wikileaks because, after I’d gone through the whole backlash, {{they were the first}} news information site to confirm any news on the Sri Lankan war in the truest form; they were the first to release information stating the <b>truth</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> had happened to the Tamils as I knew it and to reveal that the United Nations was aware that the Sri Lankan government was lying—war crimes had been committed but their hands were tied because any time anyone tried to impose sanctions, governments would walk out. [...] I support Wikileaks because of that." [...] She composed the theme to Assange's television show The World Tomorrow and later stood by Assange's side as he held a press conference at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Assange was successfully granted political asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. [...] "I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch hunt against WikiLeaks," [...] Assange said at the press conference. She posted a photo of Assange from within the embassy, and later tweeted, [...] "hummmm after this day 2things have 2 happen....., either 500 cops turn up outside every rape case reported even if it's without charge. or we get raped by the powerz that be and we deal 4eva." [...] The tweets were in reference to an arrest warrant the Swedish Prosecutor's Office issued in August 2010 for Assange on two charges: rape and molestation. Earlier in 2012 Britain's Supreme Court denied an appeal by Assange to avoid extradition to Sweden to face these charges. In November 2013, Assange appeared via Skype to open M.I.A.'s New York City concert. Also, on 18 September 2014 Maya tweeted a link to a documentary on YouTube entitled [...] "The Internet's Own Boy: Aaron Swartz". The documentary is about the life of Aaron Swartz, who was a computer programmer, writer, political organiser and Internet hacktivist.

[...] The track is followed by [...] "Apologize", a track that directly addresses critics and states the band's defiance in the face of negative opinions, as evident by the chorus, [...] "We don't apologize and that's just the way it is, but we can harmonize even if we sound like shit." [...] Third is [...] "Comin’ in Hot", a party song and the album's fourth single that uses humor to describe what happens in night clubs. [...] "My Town" [...] is the fifth single and a mid-tempo song talking about Los Angeles and Hollywood. Next is [...] "I Don't Wanna Die", a song about the fear of death fueling the need to kill another person. [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] was the lead single from the album and is about the troubles each band member was going through at the time the song was written. The song's lyrics tell the story of a person who is depressed and hopeless, taking a very somber tone to the track. Despite this, the instruments and melodies contrast to make an uptempo track. Next is [...] "Gangsta Sexy", a party anthem song about heading to nightclubs and pursuing women. The following track, [...] "Glory", is a metal-inspired song which drew influence from war and fighting. [...] "Lights Out", the ninth song on the album, is about Deuce, ex-vocalist of Hollywood Undead. It is a response to [...] "Story of a Snitch". [...] "Coming Back Down", the third single released from the album, is a rock ballad song with acoustic guitars on the track. The lyrics describes about a story of an unknown loved one who has recently died, with the narrator having difficulty trying to live without them. [...] "Bullet", the eleventh track from the album, is an uptempo pop song about suicide. It is played in an upbeat tempo with energetic vocals, which gives contrast to the dark lyrical content. Rick Florino called the track, [...] "heart-wrenching genius". [...] "Levitate" [...] is an uptempo discothèque song about sex, while the verses of the song talk about suicide and alcoholism.

SS soldiers tried to convince their victims {{that they are going to}} transfer them to another prison or to a concentration camp. For this reason, death transports were usually formed at dusk and prisoners were allowed to take their belongings with them. Sometimes before departure convicts received an additional food ration and they were given back their documents from the prison's depository. Initially, these methods were so effective that the prisoners were not aware of the fate awaiting them.
