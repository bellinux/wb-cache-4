5|$|By 2000, {{the city}} of Sacramento {{maintained}} the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the city limits under a contract with Caltrans. However, since Caltrans's main goal is to move traffic efficiently, the city {{was not able to}} carry out pedestrian-friendly projects <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> local residents wanted. Under a law passed in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the city limits to Sacramento. The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000 the portion from the south city limits to the American River became the full responsibility of the city. A 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{relational}} ties {{principle of}} fusion suggests that highly fused individuals will feel <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> other group members synergistically strengthen each other. This perception of reciprocal strength should foster {{the perception that}} together, {{members of the group}} are uniquely invulnerable. These feelings of invulnerability may serve to insulate strongly fused individuals from fully recognizing the risks associated with extreme acts. Perceptions of invulnerability have been shown to mediate the effects of fusion on endorsement of pro-group behavior.|$|E

25|$|The {{timing of}} their attack was {{carefully}} planned. After successfully asking a large Herero clan to surrender their weapons, Governor Leutwein was convinced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> {{the rest of}} the native population were essentially pacified and so withdrew half of the German troops stationed in his colony. Led by Chief Samuel Maharero, the Herero surrounded Okahandja and cut links to Windhoek, the colonial capital. Maharero then issued a manifesto in which he forbade his troops to kill any Englishmen, Boers, uninvolved peoples, women and children in general, or German missionaries.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} Coronado's expedition {{were the first}} Europeans to encounter the Acoma. (Estevan was a native Moroccan.) Alvarado reported that first the Acoma refused entry even after persuasions but after Alvarado showed threats of an attack the Acoma guards welcomed the Spaniards peacefully noting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> their horses were tired. The encounter shows that the Acoma had clothing made of deerskin, buffalohide, and woven cotton as well as turquoise jewelry, domestic turkeys, bread, pine nuts, and maize. The village seemed to contain about 200 men.|$|E

Maometto recognizes their gallantry, but demands <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> their men surrender and states that then all will be released. By his silence, Erisso rejects the offer and, as the two {{are about to be}} led away to be tortured, Anna and the women appear from the church.|$|E

Raiden's body is rebuilt and he reconciles with Rose after learning that their child was not miscarried and that her marriage to Campbell was a ruse meant to protect them from the Patriots.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} {{conceived}} in the 1970s by the Boston Transportation Planning Review {{to replace the}} rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to Logan Airport, and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, Michael Dukakis (governor) and Fred Salvucci (secretary of transportation) {{came up with the}} strategy of tying the two projects together—thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> the City of Boston supported.|$|E
25|$|The {{promise of}} {{independence}} convinced the insurgents {{to accept the}} proposal. The promise of the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church was offered to the clergy, who were frightened by anti-clerical policies of Spanish Liberalism. The offer of equality between Criollos and the Spanish-born Peninsulares assured the latter <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> their property would be safe in the new state. This was important because the Peninsulares owned {{a significant part of}} the valuable real estate and many of the businesses in Mexico. If the Spaniards had left, it would have been disastrous for the Mexican economy.|$|E

25|$|The {{buoyancy}} {{force on}} the diver is {{the weight of the}} volume of the liquid <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> their equipment displace minus the weight of the diver and their equipment; if the result is positive, that force is upwards. The buoyancy of any object immersed in water is also affected by the density of the water. The density of fresh water is about 3% less than that of ocean water. Therefore, divers who are neutrally buoyant at one dive destination (e.g. a fresh water lake) will predictably be positively or negatively buoyant when using the same equipment at destinations with different water densities (e.g. a tropical coral reef).|$|E
25|$|Following Earl Grey's 1846 {{proposal}} for federation of the Australian colonies, an 1849 {{report from the}} Privy Council of the United Kingdom suggested that a national court be created. In 1856, the then Governor of South Australia, Richard Graves MacDonnell, suggested to the Government of South Australia <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> the other colonies should consider establishing a court of appeal that would hear appeals from the Supreme Courts in each colony, and in 1860 the Parliament of South Australia passed legislation encouraging MacDonnell to put forward the idea to {{his colleagues in the}} other colonies. However, only the Government of Victoria seriously considered this proposal.|$|E
25|$|Caesar is {{the primary}} source for the {{location}} of the Eburones. The exact borders are difficult to be certain about, but the region <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> their fellow Germani inhabited corresponds to some extent with the later Roman district of Germania Inferior, enclosed by the northern bend of the river Rhine, and including a stretch of the Meuse river (Dutch: Maas) stretching from the Ardennes until the river deltas of the Rhine and Meuse. In the early medieval church this evolved into the original church province of Cologne (later stretching beyond the Rhine), which included the Diocese of Liège that had evolved from the Civitas Tungrorum. This large area included large parts of what are now the southern Netherlands, eastern Belgium, and the German Rhineland.|$|E

25|$|On August 18, 1755, {{eight days}} after Acadians were imprisoned at Chignecto, Lieutenant Colonel John Winslow arrived in Grand-Pré with 315 troops, {{and took up}} {{headquarters}} in the church. The 418 Acadian males (age 10 and older) of the area were ordered inside the church Saint-Charles-des-Mines on September 5, where they were unexpectedly imprisoned for five weeks. Winslow informed them that all but their personal goods were to be forfeited to the Crown, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> their families were to be deported as soon as ships arrived to take them away. The wives were ordered to feed and clothe both the prisoners and the troops. Six days after the initial imprisonment, because of fears of Acadian rebellion, Winslow moved 230 prisoners on board ships to await deportation.|$|E
25|$|Ornithologists have {{traditionally}} recognized two subspecies of this bird: the American ivory-billed, the more famous of the two, and the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker. The two look similar despite differences {{in size and}} plumage. Some controversy exists over whether the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker is more appropriately recognized as a separate species. A recent study compared DNA samples taken from specimens of both ivory-billed birds along with the imperial woodpecker, a larger but otherwise very similar bird. It concluded {{not only that the}} Cuban and American ivory-billed woodpeckers are genetically distinct, but also <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> the imperial form a North American clade within Campephilus that appeared in the mid-Pleistocene. The study does not attempt to define a lineage linking the three birds, though it does imply that the Cuban bird is more closely related to the imperial.|$|E
25|$|The {{defenders}} {{did receive}} some forewarning about the impending assault. On August 31 Burayh {{was informed that}} the Zanj leader had sent money and supplies into the desert to raise a force among the Arab tribes, and that a combined force of Zanj infantry and Arab horsemen were planning to attack Basra. Approximately a week later, the Arabs in Basra received a warning {{from members of the}} Banu Tamim and Banu Asad that were cooperating with the Zanj, informing them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> the Zanj would be attacking the next day and that they should evacuate their women and children before the city was surrounded. Burayh responded to this news by advancing outside the city and setting up a defensive force at a trench, but when 'Ali ibn Aban approached his position he lost his nerve and returned to Basra, allowing 'Ali to continue toward the city unopposed.|$|E

25|$|In 1795, due to {{problems}} in obtaining payment for another project, Latrobe {{was faced with}} severe financial problems. When his wife, Lydia Sellon, having died in childbirth in November 1793, he {{is thought to have}} suffered a breakdown. Declared bankrupt and unable to pay some of his workmen, he emigrated to America on 25 November 1795. There is some doubt over whether Hammerwood was finished by this point; {{it is possible that the}} Sperlings supervised its completion in Latrobe's absence. However, the failure of a large investment in a Dublin distillery led the Sperlings to lose £70,000 (equivalent to approximately £7.5 million in 2015 pounds); the artist and diarist Joseph Farington reported <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> their partners 'overbuilt themselves at a vast expense'. Between 1798 and 1800, Sperling was compelled to give up both Hammerwood and his London home and to move back to his Dynes Hall estate.|$|E
25|$|In cool climates (such as in {{the high}} Arctic or at high elevations), the depth of a scrape nest can be {{critical}} to both the survival of developing eggs and the fitness of the parent bird incubating them. The scrape must be deep enough that eggs are protected from the convective cooling caused by cold winds, but shallow enough <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>and</b> the parent bird are not too exposed to the cooling influences of ground temperatures, particularly where the permafrost layer rises to mere centimeters below the nest. Studies have shown that an egg within a scrape nest loses heat 9% more slowly than an egg placed on the ground beside the nest; in such a nest lined with natural vegetation, heat loss is reduced by an additional 25%. The insulating factor of nest lining is apparently so critical to egg survival that some species, including Kentish plovers, will restore experimentally altered levels of insulation to their pre-adjustment levels (adding or subtracting material as necessary) within 24 hours.|$|E

Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having the barrel of a gun pressed against their heads, being dragged by the hair, being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a human shield. Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter. They were told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but were actually only {{a few feet from the}} ground.|$|E
