5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E

In late November 2007 a Hyderabad company, Goldstone Technologies, acquired world negative rights to 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including that of Mayabazar, to digitally remaster them in colour. C.Jagan Mohan of Goldstone Technologies' experience at All India Radio gave him the idea of converting the film's audio to DTS.

5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lung cavity, causing air {{to be pushed}} out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung {{is known as a}} bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth.

High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific guitar track that was used in note tracking {{to make it easier for}} the player to follow in the game.

5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since.

This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System. The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (aphelion).|$|E
5|$|Outer space, or just space, is {{the expanse}} {{that exists between}} {{celestial}} bodies, including Earth. Outer space is not completely empty, but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7kelvins (K) (−270.45°C; −454.81°F). Plasma with a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins {{in the space between}} galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in outer space; local concentrations have condensed into stars and galaxies. Observations indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Other observations indicate {{that the majority of the}} mass-energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label dark energy. Intergalactic space takes up most of <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.|$|E
5|$|Pierre-Simon Laplace {{independently}} {{developed and}} proposed a similar model in 1796 in his Exposition du systeme du monde. He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. His theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud—the protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) {{a series of}} gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. His model was similar to Kant's, except more detailed and on a smaller scale. While the Laplacian nebular model dominated in the 19th century, it encountered a number of difficulties. The main problem involved angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not {{be explained by the}} nebular model. As a result, astronomers largely abandoned this theory of planet formation {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
