5000|$|Lyocell {{is a form}} of rayon which {{consists}} of cellulose fibre made from dissolving pulp (bleached wood pulp) using dry jet-wet spinning. It was developed beginning in 1972 by a team at the now defunct American Enka fibers facility at Enka, North Carolina. This development was recognised by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) in 2003 by the awarding of their Henry E. Millson Award for Invention. The operating name for the fibre inside the Enka Organization was [...] "Newcell", and the development was carried through pilot plant scale before the work was halted. The fibre was developed further as <b>Tencel</b> in the 1980s by Courtaulds Fibres in Coventry, UK and at the Grimsby, UK pilot plant. The process was first commercialised at Courtaulds rayon factories at Mobile, Alabama (1990) and at the Grimsby plant (1998). In 1998 Courtaulds was acquired by Akzo Nobel, who combined the <b>Tencel</b> division with other fibre divisions under the Acordis banner, prior to selling them off to private equity (CVC Partners).

50|$|NMMO {{monohydrate}} {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} in the Lyocell process to produce <b>Tencel</b> fiber. It dissolves cellulose to form a solution called dope, and the cellulose is reprecipitated in a water bath to produce a fiber. The process is similar but not analogous to the viscose process. In the viscose process, cellulose is made soluble by conversion to its xanthate derivatives. With NMMO, cellulose is not derivatized but dissolves to give a homogeneous polymer solution. The resulting fiber is similar to viscose; this was observed, for example, for Valonia cellulose microfibrils. Dilution with water causes the cellulose to reprecipitate, i.e. the solvation of cellulose with NMMO is a water sensitive process.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tencel,</b> a {{regenerated}} {{cellulosic fibre}} is synthesised by an environmental friendly process. It can be dyed {{by the same}} dye types as recommended for other cellulosic fibres. The behaviour of reactive dyes on <b>Tencel</b> woven fabric varies with the type and the density of woven fabric. The highly crystalline <b>Tencel</b> fibre is less easy to dye uniformly by the continuous dyeing methods because of the short time of contact between the dye and fibre. The purpose of this work is to investigate the influences of weave structure on dyeing of standard <b>Tencel</b> fabric using reactive dyes applied by continuous dyeing methods. Programmes are developed using Matlab software to measure the fabric porosity and uniformity of fibre coloration (UFC) in the yarns of the woven fabric. UFC is also measured subjectively. Firstly, fabrics of four different weave structures (plain, 2 / 1, 3 / 1, 5 / 1 twill fabric) are studied. The visual depth and UFC standard deviation values is highest for the 2 / 1 twill fabric, gradually reducing towards the 5 / 1 twill fabric. Secondly, nine plain weave fabrics of different fabric densities are dyed using different padding procedures - a liquor temperature of 40 ⁰C with a 1 min dwell time and with a 5 min dwell time, and liquor at room temperature without any dwell time. The padded fabrics are then fixed by pad-steam, pad-dry-steam, pad-batch and pad-dry-thermosol continuous dyeing processes. To improve colour depth the plain weave fabrics are given a caustic pre-treatment and their dyeing characteristics are compared with untreated fabrics. The causticised fabrics are dyed using the same padding procedures, for comparison. The optimum dyeing procedure {{is found to be}} padding with a dwell time of 1 min in liquor at 40 ⁰C after caustic pre-treatment to achieve the highest visual depth, dye uptake, and uniformity of fibre coloration. The fibrillation tendency of the <b>Tencel</b> plain weave fabrics is also reduced using this procedure.
