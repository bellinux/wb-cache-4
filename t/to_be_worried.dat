5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
5|$|Past eruptions of Quizapu Crater ejected {{enormous}} amounts of ash that traveled as far as Brazil. After the 1932 eruption, the local vegetation was devastated, and the area remained barren until the 1990s, though human life was not impacted. Despite the extent of its eruptions, the threat to humans from Quizapu is relatively small because of the remote location of Cerro Azul. Nevertheless, the size of past eruptions is large enough for scientists <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried.</b> Evidence of a potentially deadly threat lies in a lahar at Descabezado Grande. Historically, lahars have killed thousands in the Andes. There is, however, a possibility that a large reservoir of rhyodacite magma may exist under the Azul–Descabezado complex. If this is the case, all previous eruptions in 1846–1967 were only preliminary, preclimactic leaks from the large magma chamber beneath, and a large caldera-forming eruption may be expected in the future.|$|E

500|$|Maguire, in London, {{promptly}} {{wrote to}} the Colonial Office, casting doubt on the letter's character {{on the grounds that}} it lacked the witnessing signature of an unbiased missionary. He concurrently wrote to Thompson, who was still in Bulawayo, to ask if there was any sign that the king had been misled during the repudiation letter's drafting. Around the same time, Robinson's strident attacks on parliamentary opponents of the Rudd Concession led to Lord Salisbury replacing him with Sir Henry Brougham Loch. Rhodes claimed not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried,</b> telling Shippard in a letter that [...] "the policy will not be altered". Indeed, by the end of June 1889, despite the removal of Robinson and the sensation caused by Lobengula's letter rejecting the concession, Rhodes had got his way: Lord Salisbury's concerns of Portuguese and German expansionism in Africa, coupled with Rhodes's personal exertions in London, prompted the Prime Minister to approve the granting of a royal charter. Rhodes returned victorious to the Cape in August 1889, while back in London Cawston oversaw the final preparations for the chartered company's establishment.|$|E
500|$|Cragh's {{recovery}} {{began the}} day after his hanging, but it was some time– one witness said 15 days– before he was able to stand unaided. That he did not recover more quickly cast doubt on the validity of the miracle, as miracles were supposed to be immediate, but [...] "partial miracles" [...] could be explained by the [...] "lukewarm faith of those who had made the vow". Once sufficiently recovered, Cragh was summoned to appear at Swansea Castle, before Lord and Lady Briouze. The chaplain, William of Codineston, was also present. Cragh explained, [...] "with great fear and apprehension" [...] according to the chaplain, that as he was being taken to the gallows he prayed to Thomas de Cantilupe to save him. His fear resulted from his concern that he might be executed again, and he had good reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried.</b> Although those who survived were usually pardoned, it was not unknown for them to be hanged again. Between the time of his hanging and his appearance at the castle Cragh may have convinced himself that he had been saved by Cantilupe, or he may simply have decided that it would be prudent for him {{to go along with the}} story for his own safety. Cragh went on to claim that as he was hanging from the gallows a bishop dressed all in white appeared, and saved him either by supporting his feet or by replacing his tongue in his mouth.|$|E

40|$|SummaryRisk {{perception}} and psychological concerns are relevant for understanding how people view Lyme disease. This study investigates the four separate outcomes of susceptibility, likelihood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> and fear for contracting Lyme disease. University students (n= 713) were surveyed about demographics, perceived health, Lyme disease knowledge, Lyme disease preventive behaviors, Lyme disease history, and Lyme disease miscellaneous variables. We {{found that women}} were associated with increased susceptibility and fear. Asian/Asian-American race/ethnicity was associated with increased worry and fear. Perceived good health was associated with increased likelihood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> and fear. Correct knowledge was associated with increased susceptibility and likelihood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed. Those who typically {{spend a lot of}} time outdoors were associated with increased susceptibility, likelihood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> and fear. In conclusion, healthcare providers and public health campaigns should address susceptibility, likelihood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> and fear about Lyme disease, and should particularly target women and Asians/Asian-Americans to address any possible misconceptions and/or offer effective coping strategies...|$|R

2500|$|The Armory Show, American's first {{large-scale}} {{introduction to}} European Modernism, was a mixed experience for Henri. He exhibited five paintings but, as a representational artist, he naturally understood that Cubism, Fauvism, and Futurism implied {{a challenge to}} his style of picture-making. [...] In fact, he had cause <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried.</b> [...] A man, not yet fifty, who saw himself in a vanguard {{was about to be}} relegated to the position of a conservative whose day had passed. Arthur B. Davies, an organizer of the show and a member of The Eight, was particularly disdainful of Henri's concern that the new European art would overshadow the work of American artists. [...] On the other hand, some Henri scholars have insisted that the reputation Henri earned in later histories as an opponent of the Armory Show and of Modernism in general is unfair and vastly overstates his objections. They point out that he had a keen interest in new art and recommended that his students avail themselves of opportunities to study it. [...] Art historian Sarah Vure notes that [...] " [...] early as 1910, Henri advised students to attend an exhibition of works by Henri Matisse and two years later he urged them to see the work of Max Weber, one of the most avant-garde of American moderns." [...] He urged painter Charles Sheeler to visit the Albert C. Barnes collection of modern art in Pennsylvania.|$|E
2500|$|Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism {{has also}} {{been seen as a}} primary source {{that can be used to}} examine freemasonry in Europe. Even though Freemasonry became a target in the {{paranoid}} literature that blamed the revolution partly on the activities of Masons, the work still had some historical value in regards to the group. Margaret Jacob argues that Barruels writings [...] "offer a point of departure for understanding the relationship between the Continental Enlightenment, as it was lived in the clubs, societies, and lodges of the eighteenth century, and the outbreak of the democratic revolutions in the late 1780s in Amsterdam, Brussels, and most important, Paris." [...] She believes that if readers can look past the paranoia within the text, it can provide information about how Freemasons were treated during the revolution. Jacob also sees value in the text because Barruel argued for a distinction between English Freemasonry and its Continental counterpart. Barruel believed that his allegations against the Continental Freemasons did not apply to the respectable English Freemasons. The activities of the English Freemasons were not the things that needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> about. He distinguishes between the circumstances of the French and the English and shows that the language used in each situation was important. He believes that the Masonic language about equality, liberty, and fraternity bears relation to the radical and democratic phase of the French Revolution and to Jacobin language. From the book, Margaret Jacob salvages the realization that language is important and that it can have a social force all of its own.|$|E

[...] He could not square the retention of Irish MPs at Westminster under the scheme for the second home rule bill. [...] Irish MPs could control English, Scottish, and Welsh affairs, so he argued.
