40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the strategising {{practices}} of sustainability champions at Transnet, a South African state-owned enterprise (SOE). The study set out to discover what these micro-strategising practices were and what strategic outcomes they had for the organisation at the corporate level of strategy praxis. The problem that this research sought to address was the need for greater progress towards corporate sustainability and the lack of research into the role, contributions and practices of sustainability champions in formal sustainability roles within relatively large organisations. This exploration was carried out in the form of a qualitative single-case study which drew on serial interviews (<b>two</b> <b>per</b> <b>participant)</b> and case documentation as sources of evidence. The data were analysed using Applied Thematic Analysis (ATA) in the CAQDAS software Atlas. ti. The study answered the research questions and found that sustainability champions engaged in seven sets of strategising practices with seven corresponding strategic outcomes. While it was not the intention of the study to develop a conceptual model, the process of synthesising the main findings resulted in a model termed the web of sustainable strategising. The study concludes that sustainability champions are strategists who aid their organisation in the pursuit of corporate sustainability while influencing the direction of macro-institutional arrangements towards sustainable development. These results cannot be generalised, but they are transferrable to similar contexts. Business ManagementM. Com. (Business Management...|$|E

Its diagnosis requires specific methods, and accurate information on its geographic distribution and global burden are lacking. We predicted prevalence, using Bayesian geostatistical modeling, and determined risk factors in northern Cambodia. Methods: From February to June 2010, {{we performed a}} cross-sectional study among 2, 396 participants from 60 villages in Preah Vihear Province, northern Cambodia. <b>Two</b> stool specimens <b>per</b> <b>participant</b> were examined using Koga agar plate culture and the Baermann method for detecting S. stercoralis infection. Environmental data was linked to parasitological and questionnaire data by location. Bayesian mixed logistic models were used to explore the spatial correlation of S. stercoralis infection risk. Bayesian Kriging was employed to predict risk at non-surveyed locations. Principal Findings: Of the 2, 396 participants, 44. 7 % were infected with S. stercoralis. Of 1, 071 strongyloidiasis cases, 339 (31. 6 %) were among schoolchildren and 425 (39. 7 %) were found in individuals under 16 years.

Data sources {{for this study}} included <b>two</b> semi-structured interviews <b>per</b> <b>participant,</b> {{in which they were}} asked about teaching the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, as well as about the introductory course in general. In addition, participants were asked to complete four cognitive tasks; the creation of a lesson plan, a concept map on how they would like their students to think about the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram {{at the end of the}} course, a Pathfinder network rating task, and responding to stereotypical student statements regarding the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The data was analyzed using a case study approach, followed by a discussion of themes that emerged from the data. Results indicate that participants had primarily affect and process goals for the course, rather than content goals. In addition, they wanted students to view the HR diagram as a part of a flow chart, where input physics (both observed and inferred properties of stars) leads to the construction of the HR diagram, which in turn is used to make inferences about stellar evolution. Participants identified several student difficulties with the HR diagram, among which interpreting a graph was the most pertinent. In several stereotypical student statements, participants responded using the exact same analogies to explain the concepts to the students.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} costs associated with the online intervention trial, Making Effective Nutritional Choices for Cancer Prevention (MENU), and to connect the findings to the study outcomes. Methods Using prospective data collected during the MENU development and implementation phases, we estimated overall costs per person, incremental costs for the three arms of the MENU intervention, and incremental costs per change in fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption across the studied population. The MENU study was conducted in five HMO sites of the Cancer Research Network. The number of eligible study participants who were enrolled in the study was 2, 540. Recruited participants were randomized into (1) an untailored website program, (2) tailored website program, or (3) tailored web program plus personalized counseling (HOBI) via email. The primary measures for these analyses include the total intervention costs, average cost <b>per</b> <b>participant,</b> and the average cost per mean change in daily intake of F&V, stratified by study arm. Results The mean change in F&V consumption was greater in both the tailored arm and statistically higher in the HOBI arm relative to the untailored arm. The untailored arm achieved + 2. 34 servings increase vs. the tailored website arm (+ 2. 68) and the HOBI arm (+ 2. 80) servings increase. Total intervention costs for MENU participants who completed the 12 -month follow-up assessment, by study arm, were estimated to be $ 197, 197 or $ 110 respectively. This translates to $ 69 <b>per</b> <b>participant</b> in the untailored web site intervention, $ 81 <b>per</b> <b>participant</b> in the tailored website intervention, and $ 184 <b>per</b> <b>participant</b> in the HOBI intervention and a cost per average change in F&V consumption to be $ 35, $ 27 and $ 61 respectively.
