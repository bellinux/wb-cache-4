5|$|In Sonora, the {{hurricane}} destroyed 450homes and damaged another 5,000dwellings in Etchojoa and Huatabampo, which both have large Mayo Indian populations. The storm's precipitation flooded nearby agricultural fields, stopping wheat production, forcing local government to fumigate {{the region to}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a dengue fever outbreak. In the Yaqui River valley, two people were killed, and another 70homes were destroyed by Henriette's winds. Throughout the state, 24,000families were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E

5|$|Hifz-ur Rahman saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War in 18771878, where she {{operated}} on the Danube to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Russian forces from crossing the river. While defending {{the port of}} Sulina, she engaged Russian gunboats in an inconclusive action. She was laid up for twenty years, until {{the outbreak of the}} Greco-Turkish War in 1897, which highlighted the badly deteriorated state of the Ottoman fleet. A large-scale reconstruction program was put in place, and Hifz-ur Rahman was rebuilt in the Imperial Arsenal in the early 1890s. Nevertheless, she saw no further service of any significance, and she was sold for scrap in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} Makoto Ishihara, a college student who attends a seminar camp on an island {{together}} with three other students; he also befriends three other people who he meets on the island. The game takes place {{over the course of}} a week, and consists of the player reading the story, occasionally making choices that affect the direction of the plot; on the sixth day, one of the female characters dies, and the game moves back in time to the beginning, letting the player use knowledge from the first set of six days to make new choices, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the character's death.|$|E

These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E

5|$|The British Library's {{commercial}} secure electronic delivery {{service was}} started in 2003 {{at a cost of}} £6 million. This offers more than 100 million items (including 280,000 journal titles, 50 million patents, 5 million reports, 476,000 US dissertations and 433,000 conference proceedings) for researchers and library patrons worldwide which were previously unavailable outside the Library because of copyright restrictions. In line with a government directive that the British Library must cover a percentage of its operating costs, a fee is charged to the user. However, this service is no longer profitable and has led to a series of restructures to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> further losses.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation.

WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E

5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game's history, TSR took {{no action}} against small publishers' {{production}} of D compatible material, and even licensed Judges Guild to produce D materials for several years, such as City State of the Invincible Overlord. This attitude {{changed in the}} mid-1980s when TSR took legal action to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> others from publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies. Although TSR took legal action against several publishers {{in an attempt to}} restrict third-party usage, it never brought any court cases to completion, instead settling out of court in every instance. TSR itself ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{involves}} guiding three playable woodland creatures through suburban {{houses to}} collect items and {{return them to}} their forest. House inhabitants and traps must be avoided or neutralized to succeed. The game's plot concerns Gladys Sharp's attempt to turn what's left of the animals' forest into a swimming pool; the animals <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> this by luring endangered species to the forest, making the forest a protected habitat. Over the Hedge received positive and average reviews from the gaming press, as well as gaming website IGN's 'Best Game No One Played' award for 2006. The game was praised for the technical achievement of displaying full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, but some reviewers found the gameplay repetitive.|$|E

5|$|Habsburg saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa in July 1866, though she was not {{significantly}} engaged during the battle. In 1870, she was used {{in a show of}} force to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the Italian annexation of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the Franco-Prussian War, though the Italians took the city regardless. The ship's armament was revised several times in the 1870s and 1880s, before she was ultimately withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola in 1886. She served in this role until 1898 when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 18991900.|$|E

His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{remained}} in the Austro-Hungarian fleet for the next twenty years, but severely reduced naval budgets owing to Hungarian disinterest in naval matters led to an uneventful career. In 1870, Habsburg was used {{in a show of}} force to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the Italian annexation of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the Franco-Prussian War, though the Italians took the city regardless. They were rearmed with newer guns in 1874 and again in 1882. Both ships were converted for secondary duties in 1886, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max becoming a tender to the gunnery training school from 1889 to 1908, while Habsburg was employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola until 1898, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap. Erzherzog Ferdinand Max {{remained in}} the inventory until 1916 when she too was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E
5|$|The {{furniture}} store Haskins, which originated in Shepton Mallet in 1938, has its principal showroom in the High Street within Haskins Retail Centre, {{which also includes}} {{a number of others}} shops including Aldi supermarket, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home, Pavers Shoes and an outlet clothing store. Retail jobs in the town increased in number in 2006–7 when a new shopping development, including a large Tesco supermarket, a clothes store and other retailers, was constructed on a site just south of the town centre, which had once been a factory making Clarks shoes and later Doc Martens boots. This development attracted national media attention when protesters occupied the site to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the felling of an avenue of trees dating back to the 19th century. It has also divided opinion in the town, between those who hoped it would help to revitalise the town, and others who feared that local traders would be unable to compete, leading to a further decline of Shepton Mallet's High Street. There is also the Mulberry Factory Shop located on Kilver Street, near to the former Mulberry headquarters.|$|E
