25|$|September: Aldershot {{continued}} their early unbeaten {{run with a}} third consecutive 1–1 draw at home to Northampton, though the Shots needed a Ben Harding volley in the 5th minute of injury time to salvage a point. The next game - away to promotion-chasing Port Vale - promised <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> test, and this was proved right as the club suffered its first loss of the season, Gary Roberts scoring the only goal of the game. On 16 September the management brought in winger Marlon Jackson on loan from Bristol City, a player who assistant manager Gary Owers believed would help the team in the attacking third. Wycombe were the next visitors to the Recreation Ground, which meant a return for former Shots' boss Gary Waddock, who led the club to the Football Conference championship in the 2007–08 season. The match {{failed to live up}} to expectations, ending in a dull goalless draw. This fifth low-scoring draw of the season encouraged fears that the side were not good enough up front, and were not converting the few chances being presented to them. The squad responded by taking a 2–0 lead away to Stockport in their next game, only to throw it away in the final minutes to draw yet again. A win did come before the end of the month, however, Morgan again netting in the final ten minutes to snatch all three points away to Torquay.|$|E

25|$|United {{made their}} {{debut in the}} 2015 U.S. Open Cup three nights after the loss in Orlando, with the team's first ever trip to the Steel City to face the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. Pittsburgh proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> opponent, taking their MLS {{opposition}} into extra time, but D.C. United prevailed with two goals in the overtime period, to win 3–1, on goals by Coria, Opare and Deleon. United returned to RFK four nights later, where they rediscovered their home field winning ways, with yet another striking comeback, to defeat the New England Revolution, by a now very familiar 2–1 score. United fell behind in the first half, when one-time D.C. United striker, Charlie Davies put the visitors in front in the 10th minute. The home team struggled {{for much of the}} game, but salvaged a win on 2 second-half goals by Chris Rolfe. Espindola had the assist on the first goal, and Rolfe's game-winner came on a penalty kick. Fixture congestion forced Coach Ben Olsen to use a decidedly second-choice lineup on a midweek trip to Chicago, but the visiting team came away with a surprising 1–0 victory. The game-winner was scored in the 73rd minute, when Conor Doyle struck an absolute cannon of a shot that was probably the team's most impressive goal of the year to that point. United remained on the road with a trip to Toronto {{at the end of that}} week. The teams played to a 0-0 scoreless draw in very adverse weather conditions, with rain and very heavy winds. Despite being outplayed, United nearly won the game in the last minute, but Jairo Arrieta's bid for Goal of the Year, a bicycle attempt, was frantically tipped over the bar by Toronto FC goalie, Chris Konopka.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} several years, rugby league lay dormant in South Africa {{and it was not}} until the 1960s when talks of {{creating}} a national side began. After much discussion within South Africa, it was eventually agreed that a national side would play a touring Great Britain and then undertake a tour of Australasia. The first South African national side played their first competitive fixture on 23 August 1962 and put on a good showing against the much stronger British but eventually lost by nineteen points 49–30. The following two fixtures turned out to be much the same with the South Africans being defeated on another two occasions but putting in good performances whilst never being comprehensively beaten. The South Africans embarked on their first tour eleven months later with a twenty-four-man squad that included several former Springboks. The tour started with several friendly fixtures against various minor representative sides where they gained two comfortable victories; the first international fixture of the tour took place in Brisbane against the world champion Australians and the South Africans performed with courage but eventually lost the match 34–6. The following test was played a week later in Sydney that again saw the team put in a tough effort but would lose again 54–21. South Africa would leave Australia without an international win and be low on confidence heading to New Zealand to play a sole fixture against the New Zealand national side whom were expected to win comfortably. However, the match turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> encounter and surprisingly saw the team gain its first international victory 4–3 The South Africans featured several Australian players bought in to cover injuries and improve the quality of the side and so the match against New Zealand is not counted as a test match.|$|E
25|$|De la Union's {{attempt to}} relieve Bellegarde failed at the Battle of San-Lorenzo de la Muga on 13 August. The French {{sustained}} 800 casualties including General of Brigade Guillaume Mirabel killed. Augereau led 9,000 {{men on the}} right, Pérignon had 16,000 troops in the center while Sauret commanded 9,000 on the left. The Spanish attacked with 45,000 troops including 4,000 cavalry. De la Union tried to overwhelm Augereau with 22,000 men but made the same mistake as in the May attack by attacking in six columns. This time the struggle lasted 16 hours in which Augereau was nearly driven from the field but held it at the end. The French took only 140 prisoners and killed 1,336 of their enemies. Sauret had repelled an attack on his wing while Victor's brigade had repulsed a seaborne assault on the coast. At last, Dugommier ordered Augereau to abandon the cannon foundry and move toward the center. Bellegarde proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> nut to crack and its 1,000 surviving defenders only capitulated on 17 September. The French won a decisive victory at the Battle of the Black Mountain fought from 17 to 20 November. Uniquely, both army commanders Dugommier and de la Union were killed in action. The French had 36,700 troops to oppose 46,000 entrenched Spanish. Augereau began the attack at dawn on the 17th and began rolling up the Spanish left. After Dugommier {{was killed by a}} Spanish shell that morning, Pérignon took command of the army and called off the attack for two days. General of Division Jean Baptiste Beaufort de Thorigny took command of the center. On the 20th, Augereau's assault recommenced and captured the key Roure redoubt. De la Union led his cavalry in a countercharge and was later found dead with two bullet wounds. Taking few prisoners, the French massacred 8,000 of their foes as they overran all the defensive works on the left and center. The undefeated Spanish right wing under Lieutenant General Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu was also compelled to retreat. The French lost about 3,000 killed and wounded. Pérignon quickly seized Figueres and bluffed the powerful Sant Ferran fortress into surrendering on 28 November with 9,000 Spanish prisoners and 171 guns.|$|E

His rivals each had at least one untouched engine in reserve; Webber had two. Nevertheless, Alonso set himself the target to score points in Singapore. He also acknowledged that his car was not the fastest in the field and felt he needed five podiums in the season's five remaining races. Webber stated that he was expecting Singapore <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> weekend for him after he had retired from the event in 2008 and 2009, but felt there was still some time before a driver clinched the championship.

I go to Singapore to win." [...] Hamilton felt Alonso was the favourite to win the Singapore Grand Prix and viewed the Spanish driver as his main rival for the Drivers' Championship which was shared by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Button himself believed Alonso would have an extra advantage as the Spaniard's teammate Massa was out of contention for the title.|$|E

2500|$|... 1986 proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> {{year for}} both Mansell and the Williams team, {{off the track}} at least. After a {{pre-season}} test session at the Paul Ricard Ciruit {{in the south of}} France, team owner Frank Williams was involved in a horrific road accident which left him a tetraplegic. Williams would not return to the scene until making a surprise appearance at the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch where Mansell and Piquet finished 1–2. Williams's absence from the day-to-day running of the team actually created tension between the team and engine supplier Honda. The Japanese giant regarded dual World Champion Nelson Piquet as the team's number one driver (they were reportedly paying the bulk of Piquet's multimillion-dollar retainer) and were reportedly unhappy that the team's co-owner and Technical Director Patrick Head did not rein in Mansell during races and allowed him to take both points and wins from Piquet. As it was, while Williams dominated the Constructors' Championship, the two drivers took enough points from each other to allow McLaren's Alain Prost to sneak through and win the Drivers' Championship.|$|E

Luis Scola, who was held down to 13 points in the quarterfinal match against Lithuania two years ago at the World Championship, led Argentina with 32 points. Lithuania rebounded from the loss playing with Nigeria, which also served to avenge the only defeat in the Qualifying Tournament. Playing exemplary defense against the Nigerian bigs Al-Farouq Aminu and Ike Diogu, Lithuania handily won 72–53. Next was another defeat, as France rode Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to win the game 74–82. The following game was against USA, which had just broke recordswith their 156–73 blowout of Nigeria. Right from the beginning, Lithuania proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> opponent for Team USA, with Linas Kleiza scoring 25 points, and former Duke player Martynas Pocius having 7 rebounds and 6 assists.

40|$|The e-newspaper introduction- {{charting}} infrastructure {{influence on}} production, distribution and consumption Carina Ihlström, PhD * and Maria Åkesson** Keywords: E-paper technology, infrastructure, preferences The newspaper firms <b>are</b> facing <b>an</b> innovation, the e-newspaper published on e-paper technology. The e-paper is reflecting, giving the same reader experience as paper (such as high contrast {{and the possibility}} to read in sunlight) and is thin, flexible and non-sensitive. The e-newspaper combines the readability and overview from the printed newspaper with the possibilities of online media such as constant updates, interactivity and video, and <b>is</b> predicted <b>to</b> replace the printed edition in the long run. The introduction of the e-newspaper will most certainly affect the way the news is produced (Appelgren et al, 2004), distributed and consumed in the future. With the introduction of online newspapers a decade ago, the newspaper firms experienced both organizational and production challenges (Ihlström & Palmer, 2002) and the online newspapers indeed created new consumption habits (Aikat, 1998; Sundar, 1999). However, it has <b>been</b> difficult <b>to</b> find ways of profiting from the online ventures (Ihlström & Henfridsson, 2005), which partly depends on the infrastructure. Moreover, most newspaper firms nowadays offer several mobile services, such as SMS, MMS, and WAP, creating some revenue, but also in this context the infrastructure plays a role. After decades in the laboratory, e-paper technologies seem posed for commercialization starting as early as 2006 [1]. The e-paper technologies are developing rapidly, e. g. Hewlett-Packard <b>is</b> testing material <b>to</b> replace newsprint, and discusses <b>a</b> gadget that <b>is</b> very lightweight, very thin and potentially flexible. “The future newspaper could feature a plastic sheet display on which images and information can be uploaded, through either a wireless or USB connection.
