"Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other" [...] (1981) {{is a song}} by Latin country {{musician}} Ned Sublette, whose music, {{according to}} Howard Cohen, features a [...] "lilting West Texas waltz (3/4 time at about 60–90 beats per minute) feel". It is, according to Gene Tyranny, [...] "the famous gay cowboy song".

500|$|Shooting often ran for 12 {{hours at}} a time and led to {{frequent}} minor injuries among the cast and production staff, while some developed intense feelings of claustrophobia in the confined space. Gordon suggests that the uncomfortable working conditions made the performances of the cast more realistic, but concedes that although, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> this paid off {{in terms of what we}} got on the screen for the budget, but the circumstances were very difficult." [...] In the absence of suitable facilities inside the caves, the personnel established administrative, dressing and make-up rooms in a car park some distance from the filming area.

"Blood Ties" [...] {{featured}} the first appearances of Peter Gerety, Jon Seda and Callie Thorne as regular cast members on [...] Thorne portrayed Laura Ballard, a former Seattle homicide unit detective, marking the character's {{first appearance in}} the series. Gerety and Seda each previously played their respective characters in guest appearances on the show; Seda's character Paul Falsone {{first appeared in the}} two-part [...] finale. Stuart Gharty, Gerety's character, is described as a transplant from the department's internal affairs department. Executive producer Tom Fontana said he thought the new cast additions would create drama and tension between the characters: [...] "It's stimulating to add new people, because you're not feeling like you're writing or acting the same scene for the thousandth time, and I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> three of them are very different than any other characters we've had on the show." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Hankinson, [...] "One of {{the best}} parts of the episode {{centered}} around Brittany and Santana, but I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> the principals—Artie, Finn, Rachel, and Quinn too—did a great job portraying the tension and distrust pervading the team." [...] Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times felt the show was [...] "absurdly preachy" [...] on the matter of rumors, though he said the episode was [...] "decent". The scene in the motel room with Sam, Rachel, Finn and Sam's brother and sister was called [...] "arguably the most affecting scene of the entire episode" [...] by Handlen, and Poniewozik wrote that [...] "Chord Overstreet sold Sam's feeling of loss". Canning felt otherwise: [...] "It may have had a better impact if we cared more about Sam or if Chord Overstreet had delivered more believable tears, but as things were, it was just some ordinary, blah drama." ...|$|E

We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; {{and how it is}} that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar;...|$|E
500|$|Although the Parents Television Council, a {{frequent}} Family Guy critic, did not name Family Guy its [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] for [...] "Road to the Multiverse", it did {{refer to this}} episode in its negative review of the following episode, [...] "Family Goy". The review noted that {{the appearance of the}} Griffin family's Jewish neighbor, Mort Goldman, in [...] "Multiverse" [...] was notable since, in the Disney parody, Mort was beaten to a bloody pulp by Disney-inspired versions of the cast– a reference to Walt Disney's purported antisemitism. The review goes on to state, [...] "apparently, in Seth MacFarlane's mind, the best way to fight anti-Semitism is with more anti-Semitism. One must wonder what young, angry, disaffected bigots tuning into the show must <b>think.</b> <b>All</b> they see is a nebbish stereotype getting his teeth knocked out of his skull and a blood-soaked Star of David tumbling to the floor." ...|$|E
500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E

5000|$|His last key {{departure}} from Austin lies in Searle’s claim that {{four of his}} universal ‘acts’ do not need ‘extra-linguistic’ contexts to succeed.

500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I {{thought that was a}} very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>all</b> that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew." [...] "One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E
500|$|Sire Records had marketed the [...] "Everybody" [...] single as if Madonna {{was a black}} artist. This {{misconception}} {{was cleared}} by {{the release of the}} music video for the song. Regarding the importance of shooting a music video for the song, Madonna commented that, [...] "If I didn't have a video, I don't <b>think</b> <b>all</b> the kids in the Midwest would know about me. It takes the place of touring. Everybody sees them everywhere. That really {{has a lot to do}} with the success of my album." [...] She invited Sire Records executives, including Stein and Rosenblatt, to the New York nightclub Danceteria. She performed [...] "Everybody" [...] on the dancefloor, wearing a top hat and tails. On the night of the performance, Madonna's friend Haoui Montaug introduced her to the 300 strong audience. Cheered by them, Madonna and her dancers performed their choreographed dance moves, later described as a 'disco act backed by avant-garde dancers.' Seeing the performance, they also realised that Madonna appeared visually stunning. They ordered an in-house video of [...] "Everybody" [...] to be sent to the clubs around the country which used dance videos.|$|E

5000|$|The phrase, {{along with}} other calls from English {{football}} matches, appears in New Order's song [...] "World In Motion", although in that case Wolstenholme re-recorded it with the slightly different words [...] "Well, some of the crowd are on the pitch. They <b>think</b> it's <b>all</b> over. Well it is now". The British band The Dentists called their first album Some People Are on the Pitch They <b>Think</b> It's <b>All</b> Over It Is Now in Wolstenholme's honour; the LP begins {{with a sample of}} Wolstenholme's original commentary. Track #3 on British folk metal act Skyclad's EP Jig-a-Jig is called [...] "They <b>Think</b> It's <b>All</b> Over". The song contains the phrase [...] "They <b>think</b> it's <b>all</b> over. Well is it now?" [...] in its chorus and includes several references to the 1966 FIFA World Cup.|$|R
