5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E

Although Glenn Robinson, Jason Terry and Abdur-Rahim combined to average 57.9 ppg and become the highest-scoring trio in the league for the 2002–03 season, the Hawks {{failed to make the}} playoffs again. With an average of 19.9 ppg and 8.4 rpg, Abdur-Rahim played in {{all but one of the}} Hawks' games. By the end of the season, Hawks General Manager Billy Knight decided major changes had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the franchise to move forward, and Abdur-Rahim was traded the next season.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis's Oak Street Cinema, a volunteer-run {{repertory}} cinema, ran films {{seven days}} per week until cutbacks in programming had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> financial reasons. A collective of the Oak Street volunteers formed Take-Up Productions, which was established to promote showing films not typically screened in larger movie houses. The organization began with outdoor screenings, starting with Watermelon Man, which was projected against a white brick wall behind a coffee shop, {{and then began to}} rent out theaters throughout the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area, including the Riverview, Heights, and Parkway. Some screenings, such as that of Lawrence of Arabia and a series of Alfred Hitchcock films, drew hundreds of viewers.|$|E

On 9 October, Adolf Hitler ordered plans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> an invasion of the Low Countries, to use them as a base against Great Britain and to pre-empt a similar attack by the Allied forces, which could threaten the vital Ruhr Area.|$|E

5|$|Three swords {{are carried}} before the monarch into the Abbey: the blunt Sword of Mercy (also known as Curtana), the Sword of Spiritual Justice and the Sword of Temporal Justice. All three are {{believed}} to have been supplied at the time of JamesVI&I between 1610 and 1620, probably {{by a member of the}} Worshipful Company of Cutlers, using blades that were created in the 1580s by Italian bladesmiths Giandonato and Andrea Ferrara. Since the 15thcentury it had been usual practice for new swords <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> each coronation. Sold in the civil war, they were returned at the Restoration, and their first recorded use was at the coronation of JamesII in 1685.|$|E
5|$|Wilde was {{initially}} {{buried in the}} Cimetière de Bagneux outside Paris; in 1909 his remains were disinterred and transferred to Père Lachaise Cemetery, inside the city. His tomb there was designed by Sir Jacob Epstein. It was commissioned by Robert Ross, who asked for a small compartment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950. The modernist angel depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete with male genitalia, which have since been vandalised; their current whereabouts are unknown. In 2000, Leon Johnson, a multimedia artist, installed a silver prosthesis to replace them.|$|E
5|$|After {{creating}} custom plugins for the 3D {{computer graphics}} software, Burrows {{claimed that the}} team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes. In order to the play the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always {{in danger of becoming}} too large for the PlayStation Portable's Universal Media Disc. The game's cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports.|$|E

5|$|In 1956 growing {{diplomatic}} {{tensions in}} the Middle East, tensions that would soon culminate in the Suez Crisis, resulted in the resurrection of 69 Squadron. On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating the squadron at Ramat David, with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer. The squadron was soon tasked with its first mission, allocating two B-17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Mystère delivery flights from France to Israel. The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities. As Israel purchased more jet fighters, however, room had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the new arrivals, and in September 1956 the IAF ordered the squadron to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve. By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation (later Israeli Aircraft Industries) at Lod, but only three weeks later, on October 25, the IAF activated the squadron once more.|$|E
5|$|Sam Raimi {{originally}} {{envisioned the}} idea for Thor after making Darkman (1990); he met Stan Lee and pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, {{but they did not}} understand it. Thor was abandoned until April 1997, when Marvel Studios was beginning to expand rapidly. The film gained momentum after the success of X-Men (2000). The plan was for Thor <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> television. UPN was in talks for airing it; excited by the prospect, they pushed for a script and approached Tyler Mane to play Thor. In May 2000, Marvel Studios brought Artisan Entertainment to help finance it as a film, but by June 2004 the project still had yet to be patronised by a studio. Sony Pictures Entertainment finally purchased the film rights, and in December 2004 David S. Goyer was in negotiations to write and direct. By 2005, though there were talks between Goyer and Marvel, Goyer was no longer interested, though at this point the film was still set to be distributed through Sony Pictures.|$|E
5|$|Since 1888, when Mahdist rebels {{forced the}} {{evacuation}} of then governor Emin Pasha, the Lado Enclave had been occupied by rebels {{under the leadership of}} Emir Arabi Dafalla. Rejaf was their strongest fortified position in the area, and it was there Arabi Dafalla stationed his equipment and soldiers. The establishment of Mahdist Sudan had provided the context for European powers to commence the invasion and colonization of the Sudan, in which King Leopold desperately wanted to take part in order to expand his Congolese empire. However, a direct military campaign into the area was not an option; Leopold {{would not have been able}} to get permission from either the French or the British according to the rules laid out in the 1884 Berlin Conference, especially considering both nations were looking to annex the Sudan themselves. King Leopold II therefore decided to disguise his campaign into the Sudan as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim the Lado Enclave from the Mahdists, although he inended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past the boundaries of Belgian territory, first to Fashoda and then on to Khartoum. After receiving a new loan of 6.5 million francs from the Belgian government in 1895, Leopold ordered preparations <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the execution of his plan.|$|E

5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team had gone off the rails, scrapping the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the Core team were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E
5|$|The canal was {{authorised}} by an Act of Parliament {{passed on}} 6 June 1791, which created The Company and Proprietors of the Neath Canal Navigation, who had powers to raise £25,000 by {{the issue of}} shares, and an additional £10,000 if necessary. As well as building the canal, the Canal Company could build inclined planes, railways or rollers if required, and could optionally use {{the bed of the}} River Neath. The canal was to run from Glynneath (called Abernant at the time), which was not as far up the valley as Pontneddfechan, to Melincryddan Pill at Neath, where it would join the river. Thomas Dadford was employed as Engineer, and construction started from Neath, northwards towards Glynneath. The canal had reached the River Neath at Ynysbwllog by 1792, when Dadford resigned to take up work on the Monmouthshire Canal. He was replaced by Thomas Sheasby, who failed to complete the canal by the November 1793 deadline given to him, and was arrested in 1794 for irregularities in the accounts of the Glamorganshire Canal. The canal company completed the building work by 1795, using direct labour, although the lock into the river was never built. Rebuilding of locks and other improvements continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> several years afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} modest Coronet of Frederick {{was made in}} 1728 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of GeorgeII. It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by CharlesII which states that the heir apparent of the Crown shall use and bear a coronet of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch surmounted by a ball and cross. The single arch denotes that the Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal children, whose coronets have no arches. Frederick never wore his gold coronet; instead, it was placed on a cushion {{in front of him}} when he took his seat in the House of Lords. It was used by his son, GeorgeIII, then his son, GeorgeIV, and last used by EdwardVII when he was Prince of Wales. Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for his son, the future GeorgeV, to wear at Edward's coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on this one is raised. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales. After he became king in 1936, EdwardVIII abdicated later the same year and, as the Duke of Windsor, went into exile in France, taking the 1902 coronet with him; it remained abroad until his death in 1972. In its absence, another coronet had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the investiture of Prince Charles in 1969. Unlike the defunct coronets, this one is {{not a part of the}} Crown Jewels but the Honours of the Principality of Wales.|$|E
