Built around The Meters' funky beat-driven percussion, [...] "1 Thing" [...] finds Amerie lamenting an aspect of a relationship that keeps her satisfied. Even if other factors are less than positive, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> keeps her hooked ("It's this one thing that's got me trippin'"). Amerie said that {{the inspiration for the}} song came from a conversation she had with Harrison [...] "about relationships and how there's always one thing that keeps you attracted to someone. No matter what they do or how they act, there's that one undeniable thing that keeps you coming back." [...] She told Blender that the [...] "one thing" [...] "could be bringing flowers, or something more ... physical. People think I'm just this good girl, but there are other sides they don't see." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gould also {{addressed}} the issue of selfish genes in his essay [...] "Caring groups and selfish genes". Gould acknowledged that Dawkins was not imputing conscious action to genes, but simply using a shorthand metaphor commonly found in evolutionary writings. To Gould, the fatal flaw was that [...] "no matter how much power Dawkins wishes to assign to genes, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he cannot give them – direct visibility to natural selection." [...] Rather, the unit of selection is the phenotype, not the genotype, because it is phenotypes that interact with the environment at the natural-selection interface. So, in Kim Sterelny's summation of Gould's view, [...] "gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes." [...] Richard Dawkins replied to this criticism in a later book, The Extended Phenotype, that Gould confused particulate genetics with particulate embryology, stating that genes do [...] "blend", as far as their effects on developing phenotypes are concerned, but that they do not blend as they replicate and recombine down the generations.|$|E

60|$|But before {{proceeding}} further, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that had {{got to be}} understood between us, and understood clearly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{you have}} forgotten," [...] said Mr. Holiday, [...] "and which, it strikes me, is a decided {{objection}} to your plan; and that is, that the steamer for to-morrow, from New Haven, leaves at midnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am glad,' said Phoebe, 'that {{you knew}} too well {{to think there}} was any real difference. Indeed, the superiority is all yours, except in mere money. And mine, I am sure, need not stand in the way, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> does.' ...|$|E

'Indeed I am {{unworthy of}} {{anything}} so charming,' answered the cloud; 'but {{you make a}} mistake again in what you say. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is even more powerful than I, and that is the wind. Ah, here he comes, you can see for yourself.' ...|$|E
60|$|Luc. Sir, {{though your}} song <b>was</b> pleasant, yet <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> amiss in it,--that was, your {{rallying}} of religion.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> however, which threw a {{cloud over}} the rejoicing {{with which the}} conquerors hailed this memorable victory.|$|R

6000|$|... "But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I don't quite understand. Your navy, your ships. There, surely, we have you: {{sooner or}} later that whole proud fleet in the Kiel Canal will come out under fire of our guns and be sunk {{to the bottom of}} the sea. There, at least, we conquer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, as a rule," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply, [...] "only {{sometimes}} Henry intervenes. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the modern servant dislikes, it is sarcasm, and sarcasm is Henry's favourite weapon {{when he wants}} to be really disagreeable. Generally speaking, I think a servant would rather be sworn at." ...|$|E

60|$|If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{disturbs}} the complacency of a {{great artist}} of the Halls it is the consciousness of sharing his or her triumphs with performing birds and animals, but of course Joan {{was not to be}} expected to know that.

"We can't resist you, captain," [...] said Jessie, [...] "but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> we must {{positively}} insist on, namely, {{that you}} come and sit in this room of an evening.

6000|$|... "From {{the little}} I know of this case," [...] replied the Colonel, [...] "I must judge {{that you believe}} Mr. Cragg to be a counterfeiter, and that his mysterious {{business}} is--to counterfeit.
