In addition, the growing investment in renewable energies and exploration of the presence of oil in Uruguay have pushed the nuclear debate to the background. According to Ramón Mendez: Well, it seems pretty clear. For two reasons; firstly, when debate started in 2007-2008, none of this existed. And there was not a policy to 20 years agreed upon by the political parties. We did not know we could be so successful in the production of renewable energy at such competitive prices. So the picture changed. Secondly, Fukushima happened. And there are two important things: first, of the fifty-odd countries in the world who were analyzing the nuclear option, there were only two or three left, and they have not decided. SomeCountries that were nuclear, are now retiring nuclear energy, such as Germany and many others. But another consequence was, from the investors perspective, nuclear energy stopped being attractive.

40|$|Information to stop desert {{encroachment}} in The Gambia Cue: Desertification {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious environmental problems facing Africa today. In parts of The Gambia, the loss of agricultural land to the desert is particularly serious, with drought, deforestation and the common occurrence of bush fires contributing to the problem. Protecting and enhancing the remaining forest resources is vital, and has been a key focus for work by the Gambia World Development Agency, a non-government organization based in the capital Banjul. Much of that work has involved spreading information and new technologies to people in the affected areas, and the organisation has used a wide variety of approaches to deliver that information. Susanna Thorp spoke to Kebba Bah, the Executive Director of the Agency, about the different approaches his organisation is using. She also wanted to find out about a new resource centre, recently established to co-ordinate natural resource management strategies in the country. But Mr Bah began by explaining how his agency had been helping communities to the north of the Gambia River, one of the most seriously affected areas, to learn how establishing community forests could help to protect their scarce forest resources. IN:		?We had a series of exchange visits? OUT:	?natural resources in the Gambia. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 26 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Kebba Bah, Executive Director of The Gambia World Development Agency. Transcript Bah	We had a series of exchange visits, for them to visit some successful community forests. But in the East areas where we are also operating we have encouraged them to be involved in agroforestry so that they would help revive the vegetation that is affected. Thorp	So you are encouraging them to grow particular trees that have certain properties that will be useful? Bah	<b>That?s</b> <b>true.</b> In some areas we incorporated improved cooking stoves, and they realised how much they would save in terms of fuel and walking distances of 7 - 10 km, especially the women to get some firewood, and this has turned out to be a very successful study, quite a lot of the women are doing it now in some villages. Thorp	Now you said one way of sharing information is actually by taking farmers from one area and showing them what?s happening in the successful areas, but you must be using other means of disseminating and communicating that information. What have you been doing to share that information more widely? Bah	The information we have been using the national radio station, and sometimes we use some commercial radio stations, community radio stations. We organise awareness days where we bring farmers together annually to share their experiences, that?s another area. We also encourage school children to come up with posters and to come up with dramas, as a debate, and of course, teachers involved in environmental studies disseminate and use this in their own curriculum, actually. But right now with the newly approved project by CTA of establishing an regional information centre, we are looking forward to continuously collaborating with Department of Forestry, Department of Agricultural Services and some of our other traditional partners in developing this regional natural resource management centre, funded by CTA, to be a centre of excellence to serve natural resource dissemination in the area. Thorp	So how do you think that?s going to change the way in which information is shared and natural resource management can be managed more carefully? Bah	Of course it will go a long way in disseminating information, especially in areas of bush fires, which is a major concern for the Gambia. It would go a long way in coming in with posters, coming with messages and coming with radio programs, so that we would hire resource persons, specialists in different sectors of natural resource management. We use them as panelists and disseminate this information over the media and over the radio television and radio Gambia and community radios, and the audience are given the chance to get back with questions in different languages that are spoken in the Gambia. Thorp	So you can have those agencies really sharing knowledge amongst themselves so that they have a common understanding of the different problems, but also you?re going at it now in a more holistic way, because instead of just providing information on soil or information on water, you can integrate that information and really give people what they need. Bah	That is true, because the human resources are not a problem in the Gambia, it?s a question of coordinating them and bringing them on board to see how they can best be effectively utilised. Thorp	So, a positive move then for good natural resource management in the Gambia for the future? Bah	For the future it is to maintain and develop this resource centre and bring all specialists on natural resource management of different domains under one umbrella, and come up with a committee that gathers advice and guidance to see how best we can forge ahead and save natural resources in the Gambia.

40|$|Cue: Faced with {{unreliable}} {{rainfall and}} rising temperatures, farmers may feel powerless; their productivity seems {{to depend on}} forces beyond their control. But while the battle to maintain food production may be getting harder, {{it is not true}} that farmers have no power. Protecting and improving the quality of their soil, for instance, can {{have a major impact on}} crop yields, and can even help to compensate for low rainfall. In Zambia, the Programme Against Malnutrition(PAM) is currently advising farmers to practice what is called ?Conservation farming? as a way of protecting their fields from erosion and building soil fertility and water-holding capacity. This was just one of several strategies that Chris Kakunta learned about when he spoke to Hurrington Kanema, PAM?s Central Province co-ordinator. Hurrington begins by explaining some of the other ways that the organisation is helping farmers to cope with the changing climate. IN:		?One of the things that? OUT:		?made use of by the plants. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 28 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Hurrington Kanema of Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition. Transcript Kanema	One of the things that we are doing is that we are promoting crop diversification. We believe that with a wide range of crops being grown, farmers are able to cope with these dry spells, because then they plant a range of crops which are tolerant to different levels of moisture limitations. For example, we are trying to help farmers to plant a cereal crop, but also within those cereal crops, we try to encourage them to plant the short season varieties, say of maize or sorghum, which mature in a short period, so that even when we have a dry spell, farmers will have some food at the end of the season. Secondly we are trying to promote root and tuber crops. One of the crops we have been working on is cassava. In these areas where we are, in Central Province for example, cassava has not been a traditional crop, but now it has become necessary, because cassava is more drought tolerant, and once you plant it you are assured that you are going to have your food over a long period of time. In addition to that one of the other strategies we have embarked on is conservation farming. Farmers need to use methods which will help them grow crops even when there is very little moisture. Kakunta	And what methods are we talking about here? Kanema	Some of the conservation methods we are using here, are the basins, as we can see these holes around here, so that moisture will be captured in these basins for a longer period. Kakunta	There are two types of holes I can see here. There are these smaller ones, and these bigger ones. Why are they so different? Kanema	What we call the basins are just dug-out small holes which they use for planting. And then there are what we call the ripped lines, the lines which are ripped with oxen. So farmers with work oxen, we encourage them to use the ripper: it?s faster, they can also cultivate a bigger area. You know when you dig these small holes with a hand hoe, it?s quite hard, there?s a lot of work involved. But with work oxen you are able to open up the furrows very early and be able to plant in these furrows. Kakunta	You mentioned that these holes are actually able to conserve some moisture. How exactly is that done? Kanema	What we do is when we open up these holes, they are about 15 cm deep, we then put in some manure, and they are covered and we leave just about 5 cm or so. So that when the rains come the farmers can plant, and water is captured in these holes. Because it has been dug, this area is very soft, so when it rains, the little water which falls goes straight into these holes, and it is stored in the soil, and it is made available to the seed which we are going to plant. So this moisture is not wasted, it does not just run off. So the idea of conservation is we are conserving not just the moisture, but also the nutrients. Kakunta	So in other words you are actually conserving the soils as well as helping the farmers cope with the changes in the weather? Kanema	<b>That?s</b> <b>true.</b> Because you see, the idea of conservation is that we are not ploughing the whole area; the farmer is just digging this place where he needs to put his seed. The rest of the land remains intact; the stubble or whatever is left in the field to add to the nutrients of the soil. So you are improving your soil. And in the long term you are also improving the structure of the soil so that it captures more moisture; the nutrients are there in the soil, that is why it is conservation farming. And in addition to that you improve the long term well-being of the farmer. They are able to get a better crop than when they are all the time ploughing. Most of the time you will see when they plough, when there is so much rain, the rain just washes away your soil, so there is a lot of erosion taking place because of that. But with an area like this, where they have not ploughed, they have just made holes where they plant, there is no run-off, very little run-off. The little water running off goes into these basins, and it is made use of by the plants. End of track.
