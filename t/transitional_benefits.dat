50|$|The Unemployment Insurance Act of 1929 {{scrapped}} the “genuinely seeking work” {{clause in}} unemployment benefit (which was originally abolished by the First Labour Government in 1924, and reintroduced by the Conservatives in 1928), increased dependants’ allowances, extended provision {{for the long-term}} unemployed, relaxed eligibility conditions, and introduced an individual means test. As {{a result of the}} changes made by the government to unemployment provision, the number of people on <b>transitional</b> <b>benefits</b> (payments given to those who had either exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits or did not qualify for them) rose from 120,000 in 1929 to more than 500,000 in 1931.|$|E
40|$|The American {{welfare state}} has been {{contained}} by several developments that have influenced social policy: the traditionalist movement, neoliberal ideology, and the budget deficit. These {{are evident in the}} minimal welfare reform of the Family Support Act of 1988. A new paradigm for organizing thinking about American social welfare is proposed around themes that have become central to discussions of social policy: productivity, reciprocity, community, and privatization. In order to become a viable institution again, social welfare policy should emphasize specific themes: voluntarization, access to services, social choice, social control, social obligation, <b>transitional</b> <b>benefits,</b> community enterprise, and national service...|$|E
40|$|The {{underclass}} {{has become}} a prominent issue in American social welfare, yet welfare professionals have focused on maintenance as opposed to mainstreaming strategies in working with this population. A mainstreaming strategy would emphasize individual incentives, community reconstruction, and program reorganization, focusing on the social disorganization of underclass communities. The essay details specific programs {{in each of these}} areas: <b>transitional</b> <b>benefits,</b> Community Enterprise Zones, and Integrated Service Agencies, among others. Welfare professionals must find ways to stretch existing public resources and identify new private resources if they are to pose plausible programs for the underclass. The public image of welfare professionals will be enhanced if effective programs to reduce the underclass can be implemented...|$|E
50|$|In December 2003, the Medicare Modernization Act {{was signed}} into law {{creating}} a prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries effective in 2006. A provision providing transitional coverage for certain cancer drugs, from September 2004 until the full benefit was available in 2006, was also included in the law. The <b>transitional</b> <b>benefit</b> was based on the Access to Cancer Therapies Act, a longtime NBCC priority that would provide Medicare coverage for all oral cancer medications. Early warning signs from the regulators writing the rules for implementing the transitional program indicated that breast cancer drugs might not be covered. The inclusion of five breast cancer drugs during the <b>transitional</b> <b>benefit</b> was a struggle that was won with the hard work of NBCC's grassroots advocates. This program will cover 50,000 beneficiaries nationwide with total funding of $500 million.|$|R
50|$|Labour representatives on the Boards of Guardians in the Twenties {{and on the}} Public Assistance Committees of {{the early}} Thirties sought to offset the effects of {{unemployment}} and poverty as best as they could within existing structures. This often led to interventionist measures such as the provision of free school meals or ensuring that benefit claimants received the relief that was owed to them. Labour councils sought to administer the means test in the most favourable terms possible, which involved accepting {{a higher percentage of}} applications for <b>transitional</b> <b>benefit</b> than in non-Labour localities and providing the maximum rate of relief available. In Poplar, Bethnal Green, and Stepney, for instance, Labour took positive steps on behalf of its working-class supporters, providing protection, jobs, and relief at a time of economic uncertainty.|$|R

In general, integrative wage labor and child-care policies are progressing at a faster rate in the small and homogeneous society of Norway as compared to the U. S. A. Norway, however, lags behind other Scandinavian nations in initiating some of the components of comprehensive child care policies, including mother's allowance, <b>transitional</b> <b>benefit</b> allowance, reduction in the gender gap in earnings, parental leave, day care, child support collection, and income disregard to enable welfare recipients to make successful transition into wage labor. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of feminist scholarship and activism, which first must impact values and philosophies underlying policy formulations before significant improvements in the welfare of mother-headed families can be accomplished...|$|R

Based on {{the research}} projects conducted by the Center for Literacy Studies with adult basic education programs for recipients of public assistance, this roundtable will examine how incentives influence participation in educational activities and achievement of educational outcomes. Do incentives influence educational outcomes for welfare recipients and other adults who have minimal formal education? For the last three years, the Center for Literacy Studies at The University of Tennessee has conducted research and demonstration projects {{as a part of}} Tennessee’s welfare reform initiative. Several ongoing projects identify factors that influence the educational achievement of welfare recipients. One factor, incentives for learning, raises multiple issues that can be particularly sensitive when applied to disadvantaged populations. The purpose of this Roundtable discussion is to examine how incentives influence participation in educational activities and achievement of educational outcomes. Tennessee legislation enacted in 1996 created Families First, a program designed to assist welfare recipients obtain and retain employment and move toward career advancement. In addition to cash grants, the Families First program provides job training, childcare, transportation, assistance to find employment, and <b>transitional</b> <b>benefits</b> for adults who are preparing for work.

40|$|The {{economic}} viability of farming in Saskatchewan is eroding {{and the future}} of the industry is becoming uncertain given the current economic state. The combination of low commodity prices, increasing input and transportation costs, ongoing drought conditions, inadequate safety net programs, and environmental concerns resulting from agricultural greenhouse gas emissions has led to this uncertainty. One possible solution for producers to help overcome or at least minimize the negative trends occurring in agriculture, which is proposed, is afforestation of agricultural land. Afforestation not only provides net private benefits of timber income but external benefits, including carbon sequestration, and preservation of native forests, which provides areas for hunting, wildlife viewing, and conservation of land. The economic efficiency of afforestation was examined using a <b>transitional</b> <b>benefit</b> cost framework for both crop and pasture systems. This allowed for both private and social perspectives, along with the opportunity costs, to be included and the economic efficiency of afforestation from each perspective was determined. The potential conversion of agricultural land to afforestation was based solely on economic efficiency and assumed producers demonstrated an economically rational decision making process. The results from the benefit cost analysis indicated that the net private benefits from afforestation were never significant enough to warrant the conversion of either crop or pasture systems to afforestation. The results did however show that the net social benefits from afforestation would warrant the conversion of crop systems to afforestation for a limited number of situations. Crop systems on physically marginal land with a carbon payment of either $ 22. 58 or $ 33. 55 tonne of C would warrant conversion to afforestation, using either a single or infinite rotation. The infinite rotation resulted in a larger allocation of land to afforestation. The role afforestation can play in helping producers diversify and increase income levels is limited. The low price paid for timber and the high costs of establishment for afforestation are the main constraints. In order for afforestation to become economically efficient on a large scale the constraints facing producer’s needs to be addressed...|$|R

5000|$|Wilson {{proposes a}} {{comprehensive}} {{social and economic}} program that is primarily universal, but nevertheless includes targeted {{efforts to improve the}} life chances of the ghetto underclass and other disadvantaged groups. Wilson lists multiple examples of what this universal program would include, such as public funding of training, retraining, and <b>transitional</b> employment <b>benefits</b> that would be available to all members of society. With respect to the diagnosis of concentration and isolation, Wilson suggests the promotion of social mobility, through programs that will increase employment prospects for the underclass, will lead to geographic mobility. Wilson describes his proposed program as having a [...] "hidden agenda" [...] for policy makers [...] "to improve the life chances of truly disadvantaged groups such as the ghetto underclass by emphasizing programs to which the more advantaged groups of all races and class backgrounds can positively relate." [...] Universal programs are more easily accepted within the US' political climate than targeted programs, yet the underclass would likely experience the most benefit from universal programs. Wilson notes that some means-tested programs are still necessary, but recommends that they be framed as secondary to universal programming efforts. The following quote summarizes his policy call: ...|$|R
40|$|Please do not cite or {{circulate}} {{without permission}} of the author* The study of <b>transitional</b> justice has <b>benefited</b> from extensive empirical analysis of accountability for atrocities. Specifically, the field of international relations has taken notice of the increasing institutionalization of international criminal law through ad hoc tribunals and the International Criminal Court (ICC), and the role that human rights norms and norm entrepreneurs have played in reconstructing deeply divided societies. But, how can international relations scholars theorize across the case studies of transitional justice and give due attention to context? What do we make of the consistencies and inconsistencies of transitional justice institutions? While the practice of transitional justice does not represent a series of unrelated cases that are solely the result of domestic contexts and actors, can we {{go so far as}} to say that that this phenomenon of international relations constitutes a norm or an international institution? I argue that we can theorize about transitional justice as a normative structure: a systemic and systematic collection of norms that constrains and enables the decision makers of transitional justice, and importantly, if not exclusively, constitute the corresponding institutional designs. This paper identifies four key elements of the normative structure of transitional justice: a hierarchica...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Welfare reform significantly changed federal policy for low-income families with children and established a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance. Welfare reform also extended transitional Medicaid assistance through 2001. States have implemented various initiatives to help families move from cash assistance to the workforce, including some enhancements to transitional Medicaid. These initiatives likely helped to cut cash assistance caseloads {{by more than half}} from 1996 through mid- 2001. Low-wage or part-time jobs [...] which are common for newly working individuals [...] often do not come with affordable health insurance, thus making transitional Medicaid coverage an important option. The implementation of transitional Medicaid assistance varied across the 21 states that GAO reviewed. State practices enhanced beneficiaries' ability to retain Medicaid coverage. However, many families did not receive their full <b>transitional</b> Medicaid assistance <b>benefits</b> because they failed to report their income three times during the 12 -month period of coverage. Amending the Medicaid statute to provide states with greater flexibility to ease income-reporting requirements, as has been done for other aspects of the Medicaid program, could facilitate uninterrupted health insurance coverage for families moving from cash assistance to the workforce. ...|$|R
40|$|While new positionsw {{and doors}} of {{opportunity}} have been opened {{for women in}} the services, they still face significant, unique challenges. Career progression is often slower for women and they are underrepresented in the military's senior ranks. Challenges for women with young children and a perceived lack of opportunity for advancement have led many women to leave the service early in their careers. Inadequate military health care for women and staggering rates of sexual assault and harassment are also hindering some female troops from continuing their military careers. These challenges are not only bad for servicemembers' well-being and reflect the military's failure to properly protect its own, but they have a substantial impact on the mission readiness of the overall force. When they come home, female veterans are confronted with new challenges. While it has made strides in recent years, the VA is still underprepared to provide adequate care to the surge of female veterans coming to its hospitals and clinics. In addition, women veterans face significant barreiers when entering the civilian workforce, and homeless rsates among female veterans are on the rise. Given the lack of support services for our women veterans, this comes as no surprise. Female troops and veterans deserve the same access to high-quality health care, <b>transitional</b> resources, and <b>benefits</b> as their male counterparts. After honorably fighting abroad, they should not have to wage new battles here at home. In order to fully honor their outstanding contributions to the military and service to the country, much more must be done to support our women veterans...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) {{management}} is an ever increasing problem for all countries. Developed countries face {{the problem of}} dealing with very large amounts of MSW per capita, forcing them to develop new technologies and systems. On the other hand, countries with developing or transitional economies may generate lower amounts of MSW per capita, but {{the rate of increase}} is high and the current practices of MSW management are not as advanced as those of developed countries. Therefore, countries with developing or <b>transitional</b> economies may <b>beneﬁt</b> from adopting MSW management technologies used by developed economies. One aspect of MSW management in developed economies is the energy recovery from MSW. The advantages of this type of technologies are mainly the signiﬁcantly reduced waste volume for landﬁlling, the reduction of total greenhouse gas emissions, the potential for generating electricity or co-generation of electricity and heat. In this work, a comparative study of the most prominent co-generation technologies using MSW as a fuel source is presented, focusing on the evolution of their economical performance over time. An algorithm based on real-options has been applied for four technologies of MSW energy recovery: (1) incineration, (2) gasiﬁcation, (3) landﬁll biogas exploitation using a pipeline system and (4) anaerobic digestion facilities. The ﬁnancial contributors are identiﬁed and the impact of greenhouse gas trading is analysed in terms of ﬁnancial yields, considering landﬁlling as the baseline scenario. The greenhouse gas trading system presents an opportunity for investing in environmentally friendly technologies for MSW energy recovery, through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), in most developing countries. The results of this work indicate an advantage of combined heat and power over solely electricity generation. The most attractive technology among the ones examined proves to be incineration, mainly due to its higher power production efﬁciency, lower investment costs and lower emission rates. Despite the fact that these characteristics may not drastically change over time, either immediate or irreversible investment decisions might be reconsidered under the current selling prices of heat, power and CO 2 allowances...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 92 - 99) There {{are many}} {{studies on the}} concept of healing trauma and healing battered women, but there is a limited amount of literature on how undocumented battered Latina women heal. This thesis focuses on the experience of undocumented battered Latina women and their process of healing from trauma while living in a transitional domestic violence shelter. The researcher interviewed ten shelter-based clinicians, one on one, for approximately one hour. The main research questions were: 1) How do shelter clinicians define/characterize healing among undocumented battered Latina women? 2) How do shelter clinicians and workers characterize obstacles to healing among undocumented battered Latina women? (3) What are the priorities and interventions used by clinicians for each phase (beginning, middle, end) of healing? and (4) How do the clinical interventions used by shelter-based clinicians for undocumented battered Latina women differ from Herman???s (1992, 1997) traditional model of healing? 	The primary themes that emerged were that healing was a process, that included healthy and [productive] reactions to stressors, and women feeling empowered/finding their voice. Obstacles to healing were complicated by multiple marginalities due to legal issues (e. g., obtaining U-Visa/VAWA) and family/cultural concepts of bearing one's cross. To aid in the process of healing, the majority of shelter-based clinicians sought to first treat active fight, flight, or freeze trauma response. Specific clinical treatments included Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Unrealistic Family System, Humanistic Therapy, Dialectical Therapy, Acetylic Approach, and Parent Interactive Therapy (PCIT). Specific interventions included psycho education, identifying support systems, relaxation techniques, and psycho education. Ideal cultural interventions included exploring what a member of this unique population has been taught socially and culturally about mental health services and provide education and advocacy regarding the rights they have even if there are undocumented. Overall, the suggested modification to Herman's (1992, 1997) model included detailed culturally sensitive interventions for six trauma responses during each stage (beginning, middle, and end) of healing. 	A preliminary model specific to undocumented battered Latina women living in a transitional domestic violence shelter is proposed. Such a model has not been found in previous literature and may <b>benefit</b> <b>transitional</b> domestic violence shelters that focus on the healing process of undocumented Latina domestic violence survivors...|$|R
