5|$|Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra chose several {{camera angles}} to {{simulate}} {{the look of a}} comic book panel. Various visual narrative motifs were also applied. Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass. As a newborn, he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors, and as a young child, he is seen reflected in a blank TV screen. When he leaves his calling card on <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> David Dunn's car, he is reflected in a glass frame in his art gallery. Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing. Using purple as Mr. Glass' color to David Dunn's green was also Jackson's idea. Mr. Glass' wig was modeled after Afro-American statesman Frederick Douglass. As he does in his other films, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance. He plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} a network of buses and minibuses routes are where fares vary {{depending}} on model (old) and amenities like air conditioning. These prices are visible in <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle and range from COP 1,300 (USD $0.60) and COP 1,500 (USD $0.75). The bus transportation is the most used by the population.|$|E

25|$|Kabul's Milli Bus (National Bus) system, {{which has}} about 800 buses, {{provides}} service {{to the city and}} nearby areas. There are several new highways in the province, and the government has scheduled to rebuild most of the smaller roads. Funding for the roads comes from current drivers who must pay toll charges for driving on highways and major roads. The money is collected by the government through issuing motorists monthly, quarterly or annual inspection certificates that are affixed to <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> their vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Z07 {{had been}} designed with production in mind. As a result, practical and regulatory considerations necessitated very few changes for the production model. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> the Z8 was extended upward, and a larger front airdam was fitted. Both changes were implemented to provide aerodynamic stability and a reasonably placid cockpit environment. The four-spoke steering wheel of the concept car {{was replaced by a}} three spoke design. The hardtop was changed from a double-bubble form with a tapering faring to a single dome with a truncated convex backside. The concept's exotic driver's side helmet fairing was eliminated to allow easy operation of the power soft top.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, President Chen was re-elected to {{a second}} {{four-year}} term after an assassination attempt which occurred {{the day before the}} election. Two shots were fired, one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> a jeep and several layers of clothing, the other bullet penetrated the windshield and hitting the vice president's knee cast (She was wearing a knee cast due to an earlier injury). Police investigators have said that the most likely suspect {{is believed to have been}} Chen Yi-hsiung, who was later found dead. Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result.|$|E
50|$|Golf courses near {{residential}} communities {{will often}} have fences exceeding 20 {{feet in height}} {{in order to prevent}} struck balls from flying out of the course and into <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> <b>of</b> cars and windows of houses near the course. Such fences are not only not spite fences, but may actually be required.|$|R
5000|$|He {{first started}} by writing a modest tract titled [...] "Catholic Answers" [...] {{to counter the}} {{arguments}} {{he saw in the}} anti-Catholic tract.

Later {{that night at}} the Miami Jai-Alai Fronton, he and Pak Song would face Mike Graham & Dusty Rhodes defeating them by disqualification. Following the match, Hansen flew back to the Tampa International Airport and was driving through the Town ‘N Country area when his car stalled on West Hillsborough Boulevard. After telephoning for assistance, Hansen was struck by a car while crossing the median. His head hitting <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> the car, he suffered severe brain damage as well as numerous bodily injuries. Taken to St. Joseph’s Hospital, Hansen remained in a coma for a week before he died from his injuries on November 16, 1978.|$|E
25|$|Equipment (including a gurney) {{from the}} trauma room at Parkland Memorial Hospital, where President Kennedy was {{pronounced}} dead, was purchased {{from the hospital}} {{by the federal government}} in 1973 and is now stored by the National Archives at an underground facility in Lenexa, Kansas. The First Lady's pink suit, the autopsy report, X-rays and President Kennedy's blood-stained jacket, shirt and tie worn during the assassination are stored in the National Archives facility in College Park, Maryland, with access controlled by a representative of the Kennedy family. The rifle used by Oswald, his diary, revolver, bullet fragments, and <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> Kennedy's limousine are also stored by the Archives.

25|$|On February 20, 1961, Garcia {{got into}} a car with Paul Speegle, a sixteen-year-old artist and {{acquaintance}} of Garcia; Lee Adams, the house manager of the Chateau and driver of the car; and Alan Trist, a companion of theirs. After speeding past the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital, the car encountered a curve and, traveling around ninety miles per hour, collided with the guard rail, sending the car rolling turbulently. Garcia was hurled through <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> the car into a nearby field with such force he was literally thrown out of his shoes and would later be unable to recall the ejection. Lee Adams, the driver, and Alan Trist, who was seated in the back, were thrown from the car as well, suffering from abdominal injuries and a spine fracture, respectively. Garcia escaped with a broken collarbone, while Speegle, still in the car, was fatally injured.|$|E

50|$|During the 2015 {{by-election}} in {{the provincial}} Sudbury electoral district, Popescu was nearly ejected from a candidates' debate for making offensive anti-gay comments attacking provincial premier Kathleen Wynne, who is an openly gay woman. Several complaints were later filed with the Greater Sudbury Police Service alleging that Popescu was distributing literature advocating genocide of gay people, leading to a police investigation. The literature was distributed {{in the form of}} homemade compact discs and pamphlets left on <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> <b>of</b> parked cars in various locations across the city.|$|R
25|$|On {{the weekend}} of March 1–2, 1992, Mayor Daley and wife Maggie {{attended}} a family party in New York, and 16-year-old Patrick was to stay with relatives. Patrick told the relatives he was staying with friends and drove his father's new sports utility vehicle to the Daley second home in Grand Beach, Michigan and threw a party Saturday night. Patrick fetched former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's 20-gauge double-barrel shotgun from the Daley home {{and handed it to}} his cousin, R. J. Vanecko, 17. Vanecko aimed the shotgun at teenagers, pulled the trigger twice and yelled that he was not afraid to use the weapon. A youth threw a concrete goose lawn ornament through <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> Mayor Daley's truck, and Patrick punched him. A youth was seriously injured when struck {{in the head with a}} baseball bat wielded by a juvenile, was hospitalized in critical condition, underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain and spent three days in intensive care.|$|E
500|$|In Will's absence, the glee club hires Dakota Stanley (Whit Hertford), the {{choreographer}} {{of a rival}} club, Vocal Adrenaline, to help coach them to a Nationals championship. Cheerleaders Quinn (Dianna Agron), Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) {{hope that}} the notoriously harsh Stanley will prompt {{some members of the}} club to quit, furthering their plan to sabotage the club. Although Stanley is heavily critical of most of the group, Rachel convinces the members that their differences give them a unique edge, and fires the choreographer. The cheerleaders also lead Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) to believe that fellow club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) has feelings for her, leaving her hurt when he rejects her advances. He misleads her into believing he has feelings for Rachel, which angers Mercedes, and she breaks <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> <b>of</b> his car and sings [...] "Bust Your Windows". Kurt later confesses to her that he is gay—the first time he has said it to anyone—and the two make up.|$|E

50|$|Highway 407 in the {{province}} of Ontario, Canada, has no toll booths, and instead reads a transponder mounted on <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> <b>of</b> each vehicle using the road (the rear licence plates of vehicles lacking a transponder are photographed when they enter and exit the highway). This made the highway the first all-automated toll highway in the world. A bill is mailed monthly for usage of the 407. Lower charges are levied on frequent 407 users who carry electronic transponders in their vehicles. The approach has not been without controversy: In 2003 the 407 ETR settled a class action with a refund to users.|$|R
