40|$|The use {{of passive}} solar {{systems can be}} of great {{interest}} in new constructions and in retrofitting interventions, especially {{in relation to the}} enormous number of post-war period buildings of the city suburbs, usually characterised by severe functional and aesthetic disrepair and by high energy demand. These systems have morphological-functional characteristics that change according to the context and as they depend on irregular energy sources they are still not widely used and have been the object of little or no studies concerning their performances. The collection of tangible functional data, even when it is conditioned by specific applicative situations, can be very useful to guide planning and research in this field. The following illustrates the outcome of a long winter monitoring campaign of passive solar systems, in particular greenhouse and <b>Trombe-Michel</b> <b>wall</b> systems applied on buildings in a recent energy, aesthetic and functional retrofit in Savona (Italy) ...|$|E

40|$|Passive {{solar systems}} can be an {{efficient}} strategy to save energy both in new and retrofitted buildings, above all in the Mediterranean climatic zone. Over the last decades many passive solar applications have, indeed, taken place in this area. Contrariwise, there are still few data about the actual performances of passive solar systems; scientific literature shows that studies are limited and often they refer to very peculiar climatic conditions. That happens, basically, because passive solar systems are components of the building envelope, therefore they are dependant on specific environment, operating conditions and budget, hardly replicable and difficult to standardize; so that their performances are hard to evaluate. However, in spite of difficulties to obtain fair operational data it may be useful, for whoever intends to adopt passive solar strategies, to acquire data about their potential performances. This article describes the monitoring actions conducted on passive solar systems, in particular on glasshouses and <b>Trombe-Michel</b> <b>walls,</b> applied in three retrofitted buildings, built in the sixties in Savona (Italy). The winter monitoring campaign {{has been carried out}} using temperature data loggers, a thermal imaging camera and an anemometer to measure low air velocities. Those monitoring actions are producing significant data concerning: the operation/efficiency of the checked systems, their performances according to solar radiation absorption, the mode/efficiency of heat transfer, the effect of the users’ behaviour, the validation of information in the literature. The case-studies show that passive solar systems can ensure the necessary thermal transfer and a good indoor comfort in the Mediterranean climate, during not too harsh winters, on condition that the buildings are adequately insulated. Moreover the study remarks on the operating conditions of passive solar systems in relation to the convective heat transfer and the appropriate size of the wall valves as well. The article also shows some precautions to avoid passive solar buildings’ overheating during summer and the monitoring campaign demonstrates that it is easily possible to avoid this problem. The research outputs may be significant in the design and research fields, particularly in order to build up databases able to lead to more reliable simulation systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{reflection}} {{about the influence}} {{that the goal of}} reducing energy consumption in the building sector has on the formation of models and building types. The ‘energy paradigm’ is now in the common thought. Our society needs energy sources because every single sector of our economy and, consequently, of our daily life, requires energy. The building types that {{can be found in the}} vernacular culture, according to studies of ‘bioclimatic’, are largely related to the availability of resources (materials for building) and local climatic conditions. The bioclimatic design approach has generated, in the 70 s and 80 s of the twentieth century, the model of the ‘solar house’: the model generally has a south glass façade, an opaque façade to the north side with few openings, with east and west facades of limited extension. The south facade hosts ‘passive solar systems’, such as greenhouses and <b>Trombe-Michel</b> <b>walls,</b> for the exploitation of solar radiation. Ventilation chimneys, or the position of the openings on opposite sides at different heights, allow cooling in summer and, in general, a good air exchange. In 2002 the European Directive n. 91 has as objectives the reduction of energy consumption in buildings and the comparability of performance in the European countries through a homogenization of descriptive parameters of the energy performance of the building. This leads to the consolidation of a different approach, one more ‘conservative’, determined by the availability of new materials and equipment plant and the lower limit values of energy consumption required by the regulations: the Passiv Haus model. Buildings are constructed more compact, therefore, to reduce dispersant surfaces (at equal volume). The openings to the outside are limited in size and are positioned so as to allow a good natural lighting. The cooling and air exchange is assigned to heat pumps and mechanical ventilation. The photovoltaic panels, in addition, sometimes, to thermal solar panels already in bioclimatic model, become a constant presence on the roofs of buildings. The promulgation of Directive 2010 / 31 /EU – recasting of the previous Directive 2002 / 91 /EU –introduces new objectives and a new energy model: the Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB). The focus shifts to the need to have a null balance between demand and local energy production from renewable sources; to integrate microgeneration plants (PV, micro wind generators) in the architectural language becomes increasingly important, as well as to make use of evolved plant design (eg. geothermal heat pumps). The building becomes ‘energy active’. The paper presents some considerations, highlighting the need to address the architectural project knowing metabolize energy saving objectives without falling into mere diagrammatic translation of the principles mentioned above...|$|R
