However, the Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested negotiated a peace treaty without any direct involvement by foreign powers. The conflict was resolved with the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660). Sweden returned Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present day, and secured the Swedish dominium maris baltici.|$|E

5|$|The Belgians and French {{remained}} {{confused about}} {{what was expected of}} each other if or when, hostilities commenced.

He was concerned that the Belgians would be driven out of their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward to link up with French forces. This information was not given to Gamelin.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of landfalls is that {{tropical}} cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west. In the Atlantic, this sends hurricanes towards North America.

5|$|After the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>them.</b> In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. It made it clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to be drawn into an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed to the growth of a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia and could have resulted in a war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe.

Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>them.</b> Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was the key point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield.

5|$|By late 1585, {{although}} Ernst's {{brother had}} made significant inroads into the Electorate of Cologne, both sides had reached an impasse.

The Calvinist barons and counts understood the danger of Spanish intervention: it meant the aggressive introduction of the Counter-Reformation in their territories. France, in the person of Henry III, was equally interested, since the encirclement of his Kingdom by Habsburgs was cause for concern. Another sizable portion of the electorate's populace adhered to the old faith, supported by Wittelsbach-funded Jesuits. The supporters of both sides committed atrocities of their own: in the city of Cologne, the mere rumor of Gebhard's approaching army caused rioters to murder several people suspected of sympathizing with the Protestant cause.|$|E
