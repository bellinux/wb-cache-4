5|$|Avery {{became the}} first to walk the trail end-to-end, though not as a thru-hike, in 1936. In August 1937, the trail was {{completed}} to Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine, and the ATC shifted its focus toward protecting the trail lands and mapping the <b>trail</b> <b>for</b> hikers.|$|E
5|$|Tarka Trail.

5|$|After {{duplication}} in 1890, {{the original}} lattice-girder Como Bridge across the Georges River was laid as gauntlet track. This arrangement remained {{in place for}} many decades, causing a notorious bottleneck on the line, until the New South Wales Government commissioned John Holland & Co {{to build a new}} bridge in 1969. Construction of the new bridge, made of prestressed concrete box girders, commenced in 1969 and was first used by the 18:17 service from Como on 19 November 1972. The old bridge, as well as a former alignment of the line between Mortdale and Oatley replaced in 1905, is now used as a rail <b>trail</b> <b>for</b> pedestrians and cyclists.|$|E

5|$|Neither Wetherby nor Clements {{enjoyed the}} support of Governor Chandler. Coupled with this, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson {{suffered}} a heart attack during the campaign, and as majority whip, Clements assumed the role of acting majority leader. This took him away from the campaign <b>trail</b> <b>for</b> extended periods of time. During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7,000 votes. It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years, and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years.|$|E
5|$|Prairie Avenue is a north–south {{street on}} the South Side of Chicago, which {{historically}} extended from 16th Street in the Near South Side community area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States, to the city's southern limits and beyond. The street has a rich history from its origins {{as a major}} <b>trail</b> <b>for</b> horseback riders and carriages. During {{the last three decades}} of the 19th century, a six-block section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago's elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes part of the historic Prairie Avenue District, which was declared a Chicago Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Within Overlake, SR520 turns {{north and}} passes through several office parks, {{including}} the headquarters campus of Microsoft and the Nintendo of America branch office. To serve exits at Northeast 40th Street and Northeast 51st Street, SR520 gains {{a set of}} collector–distributor lanes, separated from other lanes by a concrete barrier. The freeway crosses the Sammamish River and turns east, passing {{to the south of}} the Redmond Town Center mall and Bear Creek and to the north of Marymoor Park. East of downtown Redmond, SR520 intersects SR202 and terminates; the road continues north as Avondale Road towards Cottage Lake. Portions of the corridor from Evergreen Point to Downtown Redmond are also paralleled by a shared-use <b>trail</b> <b>for</b> bicycles and pedestrians.|$|E

5|$|Continuing toward Fort Bridger {{from the}} Green River, the main trail crosses Hams Fork near Granger and {{followed}} Blacks Fork to Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger {{and his partner}} Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette cutoff was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is {{the point at which}} the Mormon Trail splits from the Oregon Trail and California <b>Trail</b> <b>for</b> good. The Mormon Trail continues southwest, fording the Bear River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails turn and proceed northwest, crossing the Bear River Divide and into the Bear River valley on the western side of the state. The trail meets the Sublette cutoff near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow the Bear River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.|$|E
5|$|Establishment of the C made Everglades National Park {{completely}} {{dependent upon}} another political entity for its survival. One of the C's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail {{on the northern}} border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami <b>Trail</b> <b>for</b> the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C for assistance, the C offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay. Though the C refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering {{the east side of}} the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{due in part}} to Cliff Fletcher's {{diplomatic}} efforts, the Soviets gave {{permission for}} a select group of Soviet hockey players to sign with NHL teams. The first of these players was Sergei Pryakhin. Although Pryakhin never became an NHL regular, his arrival blazed a <b>trail</b> <b>for</b> the large number of Russian players who entered the NHL beginning in 1989–90. Sergei Makarov joined the Flames that season and, though already in his thirties, became the fifth Flame to win the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's Rookie of the Year. The selection would prove controversial, prompting the league to amend the rules to exclude any player over the age of 26 from future consideration. That season, the team fell two points shy of their third straight presidents' Trophy with 99 points. Also that season, they won their third straight Smythe Division title. In the playoffs, they were dethroned in six games by the Los Angeles Kings. They would not win another playoff series until 2004—one of the longest such droughts in NHL history.|$|E

5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper <b>trail</b> <b>for</b> evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{scrutiny}} about the stub end at Exit 6A for Route 138 {{that was to}} be a part of an extension of the freeway for its final five miles (8km) from Route 138 to the Brielle Circle. Some of the right-of-way that was acquired in the 1960s for the Route 35 freeway were transformed into a multi-use <b>trail</b> <b>for</b> bicycles and other vehicles to link the Wall Township Municipal Complex to the existing Edgar Felix Bikeway that runs from Manasquan to Allaire State Park. In 2001, the Brielle Circle was replaced with a new four-approach interchange between Route 35, Route 34 and Route 70, but the project included no hint of the Route 18 Extension. NJDOT is in planning to create a Park & Ride at the southern terminus of the Route 18 freeway. It will be placed along the four lane right of way just south of Route 138. Residents are in opposition to this proposal for fear of loitering and vandalism that may accompany the parking lot.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign <b>trail</b> <b>for</b> the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E
