[...] His attempt at a more serious opera, Le bourgeois de Calais (1888), with [...] "a boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score" [...] was not well received. One critic wrote, [...] "That Le Bourgeois de Calais will have a successful career <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering {{in the world could}} not make it an attractive piece." [...] Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale Isoline (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act operetta, Le mari de la reine (The Queen's Husband, 1889), which failed, although Messager thought it [...] "the best of my flops."

Mrs. Tittlemouse is concerned as much about middle class proprieties as the dolls Lucinda and Jane in The Tale of Two Bad Mice but, in Mrs. Tittlemouse, Potter is on the side of the invaded rather than the invaders, who are purely animals with no human characteristics.|$|E

In fact, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> slightest opposition to her marriage in any quarter. And, being a woman, she does not like it. Perhaps {{she would have been}} married in the orthodox way {{had it not been for}} a dream that she had. In her sleep she found herself a beautiful young woman, persecuted because she was loyal to the knight she had selected. Her father was obdurate, and finally practically made her a prisoner in his gloomy old castle. Her sweetheart called with a rope ladder. They escaped, and after a number of thrilling adventures were married, and presumably lived happy forever afterwards. When May awoke, she was more discontented than ever. She flouted her fiancé, and returned his ring and swore she would never marry him. But finally she told him of her dream, and he won forgiveness by promising to run away with her like the knight of her dreams. Being a man of his word, he did. But the romance all faded out of it. The adventures they passed through were not to the woman's liking, and her experience convinced her that swashbuckling knights are as much out of date as are stagecoaches." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the year}} 1848, McCord {{published}} {{her first book}} of poetry. My Dreams, a collection of fugitive poems, from the press of Carey & Hart, Philadelphia. A close study of these poems reveals a genuine poetic talent, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> certainty of maturity, not the metrical perfection of first-rate poetry. The lyrist is an honestly doubting lyrist in many passages. There {{are a number of}} them that are either of adolescent composition, withheld until 1848 for publication, or at least of adolescent conception, possibly worked over for this volume. Hope is the keynote of a majority of the poems in this collection; but in many instances the hope is unaccompanied by any certainty of faith which a woman of McCord's full life and wide experience must have developed at the time this collection was published. A few of the poems are narrative myths, a direct reflection of her classic temperament. They suggest early Greek myths, and meet the reader with such titles as [...] "The Daughters of Hope," [...] who are cleverly personified as Fancy and Happiness, and, Happiness being lost in Life's confusion, Fancy assists her mother, Hope, to chase Happiness through all time. Others included [...] "The Falling Star," [...] "Love, Wisdom, Folly," [...] "The Comet," [...] "The Star That Followed Me," [...] "Conduct of the Sources of Good and Evil," [...] "The Home of Hope" [...] and [...] "The Voice of a Star." [...] Then there is a grouping possible among them of simple narratives of the world of concrete things. For example, the pathetic [...] "Poor Nannie" [...] and [...] "The Blood Stained Rose," [...] "The Birth of the Evergreens" [...] and [...] "Pretty Fanny." [...] But it is in the third division of these poems that McCord's maturity expresses her feelings, and in the poems of this group that deal with the eternal riddle of life and death. They suggest the suffering spirit. [...] "My Dream Child," [...] "The Village Churchyard," [...] "The First Beam of Light," [...] "My Dead," [...] "Ye're Born to Die" [...] and others are found here. Probably the best among them is [...] "The Voice of Years." ...|$|E
