5|$|Advances {{were made}} in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with {{aircraft}} carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship {{in place of the}} battleship.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's {{first six}} regiments {{organized}} during the Civil War were the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th Indiana infantry regiments. The men in these regiments volunteered {{for three months}} of service at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> but their brief terms provided inadequate; most of these soldiers re-enlisted for three additional years of service.|$|E
5|$|The Irish and British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol. At <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Irish ships joined convoys {{protected by the}} Royal Navy. The advantages were protection and cheaper insurance. These advantages were not borne out by experience. So they chose to sail alone.|$|E

50|$|A novice in National Hunt {{horse racing}} is a horse {{which has not}} won in a {{particular}} type <b>of</b> race prior to <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current season. A novice hurdler has not won a hurdle race before <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current season, while a novice chaser has not won a steeplechase before <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current season.|$|R
5|$|The {{conscription}} of German men at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{created a}} manpower shortage in German factories {{important for the}} war effort. From 1915, the Germans encouraged Belgian civilians to enlist voluntarily to work in Germany but the 30,000 recruits of the policy proved insufficient to meet demands.|$|E
5|$|The {{second section}} rejoins Stephen, {{when he is}} a {{lieutenant}} in the British Army at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Through his eyes, Faulks tells the reader about the {{first day on the}} Somme in July 1916 and the Battle of Messines near Ypres in the following year.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the Second World War the family fled Paris; Döblin's manuscripts were able to be brought into {{safekeeping}} {{in the basement of the}} Sorbonne. Between <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in 1939 and the German occupation of France in 1940, Döblin worked for the French ministry of information, writing counter-propaganda texts against Nazi Germany with a group of French Germanists and journalists, as well as artists like Frans Masereel.|$|E
50|$|BBC Scotland {{broadcasts}} its own Saturday afternoon results programme, Sportscene Results, and the vidiprinter is onscreen from <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> programme until <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classified {{results at}} 5pm.|$|R

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> with Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{signed an}} order for {{internment}} {{of all the people}} of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast. About 1,700of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Himmler {{intensified}} {{the activity of}} the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe. An increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested. As the Nazi regime became more oppressive, the concentration camp system grew in size and lethal operation, and grew in scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with almost all German capital ships during World War I, Moltkes action was {{somewhat}} limited. However, she did participate in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the High Seas Fleet. At <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Hipper.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1975-1976 season Mullaney was <b>the</b> coach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baltimore Claws but {{the team}} folded after a few preseason {{exhibition}} games and before <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regular season.|$|R

50|$|For <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2009-10 season Bowler joined North West Counties League Premier Division club, New Mills. At <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2014-15 {{season he}} signed for {{his home town}} club, Glossop North End.|$|R
5|$|At 1:55p.m., {{just before}} <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> a {{reconnaissance}} force swam {{to the east}} bank of the Suez Canal, two kilometers south of Fort Lahtzanit, and laid two ropes across the canal to facilitate the crossing of friendly forces. At 2:05p.m., as Operation Badr began, an artillery barrage was initiated against the fort using just the 85mm guns and B-10 recoilless rifles of the brigade's anti-tank company; the use of high trajectory artillery guns was forbidden since a number of Egyptian aircraft were flying over this area.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly {{serving in the}} artillery or engineers and were assigned in most part {{to the task of}} coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force would need to be raised. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the {{population}} of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in large towns and cities in Belgium, such as Antwerp and Brussels. The vast majority were recent immigrants to Belgium fleeing persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe and, as a result, only a small minority actually possessed Belgian citizenship.|$|E
50|$|Walbury Hill is also <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Test Way and is <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Combe Gibbet to Overton 16 Mile Trail Race, {{the first}} 11 miles of its route being on Wayfarer's Walk.|$|R
50|$|Just before <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2015 race, a small drone hit a {{tree branch}} near <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race and crashed into the crowd. <b>The</b> rotors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drone injured two runners with small lacerations.|$|R

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the {{population}} of the Congo numbered approximately 12million black people and 30,000 whites. The colonial government segregated {{the population}} along racial lines and there was very little mixing between the colours. The white population was highly urbanized and, in Léopoldville, the capital, lived in a quarter of the city separated from the black majority. All blacks in the city had to adhere to a curfew.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Liguria {{was assigned to the}} Third Division of the First Squadron as a training ship. Italy declared neutrality at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. The old cruiser nevertheless saw no action during the war. She was sold for scrap on 15 May 1921 and was subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> a British {{blockade}} on {{shipments to}} Germany affected the Reich economy. The Germans were particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal and grain. To safeguard Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered {{an attack on}} Norway, which took place on 9 April 1940. Much {{of the country was}} occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|E
50|$|Each year, {{the budget}} bill is {{submitted}} to the National Assembly by the executive. By law, it must be submitted at least 90 days before <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fiscal year, and the final version must be approved at least 30 days before <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fiscal year. The Assembly is also responsible for auditing accounts of past expenditures, which must be submitted at least 120 days before <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fiscal year.|$|R
5|$|The {{ballpark}} {{became the}} 11th MLB facility to have LED field lights installed, which was done prior to <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2017 season. Wi-Fi was also installed throughout the ballpark prior to <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2017 season.|$|R

5|$|In 194142, McCabe {{played his}} final {{first-class}} match. He scored 8 and 41 as Queensland took a 17-run win. Ten days later, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, prompting <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in the Pacific. With that, first-class cricket was cancelled {{and did not}} resume until 194546, ending McCabe's career {{at the age of}} just 31. He had 24 wins and four losses in 38 first-class matches as captain for all teams. In his last three seasons, McCabe took only one wicket, from 18 overs of bowling.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2004 the {{monument}} closed for a $15 million renovation, which included numerous security upgrades and redesign of {{the monument}} grounds by landscape architect Laurie Olin. The renovations were due partly to security concerns following the September 11 attacks and <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> on Terror. The monument reopened April 1, 2005, while the surrounding grounds remained closed until the landscape was finished later that summer.|$|E
5|$|The Abwehr {{was also}} active in Ireland. German {{intelligence}} operations effectively ended in September 1941 when police made arrests {{on the basis}} of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin, including that of the United States. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.|$|E
