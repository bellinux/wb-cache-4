5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} {{attitude control system}}. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Although Aucouturier had {{abandoned}} in the first stage, and so was not eligible for the general classification, he could still start {{the rest of the}} stages. In <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage,</b> Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the stage. Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage,</b> which eliminated him from the race.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|Avuis Adrian R. Huber {{believed}} that Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, Adriano Baffi, and Fabio Baldato {{had a great}} {{chance to win a}} stage in the race. Notable sprinter Mario Cipollini did not participate in the race as he was still recovering from injuries sustained in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> at the Vuelta a España.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, the spacecraft was shipped to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's flight control system, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> engine did not shut {{down at the end}} of its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E

The prize money then increases as each quarterfinalist receives US$650,000, US$700,000 is given to each semifinalist, US$1,000,000 is awarded the runner-up, and the winner earns US$2,300,000.|$|E

Finally, in The reward of cruelty, he receives what Hogarth warns is the inevitable fate of those who start down the path Nero has followed: his body is taken from the gallows after his execution as a murderer and is mutilated by surgeons in the anatomical theatre.|$|E

5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be treated alike. Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against. The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>stage</b> test was also found to have been satisfied where {{all members of the}} Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses found to have been in violation of the Societies Act were treated equally.|$|E
