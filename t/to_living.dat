5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Its adaptations <b>to</b> <b>living</b> on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E

5|$|Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for {{the first}} time on 29 October and soon {{introduced}} him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant capybara. The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures were related <b>to</b> <b>living</b> species in South America.|$|E

5|$|Elemental {{fluorine}} {{is highly}} toxic <b>to</b> <b>living</b> organisms. Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide's 50 ppm and {{are similar to}} those of chlorine: significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine. Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these <b>to</b> <b>living</b> groups and to each other is controversial. The extinct Arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct myriapod class, although work in the early 21st century established {{the group as a}} subclass of millipedes. Several living orders also appear in the fossil record. Below are two proposed arrangements of fossil millipede groups. Extinct groups are indicated with a dagger (†). The extinct order Zosterogrammida, a chilognath of uncertain position, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|In {{tropical}} {{regions with}} a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier {{part of the}} year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous. In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted <b>to</b> <b>living</b> in such areas.|$|E

5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself <b>to</b> <b>living</b> humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted <b>to</b> <b>living</b> in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} is controversial, {{and not all}} experts agree, {{particularly with}} the recent {{increase in the number}} of recognized species. According to Russell Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International (CI), taxonomist Colin Groves, and others, there are nearly 100recognized species or subspecies of extant (or living) lemur, divided into five families and 15genera. Because genetic data indicates that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs were closely related <b>to</b> <b>living</b> lemurs, an additional three families, eight genera, and 17species can be included in the total. In contrast, other experts have labeled this as taxonomic inflation, instead preferring a total closer to 50 species.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus zapfei can be {{identified}} as a Miniopterus {{on the basis of}} the possession of three lower premolars (designated p2, p3, and p4, because the original first premolar has been lost); a two-rooted p3; and the nyctalodont molars, with the posterolophid (a crest at the back of the molar) behind the entoconid cusp. M.zapfei is about 30% larger than M.fossilis and has a more slender p4. Compared <b>to</b> <b>living</b> Miniopterus, the cingulum (shelf) that surrounds the P4 is less well-developed and the parastyle crest is weaker.|$|E
5|$|Newsom {{attended}} Santa Clara University on {{a partial}} baseball scholarship and student loans, where {{he graduated in}} 1989 with a B.S. in political science. Newsom was a left-handed pitcher for Santa Clara, but he threw his arm out after two years and hasn't thrown a baseball since. He lived in the Alameda Apartments, which he later compared <b>to</b> <b>living</b> in a hotel. He later reflected on his education fondly, crediting the Jesuit approach of Santa Clara that he said has helped him become an independent thinker who questions orthodoxy. Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestor}} of Noronhomys {{may have been}} a semiaquatic animal, similar <b>to</b> <b>living</b> Holochilus or Lundomys, that arrived on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log.
