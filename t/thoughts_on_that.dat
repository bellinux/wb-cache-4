[...] The following year, Hayes recorded his <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> subject in his diary: ...|$|E

60|$|Unfortunately Adams did not {{understand}} what she meant. He, like the others, had heard the firing, but had only {{thought of it as}} a foolish waste of ammunition. Nothing was further from his <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> peaceful day and hour than deeds of violence and bloodshed. He therefore continued at work.|$|E

6000|$|... "No <b>thought</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> subject {{will ever}} trouble him. That {{will be all}} as it happens. As soon as he takes a {{sufficient}} fancy to a girl he will ask her straight off. I do not say {{that he might not}} change afterwards, but he would mean it at the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} so before, Mr. Moss, and your doing so again is an insult. It would not be done to any young lady unless she were on the stage, and were <b>thought</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> account {{to be open to}} any man about the theatre to say what he pleased to her." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{are some}} who, in such circumstances, {{give way to}} abject terror. Others, whose nervous system is not so finely strung and whose sense of justice is strong, are filled with a rush of indignation, and meet their fate with savage ferocity, or with dogged and {{apparent}} indifference. Some, rising above sublunary matters, shut their eyes to all around and fix their <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> world with which they {{may be said to}} be more immediately connected, namely, the next.|$|E
6000|$|A man so {{submissive}} to {{the orders}} of heaven, could not possibly want submission in regard of his superior, who was {{to him in the}} place of God. He had for Father Ignatius, general of the Society of Jesus, a veneration and reverence, mixed with tenderness, which surpass imagination. He himself has expressed some part of his <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> subject, and we cannot read them without being edified. In one of his letters, which begins in this manner, [...] "My only dear Father, in the bowels of Jesus Christ;" [...] he says at the conclusion, [...] "Father of my soul, for whom I have a most profound respect, I write this to you upon my knees, as if you were present, and that I beheld you with my eyes." [...] It was his custom to write to him in that posture; so high was the place which Ignatius held within his heart.|$|E
60|$|Many {{years had}} passed away {{since the time of}} Sam's {{youthful}} adventure, and the snows of many a winter had grizzled the knotty wool upon his head. He perfectly recollected the circumstances, however, for he had often been called upon to relate them, though in his version of the story he differed in many points from Peechy Prauw; as is not unfrequently the case with authentic historians. As to the subsequent researches of money-diggers, Sam knew nothing about them; they were matters quite out of his line; neither did the cautious Wolfert care to disturb his <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> point. His only wish was to secure the old fisherman as a pilot to the spot, and this was readily effected. The long time that had intervened since his nocturnal adventure had effaced all Sam's awe of the place, and the promise of a trifling reward roused him at once from his sleep and his sunshine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he has," [...] said Clym in {{a neutral}} tone. [...] "Well, I wish {{with all my heart}} that I could say, marry him. But I cannot forget what my mother <b>thought</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> matter, and it goes rather against me not to respect her opinion. There is too much reason why we should do the little we can to respect it now." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I have <b>thought</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> subject many times," [...] said Mr. Crowder, [...] "not only {{in regard}} to this case, but others, and have formed {{hundreds}} of plans for carrying my possessions into another set of social conditions; {{but the fact of}} being obliged to change my identity always made it impossible for me to avail myself of the advantages of commercial paper, legal deeds, and all titles to property." ...|$|R
6000|$|It chanced {{that the}} wild bull's mad gallop {{was in a}} {{direction}} that brought it within a few yards of the spot where we stood, so we prepared {{to put an end to}} its misery. As it drew near, Jack, who was in advance, raised his rifle. I, being only a short distance from him, also made ready to fire, although I confess that in the agitation of the moment I could not make up my mind whether I should fire at the buffalo or the leopard. As far as I can recall my rapid and disjointed <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> exciting occasion, I reasoned thus: [...] "If I shoot the leopard the bull will escape, and if I shoot the bull the leopard will escape." [...] It did not occur to me at that trying moment, when self-possession and decision were so necessary, that I might shoot the bull with one barrel, and the leopard with the other. Still less did it occur to me that I might miss bull and leopard altogether.|$|E
60|$|Having now society enough, and {{our number}} being {{sufficient}} {{to put us}} {{out of fear of}} the savages, if they had come, unless their number had been very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found occasion; and as here we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. For this purpose, I marked out several trees which I thought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> affair, to oversee and direct their work. I showed them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they had made about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick: what prodigious labour it took up, any one may imagine.|$|E
60|$|I {{published}} my <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> Constitution, that my countrymen {{might be}} enabled {{to estimate the}} wisdom of the plans which were held out to their imitation. I conceived that the true character of those plans would be best collected from the committee appointed to prepare them. I thought that the scheme of their building would be better comprehended {{in the design of the}} architects than in the execution of the masons. It was not worth my reader's while to occupy himself with the alterations by which bungling practice corrects absurd theory. Such an investigation would be endless: because every day's past experience of impracticability has driven, and every day's future experience will drive, those men to new devices as exceptionable as the old, and which are no otherwise worthy of observation than as they give a daily proof of the delusion of their promises and the falsehood of their professions. Had I followed all these changes, my letter would have been only a gazette of their wanderings, a journal of their march from error to error, through a dry, dreary desert, unguided by the lights of Heaven, or by the contrivance which wisdom has invented to supply their place.|$|E

60|$|She stopped, {{alarmed at}} {{the change of}} {{expression}} in his face. A quick flush had crossed his cheek; for an instant he had looked suspiciously into her questioning eyes. But the next moment the idea of his quietly selecting this simple, unsophisticated girl as the confidant of his miserable marriage, and the desperation that had brought him there, struck him as being irresistibly ludicrous and he smiled. It {{was the first time}} that the habitual morbid intensity of his <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> one subject had ever been disturbed by reaction; it {{was the first time that}} a clear ray of reason had pierced the gloom in which he had enwrapped it. Seeing him smile, the young girl smiled too. Then they smiled together vaguely and sympathetically, as over some unspoken confidence. But, unknown and unsuspected by himself, that smile had completed his emancipation and triumph. The next moment, when he sought with a conscientious sigh to reenter his old mood, he was half shocked to find it gone. Whatever gradual influence--the outcome of these few months of rest and repose--may have already been at work to dissipate his clouded fancy, he was only vaguely conscious that the laughing breath of the young girl had blown it away forever.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is a new}} {{character}} {{for me to come}} out in," [...] he said bitterly; [...] "I do not know myself--I, of all men. But there was no bravery in it; {{it never occurred to me}} to be afraid; I just thrashed him off as I should beat off a dog who was killing a lamb; there was no noise, and it is noise that frightens me; if the brute had roared I should assuredly have run; I know it would have been so; I could not have helped it to have saved my life. It is an awful curse that I am not as other men, and that I tremble and shake like a girl at the sound of firearms. It would have been better if I had been killed by the first shot fired in the Punjaub eight years ago, or if I had blown my brains out at the end of the day. Good Heavens! what have I suffered since. But I will not think of it. Thank God, I have got my work; and as long as I keep my <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> there is no room for that other;" [...] and then, by a great effort of will, Ralph Bathurst put the past behind him, and concentrated his thoughts on the work on which he had been that day engaged.|$|E

'Yet {{think not}} that I come to urge thy crimes, [...] I {{did not come}} to curse thee, Guinevere, [...] I, whose vast pity almost makes me die [...] To see thee, laying there thy golden head, [...] My pride in happier summers, at my feet. [...] The wrath which forced my <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> fierce law, [...] The doom of treason and the flaming death, [...] (When first I learnt thee hidden here) is past. [...] The pang--which while I weighed thy heart with one [...] Too wholly true to dream untruth in thee, [...] Made my tears burn--is also past--in part. [...] And all is past, the sin is sinned, and I, [...] Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God [...] Forgives: do thou for thine own soul the rest. [...] But how to take last leave of all I loved? [...] O golden hair, with which I used to play [...] Not knowing! O imperial-moulded form, [...] And beauty such as never woman wore, [...] Until it became a kingdom's curse with thee-- [...] I cannot touch thy lips, they are not mine, [...] But Lancelot's: nay, they never were the King's. [...] I cannot take thy hand: that too is flesh, [...] And in the flesh thou hast sinned; and mine own flesh, [...] Here looking down on thine polluted, cries [...] "I loathe thee:" [...] yet not less, O Guinevere, [...] For I was ever virgin save for thee, [...] My love through flesh hath wrought into my life [...] So far, that my doom is, I love thee still. [...] Let no man dream but that I love thee still. [...] Perchance, and so thou purify thy soul, [...] And so thou lean on our fair father Christ, [...] Hereafter in that world where all are pure [...] We two may meet before high God, and thou [...] Wilt spring to me, and claim me thine, and know [...] I am thine husband--not a smaller soul, [...] Nor Lancelot, nor another. Leave me that, [...] I charge thee, my last hope. Now must I hence. [...] Through the thick night I hear the trumpet blow: [...] They summon me their King to lead mine hosts [...] Far down to that great battle in the west, [...] Where I must strike against the man they call [...] My sister's son--no kin of mine, who leagues [...] With Lords of the White Horse, heathen, and knights, [...] Traitors--and strike him dead, and meet myself [...] Death, or I know not what mysterious doom. [...] And thou {{remaining}} here wilt learn the event; [...] But hither shall I never come again, [...] Never lie by thy side; see thee no more-- [...] Farewell!' ...|$|E

I looked forward to a forenoon of clammy warmth, and an afternoon of clammy cold and of east wind, with a misty nightfall soaking men to the bones. But the day really turned out well enough; it was showery, but not shrewish, and it smiled pleasantly at sunset, as if content with the opening ceremonies of the Great Peace Jubilee.|$|R

In seasons three and four, Ullman is sitting, being interviewed by a person off-screen giving insight into her personal life and her <b>thoughts</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> episode's subject.

The 2 pros were #1) In their opinion I had a good voice and #2) They thought I was nice. Unfortunately, {{the decision was made to}} not release my album, which was sad because I really liked it. After the traumatic end to my affiliation with Atlantic Nashville I desperately needed to stop. It was the first time I felt confused about what I was supposed to be doing.
