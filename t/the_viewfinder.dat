25|$|During {{the first}} years of {{production}} (until the Zenit-E of 1967) Zenit camera development coincided with that of the Zorki cameras. The Zenit-S had PC-synchro for external flash units (almost like the Zorki-S) and the Zenit-3M also had an RF-sibling, the Zorki-6. For an SLR, the Pentaprism of all classical Zenits was undersize, with <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder</b> showing about two-thirds of the actual frame-size.|$|E

He showcased this belief by having nearly all his photographs printed only at full-frame and completely free of any cropping or other darkroom manipulation. He insisted that his prints were not cropped as they include the first few millimeters of the unexposed negative around the image area, resulting in a black frame around the developed picture.|$|E

25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop loss light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder</b> and live view on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder,</b> and handles bright situations well.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{majority}} of commentators, Hitchcock's films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder,</b> since he did not need to, though in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternate takes to consider. However, this view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by the book Hitchcock at Work, written by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of Cahiers du cinéma. Krohn, after investigating several script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock alongside inspection of storyboards, and other production material, has observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned. He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. A great example would be the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of North by Northwest which was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.|$|E

2500|$|A digital single-lens {{reflex camera}} (also called a digital SLR or DSLR) is {{a digital camera}} that {{combines}} the optics and the mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital imaging sensor, as opposed to photographic film. The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design, light travels through the lens, then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder</b> or the image sensor. The traditional alternative {{would be to have}} a viewfinder with its own lens, hence the term [...] "single lens" [...] for this design. By using only one lens, <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder</b> of a DSLR presents an image that will not differ substantially from what is captured by the camera's sensor. A DSLR differs from non-reflex single-lens digital cameras in that <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder</b> presents a direct optical view through the lens, rather than being captured by the camera's image sensor and displayed by a digital screen.|$|E

2500|$|The first SLR cameras with {{internal}} (“through-the-lens” or “TTL”) meters (e.g., the Pentax Spotmatic) {{required that the}} lens is stopped down to the working aperture when taking a meter reading. [...] With a small aperture, this darkened <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder,</b> making viewing, focusing, and composition difficult. Subsequent models soon incorporated mechanical coupling between the lens and the camera body, indicating the working aperture to the camera while allowing the lens to be at its maximum aperture for composition and focusing; this feature became known as automatic aperture control or automatic diaphragm control.|$|E
2500|$|Compared {{with some}} low cost cameras that provide an optical {{viewfinder}} {{that uses a}} small auxiliary lens, the DSLR design {{has the advantage of}} being parallax-free: it never provides an off-axis view. A disadvantage of the DSLR optical viewfinder system is that when it is used, it prevents using the LCD for viewing and composing the picture. Some people prefer to compose pictures on the display– for them this has become the de facto way to use a camera. Depending on the viewing position of the reflex mirror (down or up), the light from the scene can only reach either <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder</b> or the sensor. Therefore, many early DSLRs did not provide [...] "live preview" [...] (i.e., focusing, framing, and depth-of-field preview using the display), a facility that is always available on digicams.

2500|$|The {{following}} day on March 5, President Fidel Castro blamed the U.S. CIA {{and called for}} a memorial service and mass demonstration at Havana's Colón Cemetery, to honor the victims. At the time, Guevara was Minister of Industry in the new government, and Korda was Castro's official photographer. After a funeral march along the seafront boulevard known as Malecón, Fidel Castro gave a eulogy for the fallen at a stage on 23rd street.

2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas <b>the</b> <b>viewfinder</b> in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|E

5000|$|The design also replaces <b>the</b> optical <b>viewfinder</b> {{present in}} {{conventional}} DSLR with a high-resolution electronic <b>viewfinder.</b> <b>The</b> translucent mirror is fixed in position so {{does not have}} to flip up to take a still image, enabling rapid continuous shots of up to 10 frames per second.
