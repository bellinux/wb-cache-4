5|$|After {{years of}} decline with {{abandoned}} buildings and high elderly populations, <b>the</b> <b>demographics</b> <b>of</b> Old Louisville {{began to change}} noticeably in the 1990s. New residents were not just college students using the area as housing, but also young professionals who {{wanted to live in}} Old Louisville. The Courier-Journal's Velocity weekly has reported the area as a hip, emerging center of culture in Louisville. This change is reflected in numerous coffeehouses, restaurants and bars opening in Old Louisville in the 1990s and early 2000s targeting at the younger crowd.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>demographics</b> <b>of</b> the {{readership}} broadened, {{it became}} possible to include characters {{who were more}} or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E

5|$|During {{their next}} {{expedition}} in 943, the Rus' captured Bardha'a, {{the capital of}} Arran, in the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan. The Rus' stayed there for several months, killing many inhabitants {{of the city and}} amassing substantial plunder. It was only an outbreak of dysentery among the Rus' that forced them to depart with their spoils. Sviatoslav, prince of Kiev, commanded the next attack, which destroyed the Khazar state in 965. Sviatoslav's campaign established the Rus's hold on the north-south trade routes, helping to alter <b>the</b> <b>demographics</b> <b>of</b> the region. Raids continued through the time period with the last Scandinavian attempt to reestablish the route to the Caspian Sea taking place in 1041 by Ingvar the Far-Travelled.|$|E
5|$|Political {{boundaries}} {{drawn by}} the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding settler populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark {{in the form of}} divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of Indians emigrating {{to other parts of the}} empire, such as Malaysia and Fiji, and Chinese people to Malaysia, Singapore and the Caribbean. <b>The</b> <b>demographics</b> <b>of</b> Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing to immigration to Britain from its former colonies.|$|E
5|$|The SSR Abkhazia was an {{ethnically diverse}} region. <b>The</b> <b>demographics</b> <b>of</b> Abkhazia shifted {{considerably}} {{in the decades}} following its annexation by Russia. Large numbers of ethnic Abkhaz had been deported {{in the late nineteenth}} century, with up to 100,000 expelled, mainly sent to the Ottoman Empire. The result was that by the time the SSR Abkhazia was formed, ethnic Abkhaz comprised less than 30% of the population (55,918), which numbered 201,016 according to the 1926 Soviet census, the only census conducted during the existence of the SSR Abkhazia. The korenizatsiia policy implemented in this era, which was to promote minority groups within the USSR, saw the numbers of Abkhaz increase: between 1922 and 1926, ethnic Abkhaz grew by roughly 8%, and constituted about 27.8% of the population; in this same time-frame, the number of ethnic Georgians fell from 42% to 36% (67,494). Other major ethnic groups counted in the 1926 census were Armenians (25,677, or 12.7%), Greeks (14,045, or 7%), and Russians (12,553, or 6.2%).|$|E

40|$|Transformation in <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global {{workforce}} {{has brought}} in new challenges, especially {{with reference to the}} global expatriate workforce. For regions like the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which heavily depend on expatriate workforce in the private sector, further research on <b>demographic</b> factors <b>of</b> expatriates is imperative as these factors significantly influence expatriate adjustment in a foreign location. The beginning segment of this paper presents major factors which have influenced <b>demographic</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global workforce, followed by discussion on the growth of the expatriate population in the GCC countries. The paper further presents findings of a survey conducted to explore <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> profile <b>of</b> a niche expatriate segment of Indian higher education teachers working in the GCC countries. The findings of the survey are also compared with other research on <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> profile <b>of</b> expatriates. This paper concludes with suggestions for further research on <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> profile <b>of</b> expatriate workers in the GCC countries...|$|R
