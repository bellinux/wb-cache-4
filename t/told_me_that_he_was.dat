500|$|Nevertheless, [...] {{with the}} {{primitive}} facilities {{available at the}} time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations {{that led to a}} satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as [...] "a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!" ...|$|E

2500|$|A BBC {{investigation}} {{alleged that}} the murder inquiry's Det. Sgt. John Davidson had taken money from known drug smuggler Clifford Norris, the father of David Norris, a chief suspect in the investigation. Neil Putnam, a former corrupt police detective turned whistleblower, told a BBC investigation that Clifford Norris was paying Mr Davidson to obstruct the case {{and to protect the}} suspects. [...] "Davidson <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> looking after Norris and that to me meant that he was protecting him, protecting his family against arrest and any conviction," [...] Putnam said. Davidson denied any such corruption.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{according}} to Charles Lyell, Cuvier made this statement after a late party and apparently had some doubts when reconsidering the matter when he awoke, fresh in the morning. [...] "The {{next morning he}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> confident {{that it was something}} quite different." [...] Strangely, this change of opinion did not make it back to Britain where Mantell was mocked for his error. Mantell was still convinced that the teeth had come from the Mesozoic strata and finally recognised that they resembled those of the iguana, but were twenty times larger. He surmised that the owner of the remains must have been at least 60feet (18metres) in length.|$|E
2500|$|The {{son of an}} English-born cabinet-maker of Polish heritage, Kopernik Joseph Boleslaw Stokowski, and his Irish-born wife Annie-Marion (née Moore), Stokowski {{was born}} Leopold Anthony Stokowski, {{although}} on occasion in later life he altered his middle name to Antoni, per the Polish spelling. There is some mystery surrounding his early life. For example, he spoke with an unusual, non-British accent, though he was [...] {{born and raised in}} London. On occasion, Stokowski gave his year of birth as 1887 instead of 1882, as {{in a letter to the}} Hugo Riemann Musiklexicon in 1950, which also incorrectly gave his birthplace as Kraków, Poland. Nicolas Slonimsky, editor of Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, received a letter from a Finnish encyclopaedia editor that said, [...] "The Maestro himself <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Pomerania, Germany, in 1889." [...] In Germany there was a corresponding rumour that his original name was simply [...] "Stock" [...] (German for stick). However, Stokowski's birth certificate (signed by J. Claxton, the registrar at the General Office, Somerset House, London, in the parish of All Souls, County of Middlesex) gives his birth on 18 April 1882, at 13 Upper Marylebone Street (now New Cavendish Street), in the Marylebone District of London. Stokowski was named after his Polish-born grandfather Leopold, who died in the English county of Surrey on 13 January 1879, at the age of 49.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{preparation}} she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai {{said in an interview}} that both herself and the director Bhansali [...] ".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and [...] "feel". Sometimes I sit quietly and gaze into space or the ground and he captures all that. In fact, the poster picture with me looking away was taken like that. I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society. [...] "And at least till my screenplay reaches the interval point, I do not start casting my actors." ...|$|E
