5|$|The revolutionary {{forces were}} to be demobilized as soon as {{possible}} and the federal forces {{were to be}} the only army in Mexico. This was in order <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> army, which had opposed a compromise with Madero.|$|E
5|$|Husayn's brother Musa Pasha then governed Gaza {{into the}} early 1670s, {{implementing}} an anti-French and anti-Christian regime <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman government. Soon after his reign ended, Ottomans officials were appointed to govern. The Ridwan period is considered Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule and the city gradually dwindled after they were removed from office.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII chose many centrist cabinets, as {{he wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> populace, much {{to the dismay of}} his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois. Louis always dreaded the day he would die, believing that his brother, and heir, Artois, would abandon the centrist {{government}} for an ultra-royalist autocracy, which would not bring favourable results.|$|E
50|$|In February 2002 One Nation quit Sharon's {{government}} to protest his disastrous economic parties. Their leader, Histadrut Labour Federation chairman Amir Peretz, has many similarities to Levy, {{with one of}} the few differences being that he had broken from Labour and not the Likud. One month later the rightist National Union-Israel Beiteinu quit the coalition, claiming that Sharon's restraint policy was equivalent <b>to</b> <b>appeasing</b> <b>the</b> PLO.|$|R
60|$|Bailey was not <b>to</b> be <b>appeased.</b> <b>The</b> venom of {{more than}} three years cried out for utterance. He had always held {{definite}} views upon Kirk, and Heaven had sent him the opportunity of expressing them.|$|R

5|$|The new {{government}} sought <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> protesters by reopening {{the border with}} Czechoslovakia. This, however, merely resulted in the resumption of the mass exodus through Hungary via Czechoslovakia. On 8November 1989, with huge demonstrations continuing across the country, the entire Politbüro resigned and a new, more moderate Politbüro was appointed under Krenz's continued leadership.|$|E
5|$|Bud Carson was Tech's {{defensive}} coordinator in 1966. His job was <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson {{was not the}} charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nerva's {{measures}} to remain {{popular with the}} Senate and the Roman people, support for Domitian remained strong in the army, which had called for his deification immediately after the assassination. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> soldiers of the Praetorian Guard, Nerva had dismissed their prefect Titus Petronius Secundus—one of the chief conspirators against Domitian—and replaced him with a former commander, Casperius Aelianus.|$|E
5000|$|The goods shed was {{an unusual}} feature. Local {{landowner}} Mr. Price of Rhiwlas objected {{to the construction of}} <b>the</b> line, and <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> him <b>the</b> goods shed was built to resemble a castle, with mock battlements and turrets.* ...|$|R
50|$|The {{island of}} Crete lives {{in fear of}} the Minotaur, a dreadful beast trapped inside a {{labyrinth}} under the royal palace. The monster is venerated as a god, and <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> it, <b>the</b> Cretians regularly sacrifice a maiden to it.|$|R

5|$|In 1671 Morgan {{attacked}} Panama City, {{landing on}} the Caribbean coast and traversing the isthmus before he attacked the city, which was on the Pacific coast. The battle was a rout, although the privateers profited less than in other raids. <b>To</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> Spanish, with whom the English had signed a peace treaty, Morgan was arrested and summoned to London in 1672, but {{was treated as a}} hero by the general populace and the leading figures of government and royalty including Charles II.|$|E
5|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> {{people of}} Rome an {{estimated}} 135 million sestertii {{was spent on}} donatives, or congiaria, throughout Domitian's reign. The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which {{had been reduced to}} a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the Capitoline Games, a quadrennial contest comprising athletic displays, chariot racing, and competitions for oratory, music and acting.|$|E
5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by {{complaining}} to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E

50|$|Exiled Druchii Warlocks ride {{on these}} foul {{tempered}} steeds as well; cursed by Malekith, {{the souls of}} these sorcerers are haunted by the Chaos God Slaanesh {{and in order to}} delay their ultimate fate, these depraved individuals sacrifice the souls of others in place of their own <b>to</b> temporarily <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> Dark Prince.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "strengths and weaknesses" [...] {{language}} {{was included in}} the curriculum standards in Texas <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> creationists when <b>the</b> SBOE first mandated the teaching of evolution in the late 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his desperate attempt <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, {{in combination with}} his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany and his regime's anti-Semitic {{policies}} significantly affected American pre-Code filmmaking. Although Hitler had become unpopular {{in many parts of}} the United States, Germany was still a voluminous importer of American films and the studios wanted <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> German government. The ban on Jews and negative portrayals of Germany in the Fatherland even led to a significant reduction in work for Jews in Hollywood until after the end of World War II. As a result, only two social problem films released by independent film companies addressed the mania in Germany during the pre-Code era (Are We Civilized? and Hitler's Reign of Terror).|$|E
5|$|Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games, and {{realised}} {{its importance}} <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> citizens of Rome. In the newly constructed Colosseum, the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments. The Inaugural {{games of the}} Flavian Amphitheatre lasted for a hundred days and {{were said to be}} extremely elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (elephants and cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were dropped into the audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even slaves), which could then be traded for the designated item.|$|E
50|$|The gods have {{cursed the}} country with a drought. There seems to be no hope. A holy man summoned by the king demands the {{sacrifice}} of a young woman <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gods. Toula is chosen to be sacrificed. A young man in love who is in love with Toula goes in search of water to save his beloved from her fate, but when he returns with good news, he finds that he is too late: Toula has already disappeared in the holy swamp and the gods have been thus appeased.|$|R
50|$|The Bhavishya Purana, some {{of whose}} {{portions}} date {{as late as}} the 19th century, also contains the legend with some variations. In this version, the Kanyakubja Brahmins conducted a sacrifice on Mount Abu <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> Brahma. <b>The</b> recital of the Vedic mantras produced four Kshatriya heroes: Samavedin Paramara, Yajurvedin Chahumana (Chauhan), Trivedin Shukla and Atharvavedin Parihara (Pratihara).|$|R
2500|$|With {{respect to}} Anglicanism, {{he stated that}} [...] "it's very sad to see a good man like the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, going to such {{extraordinary}} lengths <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> homophobes within <b>the</b> Anglican Communion".|$|R
5|$|During the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance {{away from}} {{protectionism}} and towards globalisation; its election manifesto recommended increasing {{foreign investment in}} priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India. This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch). The communist parties said that the BJP was attempting <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> World Bank and the United States government through its neoliberal policies. Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{believed}} that kings should rule England in a dignified manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual. He thought that his predecessors had allowed {{the status of}} the Crown to decline, and sought to correct this during his reign. The events of the civil war in Henry's youth deeply affected the King, and he adopted Edward the Confessor as his patron saint, hoping to emulate {{the way in which the}} Anglo-Saxon King had brought peace to England and reunited his people in order and harmony. Henry tried to use his royal authority leniently, hoping <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> more hostile barons and maintain peace in England.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, {{the treaty}} pushed American {{diplomatic}} relations away from France and towards Great Britain, as the French government {{concluded that it}} violated the Franco-American treaty of 1778, and that the U.S. government had accepted the treaty against the overwhelming public sentiment against it. This set {{up a series of}} diplomatic and political conflicts over the ensuing four years, culminating in {{what became known as the}} Quasi-War. The Jay Treaty also helped ensure American control of its own frontier lands. After the signing of treaty, the British withdrew their support from several Native Americans tribes, while the Spanish, fearing that the Jay Treaty signaled the creation of an Anglo-American alliance, sought <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
50|$|A {{main focus}} of PCNs was the valuing of {{presentation}} over participation. Within the performances contained distinct costumes worn by performers, adequate lighting, sometimes live instruments being played by musicians and more. The program was often dicatated in both English and Tagalog <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bilingual crowd the event drew in. Often folkloric dances were featured where students explored fashion and transnationalism {{within the context of}} Filipino American identity. Skits presented within the program had a tendency to draw comparisons to the experiences of Filipino Americans, such as traditional views of parents, homophobia, domestic violence, and more important representations of Fil-Am experiences.|$|R
50|$|The liturgical {{agenda was}} {{subsequently}} modified <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> many of <b>the</b> objections of the dissenting Lutherans, and in 1830 Frederick William ordered all Protestant congregations in Prussia {{to celebrate the}} Lord's Supper using the new agenda.|$|R
50|$|Some gamers {{complained about}} the Judgment Ring after the first game, {{claiming}} it made the game too hard. <b>To</b> <b>appease</b> them, <b>the</b> second and third games {{have the option to}} turn the ring off completely. As a trade-off, doing this prevents the player from performing critical hits, strikes, and other special effects, essentially creating a large handicap in exchange for the reduced difficulty.|$|R
5|$|The Jin assault {{commenced}} in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong {{continued to}} sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later.|$|E
5|$|Żółkiewski {{attended}} a cathedral school in Lwów (now L'viv, Ukraine). Unlike {{many of his}} peers he had no higher education and did not travel abroad. However, he pursued studies {{on his own and}} was particularly interested in history and historical literature. In 1566 he joined the court of King Sigismund II Augustus, as an aid to the king's secretary Jan Zamoyski. There he became familiar with the executionist movement, which advocated numerous reforms including military ones. In 1573 he took part in the diplomatic mission to France, sent to meet a newly elected king Henry III of France, and on his way back he was sent to Vienna <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> Habsburgs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> <b>the</b> gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
50|$|The statue {{controversy}} was minimized in 1899 when, in {{an effort}} <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> Hungarian sentiment, <b>the</b> Hentzi sculpture was removed from its prominent place in Saint George Square and placed inside {{the courtyard of the}} cadet school in Budapest.|$|R

One month later the rightist National Union-Israel Beiteinu quit the coalition, claiming that Sharon's restraint policy was equivalent <b>to</b> <b>appeasing</b> <b>the</b> PLO. This situation allowed Levy to enter the coalition in early April, though with almost no influence; he was named Minister Without Portfolio. Not long afterward Shas was fired from the government and was allowed back in, cementing Sharon's stability as prime minister at least {{until the end of the}} year. One Israel quit in November 2002 to force elections for January 2003.|$|R
50|$|The Act {{was passed}} as {{result of an}} {{incident}} in 1708 when the Russian Ambassador, Andrey Matveyev, was arrested and imprisoned by London bailiffs {{acting on behalf of}} his creditors. Matveyev was freed on bail, then left the country without presenting his letters of recall. <b>To</b> <b>appease</b> Peter <b>the</b> Great, the Act was passed, putting diplomatic immunity in Britain on a statutory basis for the first time.|$|R
