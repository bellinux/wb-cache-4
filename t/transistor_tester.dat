5000|$|<b>Transistor</b> <b>testers</b> {{have the}} {{necessary}} controls and switches for making the proper voltage, current and signal settings. A meter with a calibrated [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad" [...] scale is on the front.In addition, these <b>transistor</b> <b>testers</b> are designed to check the solid-state diodes. There are also testers for checking high transistor and rectifiers.|$|R

40|$|The author briefly {{describes}} a capacitor meter {{based on a}} 555 timer in astable mode which directly measures capacitor values in microfarads. The author also {{describes a}} capacitance meter based on a 555 timer in monostable mode. The author also describes a <b>transistor</b> <b>tester</b> based on a 555 timer in astable mode with dual supply. Circuit diagrams for each meter are give...|$|E
40|$|A {{very simple}} low cost bipolar <b>transistor</b> <b>tester</b> for physics lab is given. The {{proposed}} circuit not only indicates {{the type of}} transistor(NPN/PNP) but also indicates the terminals(emitter, base and collector) using simple dual color (red/green) LEDs. Color diagrams of testing procedure have been given for easy following. This article describes the construction of this apparatus in all detail with schematic circuit diagram, circuit layout and constructional illustration. The second part describes a simple circuit to test digital ICs in a physics lab. Small scale integration digital ICs like logic gates, flip-flops, registers, counters, decoders, multiplexers etc are used in physics lab for various purposes either in a commercially obtained equipment or lab made circuits. The non-functionality of a circuit may call for {{a test of the}} digital chip. Commercially available test equipment is expensive, bulky and some times useless with regard to the concerned test. This article describes an inexpensive, portable and useful digital IC test circuit that could be helpful in detecting the actual fault with the chip provided the data sheet for the chip is available. In a very convenient and easy way. The article contains neat diagrams and illustrations to help the reader build a proper functional digital IC tester. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
