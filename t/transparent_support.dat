50|$|The Acorn {{filesystem}} {{design is}} interesting to some people because all ADFS-based storage devices connect to a module called FileCore which provides almost all the features required to implement an ADFS-compatible filesystem. Because of this modular design, it is easy in RISC OS 3 to add support for so-called image filing systems. These are used to implement completely <b>transparent</b> <b>support</b> for IBM PC format floppy disks, including the slightly different Atari ST format.

50|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} while porting the sc {{spreadsheet}} to the S-Lang library, Davis developed the library's screen management facility. This component {{was designed to}} optimize screen output (by minimizing the number of characters sent to the terminal), and provide {{a simple way to}} support a variety of terminals through an extra layer of abstraction between the application code and the terminal. The slrn newsreader was the first application to make full use of this interface. Since then, a number of other programs (e.g., Mutt) have taken advantage of this feature of the library, and it has become arguably the most used aspect of the library, as this component is considered to be an alternative to curses. Since version 2.0, the screen management routines have had <b>transparent</b> <b>support</b> for UTF-8.|$|E

40|$|Though all of {{the current}} main-stream OSs have {{supported}} superpage to some extent, most of them need runtime information provided by applications, simulator or other tools. <b>Transparent</b> superpage <b>support</b> is a further step, while so far there are only very few primitive attempts for Linux. In this paper, we propose the design of GISP (Global Information based SuperPage <b>support),</b> a <b>transparent</b> superpage <b>support</b> framework in Linux kernel. GISP adopts the basic idea of the reservationbased policy, and uses LMO (lightweight memory object) and POPMAP (population map) to manage the page allocation for applications. GISP could provide the core functions of superpage support while keeping the memory continuity by dynamic pages recycling. We implement it in Linux 2. 4. 17 on PKUnity SoC, and evaluate it for real workloads and benchmarks. We obtain substantial performance benefits from 8. 1 % to 24. 0 %. Compared with the best <b>transparent</b> superpage <b>support</b> in Linux up to now, we achieve better performance from 0. 4 % to 4. 6 % in most cases; even the worst case has comparable performance improvements within 2. 6 %. Otherwise, it keeps low management cost during system running which is suitable for not only scientific applications but also commodity applications. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Louis Ducos du Hauron had {{suggested}} using a sandwich of three differently color-recording emulsions on transparent supports {{which could be}} exposed together in an ordinary camera, then taken apart and used like any other set of three-color separations. The problem was that although two of the emulsions could be in contact face-to-face, the third {{would have to be}} separated by the thickness of one <b>transparent</b> <b>support</b> layer. Because all silver halide emulsions are inherently sensitive to blue, the blue-recording layer ought to be on top and have a blue-blocking yellow filter layer behind it. This blue-recording layer, used to make the yellow print which could most afford to be [...] "soft," [...] would end up producing the sharpest image. The two layers behind it, one sensitized to red but not green and the other to green but not red, would suffer from scattering of the light as it passed through the topmost emulsion, and one or both would further suffer by being spaced away from it.|$|E
5000|$|COM and ActiveX {{components}} are run as native code on the user's machine, with no sandboxing. There are therefore few restrictions {{on what the}} code can do. The prior practice of embedding ActiveX components on web pages with Internet Explorer did therefore lead to problems with malware infections. Microsoft recognized the problem with ActiveX {{as far back as}} 1996 when Charles Fitzgerald said, [...] "We never made the claim up front that ActiveX is intrinsically secure". Recent [...] versions of Internet Explorer prompt the user before installing ActiveX controls, enabling the user to disallow installation of controls from sites that the user does not trust. The ActiveX controls are signed with digital signatures to guarantee their authenticity. It is also possible to disable ActiveX controls altogether, or to allow only a selected few. The <b>transparent</b> <b>support</b> for out-of-process COM servers still promotes software safety in terms of process isolation. This can be useful for decoupling subsystems of large application into separate processes. Process isolation limits state corruption in one process from negatively affecting the integrity of the other processes, since they only communicate through strictly defined interfaces. Thus, only the affected subsystem needs to be restarted in order to regain valid state. This is not the case for subsystems within the same process, where a rogue pointer in one subsystem can randomly corrupt other subsystems.|$|E

Brillouin scattering, the scattering of light by ultrasonic waves, offers the possibility to probe the propagation of acoustic excitations of sub-micrometric wavelength, by contact-less and local measurements. From the acoustic properties the elastic ones can be derived. In the case of <b>transparent</b> <b>supported</b> films bulk waves {{can be measured in}} two different scattering geometries, together with surface acoustic waves. The smallness of the probed wavelengths allows a spatial resolution not achievable by other ultrasonic techniques. Brillouin scattering has been exploited to characterize a silica layer of micrometric thickness, thermally grown on a silicon substrate. The observation of various acoustic modes allows to derive the values of all the elastic moduli and of Poisson’s ratio of the silica film, together with its refractive index...|$|R
40|$|Data {{parallel}} programming {{is the most}} widely adopted paradigm for a large class of problems on traditional multicomputers (see SPMD programming model sidebar, p. 23). Nevertheless, {{it is a very}} hard task to preserve efficiency when this style is adopted on a cluster of heterogeneous nodes having nonuniform and time varying computational powers. Very popular packages, such as PVM and MPI, 1, 2 allow the programmer to use these clusters as an homogeneous parallel virtual machine. However, they do not avoid the potential inefficiencies due to the unpredictable variability of usually shared resources. DAME, an acronym for DAta Migration Environment, overcomes such drawbacks by means of <b>transparent</b> <b>supports</b> that hide irregular network topology, adapt the data distribution dynamically to platform conditions, and mask the consequent nonuniform distribution to the programmer. 2 1.

50|$|Conductive CNT {{coatings}} {{have recently}} become a prospective substitute based on {{wide range of}} methods including spraying, spin coating, casting, layer-by-layer, and Langmuir-Blodgett deposition. The transfer from a filter membrane to the <b>transparent</b> <b>support</b> using a solvent or {{in the form of an}} adhesive film is another method for attaining flexible and optically transparent CNT films. Other research efforts have shown that films made of arc-discharge CNT can result in a high conductivity and transparency. Furthermore, the work function of SWCNT networks is in the 4.8 to 4.9 eV range (compared to ITO which has a lower work function of 4.7 eV) leading to the expectation that the SWCNT work function should be high enough to assure efficient hole collection. Another benefit is that SWCNT films exhibit a high optical transparency in a broad spectral range from the UV-visible to the near-infrared range. Only a few materials retain reasonable transparency in the infrared spectrum while maintaining transparency in the visible part of the spectrum as well as acceptable overall electrical conductivity. SWCNT films are highly flexible, do not creep, do not crack after bending, theoretically have high thermal conductivities to tolerate heat dissipation, and have high radiation resistance. However, the electrical sheet resistance of ITO is an order of magnitude less than the sheet resistance measured for SWCNT films. Nonetheless, initial research studies demonstrate SWCNT thin films can be used as conducting, transparent electrodes for hole collection in OPV devices with efficiencies between 1% and 2.5% confirming that they are comparable to devices fabricated using ITO. Thus, possibilities exist for advancing this research to develop CNT-based transparent electrodes that exceed the performance of traditional ITO materials.|$|E

In such deployments, the requirement of low system cost prohibits many range-based methods for sensor node localization; on the other hand, range-free approaches depending only on radio connectivity may underutilize the proximity information embedded in neighborhood sensing.
