25|$|Malnutrition is a {{condition}} that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems. It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals. Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> called overnutrition. Malnutrition {{is often used to}} specifically refer to undernutrition where an individual is not getting enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development. Extreme undernourishment, known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen. People also often get infections and are frequently cold. The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking.|$|E

500|$|Cupid at the Circus is a 1910 American silent short [...] drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a romance with a storyline focused around a country boy who follows a circus parade to the circus grounds and becomes intent on sneaking into the show. He is discovered, but before he can be ejected, a girl asks her father to buy him a ticket of admission. Thankful, the boy gives her his pocket knife. Years later the two meet again and when he sees her using his pocket knife. He proposes and she accepts. Not <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> known for certain about the production of this film, including the writer, director and photographer credits. The circus scenes were done with special arrangement by Barnum & Bailey. The film was released on May 20, 1910 to favorable reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was critical of}} the episode's intricacy, writing, [...] "'The Amazing Maleeni' is a convoluted episode that ultimately lacks verve and excitement. Even if one can {{figure out what is}} going on, there remains the question of how much, or even whether, to care." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two stars out of five. The two noted that, had the episode used real magic tricks instead of [...] "resort to CGI, the episode would have been much more than a simple [...] "cheat". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the fact that the explanation behind Maleeni turning his head around 360 degrees was never satisfactorily explained. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris compared the episode's plot to the 1999 movie Arlington Road, noting that while [...] "the scheme is fun to watch while it unfolds, [...] in the end, it's not credible; <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> left open to chance for it really to happen." ...|$|E

[...] Martin believed the scenes with Amy and Delaware in the orphanage were the [...] "fear factor" [...] of the episode. He later rated it the fourth best episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in}} the list. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy stated [...] "after the sensational opening gambit that kicked off the series premiere, it's perhaps unsurprising that 'Day of the Moon' starts with a similarly thrilling onslaught of action." [...] Jeffery was positive towards the nano-recorder, which provided the episode with [...] "a number of unsettling moments in which characters listen back to their own terrified exclamations about the Silents." [...] However, Jeffery felt the final scenes [...] "expose this episode's chief flaw— quite simply, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> left unresolved." [...] In conclusion, the reviewer stated [...] "While 'The Impossible Astronaut' aced the set-up, 'Day of the Moon' falters slightly in providing the resolution." [...] Jeffery rated the episode four stars out of five.|$|E

500|$|Định {{believed}} that Tự Đức would eventually realise his error and reward the insurgents. Historians {{feel that it}} is likely that Gian and Tự Đức saw Định's continued resistance as a misguided attempt to help the monarchy. In their written confrontation after the signing of the treaty, Gian did not accuse Định of being a rebel, but of excessive devotion to the emperor, which while admirable in principle, was hindering their current strategy. [...] "Monarchical loyalty is a noble quality", Gian had told the recalcitrant guerrilla leader, but [...] "t must have a limit. One cannot exceed this limit and still be faithful and pious. <b>Too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> just as bad as not enough; when a snake begins to have legs, it is no longer a snake..." [...] Tự Đức also appeared to view Định's continued resistance as a misguided manifestation of loyalty. Although the southern insurgents' disobedience provided the French with a pretext for further aggression, thereby hindering Tự Đức's plans for regaining the lost territory, the emperor never accused them of rebelling against royal authority. Instead, he continued to refer to them as [...] "righteous recruits" [...] motivated by [...] "indignation" [...] at the actions of the Westerners.|$|E
500|$|Amar Toor from AOL Radio {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review saying, [...] "Much {{like the rest}} of the album, this new song is simply made for the dance floor. And, much like Kesha herself, the track seems to embody relentless, carefree hedonism at its best." [...] He also noted, [...] "And when Kesha talks about a 'place I know', where 'they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor' in the style of a six-grade camp ditty, it's hard for anyone to not feel the urge to just take it off." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com gave the single four out of five stars. He was concerned with the overall lyrical depth and over-use of auto-tune but he complimented the song for its [...] "irresistibly catchy beat and chorus" [...] with a [...] "celebratory mood of dropping inhibitions." [...] He noted that [...] "with the volume turned up and the chorus encouraging you to 'take it off,' you may just feel inspired to follow the commands. The ultimate effect by the end of the song is very cathartic as it hints strongly that there is more to [...] "take off" [...] than simply clothing." [...] Andrew Burgess from musicOMH wrote that on the song the singer [...] "oozes swagger." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix used [...] "Take It Off" [...] as an example of Kesha's songwriting, noting that tracks which weren't over-thought were [...] "fine". Newman wrote that [...] "thinking <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> what gets Kesha, who co-wrote the songs here, in trouble.

By the final page of Justice League #23, that bridge is not so much burned as left a bit smokey from the waves of revelations that come to light in the issue’s final pages. It’s a fitting conclusion, but one that will require additional reading when the dust has settled." [...] Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources was critical of the final issue, giving it 3.5 stars out of 5. He felt that while [...] "Justice League #23 is a loud, clanging final chapter to the crossover between Justice League books", there [...] "was way <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> left hanging out to be completed elsewhere." [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN was highly critical of Justice League #23, giving it a 6.0 out of 10. Schedeen felt that the Trinity of Sin [...] "are practically non-entities in the story" [...] at the end, after being teased as the center of the event back in 2012. He also felt the splash pages were overused and did not like lack of conclusion. Finally, he felt it was [...] "refreshing to see that Johns has been executing a long-term plan for the past two years" [...] and [...] "the highlight of this issue, and probably the crossover as a whole, is the reveal of the Justice League traitor." [...] Ivan Reis' art was a standout in the issue, and praised by all.|$|E

She also created the Spanish Dance in ABT artist-in-residence Alexei Ratmansky's new version of The Nutcracker, premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In early 2011, she was well received at the Kennedy Center as the Milkmaid in Ratmansky's The Bright Stream, a remake of a banned comic ballet. In Black History Month in 2011, Copeland was selected by Essence {{as one of its}} 37 Boundary-breaking black women in entertainment. That same month, she toured with Company B, performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. In May, she created a role in Ratmansky's Dumbarton, danced to Stravinsky's chamber concerto, Dumbarton Oaks. Alastair Macaulay of The New York Times found the piece too intimate for the cavernous Met, but he noted: [...] "Misty Copeland gives sudden hints of need and emotional bleakness in a duet ... <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> going on to explain itself at one viewing; but at once I know I’m emotionally and structurally gripped." [...] Her Summer 2011 ABT solos included the peasant pas de deux in Giselle and, in Ratmansky's The Bright Stream at the Met in June, her reprise of the Milkmaid was called [...] "luminous, teasingly sensual". She reprised the Bright Stream role again in July at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles with a performance described as [...] "sly". As a flower girl, she was described as glittering in Don Quixote. In August, she performed at the Vail International Dance Festival in the Gerald Ford Amphitheater in Vail, Colorado.

Nonetheless, she was writing from within the patriarchal context of 17th-century England, and as J. L.

As she states in the introductory epistle, she does not [...] "plead for female preeminence, [...] to ask <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> the way to be denied all" [...] (Makin 1673). Such a disclaimer lends persuasion to Makin's rhetorical treatise for she reveals her sensitivity to her audience, an audience in which [...] "The Barbarous custom to breed women low is grown amongst us, and hath prevailed so far" [...] (Makin 1673).

2500|$|As well as {{resulting}} trusts, {{where the}} courts have presumed that the transferor would have intended the property return, there are resulting trusts which arise by automatic operation of the law. A key example is where property is transferred to a trustee, but <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> handed over. The surplus will be held by the recipient on a resulting trust. For example, in the Privy Council case of Air Jamaica Ltd v Charlton an airline's pension plan was overfunded, so that all employees could be paid the benefits that they were due under their employment contracts, but a surplus remained. The company argued that it should receive the money, because it had attempted to amend the scheme's terms, and the Jamaican government argued that it should receive the money, as bona vacantia because the scheme's original terms had stated money was not {{to return to the}} company, and the employees had all received their entitlements. However, the Privy Council advised both were wrong and the money should return to those who had made contributions to the fund: half the company and half the employees, on resulting trust. This was in response, according to Lord Millett, [...] "to the absence of any intention on his part to pass a beneficial interest to the recipient." [...] In a similar pattern, it was held in Vandervell v Inland Revenue Commissioners that an option to repurchase shares in a company was held on resulting trust for Mr Vandervell when he declared the option to be held by his family trustees, but did not say who he meant the option to be held on trust for. Mr Vandervell had been trying to make a gift of £250,000 to the Royal College of Surgeons without paying any transfer tax, and thought that he could do it if he transferred the College some shares in his company, let the company pay out enough dividends, and then bought the shares back. However, the Income Tax Act 1952 section 415(2), applied a tax to a settlor of a trust for any income made out of trusts, if the settlor retained any interest whatsoever. Because Mr Vandervell did not say who the option was meant to be for, the House of Lords concluded the option was held on trust for him, and therefore he was taxed. It has also been said, that trusts which arise when one person gives property to another for a reason, but then the reason fails, as in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd are resulting in nature. However, Lord Millett in his judgment in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley' ',(dissenting on the knowing receipt point, leading on the Quistclose point) recategorised the trust which arises as an immediate express trust {{for the benefit of the}} transferor, albeit with a mandate upon the recipient to apply the assets for a purpose stated in the contract.|$|E
