The American premiere of Petrushka, {{in a new}} production by, and starring, Adolph Bolm, was in an unusual opera-ballet double bill with La traviata. Monteux's performances were well received, but, though he later returned to the Met as a guest, opera did not loom large in his career. He said, [...] "I love conducting opera. The only <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I hate {{the atmosphere of the}} opera house, where only too often music is the least of many considerations, from staging to the temperaments of the principal singers." [...] Nor was he drawn to further engagements as a ballet conductor: [...] "it offers special problems of fitting in with the dances and the dancers, most of whom, I'm sorry to say, seem to have musical appreciation confined to an ability to count beats." [...] Nonetheless he occasionally conducted ballet performances, and even in his concert performances of the ballet scores he had conducted for Diaghilev he said he always had the dancers in his mind's eye.|$|E
500|$|Librarian Nancy Knapp {{pointed out}} the books' {{potential}} to improve literacy by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would. The seven-book series has a word count of 1,083,594 (US edition). Agreeing about the motivating effects, Diane Penrod also praised the books' blending of simple entertainment with [...] "the qualities of highbrow literary fiction", but {{expressed concern about the}} distracting effect of the prolific merchandising that accompanies the book launches. However, the assumption that Harry Potter books have increased literacy among young people is [...] "largely a folk legend." [...] Research by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the Harry Potter publishing phenomenon, nor has the broader downward trend in reading among Americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the Harry Potter books. The research also found that children who read Harry Potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres. NEA chairman Dana Gioia said the series, [...] "got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books. The <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one Harry Potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading." ...|$|E

500|$|Not every 20th-century critic opined {{primarily}} {{on the quality of}} the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that [...] "while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn." [...] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: [...] "Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. The <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is a little too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant to go... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has said more than he meant—or wished to mean." [...] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a [...] "tense ethereal beauty" [...] with a [...] "touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency" [...] of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, [...] "as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh." ...|$|E

2500|$|The crux of Butler's {{argument}} in Gender <b>Trouble</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the coherence {{of the categories}} of sex, gender, and sexuality—the natural-seeming coherence, for example, of masculine gender and heterosexual desire in male bodies—is culturally constructed through the repetition of stylized acts in time. These stylized bodily acts, in their repetition, establish the appearance of an essential, ontological [...] "core" [...] gender. This is {{the sense in which}} Butler theorizes gender, along with sex and sexuality, as performative. The performance of gender, sex, and sexuality, however, is not a voluntary choice for Butler, who locates the construction of the gendered, sexed, desiring subject within what she calls, borrowing from Foucault's Discipline and Punish, [...] "regulative discourses." [...] These, also called [...] "frameworks of intelligibility" [...] or [...] "disciplinary regimes," [...] decide in advance what possibilities of sex, gender, and sexuality are socially permitted to appear as coherent or [...] "natural." [...] Regulative discourse includes within it disciplinary techniques which, by coercing subjects to perform specific stylized actions, maintain the appearance in those subjects of the [...] "core" [...] gender, sex and sexuality the discourse itself produces.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{aspect of}} time <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the player in time trouble may {{use it to}} {{facilitate}} a swindle. An {{example of this is}} Chigorin–Schlechter, cited below, where Schlechter's time trouble led Chigorin to believe that 44...Qc7+! was a time pressure-induced blunder rather than a trap. Mortazavi notes that although players in time trouble [...] "rarely play the best moves, their opponents can also suffer from the excitement of the moment and play abysmally." [...] Krogius notes that a player who is unhappy with the course of the game sometimes [...] "enters time trouble with the idea of exploiting it as a form of psychological warfare. This ... is often successful: the opponent, hoping to gain a quick victory during the other side's time trouble, becomes excited and loses the necessary critical approach. ... The result is a loss of detachment in controlling one's emotions which leads to serious errors, and thus the intentional use of time trouble is often justified. However, Krogius warns that one should deliberately get into time trouble only after a detailed assessment of a number of considerations, such as the complexity of the position, the opponent's character, and the likelihood of errors on his part.|$|E

Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 1924, Du Bois visited Fisk on the {{occasion}} of his daughter Yolanda's graduation, and gave a speech to Fisk students, alumni and guests in connection with the University's commencement exercises. Du Bois was an outspoken critic of Fisk Presidents. In spring 1908, Du Bois visited Fisk to give the university's commencement address, and used the opportunity to criticize President Merrill's addition of industrial coursework at Fisk. While Merrill had no intent to industrialize the Fisk curriculum, the fallout from Du Bois's speech and continued problems fund raising led him to drop the proposal and submit his resignation three months later. [...] Fisk had recently announced the one million dollar fund fully subscribed and irrevocable, and Du Bois sensed the timing to challenge the administration. In front of a packed Fisk Memorial Chapel, and with McKenzie and his wife sitting in the front row, Du Bois declared, [...] "I have come to address you and, I say frankly, I have come to criticize." [...] Asserting that [...] "I have never known an institution whose alumni on the whole are more bitter and disgusted with the present situation in this university than the alumni of Fisk University today." [...] Du Bois endeavored to inform the administration [...] "openly and before your face what so many of your graduates are saying secretly behind your back." [...] Du Bois attacked the Fisk administration as sinister. [...] "For a long time a powerful section of the white South has offered to give its consent and countenance to the higher training of Negroes only on condition that the white South control and guide that education." [...] Du Bois protested that Fisk sold out to Northern foundations and Southern White interests in pursuit of fiscal security. Du Bois remarked, [...] "Of all the essentials that make an institution of learning, money is the least." [...] "And it is possible that for a million dollars the authorities of Fisk University have been asked either openly or by implication to sell to the white South the control of this institution." [...] Du Bois challenged the Fisk code of student conduct and discipline. [...] "I do not for a moment doubt that the object which Fisk today wishes to gain by her discipline are in themselves perfectly good objects," [...] "but the <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she is trying to accomplish her ends by methods which are medieval, and long since discredited." [...] Du Bois suggested students learned discipline through freedom, and lamented, [...] "self-expression and manhood are choked at Fisk in the very day when we need expression to develop manhood in the colored race." [...] Du Bois accused Fisk administrators allowing segregated ticket windows and seating at a Jubilee Singers concert, and of McKenzie leading female members of the Fisk Glee Club through the servants' entrance to sing for Southern White men. Du Bois called on alumni to reclaim Fisk's spirit, and proclaimed, [...] "the alumni of Fisk University are and of right ought to be, the ultimate source of authority in the policy and government" [...] of the University. He argued that alumni had no voice in the policies of Fisk, and complained alumni serving as board members were selected by McKenzie and other trustees and [...] "may not represent the opinion of the alumni." [...] Du Bois encouraged alumni to make public, [...] "what is happening at Fisk University," [...] to organize in order to save Fisk, and to demand elective representation on the board of trustees. Du Bois argued that until conditions at Fisk changed for the better, students should boycott the University.|$|E
