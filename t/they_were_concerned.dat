5|$|In July 1952, Kesselring was {{diagnosed}} with a cancerous growth in the throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty cigars per day but he quit smoking in 1925. Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> that he might die in prison like Mälzer, which would be a public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.|$|E

Franchise owners told media <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> at changes to the advertising mix, including the reduction of offline advertising activities.

5|$|That {{following}} offseason, Kelly, Sam Bohne {{and other}} Major League Baseball (MLB) players agreed to play professional basketball with O'Connell. National League (NL) president John Heydler insisted {{that anyone who}} played with O'Connell could be suspended. The Giants were also displeased with Kelly's arrangement, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> about the chance he could injure himself in non-baseball activity. However, Kelly had not played in any games at that point. He {{was removed from the}} roster and thus avoided suspension by MLB.|$|E

5|$|On April 25, 1979, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} who worked at the Argonne National Laboratory wrote to Senator John Glenn, the Chairman of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Federal Services. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> about information being leaked, in particular by the government's tacit acknowledgement that Morland's bomb design was substantially correct, something that could not otherwise have been deduced from unclassified information. These included the affidavits by the United States Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and government expert witness Jack Rosengren. Copies of the letter were sent to major newspapers, but with a cover note explaining that it was for background information and not publication. After about four weeks, the Glenn subcommittee forwarded it to the DOE, which classified it.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Stewart {{sought a}} {{change to the}} script to have the crew defend the Ba'ku village {{in the manner of}} the Battle of the Alamo instead of fleeing into the mountains. Piller could not find a {{feasible}} way to include this in the script, and the budget ruled out the creation of Alamo-like structures in the mountains. Several titles were considered for the film as shooting approached. Star Trek: Where Time Stands Still, Star Trek: Forever and Star Trek: Beyond Paradise were all considered but were rejected. Piller's favorite was Star Trek: Sacred Honor, but the studio rejected this because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> that it sounded too religious. When shooting began, the film was still called Star Trek IX.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent IV {{supported}} Mindaugas, {{hoping that}} a new Christian state could stem the inroads being made by the Golden Horde, {{a state of the}} Mongol Empire. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One of them ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and to build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope. This was a welcome development to the Lithuanians, since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too much control over the new state.|$|E

5|$|The {{first group}} of 35, which {{included}} Shepard, assembled at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the United States Air Force officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded {{that it would be}} a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and Wally Schirra, all of whom would eventually become astronauts. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> about their careers, but decided to volunteer.|$|E
5|$|This concern {{led to an}} {{independent}} review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered {{for the simple reason}} that everyone else was going supersonic, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.|$|E
5|$|Internally, the {{concessions}} made by General Khánh {{had the effect}} of unsettling Catholic officers such as Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Trần Thiện Khiêm, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> by what they perceived to be the handing of power to Buddhist leaders. Subsequently, General Khiêm fell out with General Khánh over policy issues along religious lines, even though an alliance between both men had enabled Khánh to remove General Minh from power. As military support for his regime diminished, Khánh had to rely upon civilian Buddhist activists to maintain power. For the Americans, Khánh's increased reliance on the Buddhists was a cause for concern, because the Buddhists favoured a political resolution to the conflict with the Communists. Thus, by the end of 1964 the Americans looked for someone to overthrow Khánh, in order to continue the military effort against the Communists. On February 20, 1965, Khánh was finally removed from power, and he was forced to leave South Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> with his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.|$|E
