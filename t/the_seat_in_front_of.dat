60|$|Months passed. One day, having {{occasion}} {{to go over}} to the Boyne Iron Works to get information at first hand from certain officials, and having finished my business, I boarded a South Side electric car standing at the terminal. Just before it started Krebs came down the aisle of the car and took <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Miss Graham. I {{shall be}} glad to avail myself of your very kind offer. Allow me." [...] He handed her ceremoniously to the carriage; he handed Effie Bowen even more ceremoniously to the carriage, holding his hat in one hand while he offered the other. Then he mounted to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them. [...] "The weather has changed," [...] he said.|$|E
50|$|The brace {{procedure}} for <b>the</b> forward-facing <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States {{is similar to}} that of the UK, but rather than placing the hands on the back of the head, passengers are advised to place them on the top of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> one hand holding the other wrist and resting the head in the space between the arms. If <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> is not within reach then passengers are advised to either grab their ankles or place their hands under their legs and grab the opposite forearm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} of whether, or not, the forearms and hands should rest on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> with <b>the</b> head {{resting on the}} crossed forearms, whether the forearms should wrap around the head, or whether the forearms should hang down by the legs.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} by Herts & Tallant and owned by George M. Cohan. The theatre introduced revolutionary concepts of a sunken orchestra (the previous configuration had the orchestra {{on the same level}} as <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> stage) and also not having pillars obstructing sight lines for the balcony.|$|R
60|$|They {{drove home}} with the boots {{standing}} {{side by side on}} <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them. Mr. Jobson got out first and knocked at the door, and as soon as it opened Mrs. Jobson pattered across the intervening space with the boots dangling from her hand. She had nearly reached the door when Mr. Foley, who had a diabolical habit of always being on hand when he was least wanted, appeared suddenly from the offside of the cab.|$|E
60|$|When {{they could}} be seen no longer, Millicent let Gaites arrange their hand-baggage {{together}} on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them. It was a warm day, {{and she said she}} did believe she would take her hat off; and she gave it to him, odorous of her pretty hair, to put in the rack overhead. After he had done this, and sat down definitively, she shrank unconsciously closer to him, knitting her fingers in those of his hand on the seat between them.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} boy {{caught sight of}} a {{gigantic}} figure entering the church, and darted away to usher the stranger into the pastor's seat; but Gascoyne (for it was he) took no notice of him. He passed steadily up {{the centre of the}} church, and sat down beside the Widow Stuart, whose face expressed anxiety and surprise the moment she observed who was seated there. The countenance of Henry, who sat {{on the other side of}} his mother, flushed, and he turned with an angry glance towards the captain of the Foam; but the look was thrown away, for Gascoyne had placed his arms on the back of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him, and rested his head on them; in which position he continued to remain without motion while the service was going on.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> open {{coaches are}} either {{arranged}} in groups opposite one another or behind one another aeroplane-style, and sometimes seats can be rotated {{to face the}} direction of travel. Seats facing one another may be provided with fixed tables, seats arranged one behind the other often have folding trays {{in the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b>|$|R

6000|$|They {{walked back}} through the thronged streets to Vauxhall station, saying little to one another, and there Lewisham, {{assuming}} as indifferent a manner as he could command, recovered their possessions from the booking-office by means of two separate tickets and put them aboard a four-wheeler. His luggage went outside, but the little brown portmanteau containing Ethel's trousseau was small enough to go on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them. You must figure a rather broken-down four-wheeler bearing the yellow-painted box and the experienced trunk and Mr. Lewisham and all his fortunes, a despondent fitful horse, and a threadbare venerable driver, blasphemous sotto voce and flagellant, in an ancient coat with capes. When our two young people found themselves in the cab again a certain stiffness of manner between them vanished {{and there was more}} squeezing of hands. [...] "Ethel Lewisham," [...] said Lewisham several times, and Ethel reciprocated with [...] "Husbinder" [...] and [...] "Hubby dear," [...] and took off her glove to look again in an ostentatious manner at a ring. And she kissed the ring.|$|E
60|$|He {{would walk}} down merely {{as far as}} the Great Vase, so he {{arranged}} with himself. If she were not there--it was not likely that she would be--he would turn back into Albany Street. The newsvendors' shops with their display of the cheaper illustrated papers, the second-hand furniture dealers with their faded engravings and old prints, would give him something to look at, to take away his thoughts from himself. But seeing her in the distance, almost the moment he had entered the gate, it came to him how disappointed he would have been had <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the red tulip bed been vacant. A little away from her he paused, turning to look at the flowers. He thought that, waiting his opportunity, {{he might be able to}} steal a glance at her undetected. Once for a moment he did so, but venturing a second time their eyes met, or he fancied they did, and blushing furiously he hurried past. But again she came with him, or, rather, preceded him. On each empty seat between him and the sinking sun he saw her quite plainly: the pale oval face and the brown shoes, and, between them, the fawn gloves folded one upon the other.|$|E
60|$|Miss Brown, {{with the}} {{radiance}} {{of her hair}} effectually concealed, in plain black skirt and simple blouse--the ideal secretary--had risen from <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her typewriter, and was standing facing the door through which he had entered, with a small revolver--which {{he had given her}} for a birthday present only the day before--clasped in her outstretched hand. The object of her solicitude was, it seemed to Peter Ruff, the most pitiful-looking object upon which he had ever looked. The hours had dwelt with Merries as the years with some people, and worse. He had lost his cap; his hair hung over his forehead in wild confusion; his eyes were red, bloodshot, and absolutely aflame with the terrors through which he had lived--underneath them the black marks might have been traced with a charcoal pencil. His cheeks were livid save for one burning spot. His clothes, too, were in disorder--the starch had gone from his collar, his tie hung loosely outside his waistcoat. He was cowering back against the wall. And between him and the girl, stretched upon the floor, was the body of a man in a huge motor coat, a limp, inert mass which neither moved nor seemed to have any sign of life. No wonder that Peter Ruff looked around his office, whose serenity had been so tragically disturbed, with an air of mild surprise.|$|E
25|$|Fiesta Class {{seats are}} also {{available}} on all aircraft.

50|$|Generally {{economy class}} seats {{consists}} of a seat, sometimes with a fold-down tray, that may recline. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> may also include a pocket attached {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> for storage of small items such as magazines. Depending on the configuration of the passenger compartment, luggage can be stowed in overhead racks or {{at each end of the}} coach cars.|$|R

60|$|It was {{all over}} in a moment--a wonderful, tense moment, during which I sat frozen to my chair, {{stricken}} dumb and motionless with the tragedy which it seemed that I alone had witnessed. For {{there had been a}} little puff of sound, so slight that no other ears had noticed it. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> me was empty, and the man on my right had fallen forwards, his hand pressed to his side, his face curiously livid, patchy with streaks of dark colour, his eyes bulbous. Waiters still hurried to and fro, the hum of conversation was uninterrupted. And then suddenly it came--a cry of breathless horror, of mortal unexpected agony--a cry, it seemed, of death. The waiters stopped in their places to gaze breathlessly at the spot from which the cry had come, a silver dish fell clattering from the fingers of one, and its contents rolled unnoticed about the floor. The murmur of voices, {{the rise and fall of}} laughter and speech, ceased as though an unseen finger had been pressed upon the lips of everyone in the room. Men rose in their places, women craned their necks. For a second or two the whole place was like a tableau of arrested motion. Then there was a rush towards the table across which the man had fallen, a doubled-up heap. A few feet away, with only that narrow margin of table-cloth between them, the girl sat and stared at him, still white and panic-stricken, yet with a curious change in her face from which all the dumb terror which had first attracted my attention seemed to have passed away.|$|E
60|$|Here was {{the theme}} on which her discontent rung its sad changes during her slow {{drive in the}} uneasy barouche, with one great trunk {{squeezing}} the meek driver, and the other fastened with a rope on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her. Her ruling vision {{all the way from}} Leubronn had been that the family would go abroad again; for of course there must be some little income left--her mamma did not mean that they would have literally nothing. To go to a dull place abroad and live poorly, was the dismal future that threatened her: she had seen plenty of poor English people abroad and imagined herself plunged in the despised dullness of their ill-plenished lives, with Alice, Bertha, Fanny and Isabel all growing up in tediousness around her, while she advanced toward thirty and her mamma got more and more melancholy. But she did not mean to submit, and let misfortune do what it would with her: she had not yet quite believed in the misfortune; but weariness and disgust with this wretched arrival had begun to affect her like an uncomfortable waking, worse than the uneasy dreams which had gone before. The self-delight with which she had kissed her image in the glass had faded before the sense of futility in being anything whatever--charming, clever, resolute--what was the good of it all? Events might turn out anyhow, and men were hateful. Yes, men were hateful. But in these last hours, a certain change had come over their meaning. It is one thing to hate stolen goods, and another thing to hate them the more because their being stolen hinders us from making use of them. Gwendolen had begun to be angry with Grandcourt for being what had hindered her from marrying him, angry with him as the cause of her present dreary lot.|$|E
60|$|Dizzily Joan arose, {{and with}} Cleve half {{supporting}} her she backed {{off the road}} to a seat on the bank. She saw the bandits now at business-like action. Blicky and Smith were cutting the horses out of their harness: Beady Jones, like a ghoul, searched the dead men; the three bandits whom Joan knew only by sight were making up a pack; Budd was standing beside the stage with his, expectant grin; and Gulden, with the agility of the gorilla he resembled, was clambering {{over the top of the}} stage. Suddenly from under the driver's seat he hauled a buckskin sack. It was small, but heavy. He threw it down to Budd, almost knocking over that bandit. Budd hugged the sack and yelled like an Indian. The other men whooped and ran toward him. Gulden hauled out another sack. Hands to the number of a dozen stretched clutchingly. When he threw the sack there was a mad scramble. They fought, but it was only play. They were gleeful. Blicky secured the prize and he held it aloft in triumph. Assuredly he would have waved it had it not been so heavy. Gulden drew out several small sacks, which he provokingly placed on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him. The bandits below howled in protest. Then the giant, with his arm under the seat, his huge frame bowed, heaved powerfully upon something, and his face turned red. He halted in his tugging to glare at his bandit comrades below. If his great cavernous eyes expressed any feeling it was analogous to the reluctance manifest in his posture--he regretted the presence of his gang. He would rather have been alone. Then with deep-muttered curse and mighty heave he lifted out a huge buckskin sack, tied and placarded and marked.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> standard-gauge cars, <b>seating</b> {{is usually}} {{configured}} into ranges of {{between three and}} five <b>seats</b> across <b>the</b> width of the car, with an aisle in between (resulting in arrangements of 2+1, 2+2 or 3+2 <b>seats)</b> or at <b>the</b> side. Tables may be provided between seats facing one another. Alternatively, <b>seats</b> facing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction may {{have access to a}} fold-down ledge on the back of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b>|$|R
50|$|The brace {{position}} as {{set out to}} airlines in the UK for passengers <b>in</b> forward-facing <b>seats</b> is based on extensive analytical work arising from Kegworth. It is subtly different from that in the United States and some other countries. Passengers should place their feet and knees together with their feet firmly on the floor (either flat or {{on the balls of}} their feet) and tucked behind the knees to prevent shins and legs from being broken against the base of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> They should bend as far forward as possible, resting their head against <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> if it is within reach and place their hands on the back of their head, with the hands one on top of another (rather than interlocked). Their elbows should then be brought in. This prevents both flailing of the arms in the crash sequence and protects the head from flying debris. The head should be as far below the top of <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> as possible to prevent injury from any collapsing overhead compartments.|$|R

25|$|By 1925, the RNA Council Stand, located {{adjacent}} the Ernest Baynes Stand overlooking the show ring, had been constructed. The Stand was originally two storeys. At some early period {{the northern end}} of the building was extended to incorporate an entrance to <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> stand. By 1938, a third storey had been added to the building and later a two-storey extension facing Executive Street was constructed.|$|R
50|$|The {{lightweight}} {{train was}} constructed with welded stainless steel using Budd's patented process. The engine was an 8-cylinder Winton 201-A diesel, driving a generator; the lead truck {{was equipped with}} traction motors. It was fitted with air conditioning in all cars.
