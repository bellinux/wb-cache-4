Sol–gel derived nanocrystalline <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> along with a commercial nanocrystalline <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> was used as adsorbents to study the adsorption of two common, organophosphorous pesticides, diethoxy-[(2 -isopropyl- 6 -methyl- 4 -pyrimidinyl) oxy]-thioxophosphorane (diazinon) and dimethoxy-(3 -methyl- 4 -nitrophenoxy) -thioxophosphorane (fenitrothion). Adsorption of diazinon and fenitrothion on the sol–gel derived, and commercial nanocrystalline <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxides</b> was studied using UV–vis, FT-IR and 31 P NMR spectroscopies.

50|$|Magnesium oxalate {{dihydrate}} {{has also}} {{been used in the}} synthesis of nano sized <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide.</b> <b>Magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> is important because it is used as a catalyst, refractory materials, adsorbents, superconductors, and ferroelectric materials. Nano sized particles of <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> are optimal for some of these uses because of the larger surface area to volume ratio as compared with larger particles. Most common syntheses of <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> produce fairly large particles, however, the sol-gel synthesis using magnesium oxalate produces highly stable nano sized particles of <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide.</b> The sol-gel synthesis involves combining a magnesium salt, or in this case magnesium oxalate, with a gelating agent.

The <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> bulk crystals were cleaved to specimen size along the / 001 / surface, and indentations were made on the cleaved surface in corrosive solutions containing HCl, NaOH, or HNO 3 and in water without exposing the specimen to any other environment. The results indicated that chloride (such as MgCl 2) and sodium films are formed on the <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> surface {{as a result of}} interactions between an HCl-containing solution and a cleaved <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> surface. The chloride films soften the <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> surface. In this case microhardness is strongly influenced by the pH value of the solution. The lower the pH, the lower the microhardness.
