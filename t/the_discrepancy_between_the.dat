When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Maemi left about 1.47million {{electric}} customers {{without power}} around the country, causing ₩12.9billion (KRW, $11.61million USD) in damage to power companies. Widespread damage interrupted mobile and cell phone service. United States {{military bases in}} the country sustained about $4.5million in damage. Nationwide, Maemi destroyed about 5,000houses and damaged 13,000homes and businesses, leaving 25,000people homeless. About 150businesses in Gangwon Province were destroyed by Typhoon Rusa in 2002, only to be destroyed again by Maemi when they were rebuilt. Insured damages from Maemi were estimated at ₩650billion (KRW, $565million), mostly property damage. The insured damage was over four {{times the amount of}} insured damage from Typhoon Rusa the year prior. Overall damage was estimated at ₩5.52trillion (KRW, $4.8billion USD). By comparison, this total was ₩2.52trillion (KRW, $1.9billion USD) less than Rusa; <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> insured and overall damage was due to Maemi causing heavier industrial damage, while Rusa caused more damage overall.

25|$|The quantum key {{distribution}} protocols described above provide Alice and Bob with nearly identical shared keys, and also with an estimate of <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> keys. These differences {{can be caused by}} eavesdropping, but also by imperfections in the transmission line and detectors. As it is impossible to distinguish between these two types of errors, guaranteed security requires the assumption that all errors are due to eavesdropping. Provided the error rate between the keys is lower than a certain threshold (20% as of April 2007), two steps can be performed to first remove the erroneous bits and then reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrary small value. These two steps are known as information reconciliation and privacy amplification respectively, and were first described in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, contradictions {{have arisen}} in the {{discussion}} of King's criticisms. The author once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself. In October 2013, however, journalist Laura Miller wrote that <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two was almost the complete opposite: the Jack Torrance of the novel was corrupted by his own choices – particularly alcoholism – whereas in Kubrick's adaptation the causes are actually more surreal and ambiguous:King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make — whether it’s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety — are what matter to him. But in Kubrick’s The Shining, the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It’s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King’s novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like “insects” because the director doesn’t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick’s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King’s “The Shining”, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick’s, the monster is Kubrick.|$|E

500|$|Wishing {{to avoid}} {{controversial}} areas of astronomy, including quasars and galactic motion, Rubin {{began to study}} the rotation and outer reaches of galaxies, an interest sparked by her collaboration with the Burbidges. She investigated the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, again beginning with Andromeda, by looking at their outermost material, and observed flat rotation curves: the outermost components of the galaxy were moving as quickly as those close to the center. This was an early indication that spiral galaxies were surrounded by dark matter haloes. She further uncovered <b>the</b> <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> predicted angular motion of galaxies based on the visible light and the observed motion.
