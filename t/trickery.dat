5|$|Arthur Conan Doyle {{said there}} were many cases on record of Home levitating, but skeptics assert the alleged levitations {{occurred}} in darkened conditions susceptible to <b>trickery.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1860s {{the stage}} magician John Nevil Maskelyne exposed the <b>trickery</b> of the Davenport brothers. Wallace {{was unable to}} accept that he had {{replicated}} their feats utilizing natural methods, and stated that Maskelyne possessed supernatural powers. However, {{in one of his}} writings Wallace dismissed Maskelyne, referring to a lecture exposing his tricks.|$|E
5|$|Following {{closely in}} the {{footsteps}} of Sir Walter Scott, the novel uses its truthful historical backdrop to tell a fictional story of people who sculpted the past. The novel addresses themes of passionate love, vengeful <b>trickery,</b> and social status. While it is disdained by critics in favor of Balzac's later work, the novel marks a turning point in his life and artistry.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{prominent}} folklorist Yeleazar Meletinsky, Hermes is a deified trickster {{and master}} of thieves ("a plunderer, a cattle-raider, a night-watching" [...] in Homers' Hymns) and deception (Euripides) and (possibly evil) tricks and <b>trickeries,</b> crafty (from lit. god of craft), the cheat, {{the god of}} stealth.|$|R
6000|$|... "As for thee, sirrah, get thee gone, bag and baggage, thy {{tents and}} thy <b>trickeries,</b> before {{the night is}} half an hour older. The guard shall be sent to protect thee; but if thou art still here an hour hence, those sobered ruffians will have returned, and nothing'll save thee and thy wench a second time." ...|$|R
5|$|In battle, Marko used {{not only}} his {{strength}} and prowess but cunning and <b>trickery.</b> Despite his extraordinary qualities he was not depicted as a superhero or a god, but as a mortal man. There were opponents who surpassed him in courage and strength. He was occasionally capricious, short-tempered or cruel, but his predominant traits were honesty, loyalty and fundamental goodness.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Yuan Shao, Cao Cao {{proceeds to}} fight against Liu Bei, who is wandering the land {{in search of a}} master. Xiahou Dun pursues and defeats Guan Yu, Liu Bei's brother, who is trying to escape to boats on the Huang He ("Tales"). In 208 AD, Cao Cao wins victories over Zhuge Liang's <b>trickery</b> at Bo Wan Po, defeats a fleeing Liu Bei at Changban, and stops a fire attack ploy by an allied fleet of Sun Jian and Liu Bei at Chi Bi.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio <b>trickery</b> that had typified her last three albums and {{which would have been}} too difficult to re-create on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E
5000|$|This {{was best}} {{summed up by}} the Venetians {{describing}} it as"Broken faith, false promises, secret intrigues, plain <b>trickeries,</b> 'Yea' in the mouth, and 'Nay' in the heart, have between them ended in a treaty...full of treachery and injury to Venice, Savoy, and the Grisons, with the sole end of satisfying Spain, since all the advantages are on her side." ...|$|R
40|$|Readers {{often have}} passionate {{responses}} (both positive and negative) to books that first manipulate them into believing a seeming ‘truth’ about the narrative only to later {{discover that they}} have been deliberately fooled. In most cases readers are aware of the fictional status of these novels, which will be termed ‘trickeries’. Why, then, do readers exhibit such outrage towards changes in a world which is known to be invented? This thesis argues {{that in the case of}} <b>trickeries</b> the conventional reading process (which encompasses readerly expectations as set up by the narrative in conference with the reader’s knowledge about narrative and fiction) is used against the reader as the means through which they might be manipulated for a variety of purposes. Ongoing contentious debates surrounding certain narratological phenomena have tended to focus on conventional fiction as the basis for extrapolating data in support of various arguments. This study exploring narrative <b>trickeries</b> – the literary aberrations, the marked fiction – provides a new perspective on these debates, and in the process reveals fresh insights into the conventional processes of writing and reading fiction. This thesis explores how historically-shifting and supposedly dichotomous notions such as ‘truth/lies’ and ‘fiction/nonfiction’ inform the current circumstances in which contemporary readers consume literature. It is argued that this context provides the necessary conditions for a great proliferation of contemporary ‘trickeries’. In this thesis different types of <b>trickeries</b> are identified and anatomised in order to explore four different narratological phenomena which divide scholarly opinion: the narrative communication model; the storyworld; fictionality; and the paratext. In this pursuit, a narratological analysis is conducted of four contemporary English-language texts: Ian McEwan’s Sweet Tooth (the unexpected twist); John Fowles’ The French Lieutenant’s Woman (the frustrated-expectations novel); William Goldman’s The Princess Bride (the fictional(ised) memoir); and, Helen Demidenko’s The Hand that Signed the Paper (the hoax). These analyses of <b>trickeries</b> provide an understanding of not only the textual mechanics at play (and thus the role of the author), but also of readerly responses, and thus the active, agential role the contemporary reader plays in the holistic process of contemporary fiction...|$|R
60|$|Again, in {{the splendid}} power of realisation, which these {{greatest}} of artists had reached, {{there was the}} latent possibility of amusement by deception, and of excitement by sensualism. And Dutch <b>trickeries</b> of base resemblance, and French fancies of insidious beauty, soon occupied {{the eyes of the}} populace of Europe, too restless and wretched now to care for the sweet earth-berries and Madonna's ivy of Cima, and too ignoble to perceive Titian's colour, or Correggio's shade.|$|R
5|$|The plot of Sherlock Holmes Baffled is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories; {{it is likely}} that the character's name was used purely for its familiarity with the public. Shot from a single point of view on a stage set, the intention of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was probably to act as a showcase for basic film <b>trickery</b> and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E
5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's <b>trickery</b> in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the justification of Heracles's divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E
5|$|At the temple, Kassandra is {{assaulted}} by Khryse, a priest who disguises himself as Apollo {{in order to}} seduce her. She sees through his <b>trickery</b> and fights him off, but the god feels insulted by her refusal and makes the city's residents stop believing her prophecies. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon uses Helen's flight as a pretext for war and soon begins launching daily raids on Troy, beginning the Trojan War. Kassandra spends {{more time with her}} family to help with daily tasks while the menled by Hectorfight off the Akhaian invaders. The war continues sporadically despite the attempts of former Trojan ally Odysseus to end the conflict.|$|E
60|$|It is interesting, wonderfully interesting--the miracles which party-politics {{can do with}} a man's {{mental and}} moral make-up. Look at McKinley, Roosevelt, and yourself: in private life spotless in character; honorable, honest, just, humane, generous; scorning <b>trickeries,</b> treacheries, suppressions of the truth, mistranslations of the {{meanings}} of facts, the filching of credit earned by another, the condoning of crime, the glorifying of base acts: in public political life the reverse of all this.|$|R
5000|$|The modern English text gives:"There {{was also}} a man called Mercury, he was very crafty and {{deceitful}} in deed and <b>trickeries,</b> though his speech was fully plausible. The heathens made him a renowned god for themselves; at crossroads they offered sacrifices to him frequently and they often erringly brought praise-offerings to hilltops, all through the devil’s teaching. This false god was honored among the heathens in that day, and he is also called by the name Odin in the Danish manner." ...|$|R
60|$|The most {{interesting}} {{figure in the}} office was Mr. Fein, the junior partner, a Harvard Jew, who was perfectly the new type of business man. Serious, tall, spectacled, clean-shaven, lean-faced, taking business as a profession, and kindly justice as a religion, studying efficiency, but hating the metamorphosis of clerks into machines, he was the distinction {{and the power of}} Truax & Fein. At first Una had thought him humorless and negligible, but she discovered that it was he who pulled Mr. Truax out of his ruts, his pious <b>trickeries,</b> his cramping economies. She found that Mr. Fein loved books and the opera, and that he could be boyish after hours.|$|R
5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on <b>trickery</b> and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|Hadji Ali (c.1887–92– November5, 1937) was a {{vaudeville}} performance artist, {{thought to}} be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation. His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene, and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no <b>trickery</b> was employed.|$|E
5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into {{that of a}} more traditional winger; while being able to play on both wings, he is more comfortable on the right, {{where he has been}} known to utilise his pace, ball control, technical skills and <b>trickery</b> to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to his offensive movement, he can also play in a more offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even in a more central position, as a main striker.|$|E
60|$|For which end doubtless those direct {{historical}} Notices, {{where they}} can be met with, are the best. Nevertheless, of this sort too there occurs much, which, with our present light, it were questionable to emit. Teufelsdrockh vibrating everywhere between the highest and the lowest levels, comes into contact with public History itself. For example, those conversations and relations with illustrious Persons, as Sultan Mahmoud, the Emperor Napoleon, and others, are they not as yet rather of a diplomatic character than of a biographic? The Editor, appreciating the sacredness of crowned heads, nay perhaps suspecting the possible <b>trickeries</b> of a Clothes-Philosopher, will eschew this province for the present; a new time may bring new insight and a different duty.|$|R
60|$|And must it ever be {{otherwise}} with painting, for otherwise {{it has ever}} been. Her subjects have been regarded as mere themes on which the artist's power is to be displayed; and that power, be it of imitation, composition, idealization, or of whatever other kind, is the chief object of the spectator's observation. It is man and his fancies, man and his <b>trickeries,</b> man and his inventions,--poor, paltry, weak, self-sighted man,--which the connoisseur forever seeks and worships. Among potsherds and dunghills, among drunken boors and withered beldames, through every scene of debauchery and degradation, we follow the erring artist, not to receive one wholesome lesson, not to be touched with pity, nor moved with indignation, but to watch the dexterity of the pencil, and gloat over the glittering of the hue.|$|R
60|$|Every day the {{commission}} of bishops came and questioned Joan about her Voices and her mission, {{and then went to}} the King with their report. These pryings accomplished but little. She told as much as she considered advisable, and kept the rest to herself. Both threats and <b>trickeries</b> were wasted upon her. She did not care for the threats, and the traps caught nothing. She was perfectly frank and childlike about these things. She knew the bishops were sent by the King, that their questions were the King's questions, and that by all law and custom a King's questions must be answered; yet she told the King in her naive way at his own table one day that she answered only such of those questions as suited her.|$|R
5|$|Shakuni schemes an evil plan to {{kill the}} Pandavas through <b>trickery.</b> He {{constructs}} a house made of wax in Varanasi. Pandavas are ordered to go on pilgrimage to Varanasi until the troubled affairs of the state are resolved. Krishna sees through the plan of the evil Shakuni. He warns Bheema {{to keep an eye}} on miscreants trying to burn the house. He later orders Bheema to dig an underground tunnel from the wax house into a forest nearby, which Bheema does. On a midnight, as Krishna predicted, the house is burned by fire on the orders of Duryodhana.|$|E
5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of <b>trickery</b> to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E
5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his <b>trickery</b> and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E
60|$|We {{may thus}} apply the rule to the highest, {{as well as}} the art of daily occurrence, always remembering that more is to be forgiven to the great painter than to the mere {{decorative}} workman; and this especially, because the former, even in deceptive portions, will not trick us so grossly; as we have just seen in Correggio, where a worse painter would have made the thing look like life at once. There is, however, in room, villa, or garden decoration, some fitting admission of <b>trickeries</b> of this kind, as of pictured landscapes at the extremities of alleys and arcades, and ceilings like skies, or painted with prolongations upwards of the architecture of the walls, which things have sometimes a certain luxury and pleasureableness in places meant for idleness, and are innocent enough {{as long as they are}} regarded as mere toys.|$|R
6000|$|This of Pirch and {{the saddle}} is an Anecdote in wide circulation; taken {{sometimes}} as a proof of Royal thrift; but is mainly the Royal mode of rebuking Pirch for his weak {{behavior in the}} accident that had befallen. Pirch, an ingenious handy kind of fellow, famed for his pranks and <b>trickeries</b> in those Page-days, had many adventures in the world;--was, for one while, something of a notability among the French; will [...] "teach you the Prussian mode of drill," [...] and actually got leave to try it [...] "on the German Regiments in our service:" [...] [Voltaire's wondering Report of him ("Ferney, 7th December, 1774"), and Friedrich's quiet Answer ("Berlin, 28th Dec. 1774"): in OEuvres de Frederic, xxiii. 297, 301. Rodenbeck (ii. 198-200) has a slight [...] "BIOGRAPHY" [...] of Pirch.]--died, finally, as Colonel of one of these, at the Siege of Gibraltar, in 1783.|$|R
6000|$|Friedrich {{has none}} of these compunctious visitings; but his account too, when he does happen to speak on the subject, is worth hearing, and {{credible}} every word. Writing to Voltaire, a good while after (POTSDAM, 9th OCTOBER, 1773)) this, in the swift-flowing, miscellaneous Letter, is one passage:... "To return to your King of Poland. I am aware that Europe pretty generally believes the late Partition made (QU'ON A FAIT) of Poland to {{be a result of}} the Political <b>trickeries</b> (MANIGANCES) which are attributed to me; nevertheless, nothing is more untrue. After in vain proposing different arrangements and expedients, there was no alternative left but either that same Partition, or else Europe kindled into a general War. Appearances are deceitful; and the Public judges only by these. What I tell you is as true as the Forty-seventh of Euclid." [...] [OEuvres de Frederic, xxiii. 257.] ...|$|R
5|$|While Philip's fleet was {{wintering}} in Bargylia, {{the combined}} Pergamese and Rhodian fleet blockaded the harbour. The {{situation in the}} Macedonian camp became so grave that the Macedonians were close to surrendering. The dire situation was alleviated somewhat by supplies sent by Zeuxis. Philip, however, managed to get out by <b>trickery.</b> He sent an Egyptian deserter to Attalus and the Rhodians {{to say that he}} was preparing to attack the allies the next day. Upon hearing the news, Attalus and the Rhodians started preparing the fleet for the oncoming attack. While the allies were making their preparations, Philip slipped past them by night with his fleet, leaving numerous campfires burning to give the appearance that he remained in his camp.|$|E
5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his <b>trickery</b> and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Because of the Pandavas' ruined {{financial}} state, Balarama's wife, Revati, {{refuses to}} honour {{her commitment to}} marry Sasirekha and Abhimanyu and expresses her support for the alliance with the Kauravas. Krishna, who is aware of Duryodhana and Shakuni's real intentions, orders his charioteer Daaruka to take Subhadra and Abhimanyu through the forests to Ghatotkacha hermitage. Ghatotkacha, {{who happens to be}} Abhimanyu's brother, at first thinks they are intruders in his forest and attacks them but later apologises for the misunderstanding. When Subhadra explains the change in the marriage arrangements, Ghatotkacha decides to wage war against both the Kauravas and Balarama. At the urging of his mother, Hidimbi, and Subhadra, Ghatotkacha abandons his plans and is advised instead to try some <b>trickery</b> in Dvaraka. With the knowledge of Krishna and Sasirekha's servant, he carries the sleeping Sasirekha in her bed from Dvaraka, and flies to his hermitage. Assuming Sasirekha's form, he returns to Dvaraka and, {{with the help of his}} assistants Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, wreaks havoc on her wedding to Lakshmana Kumara, preventing the marriage from being carried out.|$|E
40|$|This study {{concentrated}} on local private companies' evaluation to solve crises. It explains {{the factors that}} {{have an effect on}} these companies’ success by developing strategies, establishing general budget supporting up their conditions, fair dealing with tax and clear corporate responsibility duties. The companies that get government support may reach their aims of solving the crises or may develop <b>trickeries</b> to get unfair profits besides government support which increases depression. The researcher suggests the use of three tables which will be presented in this study, as models to evaluate the fair general budget policies, the ability of local private companies to get support, and also to evaluate the sharing between companies and government. These tables are important and need to be monitored and can provide direction for companies to a condition which is to cover citizens’ need locally, at appropriate prices, at a suitable time and place. On another hand, a figure displayed in this research can be used to watch a company’s reaction in crises...|$|R
5000|$|My {{work has}} become an {{investigation}} into perception, specifically what one sees, and how one experiences the act of seeing. I have been recording colour and light, and their fleeting playfulness. I am intrigued {{by the way they}} can appear but also dissolve from our vision. Light and colour are central to my work, but journey and silence have always been the fundamental starting points…I sometimes experience an instant of acute beauty during which something (ordinarily hidden) is briefly illuminated. This sublime glimmer of colour or light is fleeting, unlikely to be seen or experienced again. I am attempting to document light’s ephemeral nature, noticing subtle colours, which impregnate both our true vision and that of the outside world. By observing and experiencing existence so intently, it becomes hard to look past light’s <b>trickeries,</b> its transient and weightless nature...I want my work to be experienced rather than read, and I like to play with ideas that almost don't exist in physical reality.

40|$|If {{you could}} be invisible, what would you do? The chances are {{that it would have}} {{something}} to do with power, wealth or sex. Perhaps all three. But there's no need to feel guilty. Impulses like these have always been at the heart of our fascination with invisibility: it points to realms beyond our senses, serves as a receptacle for fears and dreams, and hints at worlds where other rules apply. Invisibility is a mighty power and a terrible curse, a sexual promise, a spiritual condition. This is a history of humanity's turbulent relationship with the invisible. It takes on the myths and morals of Plato, the occult obsessions of the Middle Ages, the <b>trickeries</b> and illusions of stage magic, the auras and ethers of Victorian physics, military strategies to camouflage armies and ships and the discovery of invisibly small worlds. From the medieval to the cutting-edge, fairy tales to telecommunications, from beliefs about the supernatural to the discovery of dark energy, Philip Ball reveals the universe of the invisible...|$|R
