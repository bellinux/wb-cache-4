5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow (Zavattariornis stresemanni), {{also known}} as Abyssinian pie, bush crow, Ethiopian bushcrow, or by its generic name Zavattariornis, is a rather starling-like bird, which is {{currently}} thought to be member of the crow family, Corvidae, though this is uncertain. It is slightly larger than the North American blue jay and is a bluish-grey in overall colour which becomes almost white on the forehead. The throat and chest are creamy-white with the tail and wings a glossy black. The black feathers have a tendency <b>to</b> <b>bleach</b> to brown at their tips. The iris of the bird is brown and the eye {{is surrounded by a}} band of naked bright blue skin. The bill, legs, and feet are black.|$|E

This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the interpositive, similar <b>to</b> <b>bleach</b> bypass, {{which will be}} used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot. It took two weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E

25|$|Typha {{stems and}} leaves {{can be used}} to make paper. It is strong with a heavy texture and it is hard <b>to</b> <b>bleach,</b> so it is not {{suitable}} for industrial production of graphical paper. In 1853, considerable amounts of cattail paper were produced in New York, due to a shortage of raw materials. In 1948, French scientists tested methods for annual harvesting of the leaves. Because of the high cost these methods were abandoned and no further research was done. Today Typha is used to make decorative paper.|$|E
50|$|Ocean {{acidification}} {{can also}} lead to increased sea surface temperature. An increase of about 1 or 2 °C can cause the collapse of the relationship between coral and zooxanthellae, possibly leading <b>to</b> <b>bleaching.</b> Average sea surface temperature in the Great Barrier Reef is predicted to increase between 1 and 3 °C by 2100. This breakdown {{of the relationship between the}} coral and the zooxanthellae occurs when Photosystem II is damaged, either due to a reaction with the D1 protein or a lack of carbon dioxide fixation; these result in a lack of photosynthesis and can lead <b>to</b> <b>bleaching.</b>|$|R
40|$|This review scrutinises the {{different}} cellular mechanisms and environmental stressors that lead <b>to</b> <b>bleaching</b> {{and discuss the}} numerous effects of these. Coral bleaching is characterized by corals losing their symbiotic zooxanthellae. Different environmental stressors, e. g. elevated sea temperatures, irradiance, changing salinity and increasing atmospheric CO 2 induce damage in multiple sites of the photosynthetic apparatus of the zooxanthellae, leading <b>to</b> <b>bleaching.</b> Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed in both coral and its symbiotic zooxanthellae, which can exacerbate the damage within both organisms. Formation of toxic nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is also induced during bleaching and can enhance the formation of ROS further. Other cellular events leading <b>to</b> coral <b>bleaching</b> are programmed cell death (PCD) and necrosis. Furthermore the fact that zooxanthellae are found in eight different clades that are susceptible to different environmental stressors is expounded. The corals {{ability to cope with}} these stressors is dependent on the clade of zooxanthellae it is associated with and this may be important for future coral reef diversity...|$|R

25|$|Common {{hospital}} disinfectants are ineffective against C. difficile spores and, in fact, may promote spore formation, however, disinfectants {{containing a}} 10:1 ratio of water <b>to</b> <b>bleach</b> effectively kill the spores. Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) systems used to sterilize a patient room post-discharge {{have been shown}} to reduce infection rates and to reduce risk of infection to subsequent patients. The incidence of CDI was reduced by 53% or 42% through use of HPV. Ultraviolet cleaning devices and housekeeping staff especially dedicated to disinfecting the rooms of patients infected with C. difficile after discharge may be effective.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1770s, textile {{production}} was {{a cottage industry}} using flax and wool. Weaving was a family activity. The children and women would card the fibre — break up and clean the disorganized fluff into long bundles. The women would then spin these rough rovings into yarn wound on a spindle. The male weaver would use a frame loom to weave this into cloth. This was then tentered in the sun <b>to</b> <b>bleach</b> it. The invention by John Kay of the flying shuttle made the loom twice as productive, causing the demand for cotton yarn to vastly exceed what traditional spinners could supply.|$|E

Jin is the term used when the bark from an entire branch is removed to create {{the impression of a}} snag of deadwood. Shari denotes stripping bark from areas of the trunk to simulate natural scarring from a broken limb or lightning strike. In addition to stripping bark, deadwood techniques may also involve the use of tools to scar the deadwood or to raise its grain, and the application of chemicals (usually lime sulfur) <b>to</b> <b>bleach</b> and preserve the exposed deadwood.|$|E

It also is used to make sodium chlorate, which is added along with sulfuric acid and water to manufacture chlorine dioxide, an excellent oxygen-based bleaching chemical. The chlorine dioxide process, which originated in Germany after World War I, is becoming more popular because of environmental pressures to reduce or eliminate chlorinated bleaching compounds.

40|$|<b>Bleaching</b> refers <b>to</b> {{the loss}} of colour in symbioses between dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium and marine benthic animals, e. g. corals. Bleaching {{generally}} results in depressed growth and increased mortality, {{and it can be}} considered as a dele-terious physiological response or ailment. An explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching comprises three elements: the external factors or triggers of bleaching, e. g. elevated temperature; the symptoms, including elimination of algal cells and loss of algal pigment; and the mechanisms, which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers, resulting in the observed symptoms. The extent <b>to</b> which <b>bleaching</b> in different symbioses and in response to different triggers involves common mechanisms is currently unknown, but a contribution of interactions between the algal and animal partners <b>to</b> <b>bleaching</b> is predicted. Symbioses vary in their susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>bleaching</b> as a result of genetic variation in Symbiodinium and acclimatory responses of the animal. The evolu-tionary explanation for bleaching is obscure. Perhaps, bleaching was of selective advantage to the animal hosts under different (more benign?) environmental conditions than the present, or bleaching may be a negative by-product of an otherwise advantageous symbiotic trait, such as the elimination of damaged algal cells...|$|R

500|$|Nitrogen trichloride (NCl3) is a dense, volatile, and {{explosive}} liquid whose {{physical properties}} {{are similar to}} those of carbon tetrachloride, although one difference is that NCl3 is easily hydrolysed by water while CCl4 is not. It was first synthesised in 1811 by Pierre Louis Dulong, who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies. As a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially <b>to</b> <b>bleach</b> and sterilise flour. Nitrogen tribromide (NBr3), first prepared in 1975, is a deep red, temperature-sensitive, volatile solid that is explosive even at −100°C. Nitrogen triiodide (NI3) is still more unstable and was only prepared in 1990. Its adduct with ammonia, which was known earlier, is very shock-sensitive: it can be set off by the touch of a feather, shifting air currents, or even alpha particles. For this reason, small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesised as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of [...] "chemical magic".|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{chlorine}} oxoacids may {{be produced by}} exploiting these disproportionation reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, sodium chlorite is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and {{as a source of}} chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO2) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is sodium chlorate, mostly used to make chlorine dioxide <b>to</b> <b>bleach</b> paper pulp. The decomposition of chlorate to chloride and oxygen is a common way to produce oxygen in the laboratory on a small scale.

500|$|Chlorine gas {{was first}} used by French chemist Claude Berthollet <b>to</b> <b>bleach</b> {{textiles}} in 1785. Modern bleaches resulted from further work by Berthollet, who first produced sodium hypochlorite in 1789 in his laboratory {{in the town of}} Javel (now part of Paris, France), by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as [...] "Eau de Javel" [...] ("Javel water"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. This process was not very efficient, and alternative production methods were sought. Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant first produced a solution of calcium hypochlorite ("chlorinated lime"), then solid calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder). These compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water, it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, E. S. Smith patented a method of sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis of brine to produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite. This is known as the chloralkali process, first introduced on an industrial scale in 1892, and now the source of most elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide. In 1884 Chemischen Fabrik Griesheim of Germany developed another chloralkali process which entered commercial production in 1888.|$|E
40|$|A major coral {{bleaching}} event {{occurred in the}} central Red Sea near Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, {{in the summer of}} 2010, when the region experienced up to 10 - 11 degree heating weeks. We documented the susceptibility of various coral taxa <b>to</b> <b>bleaching</b> at eight reefs during the peak of this thermal stress. Oculinids and agaricids were most susceptible <b>to</b> <b>bleaching,</b> with up <b>to</b> 100 and 80 % of colonies of these families, respectively, bleaching at some reefs. In contrast, some families, such as mussids, pocilloporids, and pectinids showed low levels of bleaching (< 20 % on average). We resurveyed the reefs 7 months later to estimate subsequent mortality. Mortality was highly variable among taxa, with some taxa showing evidence of full recovery and some (e. g., acroporids) apparently suffering nearly complete mortality. The unequal mortality among families resulted in significant change in community composition following the bleaching. Significant factors in the likelihood of {{coral bleaching}} during this event were depth of the reef and distance of the reef from shore. Shallow reefs and inshore reefs had a higher prevalence of bleaching. This bleaching event shows that Red Sea reefs are subject to the same increasing pressures that reefs face worldwide. This study provides a quantitative, genus-level assessment of the vulnerability of various coral groups from within the Red Sea <b>to</b> <b>bleaching</b> and estimates subsequent mortality. As such, it can provide valuable insights into the future for reef communities in the Red Sea. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|Background: Antioxidizing {{agents have}} {{recently}} been suggested to compensate decreased bond strength of resin materials <b>to</b> <b>bleached</b> tooth tissues. This study compared the shear bond strength (SBS) of three different adhesives on bleached dentin immediately after bleaching, bleached/delayed for 1 week, and bleached/applied antioxidizing agent. Materials and Methods: The dentinal surfaces of 132 intact extracted molars were prepared and divided into 12 groups. The following adhesives were investigated: Optibond FL (OFL) (three-step etch-and-rinse), Optibond Solo Plus (two-step etch-and-rinse), and Optibond all-in-one (OA) (one-step self-etch) (Kerr, Orange, USA). Unbleached dentin groups (groups 1 - 3) were prepared as negative controls (NC). The remainder surfaces (groups 4 - 12) were bleached with 20 % Opalescent PF (Ultradent, USA). Specimens were bonded immediately after bleaching (groups 4 - 6), after 1 week (groups 7 - 9), or after using 10 % sodium ascorbate (SA) gel (groups 10 - 12). Subsequent to bonding of composite resin, the samples were tested for SBS and analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (α= 0. 05). Results: Regarding control groups, OA showed the highest SBS among the studied adhesives (P 0. 05) except the of delay bonding with OA. Conclusions: The findings suggest that bond strength of resin <b>to</b> <b>bleached</b> dentin may be affected with the adhesive system. Reduced SBS <b>to</b> <b>bleached</b> dentin can be amended {{by the use of}} SA as an antioxidizing agent. However, the amount of reversed bond strength subsequent to applying antioxidant might be related to the kind of dental adhesive...|$|R

Coral bleaching was studied at four sites in four widely geographically separated areas. Three {{of these sites}} are subjected to different human activities and the fourth one is considered as a control site. Data were collected by using SCUBA diving equipments and the line transects method. A total of 3940 coral colonies, representing 62 species in 21 genera and 10 families, were recorded on transects on the reefs of four studied sites. 20. 11 % of all corals were affected by bleaching: 5. 4 % were moderately affected; 2. 7 % severely affected and 12. 007 % were dead. Overall, there were differences {{in the proportion of}} colonies affected by bleaching between the studied sites. Ras El-Behar, the site impacted by petroleum oil, has the maximum average proportion of moderately, severely bleached and dead colonies. While, the lowest average proportions of severely bleached colonies and dead colonies were found at Kalawy bay. Surprisingly, coral reef taxa at El-Hamraween harbor showed high resistance <b>to</b> <b>bleaching</b> probably because of having a new different clade of Symbiodinium which can withstand sea water temperature.
