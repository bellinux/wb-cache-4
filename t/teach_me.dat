500|$|Coach John Heisman's swift backfield {{used the}} pre-snap {{movement}} of his [...] "jump shift" [...] offense, and Al Hill led the team in carries. Ev Strupper, arguably {{the best of the}} four, was partially deaf; because of his deafness, he called the signals instead of the team's quarterback. When [...] "Strupe" [...] tried out for the team, he noticed that the quarterback shouted the signals every time he was to carry the ball. Realizing that the loud signals would be a tip-off to the opposition, Strupper told Heisman: [...] "Coach, those loud signals are absolutely unnecessary. You see when sickness in my kid days brought on this deafness my folks gave me the best instructors obtainable to <b>teach</b> <b>me</b> lip-reading." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball." ...|$|E
500|$|There was one vice-presidential {{debate between}} Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H. W. Bush. Held on , {{the result was}} proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians; women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush. At it, Ferraro criticized Reagan's initial refusal to support an {{extension}} to the Voting Rights Act. Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress stacked up with Bush's extensive government experience. To one Bush statement she said, [...] "Let me just say first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude {{that you have to}} <b>teach</b> <b>me</b> about foreign policy." [...] She strongly defended her position on abortion, which earned her applause and a respectful reply from her opponent. In {{the days leading up to}} the debate, Second Lady of the United States Barbara Bush had publicly referred to Ferraro as [...] "that four-million-dollar—I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich'." [...] Barbara Bush soon apologized.|$|E

500|$|Indeed, at times, his sarcasm was {{directed}} even at his superiors, with Nansouty clashing {{with the more}} senior Grouchy at the Battle of Friedland. Nevertheless, Grouchy later recognised that the actions of Nansouty's division throughout the battle were [...] "glorious". In 1809, Nansouty famously responded to Napoleon's criticism after the Battle of Wagram by saying: [...] "It is not Your Majesty at any rate who can <b>teach</b> <b>me</b> how to handle cavalry." [...] Three years later, during the campaign in Russia, when Murat, King of Naples complained {{to him about the}} lack of resistance of the horses, Nansouty retorted: [...] "Oh yes, Sire, this is because they lack patriotism." [...] At the Battle of Craonne, in 1814, one day before resigning, he was recorded to have refused to execute Napoleon's order to assault a redoubt, a move which he saw as a death sentence to his men. Instead, Nansouty told the Emperor: [...] "I am going alone. There is nothing but death there and I will not lead these brave soldiers to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead, the {{congregation}} raised {{funds for a}} second building, and in 1928–1929 built the six-story Temple House (used for all congregational activities) on the corner opposite the main sanctuary. Designed by Mortimer Freehof and David Levy, the cast stone building's architectural style was [...] "Jewish Deco", a mix of Romanesque Revival and Art Deco decorative forms that was common in Jewish buildings of the period. Romanesque features included the s, while a prominent Art Deco feature was [...] "the figure of Moses and the Tablets of Law, emphasizing {{the corner of the}} roof parapet." [...] The doorway and balcony at the east end of the building had [...] "a distinctly Moorish flavor, featuring symbolic ornament: the Star of David, the Menorah, and the Lion of Judah." [...] The names of major figures from the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) were inscribed on the Garfield Place facade, and the Biblical verses [...] "SHOW ME THY WAYS O LORD <b>TEACH</b> <b>ME</b> THY PATHS GUIDE ME" [...] (...) on the Eighth Avenue facade. The building was also decorated with bas-reliefs of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish and Babylonian charioteers. It housed a 125-seat chapel, a large ballroom, social halls, class rooms for the religious school, meeting rooms, administrative offices, a library, handball courts, a gymnasium, and a swimming pool.|$|E
500|$|General MacDonald {{was very}} {{critical}} of both Walther and Nansouty, for their alleged failure to provide proper cavalry support during his attack. MacDonald went on to write in his memoirs that he was [...] "taken aback by the slowness of General Nansouty [...] Nansouty did charge in the end, but too late {{to take advantage of}} the gaping hole that I had pierced in the centre of the Austrian army." [...] A few days after the Battle of Wagram, Napoleon confronted Nansouty over what he saw as being a failure to cooperate with MacDonald. Nansouty responded to the Emperor's lively reproaches by offering categorical explanations, saying that he had not been consulted in the placement of his division, rendering manoeuvres impossible during that action. As Napoleon insisted, Nansouty stood up to him, finally retorting: [...] "After all, it is not Your Majesty at any rate who can <b>teach</b> <b>me</b> to lead cavalry..." [...] Despite this remark, Nansouty would continue to be given significant commands in the coming years. It was shortly after this bloody battle that Nansouty insisted that the Carabiniers-à-Cheval be given the steel cuirass, in a bid to cancel out what he saw as being a state of inferiority of these troops vis-à-vis their fellow cuirassiers. Nansouty's initiative was approved and was enforced in 1810.|$|E

500|$|Lindwall, Miller and Arthur Morris {{were the}} first {{beneficiaries}} of the New South Wales Cricket Association players' benefit payment plan, set up to reward New South Welshmen who had played for Australia in Tests. Lindwall was a Queensland selector for five seasons and an Australian selector from 1979–80 to 1982–83. He was given life membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1960, the NSWCA is 1979 and the Queensland Cricket Association in 1991. In 1965, he received an MBE for his services to cricket. In retirement, {{he and his wife}} Peggy ran a florist's business after 1965. [...] He and Peggy had two children, a son and a daughter. In the early 1970s, Lindwall mentored upcoming Western Australian paceman Dennis Lillee, who went on to hold the world record for Test wickets. After the Seventh Test in the 1970-71 Ashes series Lillee asked Keith Miller for Lindwall's address as [...] "He might just be able to <b>teach</b> <b>me</b> how to bowl". He published two books, Flying Stumps in 1954 and The Challenging Tests in 1961. Lindwall died at age 74 at Greenslopes, Brisbane, Queensland. Lindwall was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, he was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century as one of its opening bowlers.|$|E
