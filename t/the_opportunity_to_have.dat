[...] Among the rumors surrounding the accident that this second examination sought to verify was that an accidental firearm discharge took place on board the aircraft and caused the crash, since two months after the event, a farmer had found at the crash site a [...]22 (5.6mm) pistol known to have belonged to Buddy Holly. Another rumor had Richardson surviving the initial impact and crawling out of the aircraft in search for help, prompted by the fact that his body was found farther from the wreckage than the other three. [...] Bass and his team took several X-rays of Richardson's body and eventually concluded that the musician had indeed died instantly from extensive, nonsurvivable fractures to almost all of his bones; no traces of lead were found from any bullet. Coroner Smiley's original report was, therefore, confirmed.|$|E
500|$|Following the cliffhanger of the first-season finale, Kindler {{worked to}} figure out how to {{conclude}} the story and managed to write the outlines of the first two episodes in two days. He also consulted with the writing team to look at all the problems on how to conclude the story. [...] "Eulogy" [...] was conceived as an important episode in the lives of the main characters following the aftermath of [...] "End of Nights", as well as dealing with the loss of Ashley. Kindler said of the episode [...] "it's one thing to end on a terrible tragic cliffhanger, it's another in a satisfactory manner lay all things to rest appropriately." [...] In writing the episode Cooper was knowledgeable on [...] "medical jargon," [...] as she once wrote for the medical drama series House. In writing his first script [...] "Hero", McCullough was initially concerned that it would be met by resistance from the producers because of the special effects that would be involved, but was [...] "floored" [...] to find out it was entirely possible because of Anthem Visual Effects. The producers were originally hesitant in including [...] "Hero" [...] as the fourth episode, as it was considered lighter in tone as Magnus was trying to get over Ashley's death from [...] "Eulogy". [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] came early in the development of the season, as Kindler wanted to show an episode about Magnus' work going [...] "horribly wrong," [...] and explore <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the heroes warned that their work has consequences. Described as the [...] "darkest, scariest, creepiest episode ever" [...] by Tapping, it also featured scenes Kindler was never comfortable with, and did not want to show again, including the assault of naked women, and child killings.|$|E
500|$|Giancarlo Vulcano, a music {{editor and}} {{associate}} arranger on the show, revealed that Richmond taught him the song one morning at Silvercup Studios—where {{the show is}} filmed—and they played {{the first half of}} [...] "He Needs a Kidney" [...] at the script's read-through. According to Vulcano, the 30 Rock staff loved the song and the two were satisfied with the reception of it. While arranging the instrumentation, Richmond hired violinists for the episode's background music and for [...] "He Needs a Kidney", which according to him he usually does not get <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a lot of violin sounds on the show. The recording sessions with the musical guests took place on Stage 1 at Silvercup Studios; Stage 1 serves as the set for TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictitious comedy sketch show featured on 30 Rock. Richmond and Vulcano were complimentary towards the musicians—Clay Aiken, Sara Bareilles, the Beastie Boys (Mike D and Ad-Rock), Mary J. Blige, Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Steve Earle, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Talib Kweli, Cyndi Lauper, Adam Levine, Michael McDonald, Rhett Miller, Moby, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata—who performed [...] "He Needs a Kidney". In the DVD commentary for this episode, Richmond believed that the entire song would not make it into the airing. Elvis Costello was once approached to do an appearance on 30 Rock, but the appearance fell-through. At an Oscar's after party, Fey ran into Costello and asked him if he could appear, which he agreed to. According to Fey, none of the music artists got paid to appear on the show as [...] "they all did [...] for free." [...] The reason for this was due to a joke in the song in which Sheryl Crow was the only individual to get paid, as the rest said they did it for free. Following the broadcast of this episode of 30 Rock, the musical performance video was made available for digital download on iTunes with all the proceeds from the sales going to the National Kidney Foundation.|$|E
