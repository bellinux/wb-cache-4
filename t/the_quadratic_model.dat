Unlike simpler models like <b>the</b> <b>Quadratic</b> <b>Model,</b> the EKV Model is accurate even when the MOSFET is operating in the subthreshold region (e.g. when Vbulk=Vsource then the MOSFET is subthreshold when Vgate-source < VThreshold). In addition, it models many of the specialized effects seen in submicrometre CMOS IC design.|$|E

Owing to inaccurate measurement of satellite orbit and attitude, the Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) provided by image vendors are commonly biased and cannot be directly used for high-precision remote-sensing applications.
