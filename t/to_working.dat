50|$|If the {{potential}} applied <b>to</b> the <b>working</b> electrode {{is sufficient to}} reduce the analyte, then the concentration of analyte close <b>to</b> the <b>working</b> electrode will decrease. More of the analyte will slowly diffuse into the volume of solution close <b>to</b> the <b>working</b> electrode, restoring the concentration. If {{the potential}} applied <b>to</b> the <b>working</b> electrode is great enough (an overpotential), then the concentration of analyte next <b>to</b> the <b>working</b> electrode will depend entirely on the rate of diffusion. In such a case, the current {{is said to be}} diffusion limited. As the analyte is reduced at the working electrode, the concentration of the analyte in the whole solution will very slowly decrease; this depends {{on the size of the}} <b>working</b> electrode compared <b>to</b> the volume of the solution.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates what role I-deals (i. e. the {{idiosyncratic}} deals made between employees and their organization) {{play in the}} motivation of employees <b>to</b> continue <b>working</b> after retirement. We hypothesized two types of I-deals (i. e. development and flexibility I-deals) to be positively related to motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working.</b> More specifically, we drew from continuity and personality theory {{to argue that the}} motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working</b> is enhanced by I-deals, because they fulfil people’s needs for personalized work arrangements. Moreover, drawing from activity and disengagement theory it was hypothesized that two types of unit climate (i. e. accommodative and development climates) would moderate these relationships. Specifically, it was predicted that I-deals would be positively related to motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working</b> under conditions of low accommodative or high development climate. Results of a multi-level study among 1083 employees in 24 units largely supported the above expectations; flexibility I-deals related positively to motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working,</b> and unit climate moderated the relation between development I-deals and motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Because of the ageing and {{decreasing}} working {{population in the}} construction industry, {{it is important to}} encourage workers <b>to</b> prolong their <b>working</b> life. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore factors associated with the ability and motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working</b> until the age of 65 years in construction workers. Methods: In total 5, 610 construction workers that participated in the Netherlands Working Conditions Surveys of 2007, 2008 and 2009 were included. Workers filled out questionnaires on demographic, work-related and health-related factors, and the ability and motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working.</b> Logistic regression analyses were applied. Results: Higher job tenure, lower supervisory support, and musculoskeletal complaints were significantly associated with both a lower ability and motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working,</b> whereas overtime work was associated both with a higher ability and motivation. In addition, frequently using force, working in awkward postures, lower job autonomy and emotional exhaustion were associated with a lower ability <b>to</b> continue <b>working,</b> whereas older age and intermediate emotional jobs demands were associated with a higher ability. Furthermore, a low educational level was associated with a lower motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working,</b> and having a partner without a paid job was associated with a higher motivation. Conclusions: Supervisory support and preventing musculoskeletal complaints are promising to prolong workforce participation in the construction industry as they support both the ability and motivation <b>to</b> continue <b>working.</b> Moreover, reducing physical job demands, increasing job autonomy, and preventing emotional exhaustion are relevant for the ability <b>to</b> continue <b>working...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The working {{population}} is aging and {{a shortage of}} workers is expected in the construction industry. As a consequence, it is considered necessary that construction workers extend their working life. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore factors associated with construction workers' ability and willingness <b>to</b> continue <b>working</b> until the age of 65. Methods: In total, 5, 610 construction workers that participated in the Netherlands Working Conditions Survey Wlled out questionnaires on demographics, work-related and health-related factors, and on the ability and willingness <b>to</b> continue <b>working</b> until the age of 65. Logistic regression analyses were applied. Results: Older workers were more often able, but less willing, <b>to</b> continue <b>working</b> until the age of 65. Frequently using force, lower supervisor support, lower skill discretion, and the occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints were associated with both a lower ability and willingness <b>to</b> continue <b>working.</b> In addition, dangerous work, occasionally using force, working in awkward postures, lack of job autonomy, and reporting emotional exhaustion were associated with a lower ability <b>to</b> continue <b>working,</b> whereas working overtime was associated with a higher ability. Furthermore, low social support from colleagues was associated with a higher willingness. Conclusion: In addition to physical job demands, psychosocial job characteristics play a significant role in both the ability and willingness <b>to</b> continue <b>working</b> until the age of 65 in construction workers. Moreover, preventing musculoskeletal complaints may support the ability and willingness <b>to</b> continue <b>working,</b> whereas preventing emotional exhaustion is relevant for the ability <b>to</b> continue <b>working.</b> © Springer-Verlag 2011...|$|R
