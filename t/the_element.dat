5|$|Early {{research}} into <b>the</b> <b>element</b> was somewhat limited {{because most of}} the nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States at the time were focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project. Research into <b>the</b> <b>element</b> did continue as a minor part of the project and the first bulk sample of neptunium was isolated in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The name {{darmstadtium}} (Ds) {{was suggested}} by the GSI team {{in honor of the}} city of Darmstadt, where <b>the</b> <b>element</b> was discovered. The GSI team originally also considered naming <b>the</b> <b>element</b> wixhausium, after the suburb of Darmstadt known as Wixhausen where <b>the</b> <b>element</b> was discovered, but eventually decided on darmstadtium. The new name was officially recommended by IUPAC on August 16, 2003.|$|E
5|$|Traces of {{californium}} can {{be found}} near facilities that use <b>the</b> <b>element</b> in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments. <b>The</b> <b>element</b> is fairly insoluble in water, but it adheres well to ordinary soil; and concentrations {{of it in the}} soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles.|$|E

5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} {{in most of the}} minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements {{it was not until the}} late 1800s that <b>the</b> <b>element</b> was isolated.

5000|$|The next {{quotation}} is {{a definition}} of structuralism in different fields.

The whole is independent of its relationship to <b>the</b> <b>elements.</b> <b>The</b> relationships between <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> are more important than <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> themselves. <b>The</b> <b>elements</b> are interchangeable, but not the relationships."

50|$|By coordinated {{and planned}} {{cooperation}} of <b>the</b> <b>elements,</b> <b>the</b> organization {{is able to}} solve tasks that lie beyond the abilities of <b>the</b> single <b>elements.</b> <b>The</b> price paid by <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> is <b>the</b> limitation of the degrees of freedom of <b>the</b> <b>elements.</b> Advantages of organizations are enhancement (more of the same), addition (combination of different features) and extension. Disadvantages can be inertness (through co-ordination) and loss of interaction.|$|R

5|$|Because it seldom {{appears in}} high concentration, {{germanium}} was discovered comparatively {{late in the}} history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table, and called <b>the</b> <b>element</b> ekasilicon. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur, in a rare mineral called argyrodite. Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named <b>the</b> <b>element</b> after his country, Germany. Today, germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver, lead, and copper ores.|$|E

5|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. <b>The</b> <b>element</b> was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see {{with the unaided eye}} (after einsteinium). <b>The</b> <b>element</b> was named after the university and the state of California.|$|E
50|$|When {{speaking}} of the sum of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> of a finite set, one is inevitably led to the convention that the sum of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> of <b>the</b> empty set is zero. The {{reason for this is}} that zero is <b>the</b> identity <b>element</b> for addition. Similarly, the product of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> of <b>the</b> empty set should be considered to be one (see empty product), since one is <b>the</b> identity <b>element</b> for multiplication.|$|R

5|$|Dubnium {{does not}} occur {{naturally}} on Earth and is produced artificially. The first discovery of <b>the</b> <b>element</b> was claimed by the Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in 1968, followed in 1970 by the American University of California. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party, resulting in credit for discovery being officially shared between both teams. <b>The</b> <b>element</b> was officially named dubnium in 1997 after the town of Dubna, {{the site of the}} JINR.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine {{is used as}} a {{disinfectant}} {{either as}} <b>the</b> <b>element,</b> or as the water-soluble triiodide anion I3− generated in situ by adding iodide to poorly water-soluble elemental iodine (the reverse chemical reaction makes some free elemental iodine available for antisepsis).

5|$|In 1789, a Hungarian scientist, Pál Kitaibel, {{discovered}} <b>the</b> <b>element</b> independently in an ore from Deutsch-Pilsen {{that had}} been regarded as argentiferous molybdenite, but later he gave the credit to Müller.

5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized <b>the</b> <b>element</b> 107; their report came out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on <b>the</b> <b>element</b> 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of <b>the</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the first}} report on {{attempted}} isolation of <b>the</b> <b>element</b> was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent actinides, the group 5 elements, and polonium.|$|E
