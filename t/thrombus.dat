5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot (<b>thrombus).</b> Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a <b>thrombus</b> to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).|$|E
5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins {{are used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each technique has drawbacks: a single proximal scan may miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT overtreatment. Doppler ultrasound, CT scan venography, MRI venography, or MRI of the <b>thrombus</b> are also possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by <b>thrombus.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} intracoronary <b>thrombi</b> in the culprit lesions in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by angioscopy, and to compare them with clinical and angiographic features. We angioscopically observed the culprit coronary lesions in 66 patients with AMI (55 males and 11 females, 63. 9 ± 15. 4 years old) just before interventional therapy. <b>Thrombi</b> were observed in 42 of 66 lesions (64 %), namely, red <b>thrombi</b> in 16, mixed <b>thrombi</b> in 15, white <b>thrombi</b> in 11. In patients with complete obstruction (TIMI grade 0 and I), red <b>thrombi</b> were more frequently observed than mixed or white <b>thrombi.</b> On the other hand, in patients with incomplete obstruction (TIMI grade II and III), white <b>thrombi</b> were more frequently observed than the others. Angiographically, haziness and filling defect were significantly more frequently observed in patients with red <b>thrombi</b> than the others (p< 0. 05). The distance from proximal side branch to <b>thrombi</b> tended to be longer in patients with red <b>thrombi</b> than the others. The time from onset of AMI tended to be longer in patients with white <b>thrombi</b> than the others. These results suggest that blood flow may be an important determinant of <b>thrombi</b> characterization...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{interobserver}} variability between two observers from different echocardiographic laboratories. DESIGN [...] Two observers reviewed video recordings blinded to the other's diagnosis. In part I (n = 88), they determined interobserver variability for spontaneous echo contrast, left atrial <b>thrombi,</b> and appendage <b>thrombi.</b> No diagnostic criteria for <b>thrombi</b> were defined. In part II (n = 85), diagnostic criteria for <b>thrombi</b> were defined. RESULTS [...] Part I: Both observers agreed in diagnosing spontaneous echo contrast in 97 %, left atrial <b>thrombi</b> in 90 %, left atrial appendage <b>thrombi</b> in 94 %. Part II: With predefined criteria no disagreement occurred in diagnosing left atrial <b>thrombi.</b> In {{the diagnosis of}} left atrial appendage <b>thrombi</b> both observers agreed in 89 %. The mean diameters of the 10 <b>thrombi</b> on which the observers agreed were greater than of the nine appendage <b>thrombi</b> on which they disagreed. CONCLUSIONS [...] Interobserver variability in the diagnosis of spontaneous echo contrast is low. Defined criteria decrease interobserver variability for left atrial and appendage <b>thrombi,</b> although {{one third of the}} <b>thrombi</b> diagnosed by one observer were not confirmed by the other. Interobserver variability is high in the assessment of small structures (< 15 mm) within the left atrial appendage...|$|R
50|$|Red {{blood cells}} and fibrin {{are the main}} {{components}} of venous <b>thrombi,</b> and the <b>thrombi</b> appear to attach to the blood vessel wall endothelium, normally a non-thrombogenic surface, with fibrin. Platelets in venous <b>thrombi</b> attach to downstream fibrin, while in arterial <b>thrombi,</b> they compose the core. As a whole, platelets constitute less of venous <b>thrombi</b> when compared to arterial ones. The process is thought to be initiated by tissue factor-affected thrombin production, which leads to fibrin deposition.|$|R
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (<b>thrombus)</b> within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} neuroimaging {{investigations}} that may detect cerebral sinus thrombosis. Cerebral edema and venous infarction may be apparent on any modality, {{but for the}} detection of the <b>thrombus</b> itself, the most commonly used tests are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both using various types of radiocontrast to perform a venogram and visualise the veins around the brain.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of <b>thrombus</b> and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|Background: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is {{the most}} common {{strategy}} for the treatment of Acute ST segment elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), and thromboaspiration has been increasingly utilized for removal of occlusive <b>thrombi.</b> Objectives: To analyze the influence of histopathological features of coronary <b>thrombi</b> in clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI, and the association of these variables with clinical, angiographic, and laboratory features and medications used in hospitalization. Methods: Prospective cohort study. All patients were monitored during hospitalization and thirty days after the event. Aspirated <b>thrombi</b> were preserved in formalin and subsequently stained with hematoxylin-eosin and embedded in paraffin. <b>Thrombi</b> were classified as recent and old. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major cardiovascular events within thirty days. Results: During the study period, 1, 149 patients were evaluated with STEMI, and 331 patients underwent <b>thrombi</b> aspiration, leaving 199 patients available for analysis. It was identified recent <b>thrombi</b> in 116 patients (58 %) and old <b>thrombi</b> in 83 patients (42 %). Recent <b>thrombi</b> have greater infiltration of red blood cells than old <b>thrombi</b> (p = 0. 02), but there were no statistically significant differences between other clinical, angiographic, laboratory, and histopathologica...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For 13 {{patients}} with subacute and 4 {{patients with}} chronic occlusion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of occlusive arterial <b>thrombi</b> in the superficial femoral artery were performed in vivo. The patients with subacute occlusion were treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis. The frequency of MR signal intensity and its distribution in <b>thrombi</b> were studied for 11 successfully and 2 unsuccessfully treated patients and {{patients with chronic}} occlusion. Intra-arterial <b>thrombi</b> were MRI inhomogenous {{in all of the}} patients, but the MR signals from lysable and chronic <b>thrombi</b> were significantly different than those from nonlysable ones. The MRI of occlusive arterial <b>thrombi</b> is probably usable to predict the therapeutic outcome of thrombolytic treatment...|$|R
5|$|Then {{under house}} arrest, in May 2000 al-Jamri {{suffered}} a heart attack. He {{was taken to the}} Bahrain Defence Force Hospital, where he underwent surgery. During his stay at the hospital, he was visited by the King and Prime Minister. In May 2002, al-Jamri traveled to Germany for spinal surgery. While undergoing medical checkups, it was discovered he had a <b>thrombus</b> behind his eye, which had developed when he was in prison. Following the surgery he suffered a stroke, also developing kidney problems and a blood infection, soon falling into a coma. He woke from the coma on 30 June, but shortly after suffered a second stroke, resulting in internal bleeding, and incapacitating him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining <b>thrombus</b> after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E
5|$|When {{warfarin}} is newly started, it may promote clot formation temporarily. This {{is because}} the level of protein C and protein S are also dependent on vitamin K activity. Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead {{to a reduction in}} activity of protein C (for which it is the co-factor) and therefore reduced degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Although loading doses of warfarin over 5mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII, resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards <b>thrombus</b> formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5mg per day, it is beneficial to co-administer heparin, an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, with warfarin therapy for four to five days, in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved.|$|E
40|$|Identification of a {{distinct}} leukocyte recruitment mechanism by platelet <b>thrombi.</b> • Leukocyte migration through <b>thrombi</b> is partially mediated {{by one or}} more CXCR 1 / 2 ligands, including NAP- 2. Thrombosis promotes leukocyte infiltration into inflamed tissues, leading to organ injury in a broad range of diseases; however, themechanisms bywhich <b>thrombi</b> guide leukocytes to sites of vascular injury remain ill-defined. Using mouse models of endothelial injury (traumatic or ischemia reperfusion), we demonstrate {{a distinct}} process of leukocyte recruitment, termed “directed intravascular migration, ” specifically mediated by platelet <b>thrombi.</b> Single adherent platelets and platelet aggregates stimulated leukocyte shape change at sites of endothelial injury; however, only <b>thrombi</b> were capable of inducin...|$|R
40|$|Experimental deep venous <b>thrombi</b> were {{produced}} in the untraumatised leg veins of anaesthetised dogs.

Histologically, the experimental <b>thrombi</b> resembled human valve pocket <b>thrombi</b> found at postmortem...|$|R
40|$|Right sided heart <b>thrombi</b> {{may develop}} within the right heart {{chambers}} {{or they may}} be peripheral venous clots that {{on their way to the}} lungs, accidentally lodge in a patent foramen ovale, tricuspid chordae or Chiaris network. Type A <b>thrombi</b> have a worm-like shape and are extremely mobile. These pleomorphic <b>thrombi</b> are mainly localized in the right atrium, frequently move back and forth through the tricuspid orifice and may cause cardiovascular collapse when entrapment occurs. Type B <b>thrombi</b> attach to the atrial or ventricular wall indicating that they are probably of local origin. We describe the case of a middle age man (48 years old) with no cardiovascular history and a massive pulmonary embolism where transthoracic echocardiography revealed many type A <b>thrombi</b> in both right atrium and ventricle. He presented with acute dyspnea, diaphoresis and hemodynamical instability. He was treated with thrombolysis and after three hours was greatly improved and the <b>thrombi</b> were disappeared. After ten days of hospitalization he was discharged. <b>Thrombi</b> were originated in the popliteal region of the inferior vena cava of both legs and were totally treated...|$|R
25|$|Organisation: {{following}} the thrombotic event, residual vascular <b>thrombus</b> will be re-organised histologically with several possible outcomes. For an occlusive <b>thrombus</b> (defined as thrombosis within a small vessel {{that leads to}} complete occlusion), wound healing will reorganise the occlusive <b>thrombus</b> into collagenous scar tissue, where the scar tissue will either permanently obstruct the vessel, or contract down with myofibroblastic activity to unblock the lumen. For a mural <b>thrombus</b> (defined as a <b>thrombus</b> in a large vessel that restricts the blood flow but does not occlude completely), histological reorganisation of the <b>thrombus</b> does not occur via the classic wound healing mechanism. Instead, the platelet-derived growth factor degranulated by the clotted platelets will attract a layer of smooth muscle cells to cover the clot, and this layer of mural smooth muscle will be vascularised by the blood inside the vessel lumen {{rather than by the}} vasa vasorum.|$|E
25|$|In some contexts, {{the word}} <b>thrombus</b> is used interchangeably {{with the word}} clot, {{regardless}} of its composition (white, red, or mixed). In other contexts {{it is used to}} contrast a normal from an abnormal clot: <b>thrombus</b> arises from physiologic hemostasis, thrombosis arises from a pathologic and excessive quantity of clot. In a third context it is used to contrast the result from the process: <b>thrombus</b> is the result, thrombosis is the process.|$|E

25|$|An {{embolism}} is the lodging of an embolus, a blockage-causing {{piece of}} material, inside a blood vessel. The embolus {{may be a}} blood clot (<b>thrombus),</b> a fat globule (fat embolism), a bubble of air or other gas (gas embolism), or foreign material. An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel. Such a blockage (a vascular occlusion) may affect {{a part of the}} body distant from where the embolus originated. An embolism in which the embolus is a piece of <b>thrombus</b> is called a thromboembolism. Thrombosis, the process of <b>thrombus</b> formation, often leads to thromboembolism.|$|E

25|$|Ischaemia/infarction: if an {{arterial}} <b>thrombus</b> {{cannot be}} lysed {{by the body}} {{and it does not}} embolise, and if the <b>thrombus</b> is large enough to impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery, then local ischaemia or infarction will result. A venous <b>thrombus</b> {{may or may not be}} ischaemic, since veins distribute deoxygenated blood that is less vital for cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, non-ischaemic venous thrombosis may still be problematic, due to the swelling caused by blockage to venous drainage. In deep vein thrombosis this manifests as pain, redness, and swelling; in retinal vein occlusion this may result in macular oedema and visual acuity impairment, which if severe enough can lead to blindness.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 30 % of strokes are cryptogenic {{despite an}} {{exhaustive}} in-hospital work-up.

We therefore hypothesize that T-cell content in intracranial <b>thrombi</b> may also be a biomarker of atherothrombotic origin. We histopathologically investigated 54 consecutive <b>thrombi</b> retrieved after mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke patients. First, <b>thrombi</b> were classified as fibrin-dominant, erythrocyte-dominant or mixed pattern. We then performed quantitative analysis of CD 3 + cells on immunohistochemically-stained <b>thrombi</b> and compared T-cell content between "atherothrombotic", "cardioembolism" and "other causes" stroke subtypes. Fourteen (26 %) <b>thrombi</b> were defined as fibrin-dominant, 15 (28 %) as erythrocyte-dominant, 25 (46 %) as mixed.

Between 1988 and 1993, 183 consecutive pts underwent MVR with a bileaflet prosthesis (Saint-Jude 134, Sorin 22, Carbomedics 20, Duromedics 7). Their mean age was 56 ± 13 yrs. Early TEE was performed 15 ± 6 days after surgery and revealed <b>thrombi</b> in the prosthesis in 22 pts (12 %). No pt had symptoms. Two pts were re-operated on because of large, mobile <b>thrombi.</b> In the 20 other cases, Doppler did not show any obstruction in the prosthesis (mean gradient 5 ± 2 mmHg [3 – 9]), and the motion of both leaflets was normal on TEE and fluoroscopy. A total of 27 <b>thrombi</b> was visualized in these 20 pts. Maximal size of the <b>thrombi</b> was 10 mm in 6 cases; 70 % of these <b>thrombi</b> were mobile. These 20 pts were treated by carefully controlled anticoagulation with heparin (serum levels 0. 2 to 0. 4 U/mL) andlor vitamin K antagonists (INR 3 to 4. 5). No pt received thrombolytic therapy.
