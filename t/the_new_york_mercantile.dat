5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Mercantile</b> Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Mercantile</b> Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation {{of a threat to}} supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E

40|$|U. S. {{energy prices}} have grown {{dramatically}} since the 2007 financial crisis. Speculators are blamed for market manipulation, and regulators seek additional tools {{to control the}} market. Given the growing roles of liquidity and position limits in finance along with recent Wall Street legislation changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, we carry out studies to test how effectively price impact liquidity measures measure liquidity, whether position limits have impacts on market liquidity, and how optimal speculative position limits should be modeled, based on microstructure theories. Using <b>the</b> major <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Mercantile</b> Exchange (NYMEX) energy futures data from Bloomberg, we compare low-frequency liquidity proxies with high-frequency liquidity benchmarks, run an event study on futures contracts’ liquidity following the launching of the Dodd-Frank Act, and develop a theory-based position limits model. Our empirical results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> price impact liquidity proxy developed in this thesis is more effective in measuring liquidity than the Amihud (2002) proxy. Further, contrary to Grossman's (1993) finding, position limits on financial futures do not force traders to move to foreign substitute markets. Finally, position limits for single commodity derivatives {{should be based on}} corresponding underlying spot market factors, and strong fluctuations in optimal position limits over time suggest that exchanges should update position limits on a high-frequency basis...|$|R
