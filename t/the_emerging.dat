5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on <b>the</b> <b>emerging</b> cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

The Brahman then created seven sons filled with truth, called Prajapatis.

40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} emerged {{community}} structure {{is an important}} challenge in networks analysis. In fact, several methods have been proposed in the literature to statistically determine the significance of discovered structures. Nevertheless, most of existing analysis models consider only the structural aspect of emerged communities. We are interested in studying <b>the</b> robustness of <b>emerged</b> communities in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) networks. More precisely, we consider <b>the</b> <b>emerged</b> communities in <b>the</b> induced graph by all the exchanges in these networks. Hence, rather than examining the robustness only on the structural properties of the graph, we {{will focus on the}} parameters that allow the emergence of community structures. In fact, perturbing these parameters might destroy most of the obtained properties at <b>the</b> <b>emerged</b> level. To <b>the</b> best of our knowledge, robustness of networks has never been considered from this angle before. In this paper, we study the impact of perturbing the content and the profile of nodes on <b>the</b> <b>emerged</b> communities in P 2 Pnetworks. We show how these alterations affect both structure and information supported by <b>the</b> <b>emerged</b> structures...|$|R
