500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>point</b> of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{dialogue}} is much dismissed {{because it seems}} to recommend clever evil over witless evil. This is not <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>point,</b> however. Socrates is the impresario who sings off key, the boxer who throws the match not for money, but because he can. The dialogue does not establish Socrates' absurd thesis, that the deliberate liar is better than the witless one, but it does prove that Plato is as clever as Homer. Socrates, who pretends to be a lover of good reasoning, is widely thought to be what he says he is, a rational man. [...] Socrates is the literary equivalent of Achilles, whose speech against dissembling seems to fool everyone. Socrates is no more [...] "rational" [...] than Achilles is [...] "honest and simple".|$|E

2500|$|Montgomery {{showed that}} (assuming the Riemann hypothesis) at least 2/3 of all zeros are simple, and a related {{conjecture}} {{is that all}} zeros of the zeta function are simple (or more generally have no non-trivial integer linear relations between their imaginary parts). Dedekind zeta functions of algebraic number fields, which generalize the Riemann zeta function, often do have multiple complex zeros [...] This is because the Dedekind zeta functions factorize {{as a product of}} powers of Artin L-functions, so zeros of Artin L-functions sometimes give rise to multiple zeros of Dedekind zeta functions. Other examples of zeta functions with multiple zeros are the L-functions of some elliptic curves: these can have multiple zeros at <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>point</b> of their critical line; the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture predicts that the multiplicity of this zero is the rank of the elliptic curve.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elements}} of the ceremony have changed little over the Mafia's history. These elements {{have been the subject}} of much curiosity and speculation. [...] Sociologist Diego Gambetta points out that the Mafia, being a secretive criminal organization, cannot risk having its recruits sign application forms and written contracts which might be seized by the police. [...] Thus they rely on the old-fashioned ritual ceremony. [...] The {{elements of}} the ceremony are made deliberately specific, bizarre, and painful so that the event is both memorable and unambiguous, and the ceremony is witnessed by a number of senior mafiosi. The participants may not even care about what the symbols mean, and they may indeed have no intrinsic meaning. [...] <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>point</b> of the ritual is to leave no doubt about the mafioso's new status so that it cannot be denied or revoked on a whim.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plan was}} to engage the Afrika Korps with the 7th Armoured Division while the South African Division covered their left flank. Meanwhile, on their right, XIII Corps, {{supported}} by 4th Armoured Brigade (detached from 7th Armoured Division), would make a clockwise flanking advance west of Sidi Omar and hold position threatening {{the rear of the}} line of Axis defensive strongpoints, which ran east from Sidi Omar to the coast at Halfaya. Central to the plan was the destruction of the Axis armour by 7th Armoured Division to allow the relatively lightly armoured XIII Corps to advance north to Bardia on the coast whilst XXX Corps continued north-west to Tobruk and link with a break-out by 70th Division. There was also a deception plan to persuade the Axis that the main Allied attack would not be ready until early December and would be a sweeping outflanking move through Jarabub, an oasis {{on the edge of the}} Great Sand Sea, more than [...] to the south of <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>point</b> of attack.

For Farmer, the vision that she found in the Baha'i faith of a new age of religious unity, racial reconciliation, gender equality, and global peace was the fulfillment of Transcendentalism's reform impulses and progressivism's millennial dreams. To her skeptical associates, her turn to the Persian Revelation represented a betrayal of their deepest ideals as free-ranging seekers whose vision of a cosmopolitan piety dimmed at the prospect of one movement serving as a singular focus for the universal religion." ...|$|E
