40|$|The {{through space}} singlet-singlet and <b>triplet-triplet</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> in cofacial bis(etio-porphyrins) rigidly {{held by the}} carbazoyl spacer were investigated. The studies on singlet-singlet transfer, which {{operates}} via a Förster mechanism, were performed using the zinc porphyrin and free base chromophores as energy donor and acceptor, respectively, while the investigation on triplet-triplet processes was performed using the palladium porphyrin, and the zinc porphyrin and free base chromophores as donor and acceptors, respectively. The rate for singlet-singlet transfer (kET(singlet)) is unexpectedly slower than that reported for other similar, rigidly held bisporphyrins such as H 2 (DPO) Zn(DPO = 4, 6 -bis[5 -(2, 8, 13, 17 -tetraethyl- 3, 7, 12, 18 -tetramethylporphyrinyl) ]dibenzofuran) and H 2 (DPS) Zn(DPS = 4, 6 -bis[5 -(2, 8, 13, 17 -tetraethyl- 3, 7, 12, 18 -tetramethyl-porphyrinyl) ]dibenzothiophene)). This slower rate is interpreted {{by the presence of}} the H-atom exactly located between the two meso-carbons in the dyads. The rates for triplet-triplet transfer are also slow but not too different from that recently reported for H 2 (DPX) Pd (DPX = 4, 5 -bis[5 -(2, 8, 13, 17 -tetraethyl- 3, 7, 12, 18 -tetramethylporphyrinyl) ]- 9, 9 -dimethylxanthene) and H 2 (DPB) Pd (DPB = 1, 8 -bis[5 -(2, 8, 13, 17 -tetraethyl- 3, 7, 12, 18 -tetramethylporphyrinyl) ]biphenylene) at 77 K.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to compare the {{efficiency}} of triplet excitation transfer from chlorophylls to carotenoids in samples with their various mutual organizations. We have used samples with pigments in photosynthetic complexes in thylakoid membranes and samples with isolated pigments dissolved in a solution or concentrated in micelles. We have measured both time-resolved and steady-state absorption. Time-resolved transient absorption measurements showed that only the organization of pigments in photosynthetic complexes enabled <b>triplet-triplet</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> from chlorophylls to carotenoids, and thus prevented production of reactive singlet oxygen. In the solution and in the micelles, a collision mechanism governs this transfer. Even though the total concentration of pigments was comparable with the one in thylakoid membranes, the local concentration was too low to make this <b>triplet-triplet</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> efficient. We have also studied the degradation of the samples in time. Steady-state absorption spectra measured in different days showed that pigments in the solution and in micelles exposed to sunlight degraded quickly while pigments in thylakoid membranes decomposed slower and membranes tended to cluster.
