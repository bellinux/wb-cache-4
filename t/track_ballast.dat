5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that the replacement of sleepers was a larger {{part of the cost}} of track maintenance than the replacement of rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> without the need for sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|E
5|$|Railway traffic {{throughout}} the state was paralyzed, as some train bridges collapsed, and extensive damage {{was found in the}} <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> in multiple rail lines. Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. The damage to the railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. Ford also idled production in its Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, and suffered two-week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due to the rail track damage. The damage to the road system paralyzed a route used by 40% of the trade between the United States and Mexico, as 22,000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo LaredoMonterrey highway.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRailway {{facilities}} are usually defined as stationary engineering structures that constantly influence environment. Railway stations are main contaminators in railroad sector. Usually contaminated surface run-off coming from railroad tracks of railway stations {{is the result}} of atmospheric precipitation. Surface run-off flows through surface relief deep into the soils. Then it joins ground flows and enter the nearest surface waterbodies. The paper gives analysis of surface run-off filtration through multi-layer porous medium in ballast section of railroad tracks. The authors describe liquid behaviour and properties in multi-layer porous medium. The particular attention is paid to liquid which concentrates on the surface of railroad <b>tracks</b> <b>ballast</b> section as a result of atmospheric precipitation. The paper also considers stationary and non-stationary liquid weepage into railroad <b>tracks</b> <b>ballast</b> section and spilled petroleum products spreading...|$|R
25|$|A {{railroad}} tie/railway tie/crosstie (North America) or railway sleeper (Britain, Ireland, Australasia, and Africa) is {{a rectangular}} {{support for the}} rails in railroad tracks. Generally laid perpendicular to the rails, ties transfer loads to the <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> and subgrade, hold the rails upright and keep them spaced to the correct gauge.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 2009, a Metro {{employee}} {{was struck}} {{and killed by}} a ballast regulator, a track unit that deposits and spreads <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> onto the track bed. The incident occurred halfway between the Dunn Loring-Merrifield and Vienna/Fairfax–GMU stations on {{the western end of}} the Orange Line in Fairfax County.|$|E
25|$|In turn, <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> {{typically}} {{rests on}} a layer of small crushed stones: the sub-ballast. The sub-ballast layer gives a solid support for the top ballast, and reduces the seepage {{of water from the}} underlying ground. Sometimes an elastic mat is placed on the layer of sub-ballast and beneath the ballast, thereby significantly reducing vibration.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>track's</b> <b>ballasted</b> {{superstructure}} is a multilayered construction {{consisting of}} several constitutive layers. In the slab track for High-Speed Lines, or the embedded track for terminal port stations, a concrete slab replaced the ballast. For {{the estimation of}} the increase of the mean value of the static vertical wheel load, a probabilistic approach should generally be adopted in order to cover the statistically desirable safety level. Four calculation methods are cited. An investigation of the change of track stiffness coefficient, both static and dynamic, in <b>Ballasted</b> <b>Track,</b> Transition Zone and Ballastless Track was performed and it is presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Japan {{where large}} {{earthquakes}} frequently occur, {{it is important}} to increase the resistibility of railway structures to earthquakes. The authors performed a shaking table test using a full-scale model to evaluate the lateral resistance force of the <b>ballasted</b> <b>track</b> during earthquakes. In this study, the shaking table test was attempted under test conditions under which the sleeper is given the lateral force to induce track buckling. Two kinds of cross sections of <b>ballasted</b> <b>track</b> for the full-scale model were applied: a straight track and a curved track to evaluate the influence of the difference of the cross section of <b>ballasted</b> <b>track</b> on the lateral resistance force. The results of the shaking table test clarified that the lateral resistance force of the <b>ballasted</b> <b>track</b> decreased during shaking, and the lateral sleeper displacement increased significantly by lateral force smaller than the lateral resistance force of the <b>ballasted</b> <b>track</b> after shaking. In addition, it is considered that the influence of the cross section of <b>ballasted</b> <b>track</b> on the lateral ballast resistance force during shaking and after shaking is small...|$|R

25|$|A sleeper is a {{rectangular}} object {{on which the}} rails are supported and fixed. The sleeper has two main roles: to transfer the loads from the rails to the <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> and the ground underneath, and to hold the rails to the correct width apart (to maintain the rail gauge). They are generally laid transversely to the rails.|$|E
25|$|The {{ancient city}} of Harappa was heavily damaged under British rule, when bricks from the ruins {{were used as}} <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> in the {{construction}} of the Lahore-Multan Railway. In 2005, a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders unearthed many archaeological artifacts during the early stages of building work. A plea from the Pakistani archaeologist Ahmad Hasan Dani to the Ministry of Culture resulted in a restoration of the site.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, RTA {{undertook}} a complete {{renovation of the}} Green and Blue Lines, with new <b>track,</b> <b>ballast,</b> poles and overhead wiring. Existing stations were demolished and new stations constructed. The project necessitated closing the Green Line east of Shaker Square {{for most of the}} summer of 1980 and the Blue Line east of Shaker Square for most of the summer of 1981, with substitute bus shuttles and single-tracking along the remainder of the line from East 55th Street to Shaker Square. To run on the renovated lines, a fleet of new LRVs were purchased from an Italian firm, Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie, to replace the aging PCC cars. The new lines were dedicated on October 30, 1981.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLevel {{crossings}} or paved <b>ballasted</b> <b>tracks</b> laid in {{freight train}} container yards {{are subjected to}} train loads and forklift loads. Those asphalt pavements in the level crossings or paved <b>ballasted</b> <b>tracks</b> are designed using performance-based design method. Nevertheless, in the conventional design for <b>ballasted</b> <b>tracks</b> itself at the level crossing or paved <b>ballasted</b> <b>tracks</b> in the freight container yards in Japan, truck loads or forklift loads are generally not taken into account, and therefore, heavy duty truck loads or 12 ft-container-forklift loads had not induced a typical problem to level crossing structures or paved <b>ballasted</b> <b>tracks.</b> However, because of the recent increase in the transportation of the large marine containers on freight trains, very large forklifts have been increasingly introduced to freight container yard. Maximum wheel loads of those large forklifts reach up to 500 kN. Consequently, damages to level crossings and paved <b>ballasted</b> <b>tracks</b> in freight container yard are increasing. Concrete slab tracks {{are considered to be}} effective track structure to reduce the deformation of roadbeds or subgrades which are subjected to heavy forklift loads. However, to maintain the concrete slab tracks in the freight container yards in a decent condition, it is necessary to design the roadbeds and subgrades properly to avoid excessive deformation, because once the deformation are induced bebeath concrete slab tracks, {{it is not easy to}} correct track irregularity. To deal with above issues, deformation characteristics of subgrades, roadbeds and track structure under the heavy forklift loads were investigated using small scale model tests and full scale model tests in this study. In the scale model tests, moving wheel loads were applied to an asphalt paved <b>ballasted</b> <b>track</b> model and concrete slab model. In the full scale model tests, train loads and heavy forklift loads were applied on the asphalt paved <b>ballasted</b> <b>track</b> and concrete slab track. Through those tests, it was confirmed that the load applied by heavy forklift have predominant effect on the deformation characteristics of asphalt paved <b>ballasted</b> <b>track.</b> Besides, it was confirmed that the concrete slab track effectively reduces the vertical stress applied on the roadbed and subgrade...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the movement of railway traffic over at least one track throughout the construction period, the new approach bridge was first built in a position lying parallel with the old <b>track,</b> including <b>ballast,</b> <b>track</b> and catenary. Subsequently, the entire 17,000-ton structure was moved and inserted in place in July 2011 and a further 4.5 m section was inserted on 18 January 2012. Two tracks were again available for tracks on the section, including the bridge over the Rhine, from 2 April 2012.|$|R
25|$|The {{main site}} in Punjab {{was the city}} of Harrapa. The Indus Valley Civilization spanned {{much of what is}} today Pakistan and {{eventually}} evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation. The Vedic civilisation flourished {{along the length of the}} Indus River. This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan. Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for <b>track</b> <b>ballast,</b> an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found. Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas, Achaemenids, Macedonians, Mauryas, Kushans, Guptas and Hindu Shahi. It also comprised the Gujar empire for a period of time, otherwise known as the Gurjara-Pratihara empire. Agriculture flourished and trading cities (such as Multan and Lahore) grew in wealth.|$|E
25|$|Supply trains carried all the {{necessary}} material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it {{the rest of the}} ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> and levelled {{to get ready for the}} rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men on each side of the rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with spike mauls. The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.|$|E
500|$|Three factors {{dictated}} {{the type of}} locomotive that could run on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR): increased freight and passenger train loadings, poor track quality, and weak, lightly built bridges. An increasing number of passengers used the SECR to reach the cross-Channel ferries at Dover and Folkestone between 1910 and 1913, and heavy goods trains between Tonbridge and Hither Green marshalling yard stretched the capabilities of existing locomotives and infrastructure. On {{the lines of the}} former London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), flint beach pebbles on a bed of ash had been used for ballast. Conventional <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> has irregular shapes that [...] "lock" [...] together to keep the track in place, whereas the smooth pebbles used by the LCDR failed to prevent track movement under strain. The economies in construction meant that only locomotives with low axle loadings could run safely on the track. These restrictions meant that the SECR was unable to follow a coherent locomotive strategy that reduced costs and increased serviceability. The railway's Operating Department had to use mismatched classes of underpowered and obsolete 4-4-0 and 0-6-0 locomotives because they could run within the restrictions imposed by the infrastructure. This meant frequent double-heading that increased operational costs.|$|E
50|$|After {{the line}} was {{refurbished}} and the <b>track</b> and <b>ballast</b> strengthened, DRG Class 64 locomotives took over the passenger services and DRG Class 81s the goods traffic. Later diesel engines were also used as were Uerdingen railbuses for passenger duties.|$|R
50|$|After {{the line}} was {{refurbished}} and the <b>track</b> and <b>ballast</b> upgraded, Class 64 locomotives took over the running of passenger services and Class 81s handled the goods traffic. Later, diesel engines were also used for the latter and Uerdingen railbuses for the former.|$|R

2500|$|The {{appropriate}} {{thickness of}} {{a layer of}} <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> depends on the size and spacing of the ties, the amount of traffic on the line, and various other factors. <b>Track</b> <b>ballast</b> should never be laid down less than [...] thick; and high-speed railway lines may require ballast up to [...] thick. An insufficient depth of ballast causes overloading of the underlying soil, and in unfavourable conditions overloading the soil causes the track to sink, usually unevenly. Ballast less than [...] thick can lead to vibrations that damage nearby structures. However, increasing the depth beyond [...] adds no extra benefit in reducing vibration.|$|E
2500|$|From 1900 to 1982 the ferriers mounds {{were used}} on {{industrial}} scale, systematising the use (a trend already {{started in the}} 19th century) of slag to [...] "iron-load" [...] the roads and for rail <b>track</b> <b>ballast.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1980 and 1981, the Green and Blue Lines were {{completely}} renovated with new <b>track,</b> <b>ballast,</b> poles and wiring, and new stations were built along the line. [...] The renovated line along Shaker Boulevard opened on October 11, 1980.|$|E
50|$|<b>Track</b> {{circuits}} with <b>ballast</b> contamination will be {{shorter than}} those with good ballast, thus needing more cut tracks.|$|R
25|$|Slab track {{can also}} {{generate}} significantly more noise pollution and cause more vibration than traditional <b>ballasted</b> <b>track.</b> While {{this is partly}} attributable to slab track's decreased sound absorption qualities, a more significant factor is that slab track typically uses softer rail fasteners to provide vertical compliance similar to <b>ballasted</b> <b>track,</b> and these can lead to more noise, because they permit the rail to vibrate over a greater length.|$|R

2500|$|The {{freight train}} {{involved}} in the accident was [...] "tied down" [...] (parked) on an auxiliary track known as [...] "The Slide," [...] running parallel along {{the west side of}} the main tracks, waiting its turn to deliver <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> to repair tracks on the former Southern Pacific Railroad's Coast Line which had been washed out by major January 2005 rainstorms.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Track</b> <b>ballast</b> was put {{between the}} ties as they progressed. Where a proper railbed {{had already been}} prepared, the work progressed rapidly. Constantly needed {{supplies}} included [...] "food, water, ties, rails, spikes, fishplates, nuts and bolts, <b>track</b> <b>ballast,</b> telegraph poles, wire, fire wood (or coal on the UP) and water for the steam train locomotives, etc." [...] After a flatcar was unloaded, it would usually be hooked to a small locomotive and pulled back to a siding, so another flatcar with rails etc. could be advanced to the railhead. Since juggling railroad cars took time on flat ground, where wagon transport was easier, the rail cars would {{be brought to the}} end of the line by steam locomotive, unloaded, and the flat car returned immediately to a siding for another loaded car of either ballast or rails. Temporary sidings were often installed where it could be easily done to expedite getting needed supplies to the railhead.|$|E
2500|$|Cleaning, however, {{can only}} be done {{a certain number of}} times before the ballast is damaged {{to the point that it}} cannot be re-used; furthermore, <b>track</b> <b>ballast</b> that is {{completely}} fouled can not be corrected by shoulder cleaning. [...] In such cases, it is necessary to replace the ballast altogether. One method of [...] "replacing" [...] ballast, if necessity demands, is to simply dump fresh ballast on the track, jack the whole track on top of it, and then tamp it down; alternatively, the ballast underneath the track can be removed with an undercutter, which does not require removing or lifting the track.|$|E
50|$|The {{next step}} {{consists}} of stuffing a deep {{bed of ballast}} underneath the new <b>track.</b> The <b>ballast</b> arrives in a train of hopper cars pulled by diesel locomotives. Handling this train is challenging, since the ballast must be spread evenly. If the train stops, ballast can pile over the rails and derail it.|$|R
