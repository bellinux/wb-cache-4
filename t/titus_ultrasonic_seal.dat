40|$|New {{ultrasonic}} reading heads {{have been}} designed at SILab. The heads include a new motor drive with an encoder for precise feedback on the reading positions. The software and acquisition data system were developed as well. The heads are suitable both for dry and underwater applications. The head for dry reading includes a water reservoir to allow the coupling with the ultrasonic bolt. Also the weight and dimensions of the heads were reduced to ease transport and handling. One prototype was fabricated at SILab for each system. On request of DG-TREN, a new <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>sealing</b> system for dry applications is under development.

40|$|Following initial {{discussions in}} 2006 within the {{framework}} of the EURATOM – ABACC R&D Cooperation Agreement, in 2012 the European Union engaged into a cooperation project to strengthen Safeguards Capabilities at ABACC (the Brazilian-Argentinean Agency for Accountancy and Control). ABACC expressed interest in having access to two new Safeguards capabilities based on two JRC technologies approved for Safeguards use by both EURATOM and IAEA. This four-year cooperation project is funded by the European Commission Directorate General for Development and Cooperation – EuropeAid (DEVCO), under the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation (INSC). The new capabilities to be created at ABACC are: (i) Verification of complex plant design and lay-out ("as-is") and (ii) Containment of Spent Fuel in a complex Storage Environment. This is to be achieved by transferring to ABACC two JRC-owned technologies: (a) 3 D Laser Verification System and (b) <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>Seals.</b> The development of the two technologies to be transferred were funded by JRC's internal work-programme and targeted to Safeguards under the framework of the European Commission Support Programme to the IAEA (tasks EC-E- 1425 and EC-E- 1559). The transfer of technologies includes a set of comprehensive training actions and field support activities. Close coordination with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) takes place during the whole project’s lifetime. The European Commission Directorate General for Energy (EURATOM Safeguards) is also informed on the project progress and achievements. Given the technologies to be transferred have been approved and are used by the IAEA, it will be possible at the end of the project to have the Safeguards equipment being jointly used by ABACC and the IAEA. This paper details all aspects of this cooperation project. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R
40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2002, the U. S. Support Program (USSP) {{initiated}} an effort to define a strategy or ''roadmap'' for future seals technologies {{and to develop a}} generalized process for planning safeguards equipment development, which includes seals and other safeguards equipment. The underlying objectives of the USSP include becoming more proactive than reactive in addressing safeguards equipment needs, helping the IAEA to maintain an inventory of cost-effective, reliable, and effective safeguards equipment, establishing a long-term planning horizon, and securing IAEA ownership in the process of effective requirements definition and timely transitioning of new or improved systems for IAEA use. At an initial workshop, seals, their functions, performance issues, and future embodiments were discussed in the following order: adhesive seals, metal seals, passive and active loop <b>seals,</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>seals,</b> tamper indicating enclosures (including sample containers, equipment enclosures, and conduits). Suggested improvements to these technologies focused largely on a few themes: (1) The seals must be applied quickly, easily, and correctly; (2) Seals and their associated equipment should not unduly add bulk or weight to the inspectors load; (3) Rapid, in-situ verifiability of seals is desirable; and (4) Seal systems for high risk or high value applications should have two-way, remote communications. Based upon these observations and other insights, the participants constructed a skeletal approach for seals technology planning. The process begins with a top-level review of the fundamental safeguards requirements and extraction of required system features, which is followed by analysis of suitable technologies and identification of technology gaps, and finally by development of a planning schedule for system improvements and new technology integration. Development of a comprehensive procedure will require the partnership and participation of the IAEA. The presentation will include a description of the roadmapping approach developed for safeguards technologies and an overview of the initial seals workshop results...|$|R

In this study we compared two commercially available devices, Harmonic Ace+ (HAR, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati OH, USA) and SonoSurg (SS, Olympus America, Center Valley, PA, USA), in a canine preclinical model. There were three sections to the study: acute, survival, and ex vivo (burst pressure). Hemostasis of sealed pulmonary arteries and veins was assessed for the initial application and during a simulated hypertensive crisis, both immediately after vessel sealing and after a survival period of 30 days. Other intraoperative measures were also evaluated, including transection time, tissue sticking, tissue tags, and char on the seal. Histological evaluation was performed both after initial sealing and after the survival period. Burst pressure of sealed vessels was measured ex vivo. For both devices, hemostasis was excellent, including those measurements made under simulated hypertensive crisis. There were no differences {{in any of the}} intraoperative measures or thermal damage evaluated histologically. Wound healing was normal. The burst pressures for ex vivo vessels sealed by HAR (median 619. 2 mmHg) were significantly higher than those of SS (350. 3 mmHg, P = 0. 022). Both devices displayed acceptable characteristics in sealing canine pulmonary arteries and veins. The only difference observed was that HAR produced burst pressures 76. 8 % greater than SS, which may lead to a lower percentage of failures in the region of physiological interest. Use of ultrasonic devices in thoracic applications provides a high rate of initial hemostasis, supraphysiological burst pressures, and durable seals that heal normally.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new seal for dry storage containers with nuclear material. Currently, sealing of dry storage casks containing spent fuel presents various challenges to safeguards inspectors. Continuity of knowledge {{needs to be}} reliably maintained over periods of time that can be decades. Seal replacements and verification, require significant Inspector efforts, radiological dose, and is continuing to grow. A decrease in Inspector effort is required and fail-safe redundancy is sought. These needs called {{for the development of}} a new compact sealing bolt covering these requirements. The <b>Ultrasonic</b> Optical <b>Sealing</b> Bolt (UOSB) is based on the JRC Candu Sealing System (JCSS), which is approved for safeguards use by IAEA and EURATOM safeguards. The new seal includes the same integrity element with the same identity element In addition, the UOSB integrates the additional element of a Fibre Optical Cable (FOC). This construction is in principal two seals-in-one allowing versatility. After several design iterations, field trials and a positive Vulnerability Assessment, the UOSB design was finalized. The first UOSBs, combined with EOSS and Cobra seals, were installed on dry storage containers at the Ignalina nuclear power plant (Lithuania) in June 2014. IAEA gave a Category A label to the UOSB system later on October 2014. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R
40|$|At {{the ponds}} of La Hague, France, {{different}} types of material are stored awaiting reprocessing: • Irradiated LEU fuel assemblies; • Fresh MOX scrap of different origins; • Irradiated MOX assemblies from research reactors; • Irradiated L/HEU assemblies from research reactors. According to the safeguards approach developed by Euratom, irradiated LEU fuel is verified by Cerenkov viewing devices. Other fuel types are verified with a dedicated underwater neutron/gamma detector. The measurements are resource intensive for both inspectors and operator. In addition, one of the measurement locations will be decommissioned by 2015. Thus, <b>ultrasonic</b> bolt <b>seals</b> (USBS) were identified as a suitable means to keep continuity of knowledge and reduce inspection effort. The paper describes the currently required measurements and the related intense effort and compares with the effort required to place and read USBS. The discussion focuses on the activities required for un-irradiated MOX scrap, which is of particularly high safeguards interest, and {{a description of the}} measures implemented to minimise re-measurement needs is provided. The associated significant savings are demonstrated. Under the new approach, USBS are placed on all newly arriving baskets, following verification by NDA. Baskets already in the pond will be sealed with USBS step by step. In order to make this project possible, JRC Ispra supplied a new generation of USBS reading heads, electronics and software.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the effect of various weld and machine parameters on ultrasonic weld strength. Specifically, welds with six different triple-layer coextruded polyethylene and metallized polypropylene films were examined. These materials were welded in separate experimental studies using a bench top weld system and a high production volume packaging machine. The first study investigated the effect of a range of weld forces, energies, and amplitudes in a lap joint geometry using a bench top ultrasonic plunge welding system. Weld strength was determined by measuring resistance to tearing and peel and shear strength. It was observed that low energy and low weld force had a significant effect on shear strength welds for all materials. High peel strength was observed at relatively high weld forces and energies, and high tear resistance was observed at relatively high forces, high amplitudes, and mid-range energy levels. The second study determined the suitability for the same materials to be sealed as bags for packaging applications in a vertical 2 ̆ 2 form fill seal 2 ̆ 2 machine. This machine was equipped with an <b>ultrasonic</b> end <b>seal</b> jaw. The machine factors tested in this study include energy, amplitude, and production rate (the rate at which bags are created/welded) to determine the effect on peel strength. It was observed that low energy and amplitude correlated with high strength for the top weld (top of bag) of one material and low production rate resulted in high strength for the top weld of two materials as well as the bottom weld for two materials. Data for the sixth material was inconclusive...|$|R

40|$|THE ACUTE AND SUB-ACUTE EFFECTS OF ELECTROSURGICAL AND ULTRASONIC SURGICAL DEVICES ON THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES OF SCIATIC NERVE FUNCTION Since {{the dawn}} of medicine, blood loss during {{surgeries}} {{has been one of}} the major concerns for the surgeons. Iatrogenic blood loss can have several harmful effects on the patient condition. With the rapid development in technology, the blood loss can now be significantly minimized by using a variety of vessel sealing devices that use several energy sources to seal the blood vessels or tissue bundles instead of traditional sutures and clips. These devices can be used in several general, colorectal, gynecological and urological surgical procedures. The two types of vessel sealing techniques accepted worldwide are based on electrosurgical and ultrasonic technology. The electrosurgical technique uses electric energy while the ultrasonic technique uses <b>ultrasonic</b> energy to <b>seal</b> the blood vessels and simultaneously cut and coagulate tissues. In 2009, more than 17. 5 million electrosurgical procedures were performed in US alone. Also, ultrasonic devices have been used for over 10 million procedures worldwide. However, it is not clear to if these devices can cause nerve injury when applied near the nerve tissue. The safe distance to apply these devices from nerves has not been profoundly investigated. In the current study, a set of electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices were surgically tested in a rat model. These devices were applied on the muscle tissue at specific distances from the sciatic nerve. The consequent change in the nerve conduction function was neurophysiologically assessed and analyzed. Also, a developmental study was performed to determine a feasible surgical technique to use these devices to minimize nerve injury in the acute as well as sub-acute phase. The sensory nerve function was assessed by means of behavioral changes in the sub-acute phase. It was seen that electrosurgical devices produced a significant nerve dysfunction as compared to the ultrasonic devices. The ultrasonic devices appeared to be more safe, convenient and efficient during surgical applications close to the nerve tissue...|$|R
40|$|Richard W Timm, Ryan M Asher, Karalyn R Tellio, Alissa L Welling, Jeffrey W Clymer, Joseph F Amaral Ethicon Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA Introduction: Ultrasonic {{energy is}} a {{mainstay}} in the armamentarium of surgeons, providing multifunctionality, precision, and control when dissecting and sealing vessels up to 5 mm in diameter. Historically, {{the inability to}} seal vessels in the 5 – 7 mm range has been perceived as an inherent limitation of ultrasonic technology. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate sealing of vessels up to 7 mm in diameter with an ultrasonic device that modulates energy delivery during the sealing period. Methods: In ex vivo benchtop and in vivo acute and survival preclinical models, a new ultrasonic device, Harmonic ACE®+ 7 Shears (Harmonic 7), was compared with advanced bipolar devices in sealing vessels 1 – 7 mm in diameter with respect of burst pressure, seal reliability, and seal durability. Lateral thermal damage and transection time were also evaluated. Results: Ex vivo tests of Harmonic 7 demonstrated significantly greater median burst pressures than an advanced bipolar device both for vessels < 5 mm in diameter (1, 078 mmHg and 836 mmHg, respectively, P= 0. 046) and for those in the range of 5 – 7 mm (1, 419 mmHg and 591 mmHg, P< 0. 001). In vivo tests in porcine and caprine models demonstrated similar rates of hemostasis between Harmonic 7 and advanced bipolar devices, with high success rates at initial transection and seal durability of 100 % after a 30 -day survival period. Conclusion: Sealing 5 – 7 mm vessels is not a limitation of the type of energy used but of how energy is delivered to tissue. These studies document the ability of ultrasonic energy alone to reliably seal large vessels 5 – 7 mm in diameter, with significantly greater burst pressure observed in in vitro studies than those observed with an advanced bipolar technology when energy delivery is modulated during the sealing cycle. Furthermore, the seals created in 5 – 7 mm vessels are shown to be reliable and durable in in vivo preclinical studies.
