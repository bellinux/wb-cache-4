500|$|Lauren is {{the most}} famous {{basketball}} player in Australia, a position she reached by 2003. [...] Prior to this, Australia's most famous player was Michelle Timms, Australia's first player of either gender to play internationally. [...] She was recognised {{as one of the}} world's best basketball players {{by the time she was}} 21. [...] She has been described as Australia's answer to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal, and the best female basketball player in the world. [...] She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world: [...] "I don't really think about it. Nobody really talks to me like that. It's not something I'm conscious of. My family and people who have known me all my life, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> for who I am, and crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me. They know I have to train, but the rest of it is really laid-back." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} were diligent {{in ensuring}} the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: [...] "They were under very strict security rules {{when they were}} filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{literary}} critics grew increasingly scornful of Tate, his version still remained [...] "the {{starting point for}} performances on the English-speaking stage." [...] John Philip Kemble, in 1809, even dropped some of Garrick's earlier restorations of Shakespeare, and returned several passages to Tate. The play was suppressed for several {{years prior to the}} death of King George III in 1820, as its focus on a mad king suggested an unfortunate resemblance to the situation of the reigning monarch. But in 1823, Kemble's rival, Edmund Kean (who had previously acted Tate's Lear), [...] "stimulated by Hazlitt's remonstrances and Charles Lamb's essays," [...] became the first to restore the tragic ending, though much of Tate remained in the earlier acts. [...] "The London audience," [...] Kean told his wife, [...] "have no notion of what I can do till <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> over the dead body of Cordelia." [...] Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, though one critic described his dying scene as [...] "deeply affecting", and with regret, he reverted to Tate.|$|E
