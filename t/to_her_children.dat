5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>children.</b> Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism. They can also manifest as myopathy, diabetes, multiple endocrinopathy, and a variety of other systemic disorders. Diseases caused by mutation in the mtDNA include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS syndrome and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In the vast majority of cases, these diseases are transmitted by a female <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. Diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E
5|$|George's {{marriage}} to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, {{not on the}} grounds that either of them had committed adultery, but {{on the grounds that}} Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her husband. With the agreement of her father, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in Ahlden House in her native Celle, where she stayed until she died more than thirty years later. She was denied access <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard. She was, however, endowed with an income, establishment, and servants, and was allowed to ride in a carriage outside her castle, albeit under supervision. Melusine von der Schulenburg acted as George's hostess openly from 1698 until his death, and they had three daughters together, born in 1692, 1693 and 1701, respectively.|$|E

5|$|On 4 April 1718 England, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) {{selected}} Don Carlos of Spain, {{the elder}} child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir (with {{no mention of}} Anna Maria Luisa). By 1722, the Electress was not even acknowledged as heiress, and Cosimo {{was reduced to a}} spectator at the conferences for Tuscany's future. In the midst of this, Marguerite Louise, Anna Maria Luisa's mother, died. Instead of willing her valuables <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> as prescribed by the 1674 agreement, they went to the Princess of Epinoy, a distant relative.|$|E
5|$|Tony {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in EastEnders in April 2008, when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine-year {{absence from the}} show. It was established that although Tony was currently in prison, he and Bianca were in a relationship, and that he acted as a father-figure <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> Whitney Dean, Liam Butcher (James Forde) and Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith). It was originally stated that Tony was the biological father of Bianca's youngest son, mixed-race Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs), which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill, who is white, had been cast in the role. The show's producers explained that Tony was not really Morgan's father, and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor {{was raised}} in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her {{childhood}} she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed {{a major part of}} her early years—"the happiest part". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, The Wind in the Willows, and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> in the mornings because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her early thirties she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. When she wrote and published Shiloh, her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine died in June 1717. Anna Maria Luisa {{returned}} home in October 1717, bringing with her vast treasures. Cosimo created his elder son's widow, Violante of Bavaria, Governess of Siena as to clearly define her precedence. That {{did not stop}} the two ladies from quarrelling, as was his intention. Cosimo discontinued hunting following an accident in January 1717. He accidentally shot, and killed, a man. He was so distraught, that he wished to be tried by the Knights of the Order of Saint Stephen. The state of the Grand Duchy reflected the decay of its ruler; in a 1718 military review, the army numbered less than 3000 men, {{some of whom were}} infirm, and aged 70. The navy composed of three galleys, and the crew 198. In September 1721, the Grand Duchess died; instead of willing her possessions <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> as prescribed by the 1674 agreement; they went to the Princess of Epinoy.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, no stigma was {{attached}} to the devadasi or <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> and other members of their caste received them on terms of equality.
