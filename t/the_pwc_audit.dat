40|$|I am a senior, {{finishing}} {{up the last}} accounting class for my undergraduate degree in accounting. I recently completed an internship with <b>PwC</b> in <b>the</b> McLean, Virginia office. At PwC, I was an assurance intern primarily responsible for assisting my engagement teams by performing tests around financial statement line items such as 2 ̆ 7 cash. 2 ̆ 7 I learned {{quite a bit about}} <b>the</b> <b>PWC</b> process for <b>auditing</b> these items because I performed these same procedures on six different clients. My role as an intern was to perform uniform tasks that needed to be done on each engagement, and when I was done I would go to the next client to perform those same tasks. This was appropriate for an intern with very little practical experience in public accounting. Although the expectations on me were not incredibly difficult, I still experienced a learning curve due to this being my first exposure to this kind of work. By the end of my internship, however, I felt comfortable in completing my assigned tasks and even received reviews from team leaders expressing that they would love to have me on their teams in future engagements...|$|R

30|$|The {{first one}} {{consists}} of a plasmonic metal-insulator-metal waveguide coupler (PWC) and a hyperbolic (or highly eccentric elliptic) metamaterial slab [118]. A plane wave can be focused to a point as it passes through a PWC and a metamaterial slab in order. When the incident plane wave excites <b>the</b> <b>PWC,</b> <b>the</b> waves with different transverse wavevectors and different phase transmit the metamaterial slab. By varying geometric parameters (width and height of <b>the</b> <b>PWC),</b> PWC can be designed so that the sum of phase gain from the metamaterial slab and from <b>the</b> <b>PWC</b> is a constant for every path. Under such a condition, plane waves interfere constructively at a point without loss of high spatial frequency waves thanks to unusual dispersion. Using this phase compensation mechanism, plane wave focusing and magnification are possible. Inversely, radiated beams from a point source are converted into a plane wave as they go through a metamaterial slab and a <b>PWC.</b> Without <b>the</b> <b>PWC,</b> a total internal reflection occurs when the waves with high wavevectors pass the exit surface of the lens, inhibiting the transmission of evanescent waves. But here, <b>the</b> <b>PWC</b> takes a role of bidirectional wavevector coupling and phase matching. The validity of the PWC-based metalens was demonstrated numerically [118].|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} vertical product differentiation within the Big 4 audit {{firms in the}} Australian audit market and potential pricing effects resulting from this differentiation. Assuming a competitive Big 4 audit market, systematically higher prices pertaining to one particular Big 4 audit firm is indicative of utilisation of a product differentiation strategy. A firm-wide premium implies existence of vertical product differentiation or quality differentiation. I single out PricewaterhouseCoopers (<b>PwC)</b> as <b>the</b> firm which {{is most likely to}} be using vertical product differentiation as its predecessor firm Price Waterhouse is historically considered to be the most prestigious of the Big N firms. In particular, I investigate if there is evidence of a PwC premium relative to the other Big 4 audit firms. Using a sample 5, 686 observations over the period 2000 to 2009, I find evidence of a <b>PwC</b> <b>audit</b> fee premium in Australia on average and in specific years. Over this period, after controlling for client attributes, Ernst and Young (EY), KPMG and Deloitte (DT) have 9. 7 %, 10. 8 % and 12 % lower <b>audit</b> fees than <b>PwC,</b> respectively. I also explore the alternative explanations of location, office size, and auditor industry specialisation in assessing the robustness of these findings. Using size and industry matched samples and propensity score matched samples, I further find that <b>the</b> <b>PwC</b> premium identified is a result of PwC being differentiated as a firm rather than having differentiated clients. My findings are of interest to audit researchers, regulators, auditors and auditees because pricing differentiation by PwC poses implications for future audit research, audit regulation and auditor selection. The identification of a PwC premium highlights a new dimension of product differentiation (vertical or quality differentiation) within the Big 4 audit market...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses the origin, purposes, nature, {{operation and}} {{achievements of the}} Commonwealth's Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works (Public Works Committee - PWC), and assesses its utility to parliament. <b>The</b> <b>PWC</b> originated in 1913 as a permanent committee of parliamentarians established to examine government proposals for public works, and report on them to parliament. Its purpose is to provide detailed data on works proposals {{in order to allow}} informed voting. In the process parliament also achieves a degree of control over government - ministers and public servants. Unlike most parliamentary audit of government expenditure, <b>the</b> <b>PWC</b> scrutinises proposals before works are built. It is a joint, statutory, scrutiny committee. The proper role for parliamentary committees in general is the checking of government, through influence, criticism, scrutiny, and publicity. <b>The</b> <b>PWC</b> is assessed against this role through an analysis of its legislation and operation, and interviews with involved parliamentarians and bureaucrats. Criteria used include adequacy of evidence obtained, precision and clarity of reports, and degree of influence on government and acceptance of recommendations. In these terms <b>the</b> <b>PWC</b> has little effect in controlling policy making by the executive government - cabinet and ministers. Moreover, specific amendment of its act together with the consequential effects of nominally unrelated legislation, have reduced the scope of Committee activities to an estimated less than half of all Commonwealth public works. This trend is continuing under current policies of corporatising departmental activities and excluding the resulting statutory corporations from PWC examination. These moves prevent parliament playing its proper role in the governance of the country. However, within the ambit of its powers, <b>the</b> <b>PWC</b> generally rates highly against the above criteria, and exerts a significant degree of parliamentary control over government administration - the public service - in the implementation of public works...|$|R
