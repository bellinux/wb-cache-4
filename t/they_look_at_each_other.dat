500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{arriving}} at a polo mansion. She comes out from the car wearing a vest, jeans and showing her midriff. She starts singing while her boyfriend welcomes her. They walk past a barn, where a polo player is sitting. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> briefly and she starts to sing in a balcony, watching the second man {{with a pair of}} binoculars. At {{the end of the first}} chorus, her boyfriend comes and puts a studded necklace around her neck, as a surprise gift. Until the end of the second chorus, we see scenes of Spears singing and watching the polo player as he gets ready. When the bridge begins, Spears arrives at a match wearing a white dress and a large hat. She looks at the polo player over her shoulder and sings the lines [...] "I got my eye on you / And I can’t let you get away". When the match ends, she leaves and the second man follows her. They flirt inside a hallway and leave. Her boyfriend notices her absence, walks into the hallway and sees her necklace on the floor. The video ends with Spears and the second man walking into the sunset.|$|E
60|$|Another pause. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again, {{still more}} seriously than before.|$|E
60|$|Silently, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other. <b>At</b> last Conger {{lowered the}} gun.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other. Hobart {{slipped his}} pike behind his back.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Flintwinch dreamed, that, for {{the space}} of a minute or two, <b>they</b> {{remained}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other with the candle between them, and that she somehow derived an impression that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other fixedly.|$|R
60|$|She {{does not}} speak at first, nor even when she has slowly dropped into the easy-chair by the table. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> like two pictures.|$|E
6000|$|... "Real {{conversation}} presupposes intimate acquaintance. People {{must see}} each other often enough to wear off the rough bark and outside rind of commonplaces and conventionalities in which their real ideas are enwrapped, and give forth without reserve their innermost and best feelings. Now {{what is called a}} large party is the first and rudest form of social intercourse. The most we can say of it is, that it is better than nothing. Men and women are crowded together like cattle in a pen. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> they jostle each other, exchange a few common bleatings, and eat together; and so the performance terminates. One may be crushed evening after evening against men or women, and learn very little about them. You may decide that a lady is good-tempered, when any amount of trampling on the skirt of her new silk dress brings no cloud to her brow. But is it good temper, or only wanton carelessness, which cares nothing for waste? You can see that a man is not a gentleman who squares his back to ladies at the supper-table, and devours boned turkey and paté de foie gras, while they vainly reach over and around him for something, and that another is a gentleman so far as to prefer the care of his weaker neighbors to the immediate indulgence of his own appetites; but further than this you learn little. Sometimes, it is true, in some secluded corner, two people of fine nervous system, undisturbed by the general confusion, may have a sociable half-hour, and really part feeling that they like each other better, and know more of each other than before. Yet these general gatherings have, after all, their value. They are not so good as something better would be, but they cannot be wholly dispensed with. It is far better that Mrs. Bogus should give an annual party, when she takes down all her bedsteads and throws open her whole house, than that she should never see her friends and neighbors inside her doors at all. She may feel that she has neither the taste nor the talent for constant small reunions. Such things, she may feel, require a social tact which she has not. She would be utterly at a loss how to conduct them. Each one would cost her as much anxiety and thought as her annual gathering, and prove a failure after all; whereas the annual demonstration can be put wholly {{into the hands of the}} caterer, who comes in force, with flowers, silver, china, servants, and, taking the house into his own hands, gives her entertainment for her, leaving to her no responsibility but the payment of the bills; and if Mr. Bogus does not quarrel with them, we know no reason why any one else should; and I think Mrs. Bogus merits well of the republic, for doing what she can do towards the hospitalities of the season. I'm sure I never cursed her in my heart, even when her strong coffee has held mine eyes open till morning, and her superlative lobster salads have given me the very darkest views of human life that ever dyspepsia and east wind could engender. Mrs. Bogus is the Eve who offers the apple; but after all, I am the foolish Adam who take and eat what I know is going to hurt me, and I am too gallant to visit my sins on the head of my too obliging tempter. In country places in particular, where little is going on and life is apt to stagnate, a good, large, generous party, which brings the whole neighborhood into one house to have a jolly time, to eat, drink, and be merry, is really quite a work of love and mercy. People see one another in their best clothes, and that is something; the elders exchange all manner of simple pleasantries and civilities, and talk over their domestic affairs, while the young people flirt, in that wholesome manner which is one of the safest of youthful follies. A country party, in fact, may be set down as a work of benevolence, and the money expended thereon fairly charged to the account of the great cause of peace and good will on earth." ...|$|E

50|$|In a post-credit scene, {{we see a}} hungover and half-naked Shelby waking up. Then, a hungover and half-naked Quentin {{wakes up}} (implying that they had sex). <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and scream in disgust as they fall out of bed.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the second}} ending however, Lena finds Tom dying from his wound and bites him, turning {{him into a}} vampire. After {{delivering}} the bite, Lena flies backwards, crashing into the wall much like Louise did when she bit her. Lena whispers [...] "Forgive me," [...] as Tom rises on his feet.

50|$|Huka-huka {{starts with}} the athletes on their knees. It begins when {{the owner of the}} fight, a male chief, walks {{to the center of the}} arena and calls his opponents by name.

50|$|Once {{out in the}} open, {{the creatures}} keep {{pursuing}} Melissa, and are nearly {{on top of her}} when the moon begins to set, turning the demons into silvery dust. As the sun rises Melissa stands in the light looking at the surrounding forest, and {{in the shade of a}} tree she sees Yul, fully transformed into one of the creature, staring at her sadly. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> silently until he disappears, too.|$|E

Rose is just relieved that the myth was not real {{and the two of}} them agree to stay friends with benefits. They start to kiss but Rose feels pain on her shoulder, where the werewolf bit her. They check on her shoulder and they see that the area is not exactly healed and <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with fear and confusion in their eyes.|$|E
50|$|The {{painting}} shows Adam {{standing near}} Eve: <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with measured postures, as she prepares to bite on the apple, just offered {{to her by}} the serpent near her arm around the tree. The snake has a head with thick blond hair, much idealised. The scene is aulic in its presentation, with gestures and style conveying tones of late International Gothic. Light, which models the figures without sharp angles, is soft and embracing; the dark background makes the body stand out in their sensual plasticity, almost suspended in space.|$|E
60|$|There was {{the sound}} of {{footsteps}} on the front porch. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, horrified.|$|R

McIntosh serves drinks as she sings but trips over. No one helps her up and everyone laughs except the man. She runs off to the bathroom and is almost in tears. She sings into the mirror and take off her white shirt revealing a green blondie T-shirt. The man walks in on her and <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
50|$|Birds {{and fish}} are moving around {{different}} halves of a sphere, {{separated by a}} sheet of ice. One bird and one fish (Stanley and Stella) notice each other and approach their sides of the ice sheet. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> through the ice and twirl {{to acknowledge that the}} feeling of love is mutual. Stella looks up and points, Stanley appears to be confused. Stella then taps her side of the ice sheet with her tail. Stanley gazes upward and then nods to her, understanding what he can do. As Stella watches, Stanley flies further and further up until he is high enough and then dives towards the ice sheet, breaking it.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by how Jurassic Park {{featured}} the Ford Explorer, Mercedes-Benz signed an endorsement deal to introduce {{in the film}} its first sports utility vehicle, the M320. Spielberg did not allow for rehearsals among the cast, stating, [...] "You want to capture the actors when they taste the words for the first time, when <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for the first time-thats the sort of magic you can only get on a first or second take." [...] Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, {{who had worked with}} Spielberg in Schindlers List, was brought onto the project to give a darker, more artistic look to the film, leading to a [...] "more elegant and rich" [...] approach focused on contrast and shadow.|$|E
