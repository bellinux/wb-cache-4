5|$|As {{the match}} went to penalties, Rio Ferdinand won the coin toss for Manchester United, and opted for his side <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>first</b> in the shoot-out, {{which would be}} taken at the end housing the Manchester United fans. Tevez stepped up first and sent Čech the wrong way. Ballack was next up, {{shooting}} powerfully past Van der Sar. Carrick buried his spot-kick, as did Juliano Belletti with his first touch of the game, having come on for Makélélé {{at the end of}} extra time. The first miss of the shoot-out came from Ronaldo, who characteristically stuttered in his run-up in an attempt to put Čech off, but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII's {{underestimation}} of Bonaparte proved disastrous. On 19 March, {{the army}} stationed outside Paris defected to Bonaparte, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. That same day, Louis XVIII quit the capital {{with a small}} escort at midnight. Louis decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>first</b> to Lille, and then crossed the border into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, staying in Ghent. Other leaders, most prominently Alexander I of Russia, debated whether {{in the case of}} a second victory over the French Empire, the Duke of Orléans should be proclaimed king instead of Louis XVIII.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, {{after his}} {{attacked}} failed to overtake any major positions, Zur decided to withdraw, {{for the first}} time in his life. He ordered Harpaz's company, which had the most casualties, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> and at 06:00 told Dromi's company to follow. Harpaz's company had five men missing in action, four of whom were picked up by Dromi's people. One of Dromi's platoons remained on top of a sand dune to provide cover fire for the retreat. Meanwhile, the rest of the company made its way under the road and the railway through culverts. On the eastern side, Dromi met Harpaz. They sent the cover platoon home with the injured, and remained in their place to wait for Zur. Their lookout also spotted Kotzer's retreating company and Harpaz requested artillery cover using the only working communication device they had. The Napoleonchiks missed their targets, but deterred the Egyptians, who stopped following Kotzer.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by {{letters of the alphabet}} was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>first</b> and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then be joined by the remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.|$|E
5|$|Notably, KOF 94 innovated {{the genre}} by {{replacing}} a traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting {{games with a}} format consisting of 3-on-3 team based matches dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each consisting of three members. Before each match, the players choose {{the order in which}} each of their team member enters the battle. When the match begins, the members chosen <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>first</b> on their respective teams will fight. When one character is defeated, the following member of the same team will take his or her place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character is losing a match against the opponent, then the player can call one of the remaining teammates standing on the sidelines to jump in and perform a support attack. The match ends when all three members of either team lose.|$|E

The Avengers mainly attacked from the port side so that if the torpedoes hit that side, it would {{increase the likelihood of}} the target ship capsizing.|$|E
500|$|On November 23, Judge Rothman {{accepted}} Feldman's {{motion and}} set March 21, 1994, as the start {{date for the}} civil trial. Rothman ordered Jackson's deposition scheduled {{before the end of}} January 1994, but noted he might reconsider if Jackson was indicted on criminal charges. Jackson agreed to be deposed on January 18. [...] His attorneys said he was eager to testify, but also said they might oppose the deposition if criminal charges were filed or were still under consideration on his deposition date. [...] They said if charges were filed, they would want the criminal trial <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>first.</b> However, when authorities notified Jackson's lawyers that they expected their investigation to continue at least through February, Jackson's team still failed to win a delay of the civil case. Jackson's lawyers also lost a motion to prevent Feldman from turning over information (e.g. from the civil deposition) to prosecutors pursuing possible criminal charges.|$|E
500|$|... "The End" [...] {{features}} Starr's only drum solo in the Beatles' catalogue (the drums {{are mixed}} across two tracks in [...] "true stereo", unlike most releases {{at that time}} where they were hard panned left or right). Fifty-four seconds into the song are 18 bars of lead guitar: the first two bars are played by McCartney, the second two by Harrison, and the third two by Lennon, with the sequence repeating. Harrison suggested {{the idea of a}} guitar solo in the track, Lennon decided they should trade solos and McCartney elected <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>first.</b> The solos were cut live against the existing backing track in one take. Immediately after Lennon's third and final solo, the piano chords of the final part of the song begin. The song ends with the memorable final line, [...] "And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make". This section was taped separately to the first, and required the piano to be re-recorded by McCartney, which was done on 18 August. An alternative version of the song, with Harrison's lead guitar solo played against McCartney's (with Starr's drum solo heard in the background), appears on the Anthology 3 album and the 2012 digital-only compilation album Tomorrow Never Knows.|$|E

500|$|Recorded in Monument's Nashville {{studios in}} early 1963, [...] "In Dreams" [...] peaked at number 7 on Billboard Hot 100 and spent 13 {{weeks on the}} charts in the U.S. During the five months the song was on the charts, Orbison {{replaced}} guitarist Duane Eddy {{on a tour of}} England. He was immensely popular in England, and shared billing with the Beatles, of whom he had never heard. English and Scottish promoters were wary of Orbison as a draw; he was not conventionally attractive or animated while performing, and they wondered if audiences would walk out. The tour sold out in one afternoon, however. Orbison's first meeting with John Lennon was awkward because Orbison was overwhelmed with the amount of advertising devoted to the Beatles when it was he who was supposed to headline the show. Beatlemania, however, was taking hold and Orbison accepted that he was not quite the main draw, so he decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>first</b> on stage. On opening night, the audience reacted intensely toward Orbison's ballads, as he finished with [...] "In Dreams". Philip Norman, a Beatles biographer, later wrote [...] "As Orbison performed, chinless and tragic, the Beatles stood in the wings, wondering how they would dare to follow him". After demanding Orbison play for double the time he was scheduled, the audience then screamed for a fifteenth encore, which Lennon and Paul McCartney refused to allow by holding Orbison back from re-entering the stage.|$|E
