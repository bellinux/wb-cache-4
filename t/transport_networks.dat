30|$|In [11 – 13], {{the authors}} {{addressed}} HSDPA flow control. It {{is a common}} assumption in these papers that Iub <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> capacity is not limiting. These flow controls are optimized only for efficient use of the air interface. In [14], the authors introduced a <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> overload control algorithm for Best-Effort DCH traffic. They showed that already {{in the case of}} DCHs, this improves <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization. In [15], the authors introduced cross-layer backpressure in the RNC, which allows good <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization, when the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck buffer is in the RNC. In [4], an HSDPA flow control algorithm which solves not only the efficient usage of air interface but also the congestion situation on <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> is proposed. The proposed algorithm {{can be used in a}} more general <b>transport</b> <b>network,</b> because it does not require the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck buffer to be in the RNC. In [16], the authors proposed an extension of a related HSDPA flow control algorithm which provides fairness-optimal initial rates for HSDPA flows sharing the same <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{objectivity}} of urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> evaluation and achieve the sub-file of quality level of preliminary scheme, a comprehensive evaluation method for urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> was proposed based on TOPSIS, and then constructed the evaluation model of urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network.</b> This method was applied to Xi’an urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> planning, which obeyed the basic theory of scheme evaluation and some related requirements. The result showed that planning- 5 was the best one among the five urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> planning in Xi’an and consistent with the passenger flow prediction. The evaluation model for urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> based on TOPSIS was objective, which involved few parameters, simple operation, scientific evaluation and provided a basis for urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> planning decision...|$|R
30|$|With {{more and}} more {{increased}} air interface throughput, the efficient utilization of the often limiting <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> became more important. To meet this demand a per-flow HSUPA <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> flow control algorithm has been proposed. The need for <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion control was shown and <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion detection and avoidance techniques were described. The introduced algorithm can support quality of service differentiation among HSUPA flows as well as different <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottlenecks for the flows of the same Node B. It was shown by simulations that the proposed algorithm can maintain high <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization and good fairness among the flows while also keeping the delay and loss in the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> low. The solution {{has been compared to}} a scenario where we rely only on TCP congestion control and {{it has been shown that}} the lack of HSUPA flow control causes serious performance degradation in the system when the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> capacity is limiting the throughput.|$|R
5|$|Although {{opened in}} 1800 {{at the cost}} of £100,000, the new harbour at Grimsby failed to attract the levels of trade the company had projected, caused largely by a lack of inland <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> The {{financial}} problems facing the Grimsby Haven Company led to factions and difficulty in its running and put strain on Boucherett's relations with Yarborough; having invested much money and time in the now failing company, Boucherett also found it draining of him financially.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preparation}} for D-Day {{in the spring}} of 1944, the Allies launched the Transport Plan, carrying out intensive bombing of railway junctions and <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> across northern France and Belgium. Many of these targets were in towns near densely populated civilian areas, such as La Louvière and Kortrijk in Belgium, which were bombed in March 1944. The phase of bombing in the lead up to D-Day alone resulted in 1,500 civilian casualties. Bombing of targets in Belgium steadily increased as the Allies advanced westward across France. Allied bombing during the liberation in September 1944 killed 9,750 Belgians and injured 40,000.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, {{the local}} governments in Copenhagen and {{neighbouring}} Malmö in Sweden {{announced that they}} were seeking European Union funding to study a potential metro line under the Øresund to the neighbourhood of Malmö Central Station, providing faster trips and additional capacity beyond that of the existing Øresund Bridge. The study, for which the EU granted funding in the following December, will consider both a simple shuttle between the two stations and a continuous line integrated with the local <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> on each side, and they anticipate a travel time of 15 minutes between the two city centers.|$|E
3000|$|The fourth paper, [...] "HSUPA <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> {{congestion}} control," [...] {{shows that}} {{with the arrival of}} advanced high-speed packet access networks, there is an increasing demand on the performance of the underlying <b>transport</b> <b>network.</b> In the <b>transport</b> <b>network,</b> the transmission control protocol (TCP) cannot efficiently resolve congestion because of the lower layer retransmissions. The authors propose a <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion detection and avoidance technique that supports quality of service differentiation and among HSPA flows and maintains high <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization while keeping the loss and delay low.|$|R

5|$|The {{concept of}} a mass rapid transit for New Delhi first emerged from a traffic and travel {{characteristics}} study which {{was carried out in}} the city in 1969. Over the next several years, many official committees by a variety of government departments were commissioned to examine issues related to technology, route alignment, and governmental jurisdiction. In 1984,the Urban Arts Commission came up with a proposal for developing a multi-modal transport system, which would consist of constructing three underground mass rapid transit corridors as well augmenting the city's existing suburban railway and road <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cubzac {{is located}} about 20km {{northeast}} of Bordeaux, {{on the north}} riverbank of the Dordogne. Several <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> converge in Cubzac to cross the river. These include the A10 motorway, the N10 trunk road and the Bordeaux-Nantes railroad. The LGV Sud-Ouest, a high-speed railway line running between Tours and Bordeaux, {{is in the process}} of being build. Cubzac has an elevation ranging from 1m to 42m, the highest points being limestone cliffs dating from the Oligocene epoch, some of which have been used as source of stone. In oenological terms, Cubzac is near the appellations d'origine contrôlée (AOC) côtes de Bourg and Fronsac, with its own wine castles.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts flooded {{villages and}} disrupted <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> It was estimated by 18 November {{that at least}} 500km of roads had been damaged by flooding, with the Chennai-Kolkata highway damaged the previous day and stranding hundreds of vehicles and motorists; officials {{said it would take}} days to restore the link. As in Tamil Nadu, the Southern Railway diverted or cancelled numerous trains. Over 10,000 lorry drivers were stranded on the Tada-Kavali national highway in Nellore district; district officers established 61 relief camps in the flood-affected areas and deputed senior IAS officers to oversee the relief operations in Gudur, Naidupet and Atmakur divisions, respectively. Up to 500 tanks were breached as rivers overflowed, forcing the administration to suspend rescue operations in marooned villages, though administrators supplied 10,000 food and water packets through the rail network, which managed to operate some trains, while the APSRTC continued to run bus services to less-flooded areas such as Atmakuru, Udayagiri, Marripadu and Seetharampuram.|$|E

[...] The Interplanetary <b>Transport</b> <b>Network</b> is different in nature than Hohmann transfers because Hohmann transfers assume only one large body whereas the Interplanetary <b>Transport</b> <b>Network</b> does not. The Interplanetary <b>Transport</b> <b>Network</b> is able to achieve the use of less propulsive delta-v by employing gravity assist from the planets.|$|R
30|$|The {{introduction}} of High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) greatly improves achievable uplink bitrate but it presents new challenges {{to be solved}} in the WCDMA radio access <b>network.</b> In the <b>transport</b> <b>network,</b> bandwidth reservation for HSUPA is not efficient and TCP cannot efficiently resolve congestion because of lower layer retransmissions. This paper proposes an HSUPA <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> flow control algorithm that handles congestion situations efficiently and supports Quality of Service differentiation. In the Radio <b>Network</b> Controller (RNC), <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion is detected. Relying on the standardized control frame, the RNC notifies the Node B about <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion. In case of <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion, the Node B part of the HSUPA flow control instructs the air interface scheduler to reduce the bitrate of the flow to eliminate congestion. The performance analysis concentrates on <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> limited scenarios. It is shown that TCP cannot provide efficient congestion control. The proposed algorithm can achieve high end-user perceived throughput, while maintaining low delay, loss, and good fairness in the <b>transport</b> <b>network.</b>|$|R

30|$|Likewise to HSDPA [4], the Iub and Iur <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> links {{could be}} a {{bottleneck}} in the radio access network for HSUPA, since the increased air interface (Uu) capacity does not always come with similarly increased <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> capacity in practice. (Iub is between Node B and RNC, Iur is between Drift RNC and Serving RNC (SRNC).)The cost of transport links is still high in some cases and not expected to decrease dramatically [5]. The <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> links {{are expected to be}} bottleneck, for example, in case of E 1, T 1 transmissions and ADSL UL transmission but it is unlikely to have UL <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck, for example, in case of E 3 transmission or 100 [*]Mbps Ethernet access. (The bitrate available for ATM cells is 1920 [*]kbps in case of E 1, 1536 [*]kbps in case of T 1 and 33920 [*]kbps in case of E 3.) In most networks, it is expected that in a significant percentage of the cases, the throughput is limited by the Iub/Iur <b>transport</b> <b>network,</b> especially in the initial deployment phase. As HSPA traffic is increasing in the network, most of the operators will expand their <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> to further enhance user experience.|$|R
