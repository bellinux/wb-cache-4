25|$|His next film, The Thing (1982), {{is notable}} for its high {{production}} values, including innovative special effects by Rob Bottin, special visual effects by matte artist Albert Whitlock, a score by Ennio Morricone and a cast including young actor Kurt Russell and respected character actors such as Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Keith David, and Richard Masur. <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>was</b> distributed by Universal Pictures.|$|E
25|$|With few exceptions, korbanot {{could only}} {{be used as a}} means of atoning for the first type of sin, that is sins {{committed}} in ignorance that <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a sin. In addition, korbanot have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation. The Book of Ezekiel states that the Messiah to come will still bring sin offerings for unintentional sins in the Third Jerusalem Temple, implying it could be korbanot or prayers.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>was</b> {{the fourth}} film shot by cinematographer Dean Cundey (following Carpenter's Halloween, The Fog, and Escape from New York) {{and the third}} to feature Kurt Russell as the lead actor. Russell would appear in two {{additional}} Carpenter films following The Thing: Big Trouble in Little China and Escape from L.A. Most of the special creature effects were designed and created by Rob Bottin and his crew, {{with the exception of}} the dog creature, which was created by Stan Winston. Winston was brought in when Bottin's team found themselves overloaded with work on the other creatures seen in the film.|$|E

25|$|When I {{first started}} doing the stain paintings, I left {{large areas of}} canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of the}} medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. <b>The</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E

25|$|Carpenter had {{intended}} Richard Dreyfuss as Andy McGee, but when <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>was</b> a financial disappointment, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L. Lester. Ironically, Carpenter's next film, Christine, was the 1983 {{adaptation of the}} Stephen King novel of the same name. The story concerns a high-school nerd named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who buys a junked 1958 Plymouth Fury {{which turns out to}} have supernatural powers. As Cunningham restores and rebuilds the car, he becomes unnaturally obsessed with it, with deadly consequences. Christine did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics; however, Carpenter has been quoted as saying he directed the film {{because it was the only}} thing offered to him at the time.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} as a survival horror third-person shooter for PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, {{acting as a}} sequel to the film. The video game differs from the comics in that Childs is dead of exposure, and the audiotapes are present (they were removed from Outpost 31 {{at the start of}} The Thing from Another World: Questionable Research). At the completion of the game, R.J. MacReady is found alive and helping the main character complete the last mission. The game used elements of paranoia and mistrust intrinsic to the film. Some retailers, such as GameStop, offered a free copy of the 1998 DVD release as an incentive for reserving the game. In 2011, a region of the Entropia Universe was created based on the theme of The Thing.|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{spent six}} months writing the music for [...] "Once More, with Feeling". When he {{returned}} {{after the end of}} the fifth season, he presented Davies with a script and CD, complete with notated and orchestrated music, which Davies found [...] "mind-boggling". The actors were initially bewildered; in 2012, James Marsters commented that [...] "it's obvious now that they were good songs but <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> Joss and his wife Kai, they don't sing very well. And they don't play piano very well. The songs sounded really cheesy and horrible... We were saying, 'Joss, you're ruining our careers.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{similarity}} to Carpenter's version of <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>was</b> {{due in part}} to new production designer Graeme Murray, who worked on Carpenter's film and created the complex in which the episode took place. Although [...] "Ice" [...] was intended as a bottle episode which would save money by being shot in a single location, it went over budget. According to Carter, The X-Files typically worked from a small budget and [...] "every dollar we spend ends up on the screen". As a bottle episode, [...] "Ice" [...] used a small cast and its interiors were filmed on a set constructed at an old Molson brewery site. The episode's few exterior shots were filmed at Delta Air Park in Vancouver, whose hangars and flat terrain simulated an Arctic location. Carter said that he would have preferred to set the episode at the North Pole, but he believed that this was unfeasible at the time.|$|E

500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing {{he said to me}} was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{general rule}} was that anyone with an {{interest}} in the safety of the thing stolen may sue. It could be that the owner did not have a sufficient interest to bring an action. If one person had a positive right in a thing, such as a pledgee, usufructory, or good faith possessor, both he and the owner could sue. The unsecured creditor could not. Those obliged by contract to return the thing, and other forms of [...] "negative interest", had an action available at the expense of owner. This was only true so long as the person obliged was solvent [...] that is, under a real risk of losing out by a theft. If the person obliged was insolvent, the owner would have an action instead. The plaintiff with a negative interest was precluded from an action if it was by his own fault (dolus), or other dishonest. The lower standard of care required of a depositee meant he could not be sued by a depositor, and so had no action available for furtum. A vendor, who had agreed a price but not delivered his thing, retained legal ownership of the thing. Thus if <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> stolen, the vendor had the action on the theft because he was liable to the purchaser.|$|E
500|$|The British Commonwealth Secretary George Thomson {{expressed}} outrage, accusing Beadle and {{the other}} judges of breaching [...] "the fundamental laws of the land", while Gibbs stated that since his position as Governor existed under the 1961 constitution he could only reject the ruling. An internal UK Foreign Office memorandum rejected Beadle's argument but recognised his belief that [...] "because {{of the effect of}} the effluxion of time, he was entitled to take a different view", and concluded that the Chief Justice's argument was [...] "sufficiently plausible to make it difficult to say that that position is manifestly improper or that, in adopting it, Sir Hugh Beadle is manifestly guilty of misconduct." [...] Beadle explained in a 1972 interview: [...] "We had been doing our best to try and uphold the law and when <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> in the revolutionary stage we dug our toes in, we wouldn't budge. But then as the government became more and more entrenched we had to apply the principle of law, which says that if a revolution succeeds the law changes with it. Yet because we accepted the inevitable we're blamed {{by a lot of people}} for being responsible for the revolution, which is a very different thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Variety {{reported}} in March 2010 that Chris Evans was cast as Captain America and Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull; Marvel Studios confirmed {{the latter in}} May. Ryan Phillippe and John Krasinski were also considered {{for the role of}} Captain America. In April 2010, Sebastian Stan, who had been mentioned in media accounts as a possibility for the title role, was cast as Bucky Barnes. Stan is contracted for multiple films. Also in April, Marvel announced that Hayley Atwell had been cast as Peggy Carter, and that the film's name had been changed from The First Avenger: Captain America to Captain America: The First Avenger. The next day it was reported that Joss Whedon would be rewriting the script as part of his negotiation to write and direct The Avengers. Whedon said in August, [...] "I just got to make some character connections. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> really tight and I loved it, but {{there were a couple of}} opportunities to find his voice a little bit —and some of the other characters' — and make the connections so that you understood exactly why he wanted to be who he wanted to be. And progressing through the script to flesh it out a little bit". Samuel L. Jackson revealed in an interview that he would reprise his role as Nick Fury in the film.|$|E
500|$|It {{took about}} six weeks to write the Blood Beast script. It was written under the working title Creature from Galaxy 27, which was {{conceived}} by Varno, but the Corman brothers later changed it to Night of the Blood Beast. Gene Corman received film credit for conceiving the film's story, but Varno claimed he wrote the film almost entirely himself and that Corman {{had little to do}} with the story: [...] "He had some rambling ideas but they didn't have very much to do with the movie that became Night of the Blood Beast." [...] Varno also said of him: [...] "Gene didn't open his mouth, really, until Roger told him he could." [...] Varno said he wrote the screenplay alone and showed parts of it to Roger and Gene Corman as he went along. Varno researched medical and aerospace technology at a library in Hollywood near Vine Street. The story, which fictionally portrays America's manned voyage into space, was heavily influenced by the real life Space Race ongoing between the United States and Soviet Union at the time. Gene Corman said another major inspiration was The Thing from Another World (1951), a Howard Hawks-directed science fiction film about a group of soldiers and scientists threatened by an alien creature in a remote Arctic research outpost. He said of the film, [...] "How could you not be ? We had to be, if only indirectly or subconsciously. That was a classic film then, a classic film today." [...] However, Varno said any influence from <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>was</b> only subconscious: [...] "I loved some of the scenes in The Thing and I'm sure that crept in one way or another, but not overtly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Thing (Ben Grimm), Reed Richards' college roommate {{and best}} friend, has been {{transformed}} into a monstrous, orange, rock-like humanoid possessing high levels of superhuman strength and durability. [...] The Thing is often filled with anger, self-loathing and self-pity over his new existence. He serves as [...] "an uncle figure, a long-term friend of the family with a gruff Brooklyn manner, short temper, and caustic sense of humor". In the original synopsis Lee gave to Kirby, <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>was</b> intended as [...] "the heavy", but over the years, the character has become [...] "the most lovable group member: honest, direct and free of pretension". Lee said his original pitch to Kirby stated that <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>was</b> [...] "someone who turned into a monster" [...] and is bitter because unlike the other three he cannot change back to a normal appearance.|$|E
