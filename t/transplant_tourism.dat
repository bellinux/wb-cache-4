25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E

50|$|Although the World Health Assembly 2004 {{resolution}} was unambiguous in its objection to trafficking and <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism,</b> a comprehensive description of these unethical practices was still needed. Organ trafficking, <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> and transplant commercialism are now {{defined by the}} Declaration, and it provides principles of practice based on those definitions. The Istanbul Declaration distinguishes <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> from travel for transplantation. Travel for transplantation is the movement of organs, donors, recipients or transplant professionals across jurisdictional borders for transplantation purposes. Travel for transplantation becomes <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> if (1) it involves organ trafficking and/or transplant commercialism or; (2) if the resources (organs, professionals and transplant centers) devoted to providing transplants to patients from outside a country undermine the country’s ability to provide transplant services for its own population.|$|E

50|$|The Declaration of Istanbul {{was created}} at the Istanbul Summit on Organ Trafficking and <b>Transplant</b> <b>Tourism</b> held from 30 April to 1 May 2008 in Istanbul, Turkey. The Declaration clarifies {{the issues of}} <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism,</b> {{trafficking}} and commercialism and provides ethical guidelines for practice in organ donation and transplantation. Since {{the creation of the}} declaration, over 100 countries have endorsed the principles. Some nations have subsequently strengthened their laws against commercial organ trade, including China, Israel, the Philippines, and Pakistan.|$|E

5000|$|The Declaration of Istanbul on organ {{trafficking}} and <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism,</b> {{drafted by the}} international transplant community, defines transplant commercialism, {{organ trafficking}}, and <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> [...] It denounces these practices based on violations to equity, justice, and human dignity. [...] The Declaration aims to promote ethical practices in organ transplantation and donation on an international level. [...] It is nonbinding, but over 100 transplant organizations support its principles, including countries such as China, Israel, the Philippines, and Pakistan, which strengthened their laws against illegal organ trading after the Declaration's release.|$|E
5000|$|The kidney is {{the most}} sought-after organ in <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism,</b> with prices for the organ ranging from as little as $1300 {{to as much as}} $150,000. [...] In fact, reports {{estimate}} that 75% of all illegal organ trading involves kidneys. [...] The liver trade is also prominent in <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism,</b> with prices ranging from $4000 to $157,000. [...] Though livers are regenerative, making liver donations non-fatal, they are much less common due to an excruciating post-operative recovery period that deters donors. Other high-priced bodily organs commonly sold in the organ trade include corneas ($24,400) and unfertilized eggs ($12,400), while lower-priced bodily commodities include blood ($25-$337), skin ($10 per square inch), and bones/ligaments ($5,465). [...] While there is a high demand, and correspondingly a very high price, for vital organs such as hearts and lungs, <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> and organ trafficking of these parts is very rare due to the sophisticated nature of the transplant surgery and the state-of-the-art facilities required for such transplants.|$|E
5000|$|These {{unethical}} {{practices were}} {{the subject of}} a Summit convened in Istanbul from 30 April to 1 May 2008 by The Transplantation Society (TTS) and the International Society of Nephrology (ISN). The result of these deliberations was the Istanbul Declaration on Organ Trafficking and <b>Transplant</b> <b>Tourism</b> [...] The development of the Istanbul Summit and Declaration was derived from a direction by the World Health Assembly in 2004 as it adopted resolution WHA57.18 urging member states ‘to take measures to protect the poorest and vulnerable groups from <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> and the sale of tissues and organs, including attention to the wider problem of international trafficking in human tissues and organs’.|$|E
50|$|Several {{national}} governments have held hearings in their national legislatures regarding organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners, {{with some of}} them subsequently adopting resolutions condemning organ transplant abuses in China or developing legislation to ban <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b>|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the widespread shortage of organs and the increasing ease of Internet communication, organ trafficking and <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> have become global problems accounting for an estimated 10% of organ transplants that are performed annually around the world. Organ trafficking, <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> and transplant commercialism threaten to undermine the nobility and legacy of transplantation worldwide because of the reality associated with these practices - the vulnerable in resource poor countries (such as the illiterate and impoverished, undocumented immigrants, prisoners, and political or economic refugees) are exploited for their organs as a major source of organs for the rich patient-tourists who are prepared to travel and can afford to purchase organs.|$|E
5000|$|Before 2008, {{the sale}} of organs was legal in the Philippines, and the country was a popular {{destination}} for <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> The Philippine Information Agency, {{a branch of the}} government, even promoted [...] "all-inclusive" [...] kidney transplant packages that retailed for roughly $25,000.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, {{though the}} Chinese Medical Society had stated that organ transplants from {{executed}} prisoners must cease, {{and changes in}} Chinese regulations prohibited <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism,</b> {{a meeting of the}} Transplantation Society received over 30 papers containing data from several hundred transplants, where the donor source was likely executed prisoners.|$|E
50|$|The Declaration {{emphasizes}} that organ trafficking and <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> should be prohibited because they violate {{the principles of}} equity, justice and respect for human dignity. The Declaration asserts that because transplant commercialism targets impoverished and otherwise vulnerable donors, it leads inexorably to inequity and injustice and should also be prohibited.|$|E
50|$|Trade {{in human}} organs is illegal in many jurisdictions {{in a number}} of ways and for various reasons, though organ {{trafficking}} is widespread, as is <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> The data on the extent of the black market is difficult to obtain. The question of whether to legalize and regulate the organ trade to combat illegal trafficking and organ shortage is hotly debated.|$|E
5000|$|The United Network for Organ Sharing defines <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> as [...] "the {{purchase}} of a transplant organ abroad that includes access to an organ while bypassing laws, rules, or processes of any or all countries involved." [...] The term [...] "transplant tourism" [...] describes the commercialism that drives illegal organ trade, but not all medical tourism for organs is illegal. For example, in some cases, both the donor and {{the recipient of the}} organ travel to a country with adequate facilities to perform a legal surgery. In other cases, a recipient travels to receive the organ of a relative living abroad. [...] <b>Transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> raises concerns because it involves the transfer of healthy organs in one direction, depleting the regions where organs are bought. This transfer typically occurs in trends: from South to North, from developing to developed nations, from females to males, and from people of color to whites - trends that experts say [...] "have exacerbated old...divisions." ...|$|E

Several governments tightened <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> practices and requested more {{information from the}} Chinese government. Chinese officials repeatedly and angrily denied the report's organ harvesting allegations. Upon release of the initial report, China declared they abided by World Health Organization principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors and denounced the report.|$|E
5000|$|Pakistan’s {{initial entry}} into the medical tourism {{industry}} has been strongly reliant on cheap organ <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> In the past, a sizable number of global patients traveled to Pakistan for kidney transplants. However, these cases have dropped ever since legislation, that sought to outlaw the illegal trade of selling kidneys, was enacted. According to Pakistani medical experts, medical tourism is still an untapped market that could {{be turned into a}} huge opportunity if the government [...] "focuses on key issues".|$|E
5000|$|Iran is {{the only}} nation that allows organs to be bought and sold legally. However, it does place {{restrictions}} on the commercial organ trade {{in an attempt to}} limit <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> The market is contained within the country; that is, foreigners are not allowed to buy the organs of Iranian citizens. Additionally, organs can only be transplanted between people of the same nationality - so, for example, an Iranian cannot purchase a kidney from a refugee from another country. [...] The system is largely charity- and volunteer-based, and those tasked with matching donors and patients are not paid for their work.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the absence}} of an {{organized}} system of organ donation or allocation, wait times for obtaining vital organs in China are among the shortest in the world—often just weeks for organs such as kidneys, livers, and hearts. This has made it a destination for international <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> and a major venue for tests of pharmaceutical anti-rejection drugs.

Because there is no effective nationwide organ donation or allocation system, hospitals source organs from local brokers, including through their connections to courts, detention centers and prisons.|$|E
50|$|Organ {{harvesting}} from live {{people is}} one of the most frequently discussed debate topic in organ transplantation. The World Health Organization argues that transplantation promote health, but the notion of “transplantation tourism” has the potential to violate human rights or exploit the poor, to have unintended health consequences, and to provide unequal access to services, all of which ultimately may cause harm. Thus WHO called to ban compensated organ transplanting and asked member states to protect the most vulnerable from <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> and organ trade. However, as disincentives becomes a must, adding incentives back, such as improving life condition for organ donors after donation, becomes difficult.|$|E
50|$|Reports by the World Health Organization show {{decreased}} {{health and}} economic well-being {{for those who}} donate organs through <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> In Iran, 58% of donors reported negative health consequences. In Egypt, as many as 78% of donors experienced negative health outcomes, and 96% of donors stated that they regretted donating. These findings are relatively consistent across all countries: those who sell their organs on the market tend to have poorer overall health. Substandard conditions during transplant surgeries {{can also lead to}} transmission of diseases like hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Donors' poor health is further exacerbated by depression and other mental illnesses brought on by the stress of donating and insufficient care after surgery.|$|E
50|$|To further combat <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism,</b> the Health Ministry {{issued a}} notice in July 2007 {{in line with}} the Istanbul Declaration, giving Chinese {{citizens}} priority as organ recipients. In October 2007, after several years of discussions with the WHO, the Chinese Medical Association agreed to cease commercial organ collection from condemned prisoners, who would only be able to donate to their immediate relatives. Other safeguards implemented under the legislation include documentation of consent for organ removal from the donor, and review of all death sentences by the Supreme People's Court. Transplant professionals are not involved until death is declared. A symposium among legal and medical professionals was held in April 2008 to discuss the diagnostic criteria for brain death for donors of transplant organs.|$|E
50|$|His {{contributions}} to The Transplantation Society (TTS) have been long-standing. As Chairman of TTS's Ethics Committee, he convened an International Forum on the live kidney donor in Amsterdam, Netherlands in April 2004, {{and on the}} liver lung, liver, intestine and pancreas donor in Vancouver, Canada in September 2005, with participation of over 100 physicians and surgeons from 44 countries around the world. Furthermore, he served as TTS's Director of Medical Affairs from 2006 to 2010 and President from 2012 to 2014. He is now the Immediate Past President and will remain so until August 2016. He works closely with the World Health Organization who made him a WHO consultant on matter of human organ donation and transplantation. These appointments constitute the major aspect of his current efforts. In 2008, {{he was responsible for}} convening the Istanbul Summit from which the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and <b>Transplant</b> <b>Tourism</b> was derived. He became Executive Director the Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the most}} recent Bulletin of the World Health Organization {{on the state of the}} {{international}} organ trade, 66,000 kidney transplants, 21,000 liver transplants, and 6000 heart transplants were performed globally in 2005, while another article reports that 2008 the median waiting time for the U.S. transplant list in 2008 was greater than 3 years and expected to rise, while the United Kingdom reported a lack of organs for 8000 patients, with the rate increasing at 8%. It was estimated that about 10% of all transplants occur illegally, with the Internet acting as a facilitator. <b>Transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> raises concerns because it involves the transfer of healthy organs in one direction, depleting the regions where organs are bought. This transfer typically occurs from South to North, developing to developed nations, females to males, and from people of color to whites, a trend that experts say [...] "has exacerbated old...divisions". While some organs such as the kidney can be transplanted routinely and the single remaining kidney is adequate for normal human needs, other organs are less easy to source. Liver transplants in particular are prominent, but incur an excruciating recovery that deters donations.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} community has issued many ordinances and declarations against the organ trade. Examples include the World Medical Authority's 1985 denouncement of organs for commercial use; the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of 1997 and its 2002 Optional Protocol Concerning Transplantation of Organs and Tissues of Human Origin; and the Declaration of Istanbul on organ trafficking and <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> The World Health Organization (WHO) has played {{a prominent role in}} condemning the illegal organ trade. The WHO first declared organ trade illegal in 1987, stating that such a trade violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 1991, at the 44th World Health Assembly, it approved nine guiding principles for human organ transplant. The principles clearly stated that organs cannot be the subject of financial transactions. On May 22, 2004, these guidelines were slightly amended at the 57th World Health Assembly. They are intended for the use of governments worldwide. These global initiatives have served as a helpful resource for establishing medical professional codes and a legal framework for the issue, but have not provided the sanctions required for enforcement.|$|E
50|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor.

40|$|The term 'Transplant Tourism' is {{becoming}} {{commonly used to}} describe any form of travel that serves in the attainment of new organs; this practice is utterly condemned by the medical community and the World Health Organisation. Medical Tourism involves tourists travelling to, 'obtain medical, dental and surgical care while simultaneously being holidaymakers' (Connell, 2006, p. 1094). British Medical Journal (2008) highlights that Medical Tourism is a billion dollar industry, where companies advertise health services and attract patients {{for a fraction of}} the price they would have paid at home (Turner, 2008 a). However, the typically legitimate Medical Tourism industry's reputation is being tarnished by its association with <b>Transplant</b> <b>Tourism.</b> Human organs used in transplantation can be obtained in two ways: live organ donation or cadaveric organ procurement (Lamb, 1990). In general, recipients prefer having living donor transplants over deceased ones, as the former offer them a better chance of survival (Steinberg, 2004). There is a worldwide struggle to meet the demand for organs; the gap between supply and demand has stimulated global organ trade and <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism.</b> <b>Transplant</b> <b>Tourism</b> has been overlooked within tourism literature and hoping to begin a debate, this note investigates the concept of <b>Transplant</b> <b>Tourism,</b> outlining why it cannot, in general, be considered a legitimate part of the Medical Tourism industry...|$|E

The lack of suitable legislation and infrastructure has prevented growth of deceased donor programs; so, living donors have continued to be the major source of transplantable kidneys. <b>Transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> and commercial kidney transplants are associated with a high incidence of surgical complications, acute rejection and invasive infection, which cause major morbidity and mortality. Developing transplant services worldwide has many benefits - improving the results of transplantation as they would be performed legally, increasing the donor pool, making <b>transplant</b> <b>tourism</b> unnecessary and granting various governments the moral courage to fight unacceptable practices. A private-public partnership underpinned by transparency, public audit and accountability is a prerequisite for effective transplant services in the developing world.
