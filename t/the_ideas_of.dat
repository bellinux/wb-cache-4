5|$|Although {{at various}} times the Byzantines made {{magnificent}} achievements {{in the application of}} the sciences, and are responsible for preserving much of ancient knowledge, some authors have argued that Byzantine scholars made few novel contributions to science in terms of developing new theories or extending <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> classical authors.|$|E
5|$|Among the Calvinists, {{who also}} {{included}} {{the lower classes}} and their leaders, ministers of common background, disagreements soon developed, based on different views {{in the areas of}} religious and social doctrines. The official split took place in 1562, when two separate churches were officially established: the mainstream Calvinist and the smaller, more reformist, Polish Brethren or Arians. The adherents of the radical wing of the Polish Brethren promoted, often by way of personal example, <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> social justice. Many Arians (such as Piotr of Goniądz and Jan Niemojewski) were pacifists opposed to private property, serfdom, state authority and military service; through communal living some had implemented <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> shared usage of the land and other property. A major Polish Brethren congregation and center of activities was established in 1569 in Raków near Kielce, and lasted until 1638, when Counter-Reformation had it closed. The notable Sandomierz Agreement of 1570, an act of compromise and cooperation among several Polish Protestant denominations, excluded the Arians, whose more moderate, larger faction {{toward the end of the}} century gained the upper hand within the movement.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an ideal state {{according}} to Edmund Spenser's masterpiece The Faerie Oueene and {{the differences between the}} sixteenth-century England and <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an ideal state found in the poem. The writer sees that <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an ideal state is striking in the poem, for the poem tells about a state, called Faerie Land, where a wise queen rules her people with the help of courageous knights. As the poem was full with allegories of persons or events from the sixteenth-century England, the writer is then triggered to find out, based on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an ideal state in the poem, whether England's condition in the sixteenth century may be considered as ideal or not. In order to get <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an ideal state in the poem, the writer uses A. J. Greimas' theory of structuralist narratology to reveal the underlying patterns of the poem, supported by the definition of an ideal state. By substituting the actants of the patterns found with the elements of a state, she finds out <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an ideal state according to The Faerie Oueene. The writer discovers <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an ideal state in the poem, which consists of five qualifications for an ideal leader, three qualifications for ideal ministers and three qualifications for ideal people. Furthermore, the writer compares <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an ideal state according to the poem with the condition of England in the sixteenth century by including the allegory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ideal leader is compared to Queen Elizabeth I, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ideal ministers is compared to the English court, and <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> ideal people is compared to English people. Hence, the writer discovers that the sixteenth-century England was different from <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an ideal state in some ways. As a conclusion, the writer states that England in the sixteenth century was not an ideal state, for it was different from the expectation in the poem...|$|R
