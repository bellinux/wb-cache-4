40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{abrasive}} trimming on the electrical properties of Cu 86 Mn 12 Ni 2 Manganin alloy shunt resistors. A precision abrasive trimming system for fine tuning the resistance tolerance of high current Manganin shunt resistors is proposed. The system is shown {{to be capable of}} reducing the resistance tolerance of 100 μΩ shunts from their standard value of ± 5 % to <± 1 % by removing controlled amounts of Manganin material using a square cut trim geometry. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), high current, and high temperature performance of the trimmed shunts was compared to that of untrimmed parts to determine if trimming had any detrimental effect on these key electrical performance parameters of the device. It was shown that the TCR value was reduced following trimming with typical results of + 106 ppm/°C and + 93 ppm/°C for untrimmed and <b>trimmed</b> <b>parts</b> respectively. When subjected to a high current of 200 A the <b>trimmed</b> <b>parts</b> showed a slight increase in temperature rise to 203 °C, as compared to 194 °C for the untrimmed parts, but both had significant temporary increases in resistance of up to 1. 3 μΩ. The results for resistance change following high temperature storage at 200 °C for 168 h were also significant for both untrimmed and <b>trimmed</b> <b>parts</b> with shifts of 1. 85 % and 2. 29 % respectively and these results were related to surface oxidation of the Manganin alloy which was accelerated for the freshly exposed surfaces of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>part...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Although not as {{deliberate}} a downsizing as {{what was}} to come to future Ford cars, the 1977 Thunderbird was far smaller than its predecessor, shedding nearly 10 in of length and 900 lb of weight; height and width remained essentially unchanged. The 1977 Thunderbird was created on the existing intermediate car platform by recycling a select mix of body, interior and <b>trim</b> <b>parts</b> from the previous year's Ford Elite, Mercury Montego and Mercury Cougar combined with some all new body, interior and <b>trim</b> <b>parts</b> to create a dramatic new Thunderbird look. The Thunderbird was distinguished from the LTD II and Cougar 2-door models by its unique wrap-over [...] "basket handle" [...] roofline with opera windows and large rear side quarter windows separated from the rear window by thin C-pillars. Headlamps hidden with retractable covers and full-width dropped center taillamps made a comeback from the late 1960s. As such being based on the intermediate Ford platform, a wider range of powertrains were now available. The base engine was the 302 cuin L Windsor V8, while the larger 351 cuin L 351M and 400 cuin L and T-tops were available as options along with the 351W. In California, the 351 was the only engine available. Although the smaller engines had lower output than the 460 V8, the lighter weight did compensate towards overall performance; the 400 was dropped in 1979 with the introduction of CAFE requirements.|$|R

40|$|Electroless plating {{of copper}} onto {{insulating}} substrates {{is a process}} widely used in the electronics industry for manufacture of printed wiring boards, and in decorative plating of plastic <b>trim</b> <b>parts</b> for automotive and consumer appliance applications. Plastic surfaces must be specially prepared to catalyze deposition from the electroless bath. The process most widely {{used for this purpose}} involves a palladium-tin catalyst.

We have studied these processes in detail using Mössbauer spectroscopy of the Sn 119 to follow the chemical state of the tin and Rutherford backscattering to determine thr elemcnts present on the surface. The results show that : (1) the Sn-Pd bath contains extremely fine (colloidal) particles of Pd-Sn Alloy, (2) these particles are adsorbed on the plastic surface during treatment in the sensitizing bath, and (3) during the rinse after catalysis, a layer of stannic hydroxide is deposited over the Sn-Pd alloy particles. This stannic hydroxide must normally be removed by a separate processing step. With this understanding of the chemistry, it is possible to redesign the process to provide improved efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to increasing {{awareness of the}} environment and energy, the fields of application for new types of plant fiber functional materials are expanding. In this study, different weight proportions of coir fiber were added to wood particle debris to produce hybrid boards. The two forms of coir fiber used were random distribution and non-woven needle mat. A mixed orthogonal experiment was designed to use the weight mixing ratio of wood debris and coir, the density of the hybrid boards, and the mixing form of the raw material as the experimental factors. The mechanical and sound absorption performances were evaluated. The experimental results provided evidence that the addition of the coir fibers enhanced the mechanical performance and sound absorption performance of the hybrid boards. The non-woven needle mat form in particular was effective at evenly distributing the fibers. The optimal plan for this kind of hybrid composite was obtained through experimental analysis. The excellent sound absorption performance and sufficient strength of the hybrid boards made them suitable for use on inner walls as sound-absorbing material or on interior <b>trim</b> <b>parts</b> in automotive applications.

40|$|Support Vector Machines are {{a widely}} used {{classification}} technique. They are computationally efficient and provide excellent predictions even for high-dimensional data. Moreover, Support Vector Machines are very flexible {{due to the}} incorporation of kernel functions. The latter allow to model nonlinearity, but also to deal with nonnumerical data such as protein strings. However, Support Vector Machines can suffer a lot from unclean data containing, for example, outliers or mislabeled observations. Although several outlier detection schemes have been proposed in the literature, the selection of outliers versus nonoutliers is often rather ad hoc and does not provide much insight in the data. In robust multivariate statistics outlier maps are quite popular tools to assess the quality of data under consideration. They provide a visual representation of the data depicting several types of outliers. This paper proposes an outlier map designed for Support Vector Machine classification. The Stahel [...] Donoho outlyingness measure from multivariate statistics is extended to an arbitrary kernel space. A trimmed version of Support Vector Machines is defined <b>trimming</b> <b>part</b> of the samples with largest outlyingness.
