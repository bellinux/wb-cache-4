5|$|After three years' service, Herring {{was granted}} three weeks' leave in Australia in October 1917.

5|$|In 1902, Michael met Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They fell in {{love and}} began <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> in her native English. Michael spoke both French and English fluently. At first it seemed they would marry; however, the Orthodox Church {{prohibited}} the marriage of first cousins, and Michael's father and Beatrice's mother were siblings. Nicholas refused to permit the marriage and, to Michael's and Beatrice's mutual dismay, their romance ended.|$|E
5|$|Pennant's first {{publications}} were scientific {{papers on}} the earthquake he had experienced, other geological subjects and palaeontology. One of these so impressed Carl Linnaeus, that in 1757, he put Pennant's name forward and he was duly elected {{a member of the}} Royal Swedish Society of Sciences. Pennant felt very honoured by this and continued <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> with Linnaeus throughout his life.|$|E
50|$|For example, if one polygon has {{sequential}} sides a, b, c, d, and e and {{the other}} has sequential sides v, w, x, y, and z, and if b and w are corresponding sides, then side a (adjacent <b>to</b> b) must <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> either v or x (both adjacent to w). If a and v <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> each other, then c <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> x, d <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> y, and e <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> z; hence the ith element of the sequence abcde <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> the ith element of the sequence vwxyz for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} {{feed on the}} tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August, when they mate and brood. English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing {{of the emergence of}} females has evolved <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests. Many have yellow markings located on their tergites (dorsal portion), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.|$|E

5|$|An {{accomplished}} woman, Finch gained {{her appointment}} as royal governess in August 1762 upon {{the birth of}} George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George and Queen Charlotte. Finch's duties included oversight of the royal nursery and all the staff employed therein, as well as organising lessons for the children. Finch oversaw the princes' education until they became old enough to live in their own households under the watch of governors, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21. Finch retired from her role in 1793, though she continued <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> {{with members of the}} royal family and receive gifts from them.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of {{regional}} LNA branches in May, one speech focused on legislation in Europe; the meeting resolved <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> with sister organisations on the continent. At the start of December 1874 Josephine left for Paris and a tour that covered France, Italy and Switzerland, where she met with local pressure groups and civic authorities. She encountered strong support from feminist groups, but hostility from the authorities. She returned from her travels {{at the end of}} February 1875.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{reformed}} {{the provincial}} administration, establishing a three-tiered provincial hierarchy, {{in place of}} the previous single-tier structure. The original 42 provinces of the Principate were almost tripled in number to c. 120. These were grouped into 12 divisions called dioceses, each under a vicarius, in turn grouped into 4 praetorian prefectures, <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> to the areas of command assigned to the four Tetrarchs, who were each assisted by a chief-of-staff called a praefectus praetorio (not be confused with the commanders of the Praetorian Guard, who held the same title). The aim of this fragmentation of provincial administration was probably to reduce the possibility of military rebellion by governors (by reducing the forces they each controlled).|$|E

5|$|On March 30, 1780, Scott {{arrived in}} Charleston just as Clinton was laying siege to the city. He was {{captured}} {{when the city}} surrendered on May 12, 1780, and was held as {{a prisoner of war}} at Haddrell's Point near Charleston. Although he was a prisoner, he was given freedom to move within a six-mile radius and was allowed <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> and trade with acquaintances in Virginia. With the death of William Woodford on November 13, 1780, he became primarily responsible for the welfare of the Virginia troops at Haddrell's Point. He requested his parole on account of ill health on January 30, 1781, and in late March, Charles Cornwallis granted the request.|$|E

5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E
5|$|Spots {{were found}} <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> to three Galilean moons: Io, Europa and Ganymede. They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed in the {{vicinity}} of moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to Alfvén currents flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's spots are much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Flower {{was created by}} Vincent Diamante, a video game music {{composer}} and professor at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. He had previously scored the music for Cloud, Chen's first game, and Dyadin {{when they were both}} at the University of Southern California. He worked directly with the development team to integrate the music into the game by adjusting the placements of flowers and the tones that each type played when they were reached. He did this by harmonizing the gameplay with the music, and adjusting the music dynamically <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> to changes in the game world. Diamante used his music to influence the development team in adapting ideas he had for the game.|$|E
