50|$|The Thai Rak Thai party {{charged the}} Democrats with bribing other small {{political}} parties into boycotting the April 2006 elections. An 11-member fact-finding panel headed by Deputy Attorney-General Chaikasem Nitisiri voted unanimously in June 2006 to recommend dissolving the Democrat Party, {{as well as}} Thai Rak Thai and three other parties, based on evidence that the Democrats bribed other opposition parties into boycotting the elections. In February 2007, candidates from the Progressive Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>testified</b> before the Constitution Tribunal that they were duped into registering for candidacy in the April elections. Three witnesses testified that Democrat leaders Thaworn Senniam, Wirat Kalayasiri, and Jua Ratchasi encouraged protesters to disrupt the registration of candidates during the by-elections after the April 2006 election. Prosecutors contended that the party tried to disqualify the election results and force continuous rounds of by-elections. The defence claimed that the witnesses were hired by the Thai Rak Thai party to discredit the Democrats. Ultimately, the Constitutional Court of Thailand acquitted Abhisit and the Democrats of bribery, and instead banned Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party for the same charges.|$|R

40|$|Fleury-Steiner, Ruth E. Women {{who have}} decided to seek legal {{remedies}} through civil protection orders are taking bold steps to end abusive relationships. However, the civil protection order process can be complicated by situational and relational obstacles, causing increased emotional distress for women {{during a time when}} critical decisions are made. Women seeking civil protection orders must complete detailed legal paperwork instrumental in their case and make important decisions regarding their needs. In Delaware, cases may be presented at trials where parties can bring witnesses, supply evidence, and testify in court. To avoid a trial and <b>testifying</b> in court, <b>parties</b> may agree to a consent process. In these situations, the courts do not make a finding of abuse and order conditions as agreed upon by the parties. This study {{is part of a larger}} mixed-methods National Science Foundation (NSF) longitudinal study of women seeking civil protection orders in Delaware. Research used the lenses of Ecological Systems and Procedural Justice Theories. To understand victims' perceptions about the civil court process, consent and full hearing, and institutional support, semi-structured qualitative interviews were analyzed. The findings revealed the following: (a) victims lacked a general knowledge about the protection order process and resources, (b) participants with institutional support reported increased procedural and emotional support, (c) participants noted challenges with the consent process, and (d) minority Black and mixed-race participants were more likely to be discouraged and treated poorly by court personnel.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 43) The use {{of expert}} witnesses in jury trials is common. Experts {{are assumed to}} be neutral, objective parties who disseminate information to jurors; however, the adversarial system may bias experts in favor of the side that retained them (prosecution or defense). This thesis examined the potential influence of adversarial allegiance on experts??? evaluations in a simulated child sexual abuse case. A national sample of 89 experts reviewed a police interview of an alleged 5 -year-old female victim. Retaining party (prosecution or defense) and interview suggestibility (low or high) varied across experts. Experts were more willing to testify for the defense than prosecution when interview suggestibility was high, but equally willing to <b>testify</b> for either <b>party</b> when interview suggestibility was low. Experts focused on aspects of the evidence that favored the retaining party only when interview suggestibility was low and blind raters??? perceptions of expert bias mirrored those findings. Experts??? perceptions of child victim accuracy, trustworthiness, and interview quality only varied as a function of interview suggestibility: child victim accuracy, trustworthiness, and interview quality were lower in the high versus low interview suggestibility condition. Results suggest that expert witnesses in child sexual abuse cases may have an initial bias towards the retaining party when interview suggestibility is low. However, experts appear to remain unbiased when evaluating the child victim and police interview. This information is valuable in the courtroom setting for attorneys and judges alike. Knowing that experts may remain unbiased supports the use of experts in cases to improve the quality and fairness of jurors??? decisions at trial...|$|R
