In 1992 the Australian Construction Services cleared the site and stabilised some of the building elements, and a security fence was installed.|$|E
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from <b>the</b> <b>mains</b> in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} (UPS) systems are connected in series between <b>the</b> ac <b>mains</b> and <b>the</b> critical load. A phase controlled rectifier feeds a battery supported dc bus and an inverter supplies the load. These systems require two conversion stages thus reducing operating efficiency. Moreover, input power factor is poor and large harmonic currents are injected into <b>the</b> ac <b>mains.</b> <b>The</b> proposed topology overcomes these drawbacks by placing the inverter-battery subsystem in shunt between <b>the</b> ac <b>mains</b> and <b>the</b> load. The battery is charged through the inverter dc bus. In normal operation, <b>the</b> ac <b>mains</b> feeds <b>the</b> load directly, and the inverter supplies only the amount of reactive power required to regulate the load voltage and to maintain the power factor very close to unity. When <b>the</b> ac <b>mains</b> fails, <b>the</b> solid state breakers, which connect ac <b>mains</b> to <b>the</b> load, open automatically; and the load is supplied by the battery, through the inverter. The proposed system has the following advantages: a near unity power factor, reduced line current harmonics and higher efficiency. Furthermore, unlike other proposed one conversion stage UPS systems, the proposed structure has the capability of automatic compensation for line or load unbalance. The thesis presents a complete analysis of both the steady state operations and the dynamic performances of the proposed system, with simulation and experimental verifications...|$|R

5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} {{used a variety}} of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, for a single organ â€“ Leslie configuration, <b>the</b> <b>mains</b> power, audio and control signals are all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. Care must be taken when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.|$|E

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in one lamp leads <b>the</b> <b>mains</b> phase and the current in the other lamp lags <b>the</b> <b>mains</b> phase.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{presents}} a bidirectional dcâ€“dc converter {{for use in}} low power applications. The proposed topology {{is based on a}} half-bridge on the primary and a current-fed push-pull on the secondary side of a high frequency isolation transformer. Achieving bidirectional flow of power using the same power components provides a simple, efficient and galvanically isolated topology that is specially attractive for use in battery charge/dis-charge circuits in dc UPS. <b>The</b> dc <b>mains</b> (provided by <b>the</b> ac <b>mains),</b> when presented, powers the down stream load converters and the bidirectional converter which essentially operates in the buck mode to charge the battery to a nominal value of 48 V. On failure of <b>the</b> dc <b>mains</b> (derived from <b>the</b> ac <b>mains),</b> <b>the</b> converter operation is comparable to that of a boost and the battery regulates the bus voltage and thereby provides power to the downstream converters. Small signal and steady state analyzes are presented for this specific application. The design of a laboratory prototype is included. Experimental results from the prototype, under different operating conditions, validate and evaluate the proposed topology. An efficiency of 86. 6 % is achieved in the battery charging mode and 90 % when the battery provides load power. The converter exhibits good transient response under load variations and switchover from one mode of operation to another. Index Termsâ€”Bidirectional power flow, currend fed push-pull, dc UPS.

25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of <b>the</b> <b>mains</b> voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from <b>the</b> <b>mains</b> voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E
