500|$|At first, Henson's Muppets {{appeared}} {{separately from}} the realistic segments on the Street, but after a poor test-screening in Philadelphia, the show was revamped to integrate the two, placing much greater emphasis on Henson's work. Though Henson would often downplay his role in Sesame Street’s success, Cooney frequently praised Jim's work and, in 1990, the Public Broadcasting Service called him [...] "the spark that ignited our fledgling broadcast service." [...] The success of Sesame Street also allowed Henson to stop producing commercials. He later remembered that [...] "it was a pleasure <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> world".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Invisible Circles {{was shaped by}} After Forever's singer and lyricist Floor Jansen, taking {{inspiration}} from Sander Gommans' job as an art teacher. His daily contact with children with social and family problems {{had given him the}} desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs. He had also realized that those children's problems often stemmed from the psychological traumas that their parents had experienced in their past. Gommans described the title and the concept of the album in these terms: [...] "Invisible Circles describes the paths of life that someone can follow. Life consists of several circles that you can follow; many times you will come back {{at the beginning of a}} circle, although you have tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> particular circle." ...|$|E
500|$|In early February {{the marquis}} arrived back unannounced {{at his house}} in Rio de Janeiro, much to the {{surprise}} of his wife. The Viscount of Inhaúma also returned home shortly afterwards, but with his health so compromised that he died a few weeks later. Upon learning of Inhaúma's death, Caxias said: [...] "and the same would have had happened to me, had I not resolved <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> hell." [...] PedroII was greatly disappointed in Caxias, but he was also very aware that the marquis was the person most responsible for the great successes during the war, accomplishments that had come at the cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery. The Emperor called the marquis to the Imperial Palace, the Paço de São Cristóvão, on 21 February 1869 for a reconciliation.|$|E

500|$|So many Southern Rhodesians were {{withdrawn}} from the trenches for officer training that in mid-1915 Brady appealed through the Salisbury and Bulawayo presses for more volunteers to replace {{those who had been}} commissioned. A platoon of Southern Rhodesians with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC took part in the [...] "big push" [...] of 1 July 1916, {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Somme, charging German positions elsewhere on the line early that morning. There were 90 Rhodesians on the eve of the attack and only 10 alive and unwounded afterwards. On the Somme battlefield itself, Rhodesians were among those at Delville Wood, which began on 14 July. This was the South African 1st Infantry Brigade's first engagement, and some of the colonials blacked up and imitated Zulu battle cries and war dances. Despite suffering casualties of catastrophic proportions—about 80% of the brigade's personnel were killed, wounded or captured—they took the Wood and held it as ordered until they were relieved on 20 July. By the time of its withdrawal, the South African Brigade, originally numbering 3,155 (123 officers and 3,032 other ranks), had been reduced to 19 officers and 600 men. Delville Wood was later described by Sir BH Liddell Hart as [...] "the bloodiest battle hell of 1916". [...] "God knows I never wish to see such horrible sights again," [...] a Southern Rhodesian veteran of the battle wrote home; [...] "at times I wished it would come fast, anything <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> terrible death-trap and murderous place." ...|$|E
