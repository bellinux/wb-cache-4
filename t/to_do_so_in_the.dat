5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{tactical}} draw, Antietam {{is considered a}} turning point {{of the war and}} a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the proclamation earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior knowledge that the plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance.|$|E

5|$|In 1860 {{he became}} organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, {{initially}} {{for a period}} of six months, at a salary of £120 per year. His duties included playing for services, training the choir and leading them on Fridays, a day on which the organ was not used. A new organ had been installed five years earlier that was ideal for developing his talent. He proved satisfactory in the post, and his contract was made permanent. He was permitted to study for a degree as long as it did not interfere with his duties, and he chose <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expectation that it would raise his social status. He gained his BA in 1864 and his MA two years later and was keen to proceed to his Mus Doc, which would raise his standing within the university.|$|E

5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women were able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state of Kerala. This {{is important because it}} has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E

In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park, bears are the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, dhole, brown bear, Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and snow leopard. Eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes prey on Asian elk calves.

5|$|At Auschwitz, {{the actual}} {{delivery}} of gas {{to the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.|$|E
5|$|At the ATP finals, Murray beat Djokovic 6–3 6–4, {{claiming}} {{the title and}} the No.1 spot {{at the end of}} the year, and ending 2016 on a 24-match winning streak, the longest of his career. He became the second player after Andre Agassi to win Grand Slam, World Tour Finals, Olympic and Masters titles, and the first <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same calendar year. 2016 marked the first year since 2003 that neither Federer, Nadal or Djokovic finished the year as world number 1. Despite his struggles with form throughout the second half of the year, Djokovic still ended 2016 as world number 2. Having suffered from injury plagued seasons, Nadal and Federer ended the year at number 9 and number 16 respectively. For Nadal it was his lowest end of year ranking since 2004, while Federer's fall in the rankings meant that November 2016 marked his first time outside the top 10 since October 2002.|$|E

A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E

5|$|Day {{continued}} {{to take on}} challenging and difficult projects. He had already printed the first English book of church music in 1560. In 1567, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned Day to print a collection of writings attributed to the tenth-century Aelfric of Eynsham. For this work, Day, known for his fine and varied fonts, had the first-ever font of Anglo-Saxon type cut. The cost was borne by Parker, perhaps Day's most important patron. The font may have been designed by François Guyot, a French type-founder known to have worked for Day and lived in his household. Day used the same font to print Lambarde's Archaionomia (a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws) in 1568. In 1570, he printed Billingsley and Dee's English Euclid, which included folding and movable diagrams—one of the first printed books ever <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same year, he printed Ascham's Scholemaster.|$|E
