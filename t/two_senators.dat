5|$|Each state elects <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> by statewide {{popular vote}} every six years. The {{terms of the}} <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> are {{staggered}} {{so that they are}} not elected in the same year. Utah's senators are elected in the years from classes I and III. Senators were originally chosen by the Utah House of Representatives until the Seventeenth Amendment came into force in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The {{stakes were}} raised in the {{conflict}} on 10 October, when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> each. In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates would not take their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats at once. This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{retired from}} the {{practice}} of law in 1989. In June 1990, Cooper was honored with a gala screening of Gentleman From Kentucky, a Kentucky Educational Television documentary about his life, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. On February 21, 1991, Cooper died of heart failure in a retirement home in Washington. He had been preceded in death by his second wife, Lorraine, on February 3, 1985. On February 26, 1991, Kentucky's <b>two</b> <b>senators,</b> Wendell H. Ford and Mitch McConnell, gave speeches on the Senate floor praising Cooper, and the Senate adjourned in Cooper's memory. Cooper was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal opinion on the border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and <b>two</b> <b>senators.</b> In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have been}} devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Since Utah {{became a}} U.S. state in 1896, it has sent congressional {{delegations}} to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. Each state elects <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> to serve for six years. Before the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were {{elected by the}} Utah State Legislature. Members of the House of Representatives are elected to two-year terms, one from each of Utah's four congressional districts. Before becoming a state, the Territory of Utah elected a non-voting delegate at-large to Congress from 1850 to 1896.|$|E
5|$|The Senate has 100 {{members with}} each state having <b>two</b> <b>senators,</b> elected at-large to six-year terms; {{one third of}} Senate seats are up for {{election}} every other year. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college {{system in which the}} determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia. The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} was {{authorized}} on 30 June 1890 and the contract for Indiana—not including guns and armor—was awarded to William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia, who offered to build it for $3,020,000. The {{total cost of the}} ship was almost twice as high, approximately $6,000,000. The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of armor plates caused a two-year delay. Indianas keel was laid down on 7 May 1891 and she was launched on 28 February 1893, attended by around 10,000 people, including President Benjamin Harrison, several members of his cabinet and the <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> from Indiana. During her fitting-out in early March 1894, the ship undertook a preliminary sea trial to test her speed and machinery. At this point her side armor, guns, turrets and conning tower had not yet been fitted, and her official trials would not take place until October 1895 due to the delays in armor deliveries.|$|E
5|$|Cuba was {{of special}} {{importance}} to Southern Democrats, who believed their {{economic and political}} interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union. The existence of slavery in Cuba, the island's plantation economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders, whose way of life was under fire from Northern abolitionists. Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the population-based House of Representatives, Southern politicians sought to maintain the fragile {{balance of power in}} the Senate, where each state received equal representation. As slavery-free Western states were admitted, Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state. If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state, the island would have sent <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> and up to nine representatives to Washington.|$|E

5|$|Even {{with the}} Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson {{considered}} {{himself in a}} strong position. The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or border states except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states {{to become part of}} the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for Colorado Territory was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Wetherby resumed his private law practice. In 1956, Senator Alben Barkley {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a}} heart attack. The timing of his death meant that the state would elect <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> in 1956—Clements' term was expiring and now Barkley's seat was vacant. President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador John Sherman Cooper to be the Republican candidate for the seat, hoping Cooper's immense popularity in the state would help his own re-election bid. Barkley's death occurred so late in the year that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party's candidate for the open seat. The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby, who was only six months removed from his term as governor.|$|E
5|$|Still {{convinced}} he {{was destined to}} become president, Chandler attended the 1956 Democratic National Convention with hopes of securing the party's presidential nomination. Despite being told by his advisors that the convention would nominate Adlai Stevenson, Chandler continued to seek the nomination, but received only 36 1/2 votes. Following Stevenson's nomination, Chandler returned to Kentucky bitterly disappointed. Due {{to the death of}} Senator Alben Barkley and the expiration of Senator Clements' term, Kentucky would also elect <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> in November 1956. Clements was seeking re-election, and the state Democratic committee chose Wetherby as the nominee for Barkley's seat. Chandler refused to use his office to support Stevenson, Clements, or Wetherby, and Republicans Dwight D. Eisenhower, John Sherman Cooper, and Thruston Ballard Morton won the presidential and senatorial races in the state.|$|E

5|$|The council met on December 14 {{to appoint}} representatives to the Confederacy's unicameral {{provisional}} congress. Those appointed would serve {{for only two}} months, as the provisional congress was replaced with a permanent bicameral legislature on February 17, 1862. Kentucky was entitled to <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> and 12 representatives in the permanent Confederate Congress. The usual day for general elections being passed, Governor Johnson and the legislative council set election day for Confederate Kentucky on January 22. Voters were allowed to vote in whichever county they occupied on election day, and could cast a general ballot for all positions. In an election that saw military votes outnumber civilian ones, only four of the provisional legislators were elected to seats in the Confederate House of Representatives. One provisional legislator, Henry Burnett, {{was elected to the}} Confederate Senate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before Abraham Lincoln took office, parties in the seceding states {{disagreed}} over the proper course of action concerning the forts within their domains. In Florida, three forts remained {{in the possession of}} the United States Army: Fort Zachary Taylor at Key West, Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, and Fort Pickens near Pensacola. Some of the most strident secessionists proposed that they be taken over immediately, by force if needed, beginning with Fort Pickens. Cooler heads hoped to avoid bloodshed and gain possession by negotiation; they made much of the conciliatory words of William H. Seward, already selected to be Secretary of State in the incoming administration. Mallory and Florida's other Senator, David L. Yulee, and the <b>two</b> <b>Senators</b> from Alabama sent telegrams to their respective governors urging caution. Other Southern Senators lent their support, and President-elect Jefferson Davis seemed to agree. In the end, the moderates won out, and no attack was made on Fort Pickens. Although Mallory was hardly alone, his political opponents later used his perceived pro-Union stance as an excuse to attack him.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October, the High Court {{ruled that}} the act passed at the joint sitting that gave the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> each was valid. A half-Senate {{election}} needed to be held by June 1976; most senators-elect would take their seats on 1 July but the territorial senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats would take their places at once. The ruling meant {{that it was possible}} for the ALP to gain a temporary majority in the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976. To do so, the ALP would have to win Field's and Bunton's seats, and one seat in each territory, and have the second ACT seat fall to either a Labor candidate or an independent, former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton, now estranged from his party. If this happened, Labor would have an effective 33–31 margin, would be able to pass supply if that was still an issue, and also could pass electoral redistribution laws (which had been passed by the House, though twice defeated by the Senate) that would give it an advantage at the next election.|$|E

5|$|Originally, under , Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, {{each state}} {{legislature}} elected its state's senators for a six-year term. Each state, regardless of size, {{is entitled to}} <b>two</b> <b>senators</b> {{as part of the}} Connecticut Compromise between the small and large states. This contrasted with the House of Representatives, a body elected by popular vote, and was described as an uncontroversial decision; at the time, James Wilson was the sole advocate of popularly electing the Senate and his proposal was defeated 10–1. There were many advantages to the original method of electing senators. Prior to the Constitution, a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than permanent treaties, with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state. However, under the new Constitution, the central government was granted substantially more power than before; the election of senators by the states reassured Anti-federalists that there would be some protection against the swallowing up of states and their powers by the federal government, providing a check on the power of the federal government.|$|E
5|$|States are {{the primary}} subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as {{regulating}} intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by <b>two</b> <b>Senators,</b> while Representatives are distributed among the states {{in proportion to the}} most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.|$|E
