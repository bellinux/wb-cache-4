50|$|Drever further {{notes that}} in most natural waters, all ions except HCO3− and CO3−2 have low concentrations. Thus {{carbonate}} alkalinity, which is equal to mHCO3− + 2mCO3−2 is also approximately equal to the <b>total</b> <b>alkalinity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alkalinity is {{sometimes}} incorrectly used interchangeably with basicity. For example, the pH {{of a solution}} can be lowered {{by the addition of}} CO2.

40|$|AIM: This study {{assessed}} the phycoperiphyton biomass in two regions submitted to different human impacts on Juara Lake, a coastal ecosystem with multiple uses, to order {{to test the}} hypothesis that the sampling sites that receive domestic sewage shows higher biomass values. METHODS: It was installed three experimental structures with artificial substrate (glass slides) in December 2009 in two sampling sites: ED - near the domestic sewage's release; TR - in the area of intensive fish farming (net cages). Samplings were conducted in each experimental structure, after 21, 26 and 31 days for colonization. We evaluated: transparency, electric conductivity, pH, turbidity, <b>total</b> suspended solids, <b>alkalinity,</b> dissolved oxygen, water temperature, total nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, orthophosphate and silicate. The phycoperiphyton was analyzed regarding biomass: biovolume (total and per class); pigments (chlorophyll-a and b and carotenoids) and phaeophytin; dry weight and ash-free dry weight. RESULTS: TR featured higher values of transparency, water temperature and silicate. ED presented greater values of conductivity, turbidity, <b>total</b> suspended solids, <b>alkalinity,</b> <b>total</b> nitrogen, nitrate, ammonia nitrogen, and orthophosphate. No difference was detected between the sites and the succession of days for the dry weight, ash-free dry weight, chlorophyll-b, carotenoids, phaeopigments, and total biovolume. CONCLUSIONS: Nevertheless, the biovolume of Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae were more representative in ED. Only the higher values of chlorophyll confirmed the hypothesis tested...|$|R

During the experiment, the fish were kept in a Plexiglas respiratory-metabolism chamber, which was filled with Lake Superior water.

50|$|When {{the total}} CO2 content is significant, as in natural waters and {{alkaline}} effluents, {{two or three}} inflections {{can be seen in}} the pH-volume curves owing to buffering by higher concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate.

50|$|DIC and {{alkalinity}} govern carbonate and acid-base chemistry in the world’s oceans, {{and their}} effects on the Revelle factor is no exception. The ratio of DIC to <b>total</b> <b>alkalinity,</b> and the changes in pCO2 are {{the main cause of}} Revelle Factor variability. Higher levels of DIC result in a lower Revelle factor, and consequently a larger buffering effect. Higher levels of pCO2 results in a higher Revelle factor, a positive feedback loop, and consequently a smaller buffering effect. Typically, the buffer factor ranges between 8 and 13.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} measurement, four basic {{parameters}} are of key importance: Total inorganic carbon (TIC, TCO2 or CT), <b>Total</b> <b>alkalinity</b> (TALK or AT), pH, and pCO2. Measuring any {{two of these}} parameters allows for the determination {{of a wide range}} of pH-dependent species (including the above-mentioned species). This balance can be changed by a number of processes. For example, the air-sea flux of CO2, the dissolution/precipitation of CaCO3, or biological activity such as photosynthesis/respiration. Each of these has different effects on each of the four basic parameters, and together they exert strong influences on global cycles. The net and local charge of the oceans remains neutral during any chemical process.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{alkalinity}} generation in the ocean. Perhaps the most well known is {{the dissolution of}} CaCO3 (calcium carbonate, which is a component of coral reefs) to form Ca2+ and CO32− (carbonate). The carbonate ion {{has the potential to}} absorb two hydrogen ions. Therefore, it causes a net increase in ocean alkalinity. Calcium carbonate dissolution is an indirect result of ocean pH lowering. It can cause great damage to coral reef ecosystems, but has a relatively low effect on the <b>total</b> <b>alkalinity</b> (AT) in the ocean. Lowering of pH due to absorption of CO2 actually raises the alkalinity by causing dissolution of carbonates.|$|E

50|$|Alkalinity or AT {{measures}} {{the ability of}} a solution to neutralize acids to the equivalence point of carbonate or bicarbonate. The alkalinity is equal to the stoichiometric sum of the bases in solution. In the natural environment carbonate alkalinity tends to make up most of the <b>total</b> <b>alkalinity</b> due to the common occurrence and dissolution of carbonate rocks and presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Other common natural components that can contribute to alkalinity include borate, hydroxide, phosphate, silicate, dissolved ammonia, the conjugate bases of some organic acids, and sulfate. Solutions produced in a laboratory may contain a virtually limitless number of bases that contribute to alkalinity. Alkalinity is usually given in the unit mEq/L (milliequivalent per liter). Commercially, as in the swimming pool industry, alkalinity might also be given in parts per million of equivalent calcium carbonate (ppm CaCO3).|$|E
