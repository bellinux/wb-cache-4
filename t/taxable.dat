5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{rejected}} that argument, essentially ruling that under {{federal income tax}} law all the future income earned by Mr. Earl was <b>taxable</b> {{to him at the}} time he earned the income, even though he had already assigned part of the income to his wife, and regardless of the validity of the assignment agreement under state law. The Court in Lucas v. Earl did not rule that wages are not <b>taxable.</b>|$|E
5|$|City tax {{assessors}} {{said that}} Constitution Center's value rose to $725.8 million in 2014, up from $573.5 million in 2013 (an increase of $152.3 million), {{making it the}} most valuable <b>taxable</b> property in the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Glimmer and <b>Taxable</b> {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. <b>Taxable</b> simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create the illusion of a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{taxability}} {{of income}} {{in connection with}} events or activities not involving a government privilege or franchise, the United States Supreme Court stated in United States v. Sullivan that gains from illegal traffic in liquor {{are subject to the}} Federal income tax. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rutkin v. United States that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is <b>taxable</b> as income to the wrongdoer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James v. United States that the receipt of money obtained through embezzlement is <b>taxable</b> as income to the wrongdoer, even though the wrongdoer is required to return the money to its owner.|$|E
5|$|Scout Shops Ltd – sells Association uniforms, {{equipment}} and gifts online {{and on the}} high street. In 2012, it had a turnover of £7.2 million, of which their <b>taxable</b> profits of £2.2 million was distributed to the association. The association also has a related subsidiary, World Scout Shop Ltd, which sells similar merchandise to a global market as well as world Scouting specific items. It was created in 2011 at the 22nd World Scout Jamboree in Sweden and had a turnover of £0.285 million and a <b>taxable</b> profit of £0.164 million which was distributed to the association.|$|E
5|$|<b>Taxable,</b> Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring {{coordination of}} air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, <b>Taxable</b> {{did not appear to}} have the desired effect and failed to elicit any significant response from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. The attacks on the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions and complexity of the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.|$|E
5|$|Operations <b>Taxable,</b> Glimmer and Big Drum were {{tactical}} military deceptions {{conducted on}} 6 June 1944 {{in support of}} the Allied landings in Normandy. The operations formed the naval component of Operation Bodyguard, a wider series of tactical and strategic deceptions surrounding the invasion. Small boats, along with aircraft from RAF Bomber Command, simulated invasion fleets approaching Cap d'Antifer, Pas-de-Calais and Normandy. Glimmer and <b>Taxable</b> played on the German belief, amplified by Allied deception efforts over the preceding months, that the main invasion force would land in the Calais region. Big Drum was positioned on the western flank of the real invasion force to try to confuse German forces about the scale of the landings. These operations complemented Operation Titanic, which was intended to confuse the Germans about the D-Day airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of late Iron Age and Roman settlements in the area. At {{the time of the}} Domesday Book, Knowle was a rural area assessed at a <b>taxable</b> value of two geld units. Knowle West remained rural in character until the 1930s, when a council housing estate was developed to provide homes for people displaced by slum clearance in the centre of the city.|$|E
5|$|By 1525, Reading was {{the largest}} town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when {{measured}} by <b>taxable</b> wealth. By 1611, it had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth. The town was seriously affected by the English Civil War, with a major siege and loss of trade, and {{played a pivotal role}} in the Revolution of 1688, with that revolution's only significant military action fought {{on the streets of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|Glimmer, <b>Taxable</b> and Big Drum were World War II {{deception}} operations. They {{were conducted}} {{as part of}} Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic military deception intended to support the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944. Bodyguard was designed to confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the invasion. The London Controlling Section (LCS) had spent some time convincing German commanders that the fictional First United States Army Group (FUSAG) represented {{the bulk of the}} Allied invasion force. FUSAG's existence was fabricated through Operation Fortitude South.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Internal Revenue Service began {{investigating}} the Reagans over allegations they owed additional {{tax on the}} gifts and loans of high-fashion clothes and jewelry to the First Lady during {{their time in the}} White House (recipients benefiting from the display of such items recognize <b>taxable</b> income even if they are returned). In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Corzine coauthored (with Bob Graham) a tax-cut {{proposal}} {{aimed at}} lowering the marginal tax bracket from 15% to 10% {{on the first}} $19,000 of <b>taxable</b> income. In 2002, he proposed a tax cut that exempted the first $10,000 of income from the $765 of Social Security taxes for both employers and employees. Corzine also proposed making dividend payments tax deductible to companies {{as a form of}} economic stimulus.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, 890 {{inhabitants}} were professionally active, {{the unemployment}} rate for the population between 15 and 64 was 6,7% for men and 10,0% for women, and the average net <b>taxable</b> income was €21 593. Of the 310 jobs available in Cubzac, only 34,9% were given to its inhabitants. On January 1, 2010 there were no hotels and no camping sites in Cubzac. Agriculture in Cubzac is mostly dedicated to vine, corn and hay. In 2000, 244ha of Cubzac's land was farmland, representing 25% of the total 987ha.|$|E
5|$|Like a village, {{a resort}} village {{can be created}} from an {{organized}} hamlet by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 51 of The Municipalities Act if it has: been an organized hamlet for three or more years; a population of 100 or more; 50 or more dwellings or businesses; and a <b>taxable</b> assessment base that meets a prescribed minimum. Upon reaching a population of 500, a resort village's council may request the minister to change its status to a town in accordance with section 52 of The Municipalities Act.|$|E
5|$|Powell {{implemented}} {{the use of}} the state's sinking fund to pay interest on school bonds, a measure which had passed over Governor Helm's veto, but Helm refused to carry out. In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide a measure to raise the school tax from two cents per hundred dollars of <b>taxable</b> property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1997 flood, {{there has}} been public and private {{developments}} throughout Grand Forks. Two new, large sports venues opened in 2001: the Alerus Center and the Ralph Engelstad Arena. In 2007, the Winnipeg-based Canad Inns hotel chain opened a 13-story hotel and waterpark next to the Alerus Center. By 2007 Grand Forks had a larger population than it did before the 1997 flood. Area employment and <b>taxable</b> sales had also surpassed pre-flood levels.|$|E
5|$|The budget also {{included}} changes to {{products and services}} that {{are subject to the}} sales tax, effective October 1, 2006. The newly <b>taxable</b> items included downloaded music, ringtones, movies and books; shipping and handling; drapery and carpet dry cleaning; floor installation; contracted landscaping; self-storage; tanning; massages; tattooing; magazines; investigation and security services such as armored cars and alarm systems; limousines, except for those used in funerals; memberships in health, athletic and shopping clubs; and parking, except for employee parking, parking at municipal meters and parking already subject to municipal parking taxes.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of the citadel, the Tây Sơn never again attempted to recapture the city—the building gave Nguyen Anh a further psychological advantage over his opponents. The citadel helped to secure the southern region, which allowed Nguyễn Ánh to implement domestic programs to strengthen himself economically in preparation to fight the Tây Sơn. He used the newfound security to undertake agrarian reforms. Due to Tây Sơn naval raids on the rice crop, the area had been suffering long term rice shortages. Although the land was extremely fertile, the region was agriculturally underexploited because it had been occupied by Vietnamese people only relatively recently. Nguyễn Ánh's programs resulted in large amounts of previously idle land being cultivated. Large surpluses of grain, <b>taxable</b> by the state, were generated.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to recommendations from the governor, the General Assembly enacted cost-saving {{reforms in the}} judicial system, including the abolition of criminal, chancery, and common pleas courts, dividing the state instead into 18 circuit court districts. The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of <b>taxable</b> property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E
5|$|Jerome's {{economy is}} {{centered}} mainly on recreation and tourism. Figures published in 2015 showed {{that more than}} 50percent {{of the labor force}} worked in arts, entertainment, retail, food and recreation services, while manufacturing and construction employed just over 10percent. Between 1990 and 2006 the value of <b>taxable</b> sales increased from $4.8million to $15.5million, and between 1990 and 2014 the unemployment rate fell from 4.2percent to 1.4percent. Formerly vacant buildings house boutiques, gift shops, antique and craft shops; the town also has five art galleries, a library, three parks and two museums, including the Mine Museum run by the Jerome Historical Society, and a former church building that houses the society's offices and archives. Annual events include a home tour ("Paso de Casas") in May, a reunion for former mining families in October, and a Festival of Lights in December.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 1844, Philadelphia {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} {{that gave the}} city a battalion of artillery, a regiment of infantry {{and at least one}} full troop of cavalry for the purpose of providing the preservation of peace within the city when necessary. The difficulty of quelling the riots and other crime led to the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass an 1845 act that required Philadelphia, the township of Moyamensing and the unincorporated districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Penn to maintain a police force of one man per 150 <b>taxable</b> inhabitants. In 1850, another act was passed that established that the Philadelphia police force would police the city and seven surrounding districts. The inability to maintain order effectively in Philadelphia's suburbs would be an important argument for the consolidation of the city in 1854.|$|E
5|$|The average net {{household}} income (after social, pension {{and health insurance}} contributions) in Paris was €36,085 for 2011. It ranged from €22,095 in the 19th arrondissement to €82,449 in the 7th arrondissement. The median <b>taxable</b> income for 2011 was around €25,000 in Paris and €22,200 for Île-de-France. Generally speaking, incomes are higher in the Western {{part of the city}} and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area. Unemployment was estimated at 8.2 percent in the city of Paris and 8.8 percent in the Île-de-France region in the first trimester of 2015. It ranged from 7.6 percent in the wealthy Essonne department to 13.1 percent in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, where many recent immigrants live.|$|E
5|$|The <b>taxable</b> {{value of}} an estate was {{initially}} assessed from the Domesday Survey, but other methods were later employed, such as valuations based on the sworn testimony of neighbours or {{on the number of}} plough-teams the taxpayer used. Carucage never raised as much as other taxes, but nevertheless helped to fund several projects. It paid the ransom for Richard's release in 1194, after he was taken prisoner by Leopold V, Duke of Austria; it covered the tax John had to pay Philip II of France in 1200 on land he inherited in that country; and it helped to finance Henry III's military campaigns in England and on continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, {{the land}} tax rate was reduced to one-hundredth, with lost revenue recouped by {{increasing}} the poll and property tax rates. The poll tax for most adults was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years. The lower <b>taxable</b> threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.|$|E
5|$|In 376, a large band of Goths asked Emperor Valens for {{permission}} to settle on the southern bank of the Danube River on terms similar to the Franks. The Goths were also accepted into the empire as foederati; however, they rebelled later that year and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople. The heavy losses that the Roman military suffered during this defeat ironically forced the Roman Empire to rely still further on such foederati troops to supplement its forces. In 382, the practice was radically extended when federated troops were signed up en masse as allied contingents of laeti and foederatii troops separate from existing Roman units. Near-constant civil wars during the period 408 and 433 between various Roman usurpers, emperors and their supposed deputies such as Constantine III, Constantius III, Aetius and Bonifacius resulted in further losses, necessitating the handing over of more <b>taxable</b> land to foederati.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1840s and early 1850s, the {{communities}} of Selma, Sutherland Springs, Boerne, La Vernia, and Bulverde were established along the creek. Later on, Cibolo Schertz, and Universal City were founded. These settlements dealt with torrential floods that cost many their homes and lives in later years. The destruction was prominently witnessed during the October 1998 Central Texas floods, and four years later during the flood of July 2002. The San Antonio River Authority authorized $114,599 to help clean debris from the creek in 2003, hoping to improve water quality. Above-average levels of bacteria {{have been found in}} certain areas of the creek, leading to such initiatives as the Upper Cibolo Watershed Protection plan, which began in 2010. Another plan to create a Cibolo Reservoir near Stockdale aimed to control flooding and provide fresh water met fierce opposition from local citizens concerned about the destruction of historic sites along the creek, and the loss of <b>taxable</b> land.|$|E
5|$|Nasr was a {{military}} leader with long service and experience in Khurasan. As early as 705 he participated in a campaign along the upper Oxus River, led by Salih, the brother of Qutayba ibn Muslim, the general who had been tasked with subduing Transoxiana. For his service during this campaign, Nasr was awarded an entire village in this region. Despite the successes of Qutayba, much of Central Asia east of the Oxus remained outside effective Arab control; while garrisons had been established in places like Samarkand, Balkh, or Bukhara, the Caliphate largely relied on cliental relationships with the multitude of local rulers, who became tributary to the Umayyads. In addition, clashes with the Chinese-backed Turgesh, the ambiguous policy followed regarding conversion of the native population (mass conversions would lessen the <b>taxable</b> population and hence the amount of tribute received) and increasing inter-Arab tribal factionalism weakened Umayyad control over the region and necessitated increased military activity.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all <b>taxable</b> goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E
5|$|Those {{who served}} in {{government}} had a privileged position in Han society that was just one tier below the nobles (yet some high officials were also ennobled and had fiefs). They could not be arrested for crimes unless permission was granted by the emperor. However, when officials were arrested, they were imprisoned and fettered like commoners. Their punishments in court also had to gain {{the approval of the}} emperor. Officials were not exempt from execution, yet they were often given a chance to commit suicide as a dignified alternative. The most senior posts were the Three Excellencies—excluding the Grand Tutor, a post that was irregularly occupied. The individual titles and functions of the Three Excellencies changed from Western to Eastern Han. However, their annual salaries remained at 10,000 dan (石) of grain, largely commuted to payments in coin cash and luxury items like silk. Below them were the Nine Ministers, each of whom headed a major government bureau and earned 2,000 bushels a year. The lowest-paid government employees made Equivalent to 100 bushels annually. It was thought that wealthy officials would be less tempted by bribes. Therefore, {{in the beginning of the}} dynasty, having a total assessed <b>taxable</b> wealth of one hundred thousand coins was a prerequisite for holding office. This was reduced to forty thousand coins in 142 BCE, yet from Emperor Wu's reign onwards this policy was no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|When taxes once {{payable to}} Rome were {{transferred}} to the Crown, Cromwell saw the need to assess the <b>taxable</b> value of the Church's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535. The result was an extensive compendium, the Valor Ecclesiasticus. In September of the same year, Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions, to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country's religious houses, with largely negative conclusions. In addition to reporting back to Cromwell, the visitors made {{the lives of the}} monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution. In any case, the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly {{to the beginning of the}} state-enforced dissolution of the monasteries with all religious houses worth less than £200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536. After a short pause, surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners, and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained: some 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient, with minimal resistance, and brought the crown some £90,000 a year. The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed. Cromwell's actions transferred a fifth of England's landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown, which would use the lands much more efficiently. Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England's religious houses, they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, a tax {{is imposed}} on income {{by the federal}} government, most state governments, and many local governments.
