25|$|Amy viciously {{attacked}} Steven {{and especially}} David in the boardroom, which ultimately played {{a large part}} in Lord Sugar's decision to fire her over the two boys. Karren also noted {{that she had been}} arguably the most culpable person in the arguments between the two Platinum sub-teams in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rebecca {{started out}} the episode on {{crutches}} after breaking her ankle during the reward from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fired (during final boardroom): Nurun - For lacking any assertiveness, selling poorly {{despite her}} market stall experience, {{and for her}} poor {{performance}} as PM on <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fired: Felipe - For his {{purchase}} of the paper skeleton, showing limited business skills, and for his somewhat poor track record on <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Fired: Sara â€“ For her {{aggressive}} manner towards customers, her {{inability to}} listen to others, not selling any cakes, and her general lack of contribution throughout <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sanjay - For {{offering}} a questionable business plan, poor market research, delivering {{one of the}} team's poor pitches, and for his generally very mediocre track record throughout <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fired: Majid - For {{being seen}} as {{peripheral}} figure who made little contribution to the task, not asking for a bigger role, and for his poor theme suggestion in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Task Manager {{defaults}} to {{a simple}} view which only displays a list of computer programs with a window. The expanded view is {{an updated version of}} <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>Task</b> Managers with several tabs.|$|E
50|$|Task: An {{extension}} of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task,</b> {{the teams are}} tasked with creating a 'wall' {{of support for the}} children and young men and women of Don Bosco House, and present them to an audience.|$|E
5000|$|Sofiane - For mismanaging the sub-teams, {{delivering}} a poor pitch, failing on a task his business plan was related to, {{and for his}} total disregard of authority and generally erratic track record throughout <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Prologue: Following {{the total}} {{dismissal}} of Infinity in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task's</b> boardroom, Trump summoned the three Vortex members {{and told them}} that only two would progress to the final, while the weakest of the three would be fired.|$|R
30|$|In general, {{the routes}} {{provided}} by Web services are different and cannot be easily judged. To evaluate {{the quality of}} these candidate routes, we may simply publish a evaluating task and ask the workers to make the decision. As route recommendation is a real-time task, the response time of waiting for workers may not be tolerable for users who want to plan the trips immediately. However, our preliminary work [26] neglects the power of reusing the answers of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks,</b> which is beneficial to reduce the response time. Therefore, we propose a truth reusing component, which utilizes the existing truths from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks</b> and return <b>the</b> recommended route to users.|$|R
50|$|Last chance: The {{members of}} the losing team in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task</b> face each other with the judges of the show {{deciding}} who cooked the best plate. The loser of this challenge gets eliminated from the competition.|$|E
50|$|Fired: Melissa - For her awful sales pitches, {{failing to}} {{demonstrate}} the sales skills that she claimed to possess, being disrespectful towards Jamie in the boardroom, and for her poor performance as project manager on <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fired: Myles - For {{his very}} poor and indecisive leadership, using a bad theme, {{allowing}} Jordan's mistake to reinvest, his mistake in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task,</b> and because Lord Sugar {{could not find}} an appealing market for his business proposal.|$|E
5000|$|Both Ella Jade and Solomon were {{appointed}} by Lord Sugar as their respective teams' project manager, {{based upon their}} business plans, with Jemma moved over to Summit and warned to step up, as Sugar felt she had contributed little in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sarah - For {{failing to}} use her {{background}} in the task, her mistake {{on one of the}} videos and attempting to blame Lauren for them, lacking confidence from the other candidates, being unable to take criticism, and for her weak performance throughout <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due {{to having}} the best {{performance}} record, Dawna is transferred back to Primarius because Matchstick has 5 players and Primarius has 3 players. Martha decided that the remaining players on Primarius needed help from a strong candidate due to the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task's</b> failure.|$|R
5000|$|Fired: Natasha - For {{contributing}} {{the least}} the task despite her {{experience in the}} hospitality business, losing the energy and enthusiasm she displayed earlier in the process, and for her poor performance as Project Manager on <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fired: Rebecca - For her {{failure to}} {{properly}} double-check that a supermarket had the tagine and soap, failing {{to step up}} as Project Manager as promised after <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task,</b> and for her overall weak track record throughout the process.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{proceeding}} {{to the post}} office, teams needed to have their photograph taken with a blue tuk tuk while wearing the Buddhist clothes from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b> They can then trade this photo for a postcard, which {{they would have to}} mail to Kiev.|$|E
50|$|After six {{levels of}} intense action (lasting about six minutes in total), {{the game is}} over {{and one of the}} pilots is awarded the victory. The amount of points granted is enough to change the score {{accumulated}} during the week in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks,</b> turning <b>the</b> game into the most relevant activity of the whole show.|$|R
50|$|Sent to {{boardroom}}: No final boardroom - despite Bret Michaels actually {{admitting that}} he should be fired, Trump deemed Bill Goldberg to be clearly at fault for the loss, and that given this along with him not adequately defending himself against Donald Trump, Jr.'s accusation that he had been content to stay in the background on <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks,</b> he was <b>the</b> obvious choice to leave.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{outgrowth}} of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> Joint <b>Task</b> Force East, which was planned to be a rotational brigade-sized Army force.|$|R
5000|$|Task Two: Contestants had {{to stage}} a fashion show using their products, {{as well as the}} new design {{concepts}} and patterns produced in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b> Viewers of the fashion show would vote as to which fashion line they preferred. Jennifer received 75% of the audience votes.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{it was not}} explicit, it was {{hinted that}} several others had not made a {{significant}} contribution. In particular, it was implied that Noorul would have been fired had he been brought back, both for taking a backseat on the task, and his awful leadership in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{board members}} {{reserves}} the right {{at times to}} do the following: not allow the losing team leader to determine who has to go, and to let go multiple people who were on probation from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task</b> and performed poorly on the task assigned. The board members also discourage quitting.|$|E
50|$|Sent to {{boardroom}}: No final boardroom - Trump {{felt that}} Stefani had been easily the team's best performer in this task, and that James had done enough in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks</b> to justify being kept on. Despite feeling that Frank hadn't contributed much this task, {{and had been}} difficult to lead, he ultimately considered Tim {{to be responsible for}} coming up with the original idea behind the supplement.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new lifelong learning solution where a single model is trained for {{a sequence of}} tasks. The main challenge that vision systems face {{in this context is}} catastrophic forgetting: as they tend to adapt to the most recently seen task, they lose performance on the tasks that were learned previously. Our method aims at preserving the knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks</b> while learning a new one by using autoencoders. For each task, an under-complete autoencoder is learned, capturing the features that are crucial for its achievement. When a new task is presented to the system, we prevent the reconstructions of the features with these autoencoders from changing, which has the effect of preserving the information on which <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks</b> are mainly relying. At the same time, the features are given space to adjust to the most recent environment as only their projection into a low dimension submanifold is controlled. The proposed system is evaluated on image classification tasks and shows a reduction of forgetting over the state-of-the-ar...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{document}} management systems provide great benefits to society. Software {{tools such as}} word processors are used in generation, storage, and retrieval of documents in specific formats. Using such tools, documents can be edited, printed, or distributed electronically across networks. However, with paper documents, <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>tasks</b> cannot be accomplished by computers, {{so there is a}} need to extract the information in documents to store them in a computerized format.

5000|$|Amy viciously {{attacked}} Steven {{and especially}} David in the boardroom, which ultimately played {{a large part}} in Lord Sugar's decision to fire her over the two boys. Karren also noted {{that she had been}} arguably the most culpable person in the arguments between the two Platinum sub-teams in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although Karren {{felt that}} Vana and Richard {{had been on}} a [...] "charm offensive" [...] with clients, {{due to a lack of}} floor plans and taking the risky move not to use the {{incomplete}} show flat for Versatile's high-end development, she complimented the pair for working much better than they had in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For this task, Lord Sugar had Alana, Jessica and Trishna {{move over}} to Titans, and Karthik, Mukai, Oliver and Paul move over to Nebula, before {{subsequently}} appointing Alana and Oliver as their respective team's project manager, {{due to their}} experience in the food industry. Before they left, both teams were given a warning to not repeat their performance from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Fired: Natalie - For her terrible sales pitches, {{lacking the}} {{necessary}} maturity {{to go into}} business with Lord Sugar, and for her generally weak track record in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> five <b>tasks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Immediately after Melissa Rivers and Brande Roderick {{returned}} from <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>task's</b> boardroom, Trump asked {{all the candidates}} {{to return to the}} boardroom so that he could give them the task briefing. He also asked them to select their project managers there and then; Herschel Walker initially stepped up as KOTU's project manager, but in an unusual move Trump actually overrode the team and selected Joan Rivers to be their project manager, feeling that she would be a better leader for this sort of task than Herschel.|$|R
