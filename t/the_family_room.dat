40|$|This paper aims to typify <b>the</b> {{relation}} between <b>family</b> rooms，pr ivate <b>rooms</b> and 	additional rooms in dwellings designed by professional architects. Main conclusions are 	as follows: 	(1) We find two representative types of modern dwellings. The {{first is the}} type whose 	private movements pass through <b>the</b> <b>family</b> rooms，the second is the type whose private 	movements do not pass through. 	(2) The first type shows a tendency to have no additional room or to have additional 	rooms which are connected to <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>rooms.</b> And，the first type strongly shows to 	have the draughty space which connects <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>rooms</b> to private zone. 	(3) The second type shows a tendency to have relatively many additional rooms which 	are sepated from <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>rooms...</b>|$|R

Their house was richly furnished according to the local taste of the time; the parlor had a Brussels carpet, and heavy chairs of mahogany and hair-cloth; Marcia had a piano there, and since she had come home from school they had made company, as Mrs. Gaylord called it, two or three times for her; but they had held aloof from the festivity, the Squire in his office, and Mrs. Gaylord in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>room</b> where they now sat in unwonted companionship.|$|E
