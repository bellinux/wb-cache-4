5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Jose {{the son of}} Rabbi Judah {{taught that}} three good leaders arose for Israel — Moses, Aaron, and Miriam — and for their sake Providence conferred three good things on Israel — the well that {{accompanied}} the Israelites on their journeys for <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> Miriam, <b>the</b> pillar <b>of</b> cloud for <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> Aaron, and <b>the</b> manna for <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> Moses.

[...] The well returned for <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> Moses and Aaron.

5|$|A day later, {{the owners}} of the {{previous}} bridge — the International Railway Company (IRC) — as well as the Minister of Highways Thomas Baker McQuesten announced intentions to construct a new span; a long political battle ensued for several years over <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> private or public ownership of border crossings. In the end, the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission (NFBC) paid the IRC $615,000 to purchase the right-of-way of the old bridge as well as the rights to construct the new one.|$|E
5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E

5|$|By {{recasting}} {{a difference}} of judgment over <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the early work on the hydrogen bomb project into {{a matter of a}} security risk, Teller effectively damned Oppenheimer in a field where security was necessarily of paramount concern. Teller's testimony thereby rendered Oppenheimer vulnerable to charges by a Congressional aide that he was a Soviet spy, which resulted in the destruction of Oppenheimer's career.|$|E

He often includes gay, bisexual, and Jewish characters in his work. Since the late 1990s, Chabon has written in an increasingly diverse series of styles for varied outlets; he is a notable defender of <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> genre fiction and plot-driven fiction, and, along with novels, he has published screenplays, children's books, comics, and newspaper serials.|$|E

5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the decisions of public authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Raytheon Engineers and Constructors {{proposed}} {{to build and}} operate a Dulles Corridor Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. In January 1999, the Tysons-Dulles Corridor Group (which included Bechtel Corporation and West*Group) offered a competing BRT proposal that would ultimately extend the rail line to Ashburn. These proposals prompted the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> BRT and heavy rail public transit in the corridor.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started to believe in <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, {{the end result of}} the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{discovered}} few {{investment opportunities}} himself (and those that he did, often {{failed to make}} money for the firm). Instead, he focused on analyzing <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> possible deals that others brought forward and on recruiting investors to participate in them once approved. Within Bain Capital, Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm to keep people motivated, often keeping less than ten percent for himself.|$|E
5|$|Scholars today remain {{divided on}} <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the {{electronic}} barrier {{system and the}} efficacy of the bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E

Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, while coming out in front of his classmates; Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her stage mother to sing at a child's birthday party; and Ralph tells of learning about the death of his idol Freddie Prinze.
