60|$|The {{cruelty of}} it, the {{injustice}} of it, the unprecedented hardness of it all! Such were the ideas which presented themselves to him as hour after hour {{he sat in the}} book-room with his eyes fixed on <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> of Jeremy Taylor's sermons. He had done nothing wrong,--so he told himself,--had not even coveted anything that did not belong to him. It was in accordance with his uncle's expressed desire that he had come to Llanfeare, and been introduced to the tenants as their future landlord, and had taken upon himself the place of the heir. Then the old man had announced to him his change of mind; but had not announced it to others, had not declared his altered purpose to the world at Llanfeare, and had not at once sent him back to his London office. Had he done so, that would have been better. There would have been a gross injustice, but {{that would have been the}} end of it, and he would have gone back to his London work unhappy indeed, but with some possibility of life before him. Now it seemed as though any mode of living would be impossible to him. While that fatal paper remained hidden in <b>the</b> <b>fatal</b> <b>volume</b> he could do nothing but sit there and guard it in solitude.|$|R
40|$|Hemorrhage is the {{principal}} cause of death of soldiers on the battlefield. With dispersed troops and future combat operations expecting longer evacuation times and limited availability of medical supplies far-forward, significant improvements in fluid resuscitation will be required if casualties are to be saved. While {{it is known that}} a drop in blood pressure below 40 mm Hg or loss of more than 50 % of <b>the</b> blood <b>volume</b> is <b>fatal,</b> most cells in the body, with the exception of brain cells, can survive for several hours with minimal oxygen or nutrients. Hence, morbidity from blood loss involves factors beside lack of oxygen and nutrients. Little more is known, however, about how the body responds to loss of blood or which organs are most affected. An understanding of the temporal responses of tissues to hemorrhage will lead to improved strategies of intervention before irreversible deterioration occurs. We are using gene expression analysis with microarrays to assess the responses of various organs to severe hemorrhage in rodents to uncover the prominent metabolic pathways involved. Until recently, traditional molecular techniques allowed analysis of only one gene at a time. Throughput was very limited and an accurate picture of the molecules that orchestrate the regulation of health and the dysfunction that occurs during disease or injury has not been possible. The microarray, which allows analysis of changes i...|$|R
60|$|The {{good woman}} hesitated, alarmed at the tone {{in which the}} confessor took up her information; and being {{moreover}} of opinion, that what so good a woman as the Lady of Avenel studied so devoutly, could not be of a tendency actually evil. But borne down by the clamour, exclamations, and something like threats used by Father Philip, she at length brought him <b>the</b> <b>fatal</b> <b>volume.</b> It was easy to do this without suspicion {{on the part of}} the owner, as she lay on her bed exhausted with the fatigue of a long conference with her confessor, and as the small round, or turret closet, in which was the book and her other trifling property, was accessible by another door. Of all her effects the book was the last she would have thought of securing, for of what use or interest could it be in a family who neither read themselves, nor were in the habit of seeing any who did? so that Dame Elspeth had no difficulty in possessing herself of <b>the</b> <b>volume,</b> although her heart all the while accused her of an ungenerous and an inhospitable part towards her friend and inmate. The double power of a landlord and a feudal superior was before her eyes; and to say truth, the boldness, with which she might otherwise have resisted this double authority, was, I grieve to say it, much qualified by the curiosity she entertained, as a daughter of Eve, to have some explanation respecting <b>the</b> mysterious <b>volume</b> which <b>the</b> lady cherished with so much care, yet whose contents she imparted with such caution. For never had Alice of Avenel read them any passage from the book in question until the iron door of the tower was locked, and all possibility of intrusion prevented. Even then she had shown, by the selection of particular passages, that she was more anxious to impress on their minds the principles which <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> contained, than to introduce them to it as a new rule of faith.|$|R
