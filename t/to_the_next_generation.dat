5|$|More {{offspring}} {{are produced}} than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that {{give them an}} advantage over their competitors {{are more likely to}} pass on their traits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation.</b> Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E
5|$|Ruth Archer (also Pritchard) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British BBC Radio 4 soap opera The Archers, played by English actress Felicity Finch. She made her {{debut in the}} 15 July 1987 episode. The character was created and introduced to The Archers as a love interest for established character David Archer (Timothy Bentinck), whose then girlfriend was deemed unsuitable {{for the role of}} mother <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> of the Archer family by the editor of the show Liz Rigbey. Finch was cast as Ruth after a successful audition.|$|E

5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation.</b> However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Mau {{took part}} in the Nā ʻOhana Holo Moana voyage of Hōkūle‘a to Ra‘iātea. Sailing with his son Sesario Sewralur, and Nainoa as sailing master, Mau watched as Nainoa's {{students}} Kaʻau McKenney and Keahi Omai served as navigators. Mau had seen Nainoa succeed in the 1980 and 19851987 voyages; finally, in this 1995 voyage, Mau saw proof that the knowledge was carried forward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation.</b> The canoe landed successfully at Rarotonga, and the voyage resulted in the lifting of a six-centuries-old taboo on voyaging from Ra‘iātea. Hōkūle‘a had sailed from Hawaii with sisterships Hawaiiloa and Makalii; the canoes rendez-voused at Taputapuatea with other voyaging canoes from across Oceania.|$|E
5|$|Paramount Pictures has {{produced}} thirteen Star Trek feature films, {{the most recent}} being released in July 2016. The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of The Original Series; the seventh film, Generations {{was designed as a}} transition from that cast <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Generation</b> television series; the next three films, 8–10, focused completely on the Next Generation cast. Starting with the eleventh film, the movies take place in an alternate timeline with a new cast playing the original series characters. Leonard Nimoy portrays an elderly Spock in these films, providing a physical link to the original timeline. This alternate timeline has been named by CBS, for the computer game Star Trek Online, the Kelvin Timeline.|$|E

5|$|Thorfinn the Mighty was {{a son of}} Sigurd and a {{grandson}} of King Máel Coluim mac Cináeda (Malcolm II of Scotland). Along with Sigurd's other sons he ruled Orkney {{during the first half}} of the 11th century and extended his authority over a small maritime empire stretching from Dublin to Shetland. Thorfinn died around 1065 and his sons Paul and Erlend succeeded him, fighting at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. Paul and Erlend quarreled as adults and this dispute carried on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation.</b> The martyrdom of Magnus Erlendsson, who was killed in April 1116 by his cousin Haakon Paulsson, resulted in the building of St. Magnus Cathedral, still today a dominating feature of Kirkwall.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups, the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages: Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive, and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages: Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script {{of their own and}} all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica. The Kingdom of Alba was overwhelmingly an oral society dominated by Gaelic culture. Our fuller sources for Ireland of the same period suggest that there would have been filidh, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge and culture in Gaelic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation.</b> Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} over recent years in the intergenerational transmission of Western domestic property, and specifically housing inheritance, the line of descent in this transmission has been ignored. We do not know whether domestic property goes disproportionately <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generations(s) of men, or to women, or equally to men and women as the Western cognatic system of descent would dictate. This paper explores the line of descent through an argument proffered by two European sociologists, Delphy and Leonard. They maintain that domestic property goes disproportionately <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generation(s)</b> of men because of the power of patriarchy. However, neither available information, nor data from an Australian case study, confirms this claim. Indeed, there is a suggestion that domestic property goes roughly equally <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>generations</b> of men and women. The implications of these findings are explored...|$|R
