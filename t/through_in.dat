5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio <b>through</b> <b>in</b> case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the SR 125 {{toll road}} started in September 2003; it was {{projected}} {{to open in}} 2006.

In 2005, the road was given the South Bay Expressway name. The South Bay Expressway extended SR 125 southward from SR 54 to Otay Mesa. This toll road was one of four privately financed toll highway projects, including the 91 Express Toll Lanes, that were approved in 1990; it was also one of two toll roads financed and controlled by both public and private sources, although the 91 Express Lanes, the other road, soon became entirely publicly owned. A partnership known as the South Bay Expressway operated the road, while an Australian company, Maquarie Group Ltd., handled financial and construction matters.|$|E

5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line.

Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get <b>through.</b> <b>In</b> fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as mayor, Galván {{received}} death threats from organized crime. Nuevo Laredo has been the battleground among Mexico's drug trafficking organizations given its proximity to the U.SMexico border and Interstate 35, a lucrative route {{where most of the}} cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine that reaches the United States are smuggled <b>through.</b> <b>In</b> May 2012, alleged organized crime members left the headless corpses of 14 men inside a vehicle near the Nuevo Laredo city hall. Alongside the corpses was a written message reportedly from the Sinaloa Cartel that accused Galván and other city officials of working for Los Zetas (such accusations between gangsters and local officials are common in Mexico). In June 2012, a car bomb detonated outside the Nuevo Laredo city hall at Galván's parking area, injuring several bystanders. On February 2013, the Nuevo Laredo police chief Roberto Alejandro Balmori Garza was kidnapped and his two brothers were found dead. He had been appointed by Galván as head of the police in 2011 following the murder of Manuel Farfán Carriola, the former police chief of Nuevo Laredo.|$|E

5|$|During the 1890s Saint-Saëns {{spent much}} time on holiday, {{travelling}} overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before. A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell <b>through</b> <b>in</b> 1893. He wrote one opera, the comedy Phryné (1893), and together with Paul Dukas helped to complete Frédégonde (1895) an opera left unfinished by Ernest Guiraud, who died in 1892. Phryné was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring grand opera. His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement fantasia Africa (1891) and his Fifth ("Egyptian") Piano Concerto, which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846. Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support.|$|E
5|$|Enforcing the {{prohibition}} on liquor began {{to cause the}} force increasing problems. The liquor laws had been designed to prevent the First Nations from drinking alcohol, but their terms also applied to the increasing numbers of white settlers in the late 1880s. Although some temperance groups applauded the measures, most settlers opposed them. Special permits to import alcohol for personal consumption could be granted, but these were not issued impartially, adding to the general resentment. Many members of the force drank alcohol themselves, including liquor confiscated from smugglers, and police beer canteens were established to provide members of the force a legal alternative. Settlers also began to routinely evade the laws in the larger towns, despite mounted police searches, the deployment of undercover officers, and large fines being imposed by the courts. Public hostility towards the force grew and the police soon found themselves almost entirely occupied in attempting to enforce the unpopular laws. Legal changes were pushed <b>through</b> <b>in</b> 1892, removing prohibition and allowing the licensing of public bars; the new law was enforced by local town inspectors, removing most of the force's responsibility for the problem.|$|E

50|$|United States {{involvement}} in World War I {{had a significant}} effect on the demographics of both Tacoma and its school system. The 1914 opening of the Panama Canal, and the 1917 establishment of Fort Lewis Air Force Base (Now Joint Base Lewis-McChord) resulted in a significant population increase in Tacoma and its surrounding areas. The Panama Canal succeeded in expanding business and industry associated with the Port of Tacoma, while Fort Lewis Air Force Base quickly became the largest in the United States at the time, consisting of 37,000 soldiers. From 1915 to 1920, enrollment in Tacoma Public Schools had rose from 14,211 to 18,023 (a 22% increase). To address the rapid growth of student population, the district school board debated between three possible educational models, all of which would {{have an effect on the}} future construction of schools. The models included the 8-4 system, the 6-6 system, and the 6-3-3 system. The 8-4 system, which was the typical model for schools prior to World War I, had grades one <b>through</b> eight <b>in</b> elementary schools with grades nine <b>through</b> 12 <b>in</b> high schools. The proposed 6-6 system advocated for grades one <b>through</b> six <b>in</b> elementary school, with grades seven <b>through</b> 12 <b>in</b> high school. The 6-3-3 system, which was eventually adopted, advocated for grades one <b>through</b> six <b>in</b> elementary school, grades seven <b>through</b> nine <b>in</b> middle school, and grades 10 <b>through</b> 12 <b>in</b> high school.|$|R
