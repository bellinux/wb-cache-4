25|$|Harriman, who {{controlled}} the powerful Southern Pacific Railroad, {{was concerned with}} the competition that these new electric lines gave his steam railroad traffic, and had been prodding Huntington for joint ownership of the lines but Huntington refused to negotiate. In early 1903, Harriman proposed a franchise plan with three-cent fare plan to the Los Angeles City Council, a plan which, if accepted, would have handicapped the other railways severely. Huntington countered with a <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> which gave the rider 500 miles of travel for $6.25, which undercut the Harriman strategy. The Council vetoed the franchise idea, unable to believe adequate service could be provided for such a low fare. Then, on April 14, 1903, Harriman bought Hook’s Los Angeles Traction Company, which ran lines within the downtown area and, through its California Pacific subsidiary, was constructing a line from Los Angeles to San Pedro.|$|E

For the cover of the 1922 book Arba'ah Teyashim (Four Billy Goats; [...] ), he shows an arrangement of Hebrew letters as architectural elements in a dynamic design that mirrors his contemporary Proun typography.

5000|$|SOCOG {{argued that}} the {{provision}} of the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> in braille was an unjustifiable hardship under section 24 (2). Using Section 24 [...] and section 11 of DDA 1992, the commissioner found that despite the small proportion of blind persons in the community who use Braille, SOCOG had the financial capacity to bear the additional cost {{as the cost of}} 200 braille copies of the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> would be $17,250.00 in comparison to the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> printing and distribution expenditure noted in SOCOG's budget which was $7.18 million.|$|E
5000|$|The ACC {{implemented}} a new ticket policy in hopes {{to sell out}} more of the Greensboro Coliseum's approximately 23,000 seats. [...] In previous years, each school was allotted {{an equal number of}} <b>ticket</b> <b>books</b> for distribution. This left large numbers of tickets unsold as some schools, such as Boston College, Miami, and Florida State, do not have large numbers of fans who make the trip to Greensboro for the tournament. In response, the ACC issued more <b>ticket</b> <b>books</b> to schools who traditionally sold the majority of their <b>ticket</b> <b>books.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{failing to}} provide the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> in braille, the Commissioner found that SOCOG {{breached}} section 24 of the Act. SOCOG argued that the delivery of {{the information in the}} <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> did not constitute the provision of services within the meaningof section 24. The Commissioner did not accept that argument as the services provided by SOCOG fell inside the definition stated in section 4, in which SOCOG was providing tickets to sessions at the 2000 Olympics where SOCOG cannot refuse as the terms of conditions for the tickets was the same for Maguire as for any sighted person and that the ticketing process was integral to gaining a ticket to attend and to enjoy the entertainment provided by SOCOG. In providing the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> in print and not in braille meant that Maguire was denied access to the <b>ticket</b> <b>book,</b> the consequential services provided by SOCOG and accordingly, Maguire was denied the opportunity to make a valid application for tickets to the Olympic games.|$|E

50|$|The {{commissioner}} {{found that}} SOCOG in not providing the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> in braille treated Maguire less favourably than persons without the disability {{which is also}} a breach of section 6.|$|E
50|$|Maguire {{initially}} {{tried to}} have the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> read aloud {{to him by his}} sister, but the level of detail and cross-referencing required in this process was onerous and the attempt was abandoned after several hours. Maguire then enquired about obtaining a braille version of the <b>ticket</b> <b>book.</b> SOCOG indicated a braille version would be published but this did not occur. On 7 June 1999 Maguire was contacted by SOCOG to advise that the book would not be printed in braille as the cost was considered too high given the likely small number of braille-literate users.|$|E

50|$|Bruce Lindsay Maguire (b 1957) a small {{business}} owner from Baulkham Hills, New South Wales, was born totally blind and without sight or light perception. On 31 May 1999 Maguire sought to purchase tickets {{for himself and his}} family for the Sydney Olympic Games. At the time tickets were only available via an application form in a <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> issued by the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG).|$|E

50|$|The {{commissioner}} {{felt that}} unless Maguire could {{have access to}} the information {{in order to make a}} valid application, he was treated less favourably because of his blindness than a sighted person. SOCOG contested the charge of less favourable treatment by outlining that Maguire could have got a sighted person to read the document for him, and that Maguire had access to a phone helpline and to an electronic format of the booklet. The commissioner dismissed those arguments. Reading the booklet to Maguire would have meant an incomprehensible oral presentation of tabulations, a great feat of memory, a requirement to find a time of convenience and hours of explanations was considered by the commissioner to be treating Maguire less favourably than the sighted person who could access the material without assistance at his or her leisure, capable of referencing and cross-referencing from page to page and thereby ensuring the completion not only of a valid application complete with alternatives that reflected in all respect the final decided choices of That person. The commission raises the question as to how a person in the position of Maguire could acquire any primary information in the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> which could then be perfected or developed by the officer in the course of a telephone conversation. The dilemma indicated by the commissioner was that if the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> was produced in braille, Maguire would have not required the assistance of the helpline. The vital information in the <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> was presented in tabular form in which the line of information scrolled off the right-hand edge of the screen, making it difficult for Maguire to comprehend when the material was presented in Braille form on the refreshable braille pad.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, the <b>ticket</b> <b>booked</b> on the app had to {{be printed}} from the ATVMs. This step was found tedious by the commuters, and was criticised. Later, in July 2015, an update for the app was launched, which made e-tickets acceptable. The update also brought {{technical}} changes, like, [...] the <b>tickets</b> could be <b>booked</b> only within a radius of 30m to 5km of the origin station, and not from the platform.

50|$|Monk finds Manny {{standing}} on a scaffold, preparing {{to work on a}} window-washing job. Monk explains what happened. Manny didn’t spot the Pick Axe Killer - Officer DiMarco did. Monk figured this out when he found DiMarco’s <b>ticket</b> <b>book</b> and noticed that he had written but never submitted a parking ticket for the killer's car. DiMarco had found the Pick Axe Killer, but as a police officer, he couldn’t collect the reward. He wanted the reward, and recruited an old friend of his, Manny Almonov, to identify the killer. Manny made up a story, and took credit for the tip. They agreed to split the reward money later, but Manny got greedy and decided to kill DiMarco instead.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 June 1999, Maguire made a {{complaint}} {{to the human}} rights and equal opportunity commission (HREOC), alleging that the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) had discriminated against {{him as a person}} disabled, in contravention of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 [...] in three aspects: the failure to provide braille copies of the information required to order Olympic Games tickets; the failure to provide braille copies of theOlympic Games souvenir programme; and the failure to provide a website which was accessible to Maguire.
