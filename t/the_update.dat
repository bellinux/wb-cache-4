5|$|The time-reversed {{dynamics}} of the automaton can be described by another cellular automaton. Clearly, {{for this to be}} possible, <b>the</b> <b>update</b> rule must be bijective. In the other direction, if <b>the</b> <b>update</b> rule is bijective, then it has an inverse function that is also bijective. This inverse function must be a cellular automaton rule.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>update</b> rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration.

5|$|Day of Defeat: Source has {{undergone}} several updates. These updates have consisted of gameplay tweaks, maps and graphical effects. The first new level {{was released on}} November 30, 2005, and was followed on January 25, 2006 by another map, used as a demonstration for the Source engine's abilities in rendering snow and ice. A major update was announced on June 22, 2006, adding the detonation game mode, various gameplay tweaks and two further maps to accommodate the new game mode. <b>The</b> <b>update</b> was released on June 28, 2006. On April 26, 2007, a group of maps produced by the game's community, entitled the Community Assembled Map Pack (CAMP1), was released. Consisting of three maps, the pack was created with the assistance and support of Valve. This was followed by CAMP2 on July 26, 2007, a pack which consisted of a further five maps. On May 23, 2008, Valve announced another major update to Day of Defeat: Source, this time giving the game support for the company's new Steamworks programmer. <b>The</b> <b>update</b> is open to any owners of Day of Defeat: Source. Along with various gameplay tweaks, <b>the</b> <b>update</b> moves the game to the Source engine version used with The Orange Box, allowing the game to utilize particle effects, as well as adding a map based on a long-standing custom map for Day of Defeat and 54 achievement awards for players completing certain tasks.|$|E
