A total of 124 children were recruited and grouped according to gestational age: 37 weeks or more (n = 52), 34 to 36 weeks (n = 40), and less than 34 weeks (n = 32). Study nurses followed up children 24 hours after each vaccination to record temperature, redness, and swelling at the injection site and any systemic symptoms. Proportions of children experiencing adverse events did not differ between groups. Blood samples were obtained six weeks after the vaccination course at which time all children had protective levels of diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>antitoxins.</b> Geometric mean antibody titres (95 % confidence interval) to pertussis toxin were 2754 (2042 to 3715), 5495 (4074 to 7413), and 3690 (2951 to 4677), to filamentous haemagglutinin were 541 (282 to 1023), 951 (537 to 1698), and 614 (426 to 1023), and to agglutinogens 2 and 3 were 12, 106 (6918 to 21, 380), 21, 330 (13, 183 to 34, 674), and 22, 387 (15, 136 to 33, 113) in children born at a gestational age of less than 34 weeks, 34 to 36 weeks, and 37 weeks or more respectively.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{screening}} of tetanus and diphtheria antibodies in serum using anatoxin (inactivated toxin) instead of toxin was developed {{as an alternative}} to the in vivo toxin neutralization assay based on the toxin-binding inhibition test (TOBI test). In this study, the serum titers (values between 1. 0 and 19. 5 IU) measured by a modified TOBI test (Modi-TOBI test) and toxin neutralization assays were correlated (P < 0. 0001). Titers of tetanus or diphtheria antibodies were evaluated in serum samples from guinea pigs immunized with tetanus toxoid, diphtheria-tetanus or triple vaccine. For the Modi-TOBI test, after blocking the microtiter plates, standard <b>tetanus</b> or diphtheria <b>antitoxin</b> and different concentrations of guinea pig sera were incubated with the respective anatoxin. Twelve hours later, these samples were transferred to a plate previously coated with <b>tetanus</b> or diphtheria <b>antitoxin</b> to bind the remaining anatoxin. The anatoxin was then detected using a peroxidase-labeled <b>tetanus</b> or diphtheria <b>antitoxin.</b> Serum titers were calculated using a linear regression plot of the results for the corresponding standard antitoxin. For the toxin neutralization assay, L+/ 10 / 50 doses of either toxin combined with different concentrations of serum samples were inoculated into mice for anti-tetanus detection, or in guinea pigs for anti-diphtheria detection. Both assays were suitable for determining wide ranges of antitoxin levels. The linear regression plots showed high correlation coefficients for tetanus (r² = 0. 95, P < 0. 0001) and for diphtheria (r² = 0. 93, P < 0. 0001) between the in vitro and the in vivo assays.

These molecules could be the secretory counterpart of the natural Abs in serum that were previously shown by our laboratory to be polyreactive to autoantigens. Significant levels of S-IgA Abs to human actin, myosin, tubulin, and spectrin were detected in 10 saliva and 8 colostrum samples from normal subjects. Computer-assisted analysis of immunoblots of extracts from human muscles showed these Abs to react with a large number of autoantigens. Their polyreactivity was confirmed by cross-inhibition and by immunoblotting studies of affinity-purified natural Abs, assayed against a large variety of surface or secreted antigens from Streptococcus pyogenes. The thiocyanate elution method showed that functional affinities of some natural Abs can be of the same order of magnitude as those of <b>tetanus</b> vaccine <b>antitoxins.</b> Moreover, nonimmune binding of these natural Abs to the gut protein Fv (Fv-fragment binding protein) can enhance their effector functions. This demonstrates that human secretions contain polyreactive auto-Abs which can also react with pathogens. These secretory Abs of "skeleton key" specificities are possibly produced by a primordial B- 1 -cell-associated immune system and can be involved in a plurispecific mucosal protection against pathogens, irrespective of the conventional immune response...|$|R
5000|$|The {{birth of}} active {{immunotherapy}} {{may have begun}} with Mithridates VI of Pontus. To induce active immunity for snake venom, he recommended using a method similar to modern toxoid serum therapy, by drinking the blood of animals which fed on venomous snakes. According to Jean de Maleissye, Mithridates assumed that animals feeding on venomous snakes acquired some detoxifying property in their bodies, and their blood must contain attenuated or transformed components of the snake venom. The action of those components might be strengthening the body to resist against the venom instead of exerting toxic effect. Mithridates reasoned that, by drinking the blood of these animals, he could acquire the similar resistance to the snake venom as the animals feeding on the snakes. [...] Similarly, he sought to harden himself against poison, and took daily sub-lethal doses to build tolerance. Mithridates is also said to have fashioned a 'universal antidote' {{to protect him from}} all earthly poisons. [...] For nearly 2000 years, poisons were thought to be the proximate cause of disease, and a complicated mixture of ingredients, called Mithridate, was used to cure poisoning during the Renaissance. An updated version of this cure, Theriacum Andromachi, was used well into the 19th century.In 1888 Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin isolated diphtheria toxin, and following the 1890 discovery by Behring and Kitasato of antitoxin based immunity to diphtheria and <b>tetanus,</b> the <b>antitoxin</b> became the first major success of modern therapeutic Immunology.|$|R

40|$|As far as is known, the {{injection}} of any antige n into the rabbit by any route may {{give rise to}} antibodies which are of the so called precipitin type.

No "prezone " or inhibition of precipitation in the region of antibody excess is observed. While antibodies to specific carbohydrates may be elicited in the horse or rabbit by intravenous injections of type-specific pneumococci, it is common experience that <b>tetanus</b> or diphtheria <b>antitoxins</b> are produced in the horse in suflficient amounts only in response to subcutaneous injection. These antitoxins flocculate with the antigen, but the precipitation differs from the precipitin type in that it is confined to a relatively narrow zone, inhibition being observed with excess of either antibody or antigen (ef. 3, 4).

40|$|The {{experiments}} of {{the preceding}} communication showed that the therapeutic action of antipneumococcic serum depends to a considerable extent upon a certain non-antibacterial factor. The experiments reported in the present communication had two main objects; the first {{was to determine the}} distribution of the non-antibacterial factor among the various protein fractions of the serum, and incidentally to correlate this property of the factor with that of certain known antibodies, as well as to learn whether or not the protein fractions commonly excluded from refined preparations of antipneumococcic serum, have any therapeutic value; the second was to determine the rôle of the non-antibacterial factor in the therapy of pneumococcus infection, as exemplified by the experimental, dermal, pneumococcus infection in rabbits. To determine the distribution of the non-antibacterial factor, Type I antipneumococcic serum was fractionated with (NH 4) 2 SO 4, and the antibacterial bodies were absorbed by concentrated suspensions of heat-killed pneumococci. The activity of the non-antibacterial factor in the different protein fractions was then tested for by adding varying amounts of the absorbed supernatant liquids to a certain constant, subeffective dose of serum. Even though the method of titration has certain inherent faults it was possible to ascertain that the non-antibacterial factor was apparently associated with all the globulin fractions to a similar degree, and to a certain extent with the albumen as well. In this respect the non-antibacterial factor resembles neither the antibacterial bodies of antipneumococcic serum, nor, for example, the known diphtheria or <b>tetanus</b> <b>antitoxins.</b> The determination of the relative importance of the antibacterial and non-antibacterial factors in the therapy of pneumococcus infection in rabbits, was rendered possible {{by the fact that the}} various globulin fractions differ in their relative content of the two factors. Thus whereas the water-insoluble fraction of the globulin, precipitated when the saturation of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 is raised from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, contains about 90 per cent of the antibacterial (mouse protective) bodies, it apparently contains no more of the non-antibacterial factor than the water-soluble fraction. The minimal effective doses as well as the mouse protective unit content of the different fractions were determined. Before the tests were performed, it seemed that if the therapeutic effect of a given dose were to depend chiefly upon its content of mouse protective antibody, the amounts required for 1 M. E. D. would be determined by the number of mouse protective units it contained; on the other hand, if it depended primarily on the non-antibacterial factor, one would expect the amounts required for 1 M. E. D. to be of approximately the same volume. Actually the therapeutic effect was found not to depend entirely upon either factor, alone; the M. E. D. 's varied both in volume and m. p. u. content, the absolute concentration of either factor being inconstant and almost proportional to the relative concentration of the other. Thus a relative abundance of non-antibacterial factor made up for a scarcity of mouse protective antibody (as in the water-soluble globulin), and vice versa (as in the water-insoluble globulin). It appears, therefore, that when a relatively larger amount of antibacterial bodies are acting, less of the non-antibacterial factor is necessary; conversely, when more of the non-antibacterial factor is available, less of the antibacterial bodies are necessary. The last experiment dealt with the practical question as to whether any protein fraction or combination of fractions is as good a therapeutic agent as the whole, unrefined serum from which it was derived. Two considerations were in mind in making the comparison; one had to do with the quantitative recovery of potency, the other with the qualitative effect of the various fractions as regards the lesion, course, and duration of the experimental disease. The results may be summarized as follows: (a) the total globulin was not only as good, but in this instance, definitely better than the original serum; (b) the total water-insoluble globulin, although almost as potent as the original serum, was qualitatively and quantitatively less effective than the total globulin; (c) the removal of the 30 per cent (NH 4) 2 SO 4 fraction not only diminished the potency of the remaining globulin to a considerable extent (at least 25 per cent), but also seems to have disturbed a certain equilibrium, which resulted in an undesirable zone phenomenon. As a result of this zone phenomenon, which, it is important to note, was not observed in the agglutination or mouse protection tests on the same fractions, the range of effective dosage is very narrowly limited. Although the results of agglutination tests correlated well with those of the mouse protection tests, both of these showed no parallelism with the therapeutic effects of the various fractions on the experimental, dermal, pneumococcus infection in rabbits...|$|R
