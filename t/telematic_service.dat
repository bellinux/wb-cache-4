40|$|Transport {{telematic}} systems, {{also known}} as intelligent transportation systems, can be expensive to implement but the services they provide may offer substantial benefits. However, what services the system can provide depends on the architectural choices made, which also affects {{the cost of the}} system. We propose an optimization model to support a more informed decision before investing in a multiple service transport telematic system. The model evaluates the possible choices of services and architectures, and aims to maximize the total net societal benefit. We argue that the optimization model can provide support for strategic decisions by highlighting the consequences of adopting different system architectures, including both societal value and cost.

In this context information networking has a central role, and telecommunications service engineering emerges as an important new scientific discipline. This article examines important issues that underpin the creation of telematic services in a highly competitive environment of service provisioning. The starting point is the proposal of a telecommunications service engineering framework consisting of a service development methodology, a service creation environment, and a service support environment, that considers telematic services as distributed object-oriented applications operating on distributed object platforms. Then the article focuses on the presentation and examination of a complete methodology for the development of telematic services, that "covers" in a systematic and structured manner the entire service creation process.

The aim of the application is to offer high quality care to users of health services over inexpensive communication pathways, using Internet-based, interactive communication tools, like remote access to medical records and transmission of multimedia information. The XML technology was employed to achieve customised views on patient data, according to the access rights of different user profiles. Strict security and access control policy were implemented to ensure secure transmission of medical data through the Internet. The system was designed to collaborate with existing clinical patient record systems and to be adjustable to different medical applications. Current implementations include the fields of Oncology, Lupus Erythrematosis, Obstetrics and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease. The results of the pilot operation with oncological patients in Greece were encouraging, so that the refining {{of the system and}} its expansion to a large number of patients is already in progress.

Moreover, this dissertation aims to help legislature to foresee the future possible payment methods other than mobile payment service and to bring up key issues that the legislature shall be concerned of and included in the future legislation or amendment. Moreover, this dissertation provides a review and comparison in legislative intent in the European Union and the United States. By examining regulations in the EU, the US and the current regulations of stored-value card and electronic monetary card in Taiwan, significant legal objectives relating to the mobile payment is being summarized.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{assessment}} of telematic systems for road freight transport from a planning perspective. The aim is to support strategic decisions related to architectural choices for such systems, with the possibility to achieve synergies by supporting multiple <b>telematic</b> <b>services.</b> The past decade has witnessed enormous growth in cargo volumes resulting in increasing demand for transport capacity. To match this increasing demand only with expansion of infrastructure, e. g. road and vehicles, {{does not seem to}} be a sustainable strategy. One of the few approaches with the potential to improve the use of current transport capacity is the integrated use of modern information and communication technology, otherwise known as telematic systems for road transport, an important component within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). This type of systems can deliver multiple services that can be used to improve the efficiency and safety of road freight transport. However, attempts to unleash the potential of telematic systems and make maximum possible use of the available transport capacity have been hindered by several challenges ranging from planning and design to development and deployment. Considering the large scope of possible <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> that can potentially be deployed in road freight transport, this thesis suggests a framework in order to enable structured assessment of telematic systems. Based on the suggested framework, a set of potential transport <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> are identified and a method for quantifying the value of the services to society is developed. The suggested method takes into account the expected impact on different transportation challenges, such as accidents, fuel consumption, and infrastructure maintenance. Quantitative methods are provided for studying the value of services sharing a common infrastructure. Using quantified benefits of services and costs of various functionalities required by <b>telematic</b> <b>services,</b> the concept of a multi-service architecture is investigated using optimization methods, which handles the multi-dimensional relations between different services that are otherwise difficult to analyze with traditional cost-benefit analysis. The analyses show which <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> can be achieved with different approaches, such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, etc. Although multi-service architectures are promising, several challenges need to be overcome, including security, service quality, privacy, and business models. The knowledge gained from the work presented in this thesis can be valuable for different stakeholders, such as governments, service providers, and transport service users, in fostering the planning, design, development, and deployment of telematic systems in transport...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent Truck Parking (ITP) {{involves}} {{efficient management}} of information {{as a tool}} for addressing some of the problems related to truck parking, such as, the inability to navigate to, or reserve a parking space. Different <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> (ITP core services) may be required to address different stakeholder needs, e. g., a navigation service for finding the way to a truck parking area, and a reservation service for assuring the availability of a parking space when in the parking area. In addition to ITP core services, there are several other <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> that address transport problems in general. If the synergies of different services are taken into account during design and deployment of <b>telematic</b> <b>services,</b> cost reduction may be achieved through functionality sharing.
