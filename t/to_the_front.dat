5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than {{the time to}} travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As {{a result of its}} proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients.
