25|$|The Range Rover used {{permanent}} four-wheel drive, {{rather than}} the switchable rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> for off-road use. Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 <b>transfer</b> <b>box.</b> The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual differential lock (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the layshaft and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed synchro hub for third and fourth gear and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In popular {{symmetric}} ciphers, S-box substitution is {{the core}} operation that dominates executions of cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, a method of application-specific instruction-set extension is used for accelerating the key operation in symmetric cryptography. Two instructions for S-box access are designed by constructing a novel flexible on-chip parallel substitution <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> that consists of multiple lookup tables and a post-processing module. The <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> is integrated into the 32 -bit configurable Leon 2 processor. Configuration of Leon 2 is presented. Implementing this extended processor core on Virtex-II XC 2 V 3000 FPGA shows that the parallel substitution <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> uses very small amount of hardware resources (1 KB of memory and some logic circuits). Evaluation {{of the performance of}} S-box access instructions for AES is conducted according to Amdahl Law, and the results show that overall speedup of greater than 2 can be achieved. Benefits for other symmetric ciphers using S-box substitution as their core operation are accordingly expected...|$|R

The track surface in the <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> (2) has indentations conforming to the pallet but to a height less than the pallet standing height, and the handler (3) has a vehicle transporter between <b>transfer</b> and parking <b>boxes</b> designed as a lift or beam hoist complete with flap-down box-facing end ramps. The transporter moves towards the parking boxes and can be rotated round its vertical axis. Below the track and to the sides, the transporter has chain load conveyors which can move in vehicle length sense relative the transporter track surface, and the transporter side facing the bearing system can be flapped down or swung away. Empty pallets can be taken off to a storage compartment arranged below the transporter level or in the <b>transfer</b> <b>box.</b> USE - Parking garages.

50|$|Saracen used {{an almost}} {{identical}} chassis and drivetrain to Saladin, although {{the engine was}} relocated from the rear {{to the front of}} the vehicle. The transmission used a 5-speed Wilson preselector gearbox with a fluid flywheel. Reverse gear was provided within the <b>transfer</b> <b>box,</b> allowing all five gears in either direction. The centre bevel boxes were included within the <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> housing and had a slight overdrive to the drive shafts fore and aft. Each wheel station used double wishbones and torsion bars for suspension with four (three on the centre stations) shock absorbers. Steering was applied to the centre wheels and a lever arrangement moved the front wheels by a proportionately larger amount.|$|R

5000|$|The gearbox {{had five}} ratios with {{synchromesh}} on all gears. A conventional Borg & Beck clutch with mechanical linkage was used and {{drive from the}} gearbox was by shaft to the rear combined <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> and differential assembly which incorporated reverse gear, thereby allowing five reverse gears also, and then by a long shaft to the front differential which incorporated a simple dog clutch to enable four-wheel drive when required. A conventional separate transfer case was not possible due to the cruciform layout of the vehicle chassis which placed the junction of the cruciform where the <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> would reside on a conventional ladder-type chassis. Bendix [...] "Tracta" [...] type constant velocity joints were fitted at all wheel stations. All transmission assemblies were sealed against the ingress of water.|$|R

50|$|Making Tracks is the {{cooperative}} program between the NWTF and state, federal and provincial wildlife agencies to restore wild turkeys to all suitable habitat in North America. The NWTF works with wildlife agencies coordinating the trap and transfer of wild turkeys. Wild turkey populations {{have more than}} doubled since 1990. In areas where they are abundant, wild turkeys are trapped via nets propelled or dropped over a feeding flock. Trapped birds are individually placed in specialized transport boxes, and then released in areas of suitable habitat with few or no wild turkeys. The NWTF routinely provides trapping equipment, <b>transfer</b> <b>boxes</b> and helps coordinate wild turkey transfers between states, provinces and nations. Since the 1950s, state and provincial wildlife agencies have moved more than 192,000 wild turkeys into suitable habitat across North America. The NWTF, founded in 1973, helped accelerate those efforts by providing trapping equipment, <b>transfer</b> <b>boxes,</b> funding and volunteers. Currently, there are more than 7 million wild turkeys throughout North America.|$|R
