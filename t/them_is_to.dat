5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> steer back onto the straight path.|$|E

25|$|While {{significantly}} {{resistant to}} heat and radiation, endospores can {{be destroyed by burning}} or by autoclaving at a temperature exceeding {{the boiling point}} of water, 100°C. Endospores are able to survive at 100°C for hours, although the longer the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E
25|$|Nor may the Essenes be classed {{among the}} order of ascetics. While some of their institutions, notably celibacy, appear to {{lend support to the}} theory that would class them as such, their {{fundamental}} doctrines show no connection with the pessimism that is the essential factor in Asceticism. They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They stood for a universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to construe from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be found a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.|$|E

500|$|Most street {{newspapers}} operate {{by selling}} the papers to homeless vendors {{for a fraction}} of the retail price (usually between 10% and 50%), after which the vendors sell the papers for the retail price and retain all the proceeds from street sales. The income vendors earn from sales is intended to help them [...] "get back on their feet". The purpose of requiring vendors to purchase papers up front and earn back the money by selling <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> help them develop skills in financial management. Vendors for most newspapers are identifiable by badges or messenger bags. Many newspapers require that vendors sign a code of conduct or otherwise [...] "clean up their act".|$|E

[...] The move was attacked by anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion. [...] Griffin said [...] "I am coming up because I was invited by the students at the university because they have a debate on an intelligent subject on which I have something to say. The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform." [...] The society withdrew the invitation before the event was to take place.|$|E

The thaw in relations can be taken to begin with Ronald Reagan's January 16, 1984 speech declaring that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had [...] "common interests and the foremost among <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> avoid war and reduce the level of arms" [...] in which he added that [...] "I support a zero option for all nuclear arms." [...] While the speech was commonly seen as propaganda, Lawrence S. Wittner, professor of History at the State University of New York - Albany says of it that [...] "a number of officials--including its writer, Jack Matlock Jr.--have contended that {{it was meant to be}} taken seriously by Soviet leaders."

During one scene, while on hold during a {{telephone}} call, Tom sings badly out of tune to the hold music of [...] "Forever Young", by the German synthpop group Alphaville. At one point, Tom describes the nicknames he has for various foods, and describes sandwiches as [...] "sammies, sandoozles or Adam Sandlers", the latter of which refers to the comedian and actor Adam Sandler. Andy tells Chris his favorite food is Skittles sandwiched between two Starburst, which he calls [...] "Andy's Mouth Surprise". When Leslie describes her ideal date as a dark and mysterious man who can play the organ, Ann says she believes Leslie is describing the title character from The Phantom of the Opera, {{a story about a}} deformed man who haunts an opera hall.|$|E
500|$|Next was {{the gate}} known in Turkish as Değirmen Kapı ("Mill Gate"), whose Byzantine name is unknown. Close by {{and to its}} north stood the great Tower of Mangana, which was {{intended}} to hold the {{one end of the}} chain, planned (but probably never actually installed) by Manuel I Komnenos to close off the Bosphorus, the other end being at a tower erected on the island of the modern Maiden's Tower (Kız Kulesi) off Chrysopolis (modern Üsküdar), known as Damalis (Δάμαλις) or Arkla (...) in Byzantine times. The next gate is now known as the Demirkapı ("Iron Gate"), and is an Ottoman-era structure. A Greek name is not known, and it is not known whether a gate stood there in Byzantine times. Behind these two gates extended the quarter of the Mangana (Μάγγανα, [...] "Arsenal"), with its numerous monasteries, the most famous of which were those of St. George of Mangana, the Church of Christ Philanthropos, and of the Theotokos Hodegetria, and the Palace of Mangana. Four small posterns, in two pairs of two, stand at the southern edge of the Mangana quarter, and probably serviced the numerous churches. The names, but not the identity, of two of them have been recorded, the Postern of St. Lazarus ( [...] , pylis tou hagiou Lazarou), and the Small Gate of the Hodegetria ( [...] , mikra pylē tēs Hodēgētrias), both named after the respective monasteries located near them.
