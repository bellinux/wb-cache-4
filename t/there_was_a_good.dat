5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlap between the writers of Unknown and Astounding, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter {{has argued that the}} spectrum of fantastic fiction from Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as Wonder Stories were more like the works of Edgar Allan Poe than they were tales of scientific imagination.|$|E
5|$|One unusual {{defensive}} weapon was in use at Kenley on 18 August; the parachute-and-cable. Located {{on the north}} side of the airfield at 18 metre (60 foot) intervals, these were fired vertically by a rocket in salvoes of nine or more. As enemy aircraft came in at low-altitude, the parachute deployed and held a 145-metre (480 foot) long steel cable from an altitude of 180 metres (600 feet). If struck by an aircraft, a second parachute deployed and tangled the device around the victim. If the cable was picked up on the wing, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance that the aircraft would go down out of control. This device had not been used before 18 August 1940. Also available were barrage balloons with cutting cables capable of tearing off bombers' wings.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of {{interest}} in the 2004 transit as scientists attempted to measure the pattern of light dimming as Venus blocked out some of the Sun's light, in order to refine techniques that they hope to use in searching for extrasolar planets. Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing. Measuring light intensity {{during the course of a}} transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets. However, extremely precise measurement is needed: for example, the transit of Venus causes the amount of light received from the Sun to drop by a fraction of 0.001 (that is, to 99.9% of its nominal value), and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny.|$|E

5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E

25|$|Speaking {{about his}} {{activities}} in popularizing science, Sagan {{said that there}} were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state. Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance of having more public supporters.

25|$|He {{came from}} a working-class {{background}} in the coal mining districts around Nottingham, and made his first-class debut with Nottinghamshire against Gloucestershire in 1927. A few good performances saw Voce keep his place despite the strength and variety of Nottinghamshire's bowling.

Thus, when he changed to a faster pace the following year <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of criticism, but, in 1929, Voce returned to his slower style with great success {{in a number of}} games on sticky wickets, notably against Northamptonshire when he took fourteen wickets for 43 runs.|$|E

25|$|Davies {{was made}} the chief writer and Executive Producer {{of the new}} series (called Series One instead of {{continuing}} the numbering with Season 27, although the narrative thread continued from the old series rather than starting afresh), and other writers included Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat, Paul Cornell and Rob Shearman. The Producer was Phil Collinson and the other Executive Producers were Mal Young (although he subsequently left the BBC midway through production {{at the end of}} 2004), and BBC Wales Head of Drama, Julie Gardner. A new arrangement of the theme tune was composed by Murray Gold. Gardner later commented that the choice of Cardiff as the base for filming the series {{was the result of a}} combination of factors. She and Davies, who had worked together on the BBC drama series Casanova starring David Tennant, were both from Wales; the BBC was looking to move more of its productions away from London; and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> variety of filming locations in the area.|$|E
25|$|The Greenside smelt mill {{was built}} in 182728, down in the Glenridding valley {{at the bottom of}} the Swart Beck, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> water supply and where fuel could be brought up the valley without too much difficulty. Inside the mill there was {{probably}} a furnace to prepare the ore and a single ore hearth. The air blast was produced by bellows powered by a water wheel. Further buildings were erected in the 1830s, to house a slag hearth furnace, and a silver refinery. There was no extended chimney: clouds of toxic lead oxides and acid sulphurous fumes would have made the valley an unhealthy place. The flue {{was built in}} 1841 to a chimney 150m up the hillside; in 1855 it was extended to a chimney on the ridge above. Later, loops were added to increase its length. This long flue not only removed the noxious fumes, it also enabled the lead-rich dust to be recovered and returned to the smelter. The flue was built as a stone-arched cutting, following or cut into the bedrock. This served as a giant prospecting cross-cut and proved there was no extension to the Greenside Vein to the south.|$|E
