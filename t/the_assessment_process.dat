5|$|By {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>process</b> for the ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the {{original}} suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot Drain {{for most of its}} length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather than {{to the rest of the}} drain. It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The U. S. Navy has {{established}} a Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) <b>Assessment</b> <b>Process</b> {{to be used for}} each new ship class. Papers presented at previous SIW meetings have described the PRA and the development of certain aspects of <b>the</b> PRA <b>Assessment</b> <b>Process,</b> including <b>the</b> PRA Federation Testbed. This paper provides an overview of <b>the</b> total PRA <b>Assessment</b> <b>Process</b> to illustrate how the process provides the PRA ship class results to meet OPEVAL requirements across ship classes in a consistent and adequate manner. <b>The</b> PRA <b>Assessment</b> <b>Process</b> as applied to each new ship class will build on the products and results, including the PRA Federation Testbed as implemented, from previous ship class work. To facilitate this reuse, all relevant material, collectively referred to as <b>the</b> PRA <b>Assessment</b> <b>Process</b> Standards and Architecture (PS&A), is documented in one module. The PS&A module is the roadmap for any new ship class’s program manager and technical team to implement <b>the</b> PRA <b>Assessment</b> <b>Process,</b> including documentation and products.

2500|$|The {{rapid growth}} in {{diversity}} of {{school districts in the}} United States has proven that there is an increasing need for new guidelines and standards to be put into practice in able to provide nondiscriminatory assessment procedures to students. [...] Although there is no clear-cut way to appropriately evaluate bias in the assessment of students who are culturally and linguistically diverse, the examiner must carefully consider each situation individually in order to develop an appropriate hypothesis {{that can be used in}} the testing procedure. [...] In developing a hypothesis the school psychologist must eliminate any personal or professional bias that may affect their ability to make informative decisions based on the psychometric data obtained during <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>process.</b> [...] Best practices prove that school psychologists who are culturally and linguistic competent are more effective in communicating to the individual or student in their native language and thus, eliminating the need for an interpreter. [...] The use of standardized testing also must be taken into account when assessing those who are of minority and lower socioeconomic status since they are so culturally loaded. [...] One must be able to recognize that the difference between the scores is not actually related to the ability or aptitude of the child, but to the incorrect interpretations that have been made based on the result of the scores and the significantly different standardized sample. [...] Another important factor in nondiscriminatory assessment is the ability for a school psychologist to recognize the difference in a bilingual assessment and how to assess bilingual individuals. [...] The apparent preference lies in using well-constructed, theoretically comprehensive, native language tests to non-native test takers rather than using limited and poor tests that are available in the test taker's native language.|$|E
