25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include <b>thioguanine</b> and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is {{responsible}} for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine's mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that azathioprine undergoes in the body is the conversion to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP; see Pharmacokinetics), which is itself an immunosuppressant prodrug. The TPMT enzyme {{is responsible}}, in part, for the methylation of 6-MP into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine - this methylation prevents 6-MP from further conversion into active, cytotoxic <b>thioguanine</b> nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and {{an increased risk of}} severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving azathioprine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of azathioprine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for azathioprine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for myelotoxicity. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care.

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the {{superfamily}} of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.

50|$|Cancer {{drugs have}} been {{highlighted}} as particularly appropriate candidates for toxgnostic studies {{due to the}} significant toxicity profiles associated with both targeted therapies and chemotherapy. Most cancer patients obtain only modest benefit from treatment, whereas toxicity is common and often associated with severe side effects which include considerable morbidity and mortality. One {{of the most commonly}} used chemotherapy drugs 5-fluorouracil (5FU) prescribed as adjuvant therapy following surgical resection of early stage colorectal cancer benefits only approx. 4% of patients, whereas 30-40% of those treated will suffer severe toxicity such as neutropenia, mucositis, hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea, and stomatitis, fatal toxicities will kill 0.5-1% of people treated. Through the use of toxgnostic screens a number of genetic variants have now been identified {{that can be used to}} predict 5FU toxicity prior to treatment. These genetic variants can be used to identify the individuals predisposed to severe drug toxicity and the dose of 5FU chemotherapy can be reduced to prevent severe toxic side effects. Toxgnostic biomarker tests currently available for use in clinical practice include markers for irinotecan, <b>thioguanine,</b> warfarin and 5FU.|$|E

50|$|Nodular {{regenerative}} hyperplasia (NRH) {{is a rare}} liver condition {{characterized by}} a widespread benign transformation of the hepatic parenchyma into small regenerative nodules.

There are no published systematic population studies on NRH and our current knowledge is limited to case reports and case series. NRH may develop via autoimmune, hematological, infectious, neoplastic, or drug-related causes. It is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, Felty syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, liver, kidney and bone marrow transplantation, cytotoxic drugs like azathioprine, mercaptopurine, <b>thioguanine,</b> antiretroviral drugs for HIV like didanosine and vitamin A. The disease is usually asymptomatic, slowly or non-progressive unless complications of portal hypertension develop. Accurate diagnosis is made by histopathology, which demonstrates diffuse micronodular transformation without fibrous septa. Lack of perinuclear collagen tissue distinguishes NRH from typical regenerative nodules in the cirrhotic liver. While the initial treatment is to address the underlying disease, ultimately the therapy is directed to the management of portal hypertension. The prognosis of NRH depends on both the severity of the underlying illness and the prevention of secondary complications of portal hypertension.

This trial compared the efficacy and toxicity of <b>thioguanine</b> (INN, <b>thioguanine)</b> versus mercaptopurine. METHODS: Consecutive children were randomized to receive <b>thioguanine</b> or mercaptopurine during maintenance chemotherapy. Toxicity data were collected by an adverse event-reporting system with follow-up questionnaires. Red blood cell thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity and <b>thioguanine</b> nucleotide concentrations were measured by standard techniques. RESULTS: Of the children, 748 were randomized to <b>thioguanine</b> and 744 were randomized to mercaptopurine. There {{was no difference in}} the event-free survival rate between the 2 groups (80 % and 81 %, respectively, at 5 years). <b>Thioguanine</b> was associated with veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver in 95 children, and persistent splenomegaly as a result of portal hypertension developed in 43 children. TPMT activity was significantly lower in the children in whom VOD developed, with a median of 13. 4 U (range, 5. 8 - 23 U) compared with 15. 2 U (range, 5. 3 - 27) in a control group of 161 leukemia patients in whom VOD did not develop (median difference, 1. 8 U; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 9 - 2. 7 U; P =. 0001). TPMT activity in children with persistent splenomegaly was also lower than that in control subjects (median difference, 1. 6 U; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 3 - 2. 8 U; P =. 012).

The study aimed to assess the evidence for efficacy of <b>thioguanine</b> in IBD management and the association with nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) and other thioguaninerelated hepatotoxicities. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used for literature search. Due to the lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the search was extended to observational studies. Quality of the included studies were graded A to C based on evaluation tools used to determine efficacy (subjective and objective grading tools) and nodular regenerative hyperplasia safety (liver biopsy and imaging tools). RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety studies were identified, but following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines only 13 studies were evaluated for efficacy and safety of <b>thioguanine.</b> Outcome measures were consistent across the included studies. <b>Thioguanine</b> appeared efficacious and well-tolerated in patients who were intolerant/ non-responsive to existing immunomodulators.
