5|$|Yet it {{also seems}} to many that science will {{eventually}} have to explain such experiences. This follows from an assumption {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established {{to deal with the}} global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health. The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.|$|E

25|$|Hauerwas finds {{these two}} moral {{theories}} very limiting {{because they are}} quandary ethics, cases that rely on extreme situations. He believes that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be a third reasoning that falls somewhere in between these two. He believes that the basic doctor-patient relationship should be built on trust and caring. This characterizes him as more of deontological thinker; however, he does believe in research on human beings. Hauerwas’s perspective is that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be a middle ground between these two perspectives. The patient becomes dehumanized through research; however, without this research {{there would be little}} medical improvement. Hauerwas therefore believes this middle ground should focus on caring for the patient instead of curing. With this, Hauerwas believes {{we do not have the}} moral understanding to handle current medicine.|$|E

25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances {{of police brutality}} - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do. On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} an {{education}} is found in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 13 of ICESCR. The Constitution of Tokelau gives no indication {{to the meaning of}} each individual right, therefore ICESCR can be used to define what the right to education actually means. ICESCR goes into some detail of what the right to education entails. It states all primary education should be free and compulsory. Secondary education should be generally available and accessible to all, as should any higher education. It then goes on to say <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be development in school systems that are free from discrimination, with set minimum standards and a high level of quality.|$|E
25|$|When {{the seal}} is pressed onto the {{printing}} surface, the procedure differs according to plant or silk based paste. For silk based paste, the user applies pressure, {{often with a}} specially made soft, flat surface beneath the paper. For plant based paste, the user simply applies light pressure. As lifting the seal vertically away from its imprint may rip or damage paper, the seal is usually lifted off one side at a time, as if bent off from the page. After this, the image may be blotted {{with a piece of}} paper to make it dry faster, although this may smudge it. Usually <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be a pile of soft felt or paper under the paper to be imprinted for a clear seal impression.|$|E

25|$|During {{the day the}} sun has {{different}} positions. For low concentration systems (and low temperatures) tracking can be avoided (or limited to a few positions per year) if nonimaging optics are used. For higher concentrations, however, if the mirrors or lenses do not move, then {{the focus of the}} mirrors or lenses changes (but also in these cases nonimaging optics provides the widest acceptance angles for a given concentration). Therefore, it seems unavoidable that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be a tracking system that follows the position of the sun (for solar photovoltaic a solar tracker is only optional). The tracking system increases the cost and complexity. With this in mind, different designs can be distinguished in how they concentrate the light and track the position of the sun.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Sina {{refers to}} the {{secondary}} education stage of maktab schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children {{after the age of}} 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship, or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduage, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} is {{also important}} {{in the development of}} herd immunity. For polio to occur in a population, <b>there</b> <b>needs</b> to be an infecting organism (poliovirus), a susceptible human population, and a cycle of transmission. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact and the transmission cycle of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease, and so on. If {{the vast majority of the}} population is immune to a particular agent, the ability of that pathogen to infect another host is reduced; the cycle of transmission is interrupted, and the pathogen cannot reproduce and dies out. This concept, called community immunity or herd immunity, is important to disease eradication, because it means that it is not necessary to inoculate 100% of the population—a goal that is often logistically very difficult—to achieve the desired result. If the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced to a sufficiently small number through vaccination, then the pathogen will eventually die off.|$|E
