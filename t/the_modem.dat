25|$|Hayes and the company's {{marketing}} manager Glenn Sirkis approached Heatherington with an outline {{for a new}} command-driven external modem. A few external modems already offered the ability to dial the phone by entering a phone number when <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> was first started, but the real problem was somehow sending a command to hang up, while <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> was already connected. There needed to be some way {{to indicate that the}} characters flowing out from the computer to <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> were not simply additional data to be sent to the far end, but commands to be acted on.|$|E
25|$|Several {{solutions}} to the problem were studied, and in the end Heatherington decided the only practical one was to have <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> operate in two modes. In one, data mode, all data forwarded from the computer were modulated and sent over the connected telephone line as it was with any other modem. In the other, command mode, data forwarded from the computer were instead interpreted as commands. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> could be instructed by the computer to perform various operations, such as hang up the phone or dial a number. <b>The</b> <b>modem</b> would normally start up in command mode.|$|E
50|$|CAP 21 {{became an}} {{associate}} party of Bayrou's MoDem on June 15, 2008. Corinne Lepage became a high-ranking member of <b>the</b> <b>MoDem's</b> leadership, {{serving as a}} Vice President. In the 2009 European elections, Corinne Lepage was elected Member of the European Parliament for North-West France as <b>the</b> <b>MoDem's</b> top candidate in the region.|$|R
50|$|Another more {{advanced}} {{method is to}} attach a TTL to <b>the</b> <b>modem's</b> RS-232 adapter, and get access to <b>the</b> <b>modem's</b> console directly to make it download new firmware, which can then be configured via a simple web interface. Examples include SIGMA, a firmware add-on that expands the current features of an underlying firmware, and others.|$|R

25|$|A {{radioteletype}} station {{consists of}} three distinct parts: the Teletype or teleprinter, <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> and the radio.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>modem</b> is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> is bypassed.|$|E
50|$|The {{actual data}} is {{transmitted}} from <b>the</b> answering <b>modem</b> to <b>the</b> calling <b>modem</b> via modulation of the carrier.|$|R

5000|$|... command mode {{in which}} data is {{interpreted}} as commands to <b>the</b> local <b>modem</b> (commands that <b>the</b> local <b>modem</b> should execute).|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>modem</b> would {{generate}} audio tones between 1200 and 2300Hz from picture signals, and picture signals from received audio tones. The audio would {{be attached to}} a radio receiver and transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Hayes' {{solution}} to the problem was to use a small microcontroller to implement a system that examined the data flowing into <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> using the same data pins as {{all the rest of the}} data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem could pick up the phone, dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any operator intervention. The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.|$|E
25|$|Today, both {{functions}} can {{be performed}} with modern computers equipped with digital signal processors or sound cards. The sound card performs the functions of <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> and the CPU performs the processing of the digital bits. This approach is very common in amateur radio, using specialized computer programs like fldigi, MMTTY or MixW.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> 1-Meg <b>Modem</b> in {{telecommunications}} was a DSL modem {{created by}} Nortel which {{conforms to the}} ADSL Lite standard. [...] <b>The</b> 1-Meg <b>Modem</b> was <b>the</b> first xDSL <b>modem</b> to gain approval and registration under FCC Part 68 Rules.|$|R
50|$|Using such a modem is {{extremely}} expensive—bandwidth costs between $5 and $7 per megabyte. <b>The</b> <b>modems</b> themselves are also expensive, usually costing between $1,000 and $5,000.|$|R
5000|$|A 1995 {{article in}} Next Generation stated that <b>the</b> XBAND <b>modem's</b> [...] "ultra-low latency {{is the key}} to its {{successful}} handling of realtime videogaming". <b>The</b> <b>modem's</b> data transfer rate was 2,400 bits per second, which, while low compared to PC <b>modems</b> of <b>the</b> time, was sufficient to handle the simple one-on-one games which XBAND was used with.|$|R
25|$|As an example, the goodput or data {{transfer}} rate of a V.92 voiceband modem is affected by <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> physical layer and data link layer protocols. It is sometimes higher than the physical layer data rate due to V.44 data compression, and sometimes lower due to bit-errors and automatic repeat request retransmissions.|$|E
25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> market expanded, {{competitors}} quickly {{copied the}} Hayes command set {{and often the}} Hayes industrial design as well. To compete with Hayes on price, early competitors manufactured modems using low-cost components that were often unreliable. Hayes quickly gained a reputation for high quality, {{and for a time}} held a 50% market share.|$|E
25|$|Hayes Microcomputer Products was a U.S.-based {{manufacturer}} of modems. The company {{is well known}} for the Smartmodem, which introduced a control language for operating the functions of <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> via the serial interface to the data terminal equipment, in contrast to manual operation with front-panel switches. This smart modem approach dramatically simplified and automated operation. Today almost all modems use a variant of the Hayes command set.|$|E
50|$|As PSTN {{hardware}} <b>modem</b> technology advanced, <b>the</b> modulation and encoding schemes {{became increasingly}} more complex, thus forcing the hardware used by <b>the</b> <b>modems</b> themselves {{to increase in}} complexity.|$|R

50|$|Fesneau is {{mayor of}} Marchenoir, Loir-et-Cher. He is a MoDem {{regional}} councilor in the Centre region. In 2009, {{he was selected}} to be <b>the</b> <b>MoDem's</b> candidate in Centre region for the 2010 regional elections.|$|R
25|$|The {{transmission}} speed is {{a characteristic of}} the teleprinter while the shift (the difference between the tones representing mark and space) is a characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>modem.</b> These two parameters are therefore independent, provided they have satisfied the minimum shift size for a given {{transmission speed}}. Electronic teleprinters can readily operate {{in a variety of}} speeds, but mechanical teleprinters require the change of gears in order to operate at different speeds.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April 2007, François Bayrou {{announced}} that he would be submitting a plan to a vote by UDF members to create a new Democratic Movement, which was finally launched on 10 May. However, most of the UDF's deputies protested and formed the New Centre (to support Nicolas Sarkozy). In the subsequent legislative elections held in June, <b>the</b> <b>MoDem</b> won only 3 seats (but 7.6% of the vote) whilst its New Centre rivals won 22 seats (but only 2.4%).|$|E
25|$|With {{the basic}} idea outlined, Hayes and Sirkis gave Heatherington the go-ahead to build a {{prototype}} by adding a microcontroller to an otherwise lightly modified version of their existing 300 bit/s hardware. Sirkis was particularly interested in using the 1MHz PIC microcontroller, which were available for only US$1 a piece. After six months {{of trying to get}} <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> working with the PIC, Heatherington gave up and demanded they use the 8MHz Zilog Z8 instead, a US$10 part. Sirkis acquiesced, and a working prototype was soon complete.|$|E
50|$|These {{usually come}} {{in the shape of}} a {{self-contained}} flat rectangular box that needs to be pointed in the general direction of the satellite—unlike VSAT the alignment need not be very precise and <b>the</b> <b>modems</b> have built in signal strength meters to help the user align the device properly. <b>The</b> <b>modems</b> have commonly used connectors such as Ethernet or Universal Serial Bus (USB). Some also have an integrated Bluetooth transceiver and double as a satellite phone. <b>The</b> <b>modems</b> also tend to have their own batteries so they can be connected to a laptop without draining its battery. The most common such system is INMARSAT's BGAN—these terminals are about the size of a briefcase and have near-symmetric connection speeds of around 350-500 kbit/s. Smaller modems exist like those offered by Thuraya but only connect at 444 kbit/s in a limited coverage area. INMARSAT now offer the IsatHub, a paperback book sized satellite modem working in conjunction with the users mobile phone and other devices. The cost has been reduced to $3 per MB and the device itself is on sale for about $1300.|$|R

25|$|Both {{formed from}} a split of the UDF, a {{traditionally}} centre-right party, in early 2007. <b>The</b> <b>MoDems</b> pursued {{a path of}} independence from the right-wing while the Nouveau Centre supported Nicolas Sarkozy (and {{was supported by the}} UMP).|$|R
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of microcomputers with expansion slots, like the S-100 bus machines and Apple II, it became possible for <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to pick up an incoming call, communicate with the user, and then hang up the call when the user logged off.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} with {{producing}} such a modem was forwarding commands from the computer. This could {{be addressed in}} internal modems that plugged directly into the computer's motherboard. Such modems {{had access to the}} computer's main memory, and by dedicating certain memory locations (or registers) to various status readouts or commands, software programs running on the computer could control <b>the</b> <b>modem.</b> This was a straightforward and thus a popular solution; the Novation APPLE-CAT II for the Apple II computer was an early programmable modem of this type.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Mac Mini {{includes two}} USB 2.0 and one FireWire 400 port. Networking is supported with 10/100 Ethernet and V.92 modem ports, while 802.11b/g and Bluetooth were additional build-to-order options. <b>The</b> <b>modem</b> was later {{omitted from the}} Mac Mini, but an external modem remained an option. External displays are supported via a DVI port. Adaptors are also available for VGA, S-Video, and composite video. The system contains a built-in speaker and an analog 1/8-inch stereo Mini jack for sound out {{at the back of}} the case.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Acoustic modem {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sensors on the deep sea AUV. A good performance of <b>the</b> acoustic <b>modem</b> has great effect on the safety and operation of deep sea AUV. According to the construction of deep sea AUV, acoustic modem is installed in the cavity behind the GPS antenna, it would cause flow noise around <b>the</b> acoustic <b>modem</b> and thus interference will occur when the communication is established between deep sea AUV and surface. Flow-induced noise around <b>the</b> acoustic <b>modem</b> is studied in this paper. Firstly the unsteady flow around <b>the</b> acoustic <b>modem</b> is studied by large eddy simulation (LES) method. Secondly based on the resolved information of flow field, acoustic noise distribution is studied using equivalent acoustic sources method. Compared with different positions of GPS antenna, flow noise distribution around <b>the</b> acoustic <b>modem</b> and <b>the</b> effect on communication is investigated. Then acoustic <b>modem</b> layout on <b>the</b> AUV is optimized...|$|R

40|$|The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has {{developed}} a two way time transfer <b>modem</b> system for <b>the</b> United States Naval Observatory (USNO). Two modems {{in conjunction with a}} pair of Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) and a communication satellite can achieve sub nanosecond time transfer. This performance is demonstrated by the results of testing at and between NRL and USNO. <b>The</b> <b>modems</b> use Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) methods to separate their signals through a single path in <b>the</b> satellite. Each <b>modem</b> transmitted a different Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) code and received the others PRN code. High precision time transfer is possible with two way methods because of reciprocity of many of the terms of the path and hardware delay between <b>the</b> two <b>modems.</b> <b>The</b> hardware description was given in a previous paper...|$|R
