5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. <b>The</b> <b>plate</b> was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|In Fauna boreali-americana, Richardson assigns the mammal to {{the now-defunct}} genus Diplostoma {{described}} by Rafinesque in 1817. He named it Diplostoma ? bulbivorum. Illustration-labeling errors in Richardson's book further confounded subsequent taxonomists; <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> was labeled Diplostoma douglasii.|$|E
5|$|Later {{copies of}} the second state, with minor retouching, were also printed from <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> by Thomas Cotes in 1632, for Robert Allot's Second Folio, a new edition of the {{collected}} plays. It was also reused in later folios, although by then <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> was beginning to wear out and was heavily re-engraved. The original plate was still being used into the 1660s, and then disappears. Already in 1640 William Marshall had copied and adapted the design on a new plate for John Benson's edition of Shakespeare's sonnets. All subsequent engraved reprintings of the portrait were made by later engravers copying the original printed image.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Du Tertre's crude 1667 {{drawing and}} Labat's 1722 derivative, a few {{contemporary}} paintings depict red macaws {{that may be}} the Lesser Antillean macaw. A color plate accompanying a 1765 volume of Buffon's encyclopaedia Histoire Naturelle (no. 12 in Planches Enluminées, entitled L'Ara Rouge) shows a red macaw with entirely red tail feathers and more red on the tertial and scapular feathers of the wing than are present on the scarlet macaw. Copies of <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> differ in the nuances used, but are identical in pattern. The painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in Europe at the time. The Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus cited <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> in his 1766 description of the scarlet macaw, but his description does not match the bird shown. A 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, which also includes a dodo, shows a red macaw that agrees with the descriptions of the Lesser Antillean macaw. A second macaw in the painting may be the hypothetical extinct Martinique macaw (A. martinicus), but though many parrots were imported into Europe at the time from all over the world, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of such paintings today.|$|E

Joseph's brother William, who said he felt <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> inside a pillow case in 1827, said in 1884 that he understood <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> to be [...] "a mixture of gold and copper ... much heavier than stone, and very much heavier than wood".|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to Smith {{and the other}} eleven {{who claimed to be}} witnesses, a few other early Mormons said they saw <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b> For instance, Smith's mother Lucy Mack Smith said she had [...] "seen and handled" [...] <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b> Smith's wife Emma and his younger brother William and younger sister Katharine also said they had examined and lifted <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> while they were wrapped in fabric.

Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with {{the top of their}} lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out.

This creates a tweezing effect, where the hair between <b>the</b> <b>plates,</b> when they close, is pulled as <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> rotate away from the skin, then released as <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> separate.
