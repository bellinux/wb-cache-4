40|$|<b>The</b> {{effects of}} <b>blowing</b> and its {{parameters}} including <b>the</b> jet amplitude, <b>blowing</b> coefficient and jet width {{in order to}} flow control was evaluated for a NACA 0012 airfoil. The flow was considered as fully turbulent with the Reynolds number of 5 · 10 ^ 5, and the Menter shear stress turbulent model was employed. Tangential and perpendicular <b>blowing</b> at <b>the</b> trailing edge were applied on the airfoil upper surface, and the jet widths were varied from 1. 5 to 4 percent of the chord length, and the jet amplitude was also selected 0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5. In <b>the</b> tangential <b>blowing,</b> <b>the</b> results showed that when <b>the</b> <b>blowing</b> amplitude increases, <b>the</b> lift-to-drag ratio rises by 15 percent, however, the smaller amounts of <b>the</b> <b>blowing</b> amplitude are more effective in <b>the</b> perpendicular <b>blowing.</b> Furthermore, when <b>the</b> <b>blowing</b> jet width rises, the lift-to-drag ratio increases continuously in <b>the</b> tangential <b>blowing</b> and decreases quasi-linear in <b>the</b> perpendicular <b>blowing.</b> In this study, <b>the</b> <b>blowing</b> jet width 3. 5 and 4 percent of the chord length for <b>the</b> tangential <b>blowing</b> was selected as optimal values as well as smaller amounts of blowing jet width {{are more suitable for}} <b>the</b> perpendicular <b>blowing.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> lift-to-drag ratio was increased by 17 percent for <b>the</b> tangential <b>blowing</b> in <b>the</b> angle of attack of 18 degrees...|$|R

The MDT David was chosen over the armoured version of the Storm because the heavy Storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems, safety hazards and limited mission operability.

5|$|After his dismissal, {{his successors}} {{reversed}} his policy of reconciliation, {{resulting in a}} large-scale anti-Arab rebellion among the Soghdians. Another major defeat against the Turgesh in the Battle of the Defile {{was followed by the}} almost complete collapse of the Arab position in Trasoxiana and the outbreak of a major rebellion in Khurasan itself, led by al-Harith ibn Surayj. Appointed for a second time to govern Khurasan in late 734, Asad brought fresh troops into the province and managed to suppress Harith's uprising in 735–736, although the rebel leader himself escaped capture. An expedition in Khuttal in 737 brought about the intervention of the Turgesh khagan at the head of an army. Despite initial Arab setbacks and the Turgesh invasion of Khurasan, Asad succeeded in inflicting a defeat upon the khagan in person at the Battle of Kharistan, turning back the Turgesh army. Despite Asad's death a few months later, this success was instrumental in preserving Muslim rule in Central Asia, as <b>the</b> <b>blow</b> to the khagans prestige led to his murder soon after and the collapse of Turgesh power. At the same time, Asad's conciliatory policy towards the native population laid the foundations for its eventual acceptance of Muslim rule and the Islamization of Central Asia.|$|E

5|$|By the Hellenistic period, {{it became}} common for Greek states {{to finance the}} {{development}} and proliferation of ever more powerful torsion siege engines, naval ships, and standardized designs for arms and armor. Under PhilipII and Alexander the Great, improvements were made to siege artillery such as bolt-shooting ballistae and siege engines such as huge rolling siege towers. E.W.Marsden and M.Y.Treister contend that the Macedonian rulers Antigonus I Monophthalmus and his successor Demetrius I of Macedon had the most powerful siege artillery of the Hellenistic world {{at the end of}} the 4thcenturyBC. The siege of Salamis, Cyprus, in 306BC necessitated the building of large siege engines and drafting of craftsmen from parts of West Asia. The siege tower commissioned by DemetriusI for the Macedonian Siege of Rhodes (305–304 BC) and manned by over three thousand soldiers was built at a height of nine stories. It had a base of , eight wheels that were steered in either direction by pivots, three sides covered in iron plates to protect them from fire, and mechanically opened windows (shielded with wool-stuffed leather curtains to soften <b>the</b> <b>blow</b> of ballistae rounds) of different sizes to accommodate the firing of missiles ranging from arrows to larger bolts.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to <b>the</b> <b>blow</b> inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the feature}} of the {{integrable}} systems is that all forward things are determined by its initial conditions.

Through the Painlevé analysis it is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>blowing</b> up themselves are characterized by the Weyl group [Flaschka and Haine]. In this paper we study how the behavior at <b>the</b> <b>blowing</b> up point is governed by its initial condition. For this purpose we realize the Painlevé divisor as the analytic variety. By virtue of this description we can compactify level set by using monoidal transformation by Painlevé divisor.
