500|$|In Pinafore, Sullivan {{exploits}} minor keys for comic effect, {{for instance}} in [...] "Kind Captain, I've important information". Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in [...] "Sorry her lot". The musicologist Gervase Hughes {{was impressed with the}} introduction to the opening chorus which includes [...] "a rousing nautical tune... in a key of no nonsense, C major... a modulation to the mediant minor, where <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of [...] "Sorry her lot" [...] in 2/4 [...] After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz." [...] He continues, [...] "the bassoon and basses... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore... in the improbable key of A flat minor.... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on a good old 6/4".|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 2007, Plame {{testified before}} the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was asked how she learned of Novak's {{reference}} to her in his column. Plame told the committee [...] "I found out {{very early in the}} morning when my husband came in and dropped the newspaper on the bed and said, 'He did it'.... We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> that we read about this July 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know exactly what he said, but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I kept my lips shut, of course. The {{signal for}} the Indians to attack was never given. Instead, the bugle-calls of the {{relieving}} force for which my ears had thirsted so long, burst out, terrifying like {{the call of}} the Last Day <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprised</b> enemies.|$|R
60|$|On {{receiving}} our card the Prince, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> great <b>surprise</b> and pleasure, {{sent down}} a most cordial {{message that he}} would be delighted to see us at once. This thrilled us.|$|R
60|$|Next inning, after old man Hathaway had baffled the Canadians {{with his}} wide, tantalizing curves, my {{predictions}} {{began to be}} verified. Snead rapped one high and far to deep right field. <b>To</b> <b>our</b> infinite <b>surprise,</b> however, the right fielder ran with fleetness that made our own Deerfoot seem slow, and he got under the ball and caught it.|$|R
60|$|And now, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> we were accosted by {{an eager}} and servile throng.|$|E
60|$|The only {{disorder}} in the groom's room was produced, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> by the groom's books and papers.|$|E

40|$|The author {{presents}} {{his personal}} {{response to the}} newly found poems of Marulić,discovered at Glasgow by Darko Novaković. In {{sharp contrast to the}} stereotypical picture of Marulić as an exclusively religious poet, the new poems, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> great <b>surprise,</b> show him as a brilliant satirist, teasing, even bold jester and erotic poet who, in spite of his old age, wittily plays on sensuality...|$|R
50|$|Gordon's {{report on}} the {{bombardment}} stated that:A little before sunset the squadron anchored just out of gunshot; the bomb vessels at once took up their position to cover the frigates in the projected attack at daylight next morning and began throwing shells until about 7:00pm. The garrison, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> great <b>surprise,</b> retreated from the fort; and a short time afterward Fort Washington was blown up.|$|R
50|$|Adrian Searle, chief {{art critic}} of The Guardian and {{formerly}} a painter, wrote: Nigel Greenwood {{gave me my}} first solo show, in 1988, I think <b>to</b> <b>our</b> mutual <b>surprise.</b> Getting {{him to come to}} my studio was a frustrating business of cancelled appointments. When he finally made it, he accidentally broke my coffee pot, got paint on his trousers and found he had locked himself out of his car. He gave me the show anyway.|$|R
60|$|The {{answer was}} communicated, and {{we waited for}} {{its effect on the}} Indians. <b>To</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> several of them soon {{gathered}} around, evidently regarding us both with interest and respect.|$|E
60|$|Just then {{we heard}} our father wishing the other gentlemen good- night, and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> Clarence opened the door, though he was deadly white and with dew {{starting}} on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> Cecile did {{not seem}} so much dismayed at {{returning}} under the power of her tyrant as we had expected. It was doing what her husband wished, and living where she would have news of him, and perhaps sometimes see him.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the Grioli-Koiter-Mindlin-Toupin indeterminatecouple stress model. The main aim {{is to show that}} the traction boundary conditions were not yet completely deduced. As it turns out, and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own <b>surprise,</b> restricting the boundary condition framework from the strain gradient models to the couple stress model does not reduce to Mindlin's set of accepted boundary conditions. We present therefore, {{for the first time the}} complete, consistent set of traction boundary conditions...|$|R
60|$|During {{the course}} of the meal the Portuguese trader became so {{communicative}} and agreeable that we all began to think we had judged him harshly. We observed, too, that Makarooroo and the negroes had fraternised heartily, and our guide was singing and laughing, and making himself agreeable at a very uncommon rate, so much so as <b>to</b> call forth <b>our</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> great <b>surprise,</b> {{we found}} that the Britishers were making {{preparations}} to take possession of the village. The armed brig was moored stem and stern in the channel where her full broadside could be brought to bear upon the settlement, and the three barges, each having on board a twelve-pounder, were rowed up to the beach on which no less than four hundred soldiers, with weapons ready for use, stood as if to repel an attack.|$|R
60|$|Placing him in {{one corner}} where he might sit with {{his back against the}} boards, the old sailor went outside and drove the mule in the {{direction}} of the tavern, himself following until he was lost to view, much <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> and disquietude.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye ain't got no bunk to spare, you boys, hev ye?" [...] asked Mosby, evasively, {{glancing at}} Percy Briggs {{without looking at}} the stranger. We all looked at Briggs also; it was HIS affair after all--HE had {{originated}} this opposition. <b>To</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> he said nothing.|$|E
60|$|The frog, as before, {{refused to}} make any reply; so our friend lay for some time chuckling and making faces at it. While thus engaged he {{happened}} to look up, and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> as well as alarm we observed that he suddenly turned as pale as death.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it may fall," [...] {{said the}} Skinner, {{for the first}} time {{beginning}} to tremble. [...] "I will tell you anything--even how <b>to</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>our</b> party at the Pond, without all this trouble, and it is commanded by my own brother." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>our</b> immense <b>surprise,</b> Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell {{accepted}} the invitation {{with the utmost}} alacrity. She was profuse in her thanks, indeed; for she told us the Arms was an ill-kept house, and the cookery by no means agreed with her husband's liver. It was sweet of us to invite them; such kindness to perfect strangers was quite unexpected. She should always say that nowhere on earth had she met with so cordial or friendly a reception as at Seldon Castle. But--she accepted, unreservedly.|$|R
60|$|About {{five o'clock}} in the evening, our eyes being all up in the air, and towards the hills, for the {{appointed}} signals, beheld, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> great <b>surprise,</b> a canoe come rowing to {{us out of the}} mouth of the river. Immediately we went <b>to</b> work with <b>our</b> perspective glasses; one said it was one thing, and one said it was another, until I fetched a large telescope out of the cabin, and with that I could easily see they were my own men, and it was <b>to</b> <b>our</b> inexpressible satisfaction that they soon after came directly on board.|$|R
60|$|As we {{boarded the}} canoe, the Islanders slowly retreated; {{meantime}} earnestly conferring in whispers; {{all but the}} old priest, who, still seated, presented an undaunted though troubled front. <b>To</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> he motioned us to sit down by him; which we did; taking care, however, not to cut off our communication with Jarl.|$|E
6000|$|... "A wild cat!" [...] cried Jack, fitting {{an arrow}} to his bow, and {{discharging}} it so hastily that {{he missed the}} animal, and hit the earth about half-a-foot {{to one side of}} it. <b>To</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> the wild cat did not fly, but walked slowly towards the arrow and snuffed at it.|$|E
6000|$|... "We call it taro," [...] one of {{the nearest}} group answered, greatly <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> in {{perfectly}} good and clear English. [...] "Would you like to taste some? It's very nice. We shall be delighted if you'll try it. Hawaiians are always proud indeed to show any hospitality {{in their power to}} friendly strangers." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not above}} {{three miles from}} the hills before {{we came to the}} shore, or water-edge of this sea, and there, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> further <b>surprise,</b> we found the water fresh and {{pleasant}} to drink; so that, in short, we knew not what course to take. The sea, as we thought it to be, put a full stop <b>to</b> <b>our</b> journey (I mean westward), for it lay just in the way. Our next question was, which hand to turn to, to the right hand or the left, but this was soon resolved; for, as we knew not the extent of it, we considered that our way, if it had been the sea really, must be on the north, and therefore, if we went to the south now, it must be just so much out of our way at last. So, having spent {{a good part of the}} day in <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> at the thing, and consulting what to do, we set forward to the north.|$|R
40|$|Context-predicting models (more com-monly {{known as}} embeddings or neural {{language}} models) {{are the new}} kids on the distributional semantics block. Despite the buzz surrounding these models, the litera-ture is still lacking a systematic compari-son of the predictive models with classic, count-vector-based distributional semantic approaches. In this paper, we perform such an extensive evaluation, {{on a wide range of}} lexical semantics tasks and across many parameter settings. The results, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own <b>surprise,</b> show that the buzz is fully justified, as the context-predicting models obtain a thorough and resounding victory against their count-based counter-parts. ...|$|R
6000|$|It did [...] "pay" [...] {{in other}} ways than the mere {{pleasure}} of it. There was always a better feeling between the Roaders and the Hillites thereafter. The big brothers of the little girls, <b>to</b> whom <b>our</b> Christmas <b>surprise</b> {{had been such a}} treat, thought it worthwhile to bury the hatchet, and quarrels between the two villages became things of the past.|$|R
60|$|The Indians of the prairies {{arrived in}} their {{customary}} marching order, or in single files. Manytongues led, followed by Prairiefire; Flintyheart and Eaglesflight came next, {{and the rest}} succeeded in a nameless but perfect order. <b>To</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> however, they brought the two prisoners with them, secured with savage ingenuity, {{and in a way}} to render escape nearly impossible.|$|E
6000|$|Moir {{was late}} that evening, {{and when he}} did arrive he brought with him, rather <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> a small, stout Frenchman, whom he {{introduced}} as Monsieur Paul Le Duc. I say <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> for we held a theory that any intrusion into our spiritual circle deranged the conditions, and introduced an element of suspicion. We knew that we could trust each other, but all our results were vitiated by the presence of an outsider. However, Moir soon reconciled us to the innovation. Monsieur Paul Le Duc was a famous student of occultism, a seer, a medium, and a mystic. He was travelling in England with a letter of introduction to Moir from the President of the Parisian brothers of the Rosy Cross. What more natural than that he should bring him to our little séance, or that we should feel honoured by his presence? ...|$|E
60|$|But {{though the}} long rows of white-washed {{hospitals}} {{on the hill}} side were now in plain sight, and though scores of ships were here lying at anchor, yet no boat came off to us; and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> and delight, on we sailed, past a spot which every one had dreaded. How it was that they thus let us pass without boarding us, we never could learn.|$|E
6000|$|At half-past eleven I went to Lord Aberdeen's {{and stayed}} about an [...] hour. His {{being in the}} Palmerston cabinet which had been proposed, [...] was, he said, out of the question; but his velleities seemed to [...] lean rather <b>to</b> <b>our</b> joining, which <b>surprised</b> me. He was afraid of [...] the {{position}} we should occupy {{in the public eye}} if we declined....|$|R
60|$|At {{night we}} slept {{close to the}} {{junction}} of Ponsonby Sound with the Beagle Channel. A small family of Fuegians, who {{were living in the}} cove, were quiet and inoffensive, and soon joined our party round a blazing fire. We were well clothed, and though sitting close to the fire were far from too warm; yet these naked savages, though farther off, were observed, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> great <b>surprise,</b> <b>to</b> be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting. They seemed, however, very well pleased, and all joined in the chorus of the seamen's songs: but {{the manner in which they}} were invariably a little behindhand was quite ludicrous.|$|R
60|$|While we {{had been}} talking the cannonading ceased gradually, until by the time Pierre was done with his efforts to soothe me, {{comparative}} silence prevailed. Straightway we lads forgot all else in the desire to know what had been done; whether our people had retreated, or if the Britishers had fallen back, and I was {{on the point of}} proposing that I go out {{to get an idea of}} the situation when the door suddenly opened, and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> great <b>surprise</b> and delight the Jerseyman flung himself headlong into the room, as if he had run until so exhausted that he could no longer remain on his feet.|$|R
