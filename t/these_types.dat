5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity of <b>these</b> <b>types</b> of seeds {{has been found to}} be increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E

5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps seen from a top-down perspective. In both <b>these</b> <b>types</b> of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge on the bottom of the screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries fleets had relied on {{two types of}} major warship, the ship {{of the line and}} the frigate. The first major change to <b>these</b> <b>types</b> was the {{introduction}} of steam power for propulsion. While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards, steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s.|$|E

Although Gyromitra esculenta has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest <b>these</b> <b>types</b> of mushrooms. The toxins may be cumulative and even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from Gyromitra esculenta, and it is not known if the potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.|$|E
