5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between <b>the</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>field,</b> the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases. Olivia and Walter {{come to the same}} conclusion, that Jones is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway, the epicenter of these Fringe events. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sporting}} {{facility in}} the city is the Gifu Memorial Center, whose complex includes facilities for athletic and other events. Its athletic facilities include a track and field complex, a baseball stadium, and plazas for tennis and swimming, as well as martial arts and traditional arts facilities. There are also two large multi-purpose domes: the Deai Dome (seats 5,000) and the Fureai Dome (seats 700). All of the facilities are equipped for night events. <b>The</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>field</b> at the Memorial Center serves as the home to FC Gifu, the city's football representative in the J-League. Next to Memorial Center is the Nagaragawa Sports Plaza, a sports science and training center. The facility accommodates up to 300 people and provides access to equipment for improving athletic ability.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion {{landed on the}} battlefield, the Viet Cong had intercepted a radio {{conversation}} between the aforementioned unit and the 52nd Ranger Battalion in the district centre; several months earlier the 7th Airborne Battalion {{was involved in the}} battle at Bình Giã, so they vowed to avenge the loss of their comrades. Thus, from <b>the</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>field,</b> the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion marched up to Thuận Lợi, against only light opposition. The South Vietnamese paratroopers arrived at the area where the first group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was dropped off and they collected seven survivors and 55 bodies. In the afternoon, as elements of the 7th Airborne Battalion moved through the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation to search for remnants of the second group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment started attacking the South Vietnamese paratroopers in a manner which had characterised earlier ambushes. Taking advantage of the poor weather conditions that had limited U.S. air strikes, as well as their numerical superiority, the Viet Cong broke the South Vietnamese formation into small groups and destroyed many of them. On the next day, the strength of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion was reduced from 470 to just 159 soldiers.|$|E

But once that season ended, in December 2007, Alex finally decided to retire from <b>the</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>fields</b> once and for all.|$|R

5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on <b>the</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>field,</b> they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} one of {{the first}} scenes in which Maslany plays multiple characters interacting in the same shot. To construct the scene in which Sarah and Alison meet in <b>the</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>field</b> shed, Maslany and her stunt double Kathryn Alexandre first shot a master version of the scene using a Technodolly, a programmable camera crane that can memorise camera movements. Two versions of the scene were then re-filmed without Alexandre, with Maslany playing each of the characters. To simulate Alison placing her hand on Sarah's shoulder, a grip stand was used in the place of Sarah's shoulder for Maslany to hold when playing Alison, and to simulate Sarah slapping Alison's arm away, Maslany slapped the air when playing Sarah and reacted {{as if she had been}} hit when playing Alison. The final scene was created through digital compositing, whereby both versions of the scene—with Maslany playing both characters separately—are combined to produce a single shot. Maslany felt that, as one of her early attempts at sharing a scene with herself, she over-thought the process: [...] "I think I was trying too hard to get it right. Nobody's there when you're shooting these things, so you overcompensate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>field</b> had a {{grayscale}} plastic floor {{allowing the}} robots to locate themselves along the field. [...] In 2007, this {{was replaced with}} the GENII (Generation 2) field which had different shades of green plastic, which allowed light sensors {{to be used to}} more accurately determine location (this field is still used in Australia and is now also used in the World Robot Olympiad). [...] In 2009, the field was replaced with plain green felt. [...] This change was aimed at making the game more realistic by creating greater reliance on the goal location and walls rather than the ground. [...] The change, however, has been controversial with many teams having problems with quality of the felt.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1998, Florida State's dream of a new complex started to become a reality, as ground was broken for the new {{facility}} and construction began. Although the new facility was not completed, the Seminoles began playing on their new field {{in the fall of}} 1998. The 1999 season marked the first full season in the new 1,600 seat Seminole Soccer Complex, which is {{regarded as one of the}} nation's best with its new top-playing surface. The two-level Mary Ann Stiles & Barry Smith Team Building houses the coaches' offices which overlook <b>the</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>field,</b> a reception area, a combined workroom, large team and coaches locker rooms, visiting team locker rooms and training and equipment rooms. The team building will undergo a multi-million dollar renovation to the second floor beginning in October of 2008 with an expected completion date in June 2009. [...] The expansion to the second floor will include new offices, a team meeting room, tradition space for both sports and a player lounge. Although the Seminole Soccer Complex is still one of the newest facilities on the Florida State campus, FSU's commitment to the success of the soccer program continues to show with the latest upgrade to the facility. Florida State unveiled a brand new video scoreboard in 2006. The Seminole Soccer Complex now has a capacity of 2,000.|$|E
