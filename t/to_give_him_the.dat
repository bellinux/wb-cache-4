Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by another way. This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2009, Brodeur broke {{a number}} of career records for goaltenders. He missed 50 games in the 2008–09 season, but a winning streak upon his return pushed him near the NHL's all-time win record. On March 14, 2009, the Devils {{defeated}} the Canadiens 3–1 <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> 551st win of his career, tying him with Roy for the NHL record.

Aaron sneaks up behind him and strikes him with a crowbar, nearly ripping off his ear. He watches in despair as Ripley sacrifices herself by falling into the lead smelter.|$|E
5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> unfettered control {{that he had}} exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again {{it would be as}} a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Kennedy was {{substantially}} behind Humphrey in convention delegate support, but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary. Only thirteen states held primaries that year, meaning that most delegates at the Democratic convention could choose a candidate based on their personal preference. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., and others have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and charisma would have been sufficiently convincing at the 1968 Democratic National Convention <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> nomination. Historian Michael Beschloss believed, however, that Kennedy would not have secured the nomination. Humphrey, after a National Convention in Chicago marred by violence in the streets, was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground. He ultimately lost the general election to Republican Richard Nixon by the narrow popular vote margin of 43.4% to 42.7%. Nixon won by a more decisive 301-191 margin in the electoral vote.|$|E
5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{informs the}} detectives that Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) {{has been shot}} in the head, and he orders an {{immediate}} investigation. Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) arrive at the hospital to find the doctors working frantically on Thormann; Crosetti, a close friend of Thormann, becomes very emotional. Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives in when Crosetti tries to make him feel guilty by showing him his previous gunshot wounds. When an investigation at the crime scene turns up nothing, Lewis catches Crosetti praying with a rosary in the locker room. Crosetti convinces a skeptical Lewis to pray with him for help in the investigation.|$|E

5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, {{the election results}} were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E
5|$|In March 1081, Melissenos was encamped {{with his}} army at Damalis, on the Asian shore across the Bosporus from Constantinople. There, he {{received}} {{news of the}} revolt of the Komnenoi against Botaneiates and the proclamation of Alexios Komnenos as emperor. He sent letters to the Komnenoi, suggesting a division of authority over the imperial territory, with the Balkans remaining under Komnenian control and himself keeping Asia Minor, although he also emphasized that the Byzantine Empire should remain united. In reply, the Komnenoi offered to recognize him as Caesar – the second highest dignity after the imperial title itself – and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> governance of Thessalonica – the Empire's second-most important city – if he would submit to them. Melissenos initially refused to accept this offer, but as the Komnenoi {{were on the verge}} of taking Constantinople and might refuse to make similar concessions later, he eventually agreed.|$|E
5|$|In some {{adaptations of}} the Ramayana, other {{characters}} also use surrogates to save themselves from Ravana. A Tamil text narrates how Ravana once asks for Parvati as boon {{from her husband}} Shiva, however Vishnu – disguised as a sage – deludes Ravana into believing Shiva granted him an illusionary Parvati. Ravana entrusts Parvati to Vishnu and mediates again to compel Shiva <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> real Parvati. This time, Shiva gives an illusionary Parvati, which he accepts as the real one and returns to Lanka with her. In the Malay Ramayana, Ravana sets his eyes on Rama's mother, however she transforms a frog into her image and sends this surrogate to be Ravana's wife.|$|E

However Darren teamed up with Kim to force Dr. S'avage <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> hospital taxi contract and recruited Tony to work as his receptionist. However they came to blows over the name and design of the company, but resolved their differences with Darren moving into the boarding house, Tony working as a taxi driver and Maxine Minniver (Nikki Sanderson) takes over as receptionist.|$|E
5|$|On October 5 at Citi Field, in a 3-0 {{win over}} the {{defending}} National League Champion New York Mets in the NL Wild Card Game, Bumgarner pitched his third career postseason complete game four-hit shutout <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> most career complete game shutouts {{in the history of}} the Wild Card Era with two. In other words, he set the Major League record for most career complete game shutout wins in winner-take-all-games, the first and only pitcher to have more than one. Bumgarner's third career postseason shutout ties him for second all-time behind Christy Mathewson's four. He also tied Tom Glavine's Major League record with six career scoreless postseason starts and lowered his Major League career postseason road record to a microscopic 0.50 ERA.|$|E
