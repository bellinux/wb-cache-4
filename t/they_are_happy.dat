25|$|Egypt is a Muslim-majority country. However, over 90 {{percent of}} the Zabbaleen {{community}} in the Mokattam village are Coptic Christians. Communities where almost everyone is Christian are rare to find in Egypt outside of the Zabbaleen community of Mokattam. According to Engi Wassef, in her commentary in her documentary film Marina of the Zabbaleen, {{many people in the}} Zabbaleen village say that even if they could live outside of the village or buy a house elsewhere, they would not because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> to live within their own religious community and freely practice their religion.|$|E

25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{minstrel}} show {{coincided with}} the growth of the abolitionist movement. Many Northerners were concerned for the oppressed blacks of the South, but most had no idea how these slaves lived day-to-day. Blackface performance had been inconsistent on this subject; some slaves were happy, others victims of a cruel and inhuman institution. However, in the 1850s minstrelsy became decidedly mean-spirited and pro-slavery as race replaced class as its main focus. Most minstrels projected a greatly romanticized and exaggerated image of black life with cheerful, simple slaves always ready to sing and dance and to please their masters. (Less frequently, the masters cruelly split up black lovers or sexually assaulted black women.) The lyrics and dialogue were generally racist, satiric, and largely white in origin. Songs about slaves yearning to return to their masters were plentiful. The message was clear: do not worry about the slaves; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> with their lot in life. Figures like the Northern dandy and the homesick ex-slave reinforced the idea that blacks did not belong, nor did they want to belong, in Northern society.|$|E

Kierkegaard, using the pseudonym 'A.F.', writes, [...] "most people, including the author of this article, think it is not worth the trouble to be concerned about who the author is. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>happy</b> not to know his identity, for then they have only the book to deal with, without being bothered or distracted by his personality." ...|$|E
