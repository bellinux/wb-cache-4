5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men. Women were also accepted into <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Women's Army Corps (WACs) and U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). Unlike processes {{to screen out}} male homosexuals, which had been in place since {{the creation of the}} American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> the 1940s, and frailty discouraged.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers.

As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E
