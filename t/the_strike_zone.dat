5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone,</b> provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone,</b> a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} {{in a game}} against the Boston Red Sox, Kershaw gained much attention for throwing a curveball to Sean Casey that started behind Casey but at the end looped into <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone</b> and struck him out looking. Kershaw was 0–3 and had a 2.28 ERA with 47 strikeouts through 43 innings pitched in his first stint of the year with the Suns. He was then called up to the majors on May 28, 2008, but optioned back to Jacksonville on July 2.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{also worked}} {{occasionally}} as an umpire in significant games. One notable example {{was the final}} contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29–18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone.</b> Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its {{first few years of}} existence.|$|E
5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings {{on the outcome of}} each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone,</b> and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.|$|E
5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone,</b> as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies began August {{by placing}} Cliff Lee on the {{disabled}} list, replacing him on the roster with Cesar Jimenez; however, David Buchanan was eventually expected to take Lee's place in the starting rotation. They continued their series with the Washington Nationals, winning 2–1 with another strong outing from Roberto Hernandez and a home run by Marlon Byrd. After wins in the series' first two games, starting pitcher A. J. Burnett was ejected {{in the second inning}} of the third game for arguing with home plate umpire Chris Guccione about <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone.</b> Burnett's first ejection in his 16-season career sparked 11 runs by the Nationals, who shut out the Phillies. The team also lost the rubber match 4–0 the following day, when Cole Hamels had no run support in a pitchers' duel with Stephen Strasburg.|$|E
5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a pitch is not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone</b> that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a pitch is not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E
5|$|The players' union became bolder {{under the}} {{leadership}} of former United Steelworkers chief economist and negotiator Marvin Miller, who was elected executive director in 1966. On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone</b> was reduced and the height of the pitcher's mound was lowered from 15 to 10 inches (38.1 - 25.4cm). In 1969, both the National and American Leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted. Also that same year, Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major leagues' first general players' strike took place in 1972, delaying the season's start for two weeks. In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the designated hitter rule the following year. In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series {{for the first time in}} 90 years. Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.|$|E

Four expansion teams joined the majors. 1969 batting averages returned to their historical averages and never again would pitching have as large a statistical average over batting in the major leagues.|$|R

5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone.</b> Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E

25|$|The catcher {{is usually}} the first to notice the tendencies, quirks, and peculiarities of each home-plate umpire. Some umpires favor high strikes, pitched balls that are {{technically}} above <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone</b> but appear, to the umpire, to be good. Conversely, some umpires will call low pitches strikes {{even when they are}} slightly below the knees. Other umpires have an inside bias or an outside bias; some umpires have more than one bias; some are uniformly lenient; some have very restricted notions of <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone,</b> and the pitcher will constantly feel that his pitches are unfairly judged. The catcher can exploit an umpire's tendencies by taking him into account in how he chooses to receive the ball.|$|E
25|$|Despite the team's winning ways in April, {{the bullpen}} {{was a source}} of {{problems}} all month, with its combined 5.70 ERA ranking as the highest in the National League during April.

Although Nationals relievers issued a National League-lowest 2.93 walks per nine innings and threw a higher percentage of their pitches in <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone</b> than any other MLB bullpen by a full two percentage points, they also threw the fourth-lowest number of first-pitch strikes among MLB bullpens, suggesting problems with command in <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> <b>zone.</b> Much of the bullpen's struggles came from relievers giving up 1.86 home runs per nine innings, a rate one full home run higher than the previous season's.|$|E
