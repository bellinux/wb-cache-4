5|$|Voalavo {{is a small}} rodent {{resembling}} a mouse with gray fur. Species of the genus are among the smallest known nesomyines, close in size only to Monticolomys koopmani. In terms of external morphology, Voalavo is barely different from Eliurus; fur coloration patterns, general morphology of the feet, and number of mammae (six) {{are all the same}} in both genera. However, all species of Eliurus have a pronounced tuft of elongated hairs {{at the tip of the}} tail, a feature that is absent in Voalavo, although the latter does have slightly longer hairs near the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative tail length in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is comparable to that of the longest-tailed species of Eliurus, Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but V.antsahabensis has a somewhat shorter tail. Furthermore, the pads of the feet are larger in Eliurus, and specifically, the <b>thenar</b> pad (located at the middle of the tarsus) is circular and fairly small in Voalavo, but longer and larger in Eliurus. On the chest, Voalavo species have a gland that produces a sweet-swelling musk in breeding males; this gland is absent in Eliurus. Unlike all other nesomyines but Brachyuromys, Voalavo lacks an entepicondylar foramen, an opening on the humerus (upper forelimb bone).|$|E

25|$|As a note, {{a patient}} with true carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (entrapment of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel) will not have any sensory loss over the <b>thenar</b> eminence (bulge of muscles {{in the palm of}} hand and {{at the base of the}} thumb). This is because the palmar branch of the median nerve, which innervates that area of the palm, branches off of the median nerve and passes over the carpal tunnel. This feature of the median nerve can help separate carpal tunnel syndrome from thoracic outlet syndrome, or pronator teres syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{first to}} notice the {{association}} between the carpal ligament pathology and median nerve compression {{appear to have been}} Pierre Marie and Charles Foix in 1913. They described the results of a post mortum of an 80-year-old man with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. They suggested that division of the carpal ligament would be curative in such cases. Putman had previously described a series of 37 patients and suggested a vasomotor origin. The association between the <b>thenar</b> muscle atrophy and compression was noted in 1914. The name 'carpal tunnel syndrome' appears to have been coined by Moersch in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of Bennett {{fracture}} are {{instability of}} the CMC joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and {{weakness of the}} pinch grasp. Characteristic signs include pain, swelling, and ecchymosis {{around the base of}} the thumb and <b>thenar</b> eminence, and especially over the CMC joint of the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the CMC joint of the thumb. The patient will often manifest a weakened ability to grasp objects or perform such tasks as tying shoes and tearing a piece of paper. Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the thumb on an object, such as when reaching into a pants pocket.|$|E

2500|$|Numbness in the {{distribution}} of the median nerve, nocturnal symptoms, <b>thenar</b> muscle weakness/atrophy, positive Tinel's sign at the carpal tunnel, and abnormal sensory testing such as two-point discrimination have been standardized as clinical diagnostic criteria by consensus panels of experts. [...] Pain may also be a presenting symptom, although less common than sensory disturbances.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scaphoid}} can be palpated at {{the base}} of the anatomical snuff box. It can also be palpated in the volar (palmar) hand/wrist. [...] Its position is the intersections of the long axes of the four fingers while in a fist, or the base of the <b>thenar</b> eminence. [...] When palpated in this position, the bone will be felt to slide forward during radial deviation (wrist abduction) and flexion.|$|E
2500|$|Compression of {{the median}} nerve as it runs deep to the {{transverse}} carpal ligament (TCL) causes atrophy of the <b>thenar</b> eminence, {{weakness of the}} flexor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, as well as sensory loss in the digits supplied by the median nerve. The superficial sensory branch of the median nerve, which provides sensation {{to the base of}} the palm, branches proximal to the TCL and travels superficial to it. [...] Thus, this branch spared in carpal tunnel syndrome, and there is no loss of palmar sensation.|$|E

50|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{muscles of}} the thumb {{can be divided into}} two groups; the <b>thenar</b> eminence and other muscles. The <b>thenar</b> eminence refers to the group of muscles on the palm {{at the base of the}} thumb.The three muscles composing the <b>thenar</b> eminence are the abductor pollicis brevis, flexor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis.The other two muscles that influences movement of the thumb are the adductor pollicis and the first dorsal interosseous muscle.|$|E
50|$|In the hand, {{the median}} nerve {{supplies}} motor innervation to the 1st and 2nd lumbrical muscles. It also supplies {{the muscles of}} the <b>thenar</b> eminence by a recurrent <b>thenar</b> branch. The rest of the intrinsic muscles of the hand are supplied by the ulnar nerve.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>thenar</b> {{eminence}} (from the Greek [...] "θέναρ" [...] - <b>thenar,</b> [...] "palm of the hand") {{refers to}} the group of muscles on the palm of the human hand {{at the base of the}} thumb. The skin overlying this region is the area stimulated when trying to elicit a palmomental reflex.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} three muscles are {{considered part of}} the <b>thenar</b> eminence: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{intrinsic}} muscle groups are the <b>thenar</b> and hypothenar muscles (<b>thenar</b> {{referring to the}} thumb, hypothenar to the small finger), the dorsal and palmar interossei muscles (between the metacarpal bones) and the lumbrical muscles. The lumbricals arise from the deep flexor (and are special {{because they have no}} bony origin) and insert on the dorsal extensor hood mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Palmar {{erythema}} is reddening of {{the palms}} at the <b>thenar</b> and hypothenar eminences.|$|E
5000|$|Abductor pollicis brevis abducts the thumb. This {{muscle is}} the most {{superficial}} of the <b>thenar</b> group.|$|E

5000|$|Lack {{of ability}} to abduct and oppose the thumb due to {{paralysis}} of the <b>thenar</b> muscles. This is called [...] "ape-hand deformity".|$|E
50|$|It {{can occur}} with an injury of the median nerve {{either at the}} elbow or the wrist, {{impairing}} the <b>thenar</b> muscles and opponens pollicis muscle.|$|E
50|$|The fingers {{have two}} long flexors, {{located on the}} {{underside}} of the forearm. They insert by tendons to the phalanges of the fingers. The deep flexor attaches to the distal phalanx, and the superficial flexor attaches to the middle phalanx. The flexors allow for the actual bending of the fingers. The thumb has one long flexor and a short flexor in the <b>thenar</b> muscle group. The human thumb also has other muscles in the <b>thenar</b> group (opponens and abductor brevis muscle), moving the thumb in opposition, making grasping possible.|$|E
5000|$|Running forward, {{it passes}} through, {{occasionally}} over, the <b>thenar</b> muscles, which it supplies, and sometimes anastomoses with the terminal {{portion of the}} ulnar artery, completing the superficial palmar arch.|$|E

50|$|Characteristic signs include pain, swelling, and {{ecchymosis}} {{around the}} <b>thenar</b> eminence, and especially over the MCP joint of the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the MCP joint of the thumb.|$|E
50|$|The flexor pollicis brevis is {{a muscle}} {{in the hand}} that flexes the thumb. It {{is one of three}} <b>thenar</b> muscles. It has both a {{superficial}} part and a deep part.|$|E
50|$|It is a fleshy, flat, triangular, and fan-shaped muscle {{deep in the}} <b>thenar</b> {{compartment}} {{beneath the}} long flexor tendons and the lumbrical muscles {{at the center of}} the palm. It overlies the metacarpal bones and the interosseous muscles.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Recurrent {{branch to}} {{muscles of the}} <b>thenar</b> {{compartment}} (the recurrent branch is also called [...] "the million dollar nerve"). Here it provides motor innervation to opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis and superficial part of flexor pollicis brevis.|$|E
50|$|The opponens pollicis is a small, {{triangular}} {{muscle in}} the hand, which functions {{to oppose the}} thumb. It {{is one of the}} three <b>thenar</b> muscles, lying deep to the abductor pollicis brevis and lateral to the flexor pollicis brevis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{muscles of}} the hand {{supplied}} by the median nerve can be remembered using the mnemonic, [...] "LOAF" [...] for Lumbricals 1 & 2, Opponens pollicis, Abductor pollicis brevis and Flexor pollicis brevis. (NB: OAF are the <b>thenar</b> eminence).|$|E
