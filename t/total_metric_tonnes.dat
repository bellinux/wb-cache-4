50|$|On {{the night}} of 6 September 2001, ten 200-litre {{canisters}} of methanol, <b>totalling</b> 1.6 <b>metric</b> <b>tonnes,</b> were stolen from Baltfet (a company processing industrial fats, esters and animal feed) by Deniss Pletškin, a former employee and Robert Petrov, a current employee, on order of Sergei Maistrišin.

Maistrišin proceeded to sell the stolen methanol to Aleksandr Sobolev, a known smuggler, for 76,000 krooni, claiming that it was technical spirit (i.e., laboratory-grade neutral spirit). Sobolev mixed the liquid with water and lemon flavouring agents at about 30% by volume, bottled the resulting liquid, attached fake labels of various well-known vodka brands, and distributed it through an underground network. Beginning on 9 September, hundreds of people ended up drinking the resulting product and suffered methanol poisoning.|$|R

5000|$|Scallop {{aquaculture}} is {{the commercial}} activity of cultivating (farming) scallops {{until they reach}} a marketable size and can be sold as a consumer product. Wild juvenile scallops, or spat, were collected for growing in Japan as early as 1934. The first attempts to fully cultivate scallops in farm environments were not recorded until the 1950s and 1960s. Traditionally, fishing for wild scallops has been the preferred practice, since farming can be expensive. However worldwide declines in wild scallop populations {{have resulted in the}} growth of aquaculture. Globally the scallop aquaculture industry is now well established, with a reported annual production <b>totalling</b> over 1,200,000 <b>metric</b> <b>tonnes</b> [...] from about 12 species.

40|$|Between 8 and 50 <b>metric</b> <b>tonnes</b> {{of excess}} {{plutonium}} are currently {{planned to be}} immobilized in a glass or ceramic waste form in the US. The immobilized Pu would then be encased in HLW glass (the can-in-canister alternative), which would provide a radiation barrier to enhance the proliferation resistance of the material. Associated with the plutonium are about 15 <b>metric</b> <b>tonnes</b> of uranium primarily {sup 238 }U {{and a variety of}} other impurities (primarily Ga, Mo, Al, Mg, Si, and Cl) <b>totaling</b> about 1 <b>metric</b> <b>tonne</b> or less. Immobilization of this material is complicated by the fact that the uranium content in the various feed streams varies widely, from 0 to about 95 %. The proposed ceramic form is composed of about 90 % zirconolite (CaZrTi{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }) and/or pyrochlore (CaPuTi{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }) with about 10 % other phases, typically hollandite (BaAl{sub 2 }Ti{sub 6 }O{sub 16 }) and rutile (TiO{sub 2 }). The form is a variation of Synroc-C, which contains nominally 30 % zirconolite, 30 % perovskite, 30 % hollandite, and 10 % rutile and noble metal alloys. Zirconolite and perovskite are the actinide host phases in Synroc-C with zirconolite being the more durable phase. The pyrochlore structure is closely related to zirconolite and forms at higher actinide loadings. Thus, this mineral is of interest for plutonium deposition in ceramic. Pyrochlore has the advantage that it is cubic rather the monoclinic like zirconolite. Cubic mineral swell isotropically when radiation damaged. As a result, differential strain in the microstructure will be minimal, leading to significantly less microcracking of the form after thousands of years in a repository. Zirconolites and pyrochlores containing uranium and. or thorium exist in nature and have demonstrated actinide immobilizations for periods exceeding 100 million years...|$|R
