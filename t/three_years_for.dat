5|$|Despite U.S. {{declarations}} of neutrality and German accountability for its unrestricted submarine warfare, in 1915 the British passenger liner Lusitania was sunk, leading {{to calls for}} war. President Wilson forced the Germans to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare and after long debate Congress passes the Naval Act of 1916 that authorized a $500million construction program over <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>for</b> 10 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, 10 scout cruisers, 50 destroyers and 67 submarines. The idea was a balanced fleet, but in the event destroyers were much more important, {{because they had to}} handle submarines and convoys. By {{the end of the war}} 273 destroyers had been ordered; most were finished after World War I ended but many served in World War II. There were few war plans beyond the defense of the main American harbors.|$|E
5|$|Evan Lysacek was {{originally}} coached by Candice Brown in Naperville. After that, {{he worked with}} Deborah Stoery in Naperville, Illinois and Addison, Illinois for <b>three</b> <b>years.</b> <b>For</b> the next two years, he had an arrangement where he would train under both Addison-based Maria Jeżak-Athey and Moscow-based Viktor Kudriavtsev. Kudriavtsev would come to Chicago {{for part of the}} year to coach, and Lysacek spent his summers at Kudriavtsev's summer training camps in Moscow, Russia and Flims, Switzerland. When that arrangement proved untenable, Kudriavtsev recommended Lysacek to Carroll, who agreed to coach Lysacek on the condition that Lysacek would work more with Congemi than with himself, due to Carroll's commitments to Timothy Goebel. Lysacek moved to El Segundo, California to work with Frank Carroll and Ken Congemi in June 2003. Lysacek worked with both Congemi and Carroll through the 2006-2007 season, after which he began working solely with Carroll. He has also trained with ballerina Galina Barinova.|$|E
5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>for</b> Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E

5|$|Like scholar-officials, {{military}} generals {{were ranked}} in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations {{every five years}} (as opposed to <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>for</b> officials). However, military officers had less prestige than officials. This was due to their hereditary service (instead of solely merit-based) and Confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence (wu) over the cultured pursuits of knowledge (wen). Although seen as less prestigious, military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations, and after 1478 the military even held their own examinations to test military skills. In addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the Yuan period, the Ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector. In the early half of the dynasty, men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office; this trend was reversed during {{the latter half of}} the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them.|$|E

In October 2002, McKevitt and other RIRA members imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison issued a statement calling for the organisation to stand down. After a two-month trial, McKevitt was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment in August 2003 after being convicted of directing terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds {{in southwestern}} Haiti from the {{hurricane}} {{damaged or destroyed}} hundreds of trees. The path of Flora over the area was best determined by the trajectory of fallen trees across the peninsula. The strong winds left entire villages roofless, with many buildings entirely destroyed. The combination of rough waves and strong winds destroyed three entire communities. Many {{of those who died}} in southwestern Haiti suffered from intense burns from strong winds. In most areas, crops were entirely destroyed. The coffee crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane, though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years. Additionally, strong winds downed shading trees for the coffee crop on the southern peninsula. One official estimated it would require <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>for</b> the coffee crop to be replanted and regrown.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} 2001 season saw George O'Leary {{entertain}} {{a coaching}} offer from Notre Dame after Bob Davie announced resignation as Irish head coach.

He claimed to have played <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>for</b> the University of New Hampshire and to have attained a master's degree from New York University; in actuality, he had attended NYU but did not graduate, and he never played a down of New Hampshire football. Following O'Leary's departure, Mac McWhorter was named interim head coach for Georgia Tech's bowl game, a victory over Stanford in the 2002 Seattle Bowl.
