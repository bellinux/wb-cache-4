Examine the bacterial colony,coliform group and pathogenic bacteria,these three microorganism index signs in teaching environment and facilities. Use flat band method to examine the sanitation in the air;use cotton swab sampling method to examine the coli group and pathogenic bacteria. According {{to the results of}} examination,find out the variety trend of the dynamic state of environment and pollution of the environment condition,establish the reasonable disinfection method and procedure aimed at different microoganismses. Through testing,we confirm that the air quality is good in September and October. The average of <b>total</b> <b>numbers</b> of colony is less than 10.

30|$|The {{populations of}} J 2 were {{measured}} in 200  g soil from each pot of each treatment combination {{by means of}} modified Whitehead trays (Whitehead and Hemming 1965). The final total population density of healthy nematodes was calculated by combining the <b>total</b> <b>numbers</b> of J 2 and healthy eggs. For estimation of the numbers of healthy eggs, the <b>total</b> <b>numbers</b> of infected eggs were subtracted from the <b>total</b> <b>numbers</b> of eggs. A reproduction factor was estimated by dividing the final nematode population density by the initial population density (Pf/Pi) (Ebadi et al. 2009).|$|R
