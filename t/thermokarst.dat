The most agreed upon theory today is that Valles Marineris was formed by rift faults like the East African Rift, later made bigger by erosion and collapsing of the rift walls. It has also been proposed that Valles Marineris was formed by flowing lava.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{specific}} example, climate change will cause widespread thawing of permafrost in the discontinuous zone and {{significant changes in}} the continuous zone. [...] Thawing permafrost can lead to a landscape of irregular depressions (<b>thermokarst)</b> due to subsiding soils. [...] This can alter drainage patterns and even change the course of streams; whereas other areas could become swamp-like. [...] In addition, slope stability will decrease and permafrost degradation could lead to erosion of river banks resulting in an increase in sediment transport by the rivers. [...] These physical changes will impact nutrient cycling and biological processes within the basin as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{related term}} <b>thermokarst</b> lake, also called a thaw lake or cave-in lake, {{refers to a}} body of freshwater, usually shallow, that is formed in a {{depression}} by meltwater from thawing permafrost. Depressions are often produced {{by the collapse of}} ground levels associated with permafrost thaw. Continued thawing of the permafrost substrate can lead to the drainage and eventual disappearance of <b>thermokarst</b> lakes, leaving them, in such cases, a geomorphologically temporary phenomenon. In recent years, <b>thermokarst</b> lakes have become increasingly common in Siberia and other tundra environments.|$|E

5000|$|Permafrost {{is a large}} global carbon {{reservoir}} that has remained frozen {{throughout much of the}} Holocene. [...] Due to recent climate change, the permafrost is beginning to thaw, releasing stored carbon and forming <b>thermokarst</b> lakes. [...] When the thawed permafrost enters the <b>thermokarst</b> lakes, its carbon is converted into carbon dioxide and methane and released into the atmosphere. [...] Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and the methane emissions from <b>thermokarst</b> lakes have the potential to initiate a positive feedback cycle in which increased atmospheric methane concentrations lead to amplified global climate change, which in turn leads to more permafrost thaw and more methane and carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E

50|$|A talik is a {{layer of}} year-round unfrozen ground that lies in {{permafrost}} areas. In regions of continuous permafrost, taliks often occur underneath shallow <b>thermokarst</b> lakes and rivers, where the deep water does not freeze in winter, and thus the soil underneath will not freeze either. Sometimes closed, open and through talik are distinguished. These terms refer to whether the talik is completely surrounded by permafrost, {{is open to the}} top (e.g. a <b>thermokarst</b> lake), or open to both top and unfrozen layers beneath the permafrost, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Pleistocene {{deposits}} blanket most of {{the surface}} of Faddeyevsky Island. A layer of Late Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial and lacustrine deposits largely cover the central and southern parts of Faddeyevsky Island. Middle and Late Pleistocene deposits largely cover {{the northern part of}} this island. The permafrost is about 400 to 500 m thick. The central plain of Faddeyevsky Island has been highly altered by <b>thermokarst</b> processes. It contains numerous deep erosive cuts created by the seasonal melting of the permafrost. Numerous baydzharakhs, <b>thermokarst</b> mounds, dot the landscape; they are the result of the melting of polygonal ice wedges within the permafrost.|$|E
50|$|An alas is {{different}} from <b>thermokarst</b> depressions found elsewhere in the Arctic in that the lake is only temporary. Due to the aridity of Yakutia, the lake will dry up once the underlying ice has been depleted.|$|E
5000|$|This paper {{estimates}} that 33-87% of high-latitude increases in atmospheric methane originate from <b>thermokarst</b> lakes.

50|$|The lands {{within the}} monument, which lies entirely above the Arctic Circle, are all tundra {{in which the}} {{permafrost}} dominates soils and vegetation. The monument is in a permafrost region. In the lowland areas the land is shaped by <b>thermokarst</b> forces. Typical <b>thermokarst</b> features seen in the monument include pingos, polygon ice wedges and thaw ponds. Low vegetation covers the land, mainly in tussocks of cottongrass, with shrubby growth of willow, Labrador tea, dwarf birch, mountain alder and other species in moist tundra areas. Wetter aras {{in the southern part}} of the monument feature grasses and sedges. Upland regions are Arctic tundra, with lichen, saxifrage, willow and heather. Few trees grow, and the white spruce that do grow are confined to the southeastern corner of the monument.|$|E
50|$|Most rivers {{belong to}} the basin of Merkys River, {{including}} the Ūla, Katra, Grūda, Varėnė, and Skroblus. These rivers are characterized by their clear, cold water, and numerous tributaries. Also, there are some tiny <b>thermokarst</b> lakes and bogs, including Čepkeliai Marsh, the largest bog in Lithuania.|$|E
50|$|Drunken {{trees are}} not a {{completely}} new phenomenon—dendrochronological evidence can date <b>thermokarst</b> tilting back to at least the 19th century. The southern extent of the subarctic permafrost reached a peak during the Little Ice Age of the 16th and 17th centuries, {{and has been in}} decline since then.|$|E
50|$|Permafrost, {{which is}} soil (or rock) that remains below 0 °C {{for at least}} two {{consecutive}} years, forms a solid matrix in soil which can extend to a depth of hundreds of meters. The permafrost prevents trees from developing deep root systems; for example, the black spruce that has adapted to permafrost soils has no significant taproot. In areas where the permafrost temperature is near the melting point of water, climate variations, or loss of surface vegetation from fire, flooding, construction, or deforestation, can thaw the upper extents of the permafrost, creating a <b>thermokarst,</b> the scientific name for a ground slump caused by melting permafrost.The <b>thermokarst</b> undermines the shallow root bed of these trees, causing them to lean or fall.Thermokarst lakes are surrounded by a ring of drunken trees leaning toward the lake, which makes these land features easily identifiable.|$|E
50|$|In {{collaboration}} with Dr. Terry Chapin and Dr. Katey Walter-Anthony, Sergei Zimov {{has published a}} series a collection of scientific papers exposing the importance of permafrost and high-latitude carbon dioxide and methane emissions in the global carbon cycle. These papers identified methane ebullition from <b>thermokarst</b> lakes {{to be a significant}} source of atmospheric methane, a potent greenhouse gas.|$|E
50|$|Regions of {{permafrost}} cover {{much of the}} Arctic. In many areas, permafrost is melting, {{leading to}} the formation of a boggy, undulating landscape filled with <b>thermokarst</b> lakes and distinctive patterns of drunken trees. The process of permafrost melting is complex and poorly understood since existing models do not include feedback effects such as the heat generated by decomposition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thermokarst</b> {{is a land}} surface characterised by very {{irregular}} {{surfaces of}} marshy hollows and small hummocks formed as ice-rich permafrost thaws, that occurs in Arctic areas, and {{on a smaller scale}} in mountainous areas such as the Himalayas and the Swiss Alps. These pitted surfaces resemble those formed by solution in some karst areas of limestone, which is how they came to have karst attached to their name without the presence of any limestone. Small domes that form on the surface due to frost heaving with the onset of winter are only temporary features. They then collapse with the arrival of next summer's thaw and leave a small surface depression. Some ice lenses grow and form larger surface hummocks, which last many years and sometimes become covered with grasses and sedges, until they begin to thaw. These domed surfaces eventually collapse either annually or after longer periods and form depressions which contribute to uneven surfaces. These are included within the general label of <b>thermokarst.</b>|$|E
50|$|The North Siberian Lowland (Северо-Сибирская низменность), {{also known}} as Taymyr Lowland (Таймырская низменность), is a lowland plain between the lower reaches of the Yenisey and Olenyok rivers in Krasnoyarsk Krai and Yakutia. It is 1,400 km long and up to 600 km wide. This lowland plain {{features}} flat-topped ridges approximately 200-300 m high, which rise over broad and heavily swamped degradations {{with a large number}} of <b>thermokarst</b> lakes.|$|E

50|$|Cape Krusenstern is {{primarily}} a coastal plain, containing large lagoons and rolling hills of limestone. The bluffs record {{thousands of years of}} change in the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea, as well as evidence of some 9,000 years of human habitation. The park's central features, 114 beach ridges at the eponymous cape, alternate between sandy and gravelly ridges and narrow ponds. Located entirely above the Arctic Circle in a region of permafrost, the monument's lands include typical <b>thermokarst</b> features.|$|E
50|$|Elsewhere {{along the}} coast of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, the sea cliffs expose pre-Eemian {{floodplain}} and lake sediments at their base. Eemian lake sediments fill depressions, i.e. ice wedge casts and <b>thermokarst</b> lakes, which developed by the surficial thawing during Eemian interglacial climates of Saalian ice-wedges and other permafrost. In some locations, the Eemian lake deposits are thicker and laterally continuous enough to form a complete blanket overlying older sediments. The Eemian sediments contain fossils indicative of an interglacial environment.|$|E

50|$|The Yedoma region {{currently}} occupies {{an area of}} {{more than}} one million square kilometers from northeast Siberia to Alaska and Canada, and in many regions is tens of meters thick. During the Last Glacial Maximum, when the global sea level was 120 m lower than that of today, similar deposits covered substantial areas of the exposed northeast Eurasiancontinental shelves. At the end of last ice age, at the Pleistocene — Holocene transition, thawing yedoma and the resulting <b>thermokarst</b> lakes may have produced 33 to 87% of the high-latitude increase in atmospheric methane concentration.|$|E

50|$|Since its discovery, Semenovsky Island rapidly {{decreased}} in size until it disappeared between 1952 {{and the early}} 1960s. The area of Semyonovsky Island was 4.6 km² in 1823, 0.9 km² in 1912, 0.5 km² in 1936, and 0.2 km² in 1945. In 1950, {{it was only a}} solitary baydzharakh (<b>thermokarst</b> mound). By 1952, it had been eroded down into a sand bar lying just above the sea surface. When Semyonovsky Island was visited in the early 1960s, it had vanished and only a sand shoal with an average depth of 10 m and minimum depth of 0.2 m remained.|$|E
50|$|Lavysas is a lake in {{southern}} Lithuania, Varena district, about 5 {{miles south of}} Perloja and 10 miles southwest of Varena, surrounded by the Dainava forest. The lake is 1.5 km long and has a width up to 1.2 km. The maximum depth is 10.2 m. The lake is of glacial origin, <b>thermokarst,</b> and forms an oval shape. The shores are sandy and covered with coniferous forests. The southern coast {{on the other hand}} is swampy. The lake collects the water from two streams, the Merkys and its tributary the Lavysa. Located on the west coast is the village of Lavyso. Close to the lake are many campsites and rest houses.|$|E
5000|$|Teshekpuk Lake is {{the largest}} lake in Arctic Alaska, the largest <b>thermokarst</b> lake in the world.

The region provides habitat {{to a variety of}} arctic wildlife, including the Teshekpuk Lake Caribou Herd (64,000 animals), and large numbers of shorebirds and migratory waterfowl. The Teshekpuk Lake Observatory was established by the U.S. Geological Survey, National Science Foundation and other partners to study impacts of climate change on the arctic environment.|$|E
5000|$|The reserve {{sits on a}} low plateau, with deeply cut river valleys. The valley tops {{resemble}} elongated ridges, with {{hills of}} a typical height of 100-300 meters. The highest point in the territory is 602 meters above sea level. The Tunguska Event occurred on {{the northern edge of}} the reserve. The Stony Tunguska River (Podkamennaya Tunguska River) runs across the southern border of the site. Two main rivers run south through the reserve, the Chamby River and the Hushmy River. The river valleys are generally waterlogged when not frozen. [...] Lake Cheko, a round, picturesque <b>thermokarst</b> lake is on the northern border of the site; it has been suggested as a possible impact site of the 1908 meteorite fall.|$|E
50|$|Where <b>thermokarst</b> {{depressions}} {{have formed}} by melting of the permafrost, they are filled by Holocene solifluction and lake sediments. These depressions formed {{as the result}} of the thawing of ice wedges and other permafrost during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition about 12,000 to 10,000 years ago. Lacustrine sediments filling these depressions contain a record of the Allerød warming, Younger Dryas cooling, and other climatic events. Holocene fluvial and solifluction deposits underlie valleys of streams cut into underlying Pleistocene sediments. Solifluction deposits, which were created by melting of the underlying permafrost, veneer the surface of the uplands. New ice wedge polygon systems later formed in these sediments during the Late Holocene as result of pronounced climatic cooling, which only recently has reversed in the last couple of hundred years.|$|E

5000|$|This {{ecoregion}} {{is located}} on the north coast of Alaska, and includes the east coast plain of Banks Island, as well as the Anderson River and Horton River plains, and the Tuktoyaktuk coast in the Northwest Territories. This is an area of low, flat, boggy coastal plains. The underlying soil of this damp Arctic coast is thick, solid permafrost, covered in summer with <b>thermokarst</b> [...] "thaw lakes" [...] of melted ice. Ice features such as ice wedges and pingo mounds of soil and ice can be found. This coast has an arctic climate warm enough to allow plant growth in late-June, July and August only, and even then frosts may occur. On the whole this is a damper, wetter area than the Low Arctic tundra ecoregion that continues along the coast west of here to Quebec.|$|E
5000|$|The Batagaika crater is a <b>thermokarst</b> {{depression}} {{in the form of}} a one kilometre-long gash up to 100 metres (328 feet) deep, and growing, in the East Siberian taiga, in the Sakha Republic in Russia. It is located 10 km southeast of Batagay and 5 km northeast of the settlement Ese-Khayya, about 660 km north-northeast of the capital Yakutsk. The structure is named after the near flowing Batagayka, a right tributary of the river Yana. The land began to sink due to the thawing permafrost in the 1960s after the surrounding forest was cleared. Flooding also contributed to the enlargement of the crater. Archeologists have found ice age fossils buried in the mud around the rim of the crater. The rim is extremely unstable as there are regular landslides into the crater and the permafrost is constantly thawing. The crater is currently growing in size.|$|E
