50|$|Pursuant to the Ethiopian Constitution of 1995, {{the city}} of Addis Ababa {{is one of the}} two federal cities that are {{accountable}} to the Federal Government of Ethiopia. The other city with the same status is Dire Dawa in the east of the country and both federal cities are located within the State of Oromia. Earlier, following the establishment of the federal structure in 1991 under the <b>Transitional</b> <b>Charter</b> of Ethiopia, the City Government of Addis Ababa was one of the then new 14 regional governments. However, that structure was changed by the federal constitution in 1995 and as a result, Addis Ababa does not have statehood status.|$|E
50|$|After Koumakoye {{indicated}} {{his intention}} to run for President in the planned elections, President Déby asked the CST to change the <b>transitional</b> <b>charter</b> so that the Prime Minister could not run, and the CST accordingly did so in late March 1995. On April 8, 1995, the CST removed Koumakoye from his post as Prime Minister and chose Koibla Djimasta to replace him. In March 1996, Koumakoye was arrested for alleged illegal weapons possession and sentenced to three months in prison; according to Amnesty International, the trial was unfair and apparently intended to keep Koumakoye from contesting the election. In the presidential election, held in June 1996, he was nevertheless a candidate and received 2.29% of the vote, placing ninth.|$|E
50|$|On 26 March 2005, he {{was chosen}} as the PRS {{candidate}} for the 19 June presidential election by the party's national council, despite being officially banned from politics for five years. Ialá submitted his candidate application to the Supreme Court on 11 April, arguing that since he had signed his agreement to respect his ban from politics at his home and not in his office, it was invalid. The Supreme Court cleared him to stand in the election in its list of approved candidates published on 10 May, with five judges in favor of permitting his candidacy and one opposed. The decision was {{based on the fact that}} Ialá had resigned prior to the signing of the <b>transitional</b> <b>charter</b> which had barred him from politics, with the judges ruling that the charter should not be retroactively applied to Ialá in a way contrary to his interests. Soon afterwards, on 15 May, Ialá said that he was withdrawing his resignation as President and would resume office to serve out the remainder of his term. Although this increased the country's political tension, the declaration did not appear to lead to much immediate consequence; a rally of some of Ialá's supporters was held two days later and was dispersed by police with tear gas.|$|E

40|$|Since Eritrea’s secession from Ethiopia {{there has}} been {{continuous}} opposition by intellectuals and {{the opposition to the}} government’s policy of making Ethiopia a landlocked country. Some totally reject the secession, while others accept the independence as a “fait accompli ” and voice concern over the lack of an outlet to the sea, and still others acknowledge the right of self-determination and secession of Eritrea but denounce the inconsistency of the application of the <b>Transitional</b> <b>Charter</b> regarding the Red Sea Afar and the Algiers Agreement for denying Ethiopia its legitimate right to access to the sea and allege that the government is acting against the paramount national interest of the country...|$|E
30|$|With the {{overthrow}} of the Derg regime and coming into power of Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democracy Front (EPRDF) in 1991, Ethiopia’s foreign policy turf underwent changes in tune with domestic and international changes. The <b>transitional</b> <b>charter,</b> notably, mentioned that the transitional government “will conduct its foreign relations {{on the basis of the}} principles of respect for the sovereignty and equality of states and non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs as well as the promotion of mutual interest” (Transitional Period Charter of Ethiopia Negarit Gazetta 1991, p. 2). Subsequent constitutional principles have also reiterated, among others, the need for promoting development and operating within the broader globalized world by way of “creating a conducive environment for making use of available market and investment opportunity and getting technical assistance, loans and aid for the development and democratization endeavor of the country” (Ethiopian Foreign Policy Document 2002 : pp. 2 - 15). The foreign policy document also mentions the need for realizing the twin objectives of bringing about democracy and development for which external economic support through economic diplomacy is needed (FDRE, Foreign Affairs and National Security Policy and Strategy 2002 : 23 - 24). The document further emphasized on securing China’s Foreign Direct Investment and promote trade and investment in Ethiopia (Ibid: 151 - 152).|$|E
