40|$|Current {{solutions}} for industrial manufacturing assembly systems do not suit {{the needs of}} mass customization industry, which is facing low production volumes, many variants and rapidly changing conditions. This technical report explains in detail the concept of Self-Organising Evolvable Assembly Systems, where assembly system modules and product parts to be assembled self-organise and self-adapt (among others, choose their coalition partners, their location and monitor themselves) in order to easily and quickly produce a new or reconfigured assembly system each time a new product order arrives or each time a failure or weakness arises in the current assembly system. This report presents in detail the design of such a system following an architecture for self-organising and self-adaptive systems based on policies enforced at run-time {{on the basis of}} collected and updated metadata. As a case study, the assembly of a adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>roller</b> dispenser is considered. 1 Challenges in manufacturing In the era of mass production, companies needed optimal solutions to produce large quantities of an identical product as fast and as cheap as possible; it was worth paying the big investments for custom-made installations, which would be disposed of once the product is out of production. In the best case some of the equipment could be reused but needed manual re-programming. Any change, even small, in the product design or any failur...|$|E

50|$|Pinch wheel or {{pinch roller}} {{was the name}} used for the plastic or rubber wheels in an 8-track cartridge, used to guide and align the {{magnetic}} <b>tape.</b> Rubber <b>rollers</b> were known to degrade over time, creating a maintenance issue.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the SPOT 4 {{satellite}} will be {{quite different from the}} previous ones. The {{design of the}} new magnetic tape recorder, which was derived from industrial knowledge and mission requirements; the main technical characteristics of the recorder; and the mechanical subsystems of the recorder and their locations and contributions to the final performance are all discussed. The philosophy of the development program, required to achieve the desired performance and reliability for each flight model, is described, and information on the schedule and current development is presented. The components of the tape plate system, (the transmission belts, <b>tape</b> <b>rollers</b> of the recorders, and reel hub ball bearings) which are subjected to heavy mechanical operation, fatigue, and wear in the thermal environment of the mission, are discussed. For each of the components, a description of its function in the recorder is given, as well as the mechanical stress imposed during the various operational phases. The quality testing program, which was used to verify the design safety margins, is described. Finally, the first test results of a functioning model of the flight system are presented...|$|R
50|$|A tape {{transport}} is {{the collection}} of parts of a magnetic tape player or recorder that the actual tape passes through. Transport parts include the head, capstan, pinch <b>roller,</b> <b>tape</b> pins, and tape guide. The tape transport {{as a whole is}} called the transport mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The nearly square shaped {{cartridges}} {{are among}} the largest ever built. More than 24 hours of playback fits on a single cartridge. The music distributed by 3M consisted exclusively of mono recordings by company's own [...] "3M Orchestra". The tape is ¼ inch wide and is played at 1⅞ inches per second. The cartridge consists of a reel-to-reel mechanism intended for playback only. Internally, the cartridge contains two 8⅜ inch tape reels, <b>tape</b> guides, <b>rollers,</b> and a reel brake. The reels are stacked {{on top of each}} other horizontally and counter rotate during operation. After passing over the tape head, the tape loops over a roller in the cartridge to change its direction back to the takeup reel.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} viscoelastic nature of the adhesive on the intermittent peel front dynamics by extending a recently introduced model for peeling of an adhesive tape. As time and rate-dependent deformation of the adhesives are measured in stationary conditions, a crucial step in incorporating the viscoelastic effects applicable to unstable intermittent peel dynamics is {{the introduction of a}} dynamization scheme that eliminates the explicit time dependence in terms of dynamical variables. We find contrasting influences of viscoelastic contribution in different regions of <b>tape</b> mass, <b>roller</b> inertia, and pull velocity. As the model acoustic energy dissipated depends {{on the nature of the}} peel front and its dynamical evolution, the combined effect of the roller inertia and pull velocity makes the acoustic energy noisier for small tape mass and low-pull velocity while it is burstlike for low-tape mass, intermediate values of the roller inertia and high-pull velocity. The changes are quantified by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent and analyzing the statistical distributions of the amplitudes and durations of the model acoustic energy signals. Both single and two stage power-law distributions are observed. Scaling relations between the exponents are derived which show that the exponents corresponding to large values of event sizes and durations are completely determined by those for small values. Th scaling relations are found to be satisfied in all cases studied. Interestingly, we find only five types of model acoustic emission signals among multitude of possibilities of the peel front configurations...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} peeling of an adhesive tape subjected to a constant pull speed. We derive the equations of motion for the angular speed of the <b>roller</b> <b>tape,</b> the peel angle and the pull force used in earlier investigations using a Lagrangian. Due to the constraint between the pull force, peel angle and the peel force, it {{falls into the category}} of differential-algebraic equations requiring an appropriate algorithm for its numerical solution. Using such a scheme, we show that stick-slip jumps emerge in a purely dynamical manner. Our detailed numerical study shows that these set of equations exhibit rich dynamics hitherto not reported. In particular, our analysis shows that inertia has considerable influence {{on the nature of the}} dynamics. Following studies in the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect, we suggest a phenomenological peel force function which includes the influence of the pull speed. This reproduces the decreasing nature of the rupture force with the pull speed observed in experiments. This rich dynamics is made transparent by using a set of approximations valid in different regimes of the parameter space. The approximate solutions capture major features of the exact numerical solutions and also produce reasonably accurate values for the various quantities of interest. ...|$|R
5000|$|Evans visits Newman {{and shows}} him a <b>tape</b> of the <b>roller</b> skater's death. She {{points out the}} time it {{normally}} takes for the elevator to go up 87 floors would take about 40 seconds to a minute. However, the elevator ascended the floors {{in less than two}} seconds, thus noting that there is definitely something wrong. When they try to show the tape to Jeff, he refuses to watch it and leaves abruptly. Instead, they go to Evans' office and look up a man named Gunther Steinberg (Michael Ironside), who had been experimenting with organic reproducing computer chips using dolphin brains. However, the project had gone disastrously wrong and Steinberg was fired. Later the next morning Milligan (Edward Herrmann), who remains suspicious of the elevators throughout the film, discovers Jeff's corpse in an elevator shaft. When Jennifer and Mark arrive, they are shocked to hear that the police have concocted a story that has Jeff being a terrorist and being behind the incidents and assure the public that the threat is over. Later during the day, an elevator cab flies to top floor at such a speed that the floor flies off and all the people in it are killed. This event reaches the President and is seen as an act of terrorism.|$|R
2500|$|By then, Roller was {{directing}} {{the effort to}} preserve samples of oral history, interviewing the former [...] "illegalists" [...] and building up a large collection of magnetic <b>tape</b> recordings. Reputedly, <b>Roller's</b> experiment in oral history had unwittingly managed to embarrass the communist leader: it presented Gheorghiu-Dej as more the secondary figure than the [...] "illegalist" [...] leader fashioned in official documents. In the spring of 1958, as the party celebrated 25 years since the Grivița Strike of 1933, the PMR Institute collection of recordings was in focus. A number of the [...] "illegalists", especially {{those who did not}} receive the posts they expected after 1944, began to question whether Gheorghiu-Dej had played the leading role he claimed for himself during the strike, as well as criticizing the country's direction. The latter hastily called a plenary session of the central committee for June 9–13, where a group of deviationists was [...] "unmasked". The group was entirely composed of members who had belonged to the party when it was banned and included prominent figures such as Constantin Doncea and Grigore Răceanu. Officially, they were sanctioned for criticizing the leadership and its work methods as well as for attempting to organize a conference where party activity would be discussed. The underlying motive for the purge was their criticism of the party's stifling atmosphere and of the personality cult surrounding Gheorghiu-Dej.|$|R
5000|$|After {{taking a}} ride with Muntz in a 4-track player-outfitted car, Bill Lear, maker of the Lear Jet, {{modified}} the 4-track technology to create the Stereo 8 cartridge, widely known as the 8-track. Most notably, eight tracks were squeezed onto the same ¼" [...] tape, reducing potential audio quality, but allowing twice as much music to be put onto the same length of <b>tape.</b> The pinch <b>roller</b> was also {{an integral part of}} the 8-track cartridge, although many early rubber rollers would suffer from deterioration because the rubber had not been fully cured. Once this was discovered, all later rubber pinch rollers were [...] "fully cured" [...] (hard) rubber, or plastic rollers (introduced by RCA in 1970) were used instead. Thanks to his connection to Motorola, which made radios for Ford Motors cars, Lear was able to ensure that 8-track players would be included in many Ford cars, and they became popular mainly during the early- to mid-1970s. 4-track tapes gradually faded away and were gone by late 1970, as most people switched to 8-tracks, although players compatible with both 4-track and 8-track tapes were sometimes made. Inexpensive adapters were available that permitted 4-track tapes to be played in 8-track players. The adapter was a rubber pinch roller attached to a small metal plate that would clip into the opening in the 4-track cartridge. 4-track tapes are still in-demand by collectors.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{tape storage}} which is {{primarily}} used for long-term archival and backup of digital data, {{has historically been}} the most efficient, high-capacity and least expensive storage technology for huge quantities of data. Tape storage applications are in diverse fields such as corporate and government financial records, satellite imagery, credit card databases and patient medical records. Recently, the Linear Tape-Open (LTO) Ultrium format {{has emerged as the}} most dominant tape technology option in the mid-range tape drive market, with the LTO generation 5 (LTO- 5) being capable of holding as much as 1. 5 TB of uncompressed data on a single cartridge. Tape storage however has been traditionally challenged by competing technologies like hard disk drives (HDD), consumer optical storage devices which include CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray disk technologies, optical library systems and holographic storage systems. Thus, one of main goals of the tape industry is to design and manufacture advanced tape storage technologies that aim at reducing the price per unit data storage (/GB). In commercial tape drives, a flexible magnetic tape is transported between the supply and take-up packs at a fixed axial tension and transport speed and over edge and surface guides and read/write heads. The tape decks must assure accurate guiding and transport of the tape while it accelerates and decelerates by holding the axial tension constant. During transport, lateral in-plane vibration of tape 2 ̆ 7 s narrow edge causes misalignment between data tracks on the tape and position of read/write head and leads to reduced storage capacity. Lateral vibration (low and high frequency) is caused by excitation sources viz. pack run-out, flange impacts, pack tilts and tape edge weave. High frequency lateral vibration is more detrimental as it is difficult to move the read/write head to follow the tape 2 ̆ 7 s high frequency motion. To attenuate this vibration, surface guides (rollers or stationary guides) which control the lateral displacement of tape by applying friction on its wider surface, are used. Choice of an appropriate surface guide (or roller) is possible with an understanding of the physics involved in the surface friction between magnetic tape 2 ̆ 7 s wide surface and the roller. This thesis is motivated by the need to conduct a detailed investigation into the frictional interaction between roller surface and magnetic tape and contribute towards the advancement of tape technology to meet the growing market needs. A parametric study is carried out with respect to the tape 2 ̆ 7 s axial tension and axial velocity in the following two aspects: *	An experimental setup is used to control these tape parameters and obtain lateral vibration measurements at two points equidistant from the tape-roller interface to understand the effect of stick-slip friction at the interface on tape 2 ̆ 7 s lateral vibration *	A numerical model is developed to study stick-slip friction between the roller surface and the tape that travels over it. The tape is modeled as an axially moving, tensioned, viscoelastic Euler-Bernoulli beam subjected to boundary disturbances arising from supply and take-up pack run-out and stick-slip friction between <b>tape</b> and <b>roller</b> surface. These analyses are used to predict the possibility of sticking or slipping between the surfaces in contact, as a function of parameters viz. axial tension, axial velocity, surface roughness of roller and span length. A `dynamic phase diagram 2 ̆ 7 is constructed to determine the regions in the stiffness-velocity phase-space where steady stick-slip motion occurs and its effects on lateral vibration of the magnetic tape...|$|R
