5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E
5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} to be caused by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens.

Asthma is classified according to <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E
5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep.

Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: This {{research}} users inferential statistical {{tests to}} explore the statistical significance of observed relationships between <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> elements of online tutorials found within the academic literature, and <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> those same elements as found in online tutorials produced by New Zealand and Australian university libraries. Frequencies were also compared between Australian and New Zealand tutorials, and also between two types of tutorials. Method: Elements of online tutorials were located in articles from highly ranked journals, and other germane sources. A content analysis of a sample of online tutorials was carried out, using the elements identified as criteria. Findings and conclusion: No statistically {{significant differences were found}} between <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> elements in <b>the</b> literature and elements in the online tutorials, despite descriptive statistics indicating otherwise. A slight positive correlation was found between <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> elements in tutorials produced in the two different countries.

5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{proposed}} {{a model of}} matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory {{because it was a}} particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> a {{selected}} set of teaching behaviors of trained and untrained teachers in elementary schools in St. Lucia.

Significant differences were found to exist in <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> Questioning, Feedback and Praise behaviors of trained and untrained teachers.

40|$|Three pigeons {{performed}} on two-component multiple variable-interval variable-interval schedules of reinforcement.
