5|$|Before {{releasing}} the documentary, Madonna invited {{a select group}} of friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill. The film was trimmed after negative feedback regarding excessive details about Kabbalah. For the promotion and premiere of the film, Madonna appeared at Q sessions with the press and also gave a speech to film students at New York's Hunter College. Critical response to I'm Going <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> a Secret was mixed, with reviewers complimenting the live performances and the scenes involving her children and family, but criticizing the self-indulgent and preachy nature. I'm Going <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> a Secret was released in a two-disc format, a CD with 14 songs from the show and a DVD with the documentary film. It received a positive response from critics but was a moderate success commercially.|$|E
5|$|Confessions on a Dance Floor is {{the tenth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It {{was released on}} November 9, 2005 by Warner Bros. Records. A complete departure from her previous studio album American Life (2003), the album includes influences of 1970s and 1980s disco, as well as modern-day club music. Initially, she began working with Mirwais Ahmadzaï for the album, but later felt that their collaboration was not going in the direction she desired. Madonna took her collaboration with Stuart Price who was overviewing her documentary I'm Going <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> a Secret. The album was mainly recorded at Price's home-studio where Madonna {{spent most of her}} time during the recordings.|$|E

5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was inspired}} by Madonna's need to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> a Secret clarified from its beginning that {{it was about the}} singer's personal views on life and spirituality. Like Truth or Dare, the performance scenes were shot in color, {{while the rest of the}} film was in black-and-white. Besides Madonna, her dancers and her tour entourage, Åkerlund also shot her family, her working process and her day-to-day life. Madonna and her then-husband Guy Ritchie's local pub in Mayfair, London was used for some sequences. The film features appearances from Madonna's father, stepmother and filmmaker Michael Moore.|$|E

5|$|The Re-Invention World Tour was {{the sixth}} concert tour by Madonna. It {{supported}} her ninth studio album American Life, and visited North America and Europe. Madonna {{was inspired to}} create the tour, after taking part in an art installation called X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS, directed by photographer Steven Klein. She incorporated the images from the installation in the tour, whose name was in reality a dig at Madonna's critics. A number of songs were rehearsed for the tour, with twenty-four of them making the final setlist. The tour was divided into five segments: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal. The tour garnered positive reception from contemporary critics. The tour was chronicled in the documentary titled I'm Going <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} world tour it documents and the exhibition, it was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe during May 24 to September 14, 2004, and was directed by Jonas Åkerlund. Critical response towards the documentary was mixed, with one group of reviewers complimenting the live performances from the tour and the scenes involving her children and family, while others criticized the self-indulgent nature of the documentary and the preaching nature of Madonna's commentary in the film.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{photographer}} Steven Klein for an art installation project called X-Static Process. The installation portrayed Madonna in different incarnations of her spiritual practices– from yogi, prophet, queen to freak and pole dancer. The publication was a worldwide success, {{leading to a}} number of exhibitions in New York, London, Paris, Düsseldorf, Berlin and Florence. After the exhibition was over, Madonna was inspired by the images from the exhibitions and decided to incorporate them into her then unplanned tour and asked Klein to help her with the task. She then began developing her sixth concert tour called Re-Invention World Tour. The poster released for the tour used one of the images from the installation project. It featured Madonna in a seventeenth-century-style dress, crawling on all fours towards the camera. The central theme of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with different themes: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal segments. During the Q Awards, Elton John accused Madonna for lip-synching in her shows which gained great controversy but was denied by Madonna's representatives. Although musician Prince's Musicology Live 2004ever tour was initially projected to be the highest grossing tour of 2004, Billboard Boxscore published that the Re-Invention Tour had sold 55 out of the 56 shows and grossed $125 million. At the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards, Re-Invention Tour received the Top Tour while Madonna's tour manager Caresse Henry was awarded the Top Manager award. A documentary, titled I'm Going <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> a Secret, which chronicled the tour, was released in 2005.|$|E
