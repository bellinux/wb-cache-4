5|$|Parts of Greece were {{occupied}} by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify his policy and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the Venizelists. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured but his mother narrowly saved Princess Katherine by carrying her through <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> more than two kilometers. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived {{to deal with the}} blaze, sixteen people were killed.|$|E
5|$|As the British {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines and even in bends in the road, and each time the British would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> {{a half an hour}} looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position.|$|E

25|$|That night Saul is {{summoned to}} clean the dinner tables by SS-commandant Moll (Uwe Lauer). Biedermann walks in and is ordered to write {{up a list of}} seventy names. This leads Biedermann to believe that his unit will soon be gassed. Biedermann {{discloses}} the information to Abraham, who instructs Saul to head to the women's camp, where he will pick up a smuggled package of gunpowder from a prisoner named Ella. When Saul finds himself face to face with Ella, he clearly knows her. She calls him by name, clasps his hand, but he withdraws. After collecting the package, Saul deliberately falls into a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> execution. Saul again looks for a rabbi among the arrivals. A Frenchman named Braun (Todd Charmont) approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun {{as a member of the}} Sonderkommando and sneaks him into the camp. When Saul arrives at the camp he is confronted by Abraham and realizes that during the turmoil in the woods he has lost the package. On further questioning, he says that the dead boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true.|$|E

Spencer and 17-year-old Million {{were able to}} escape the attackers. Million escaped by jumping into the Pecatonica River, hiding in brush and making his way to Fort Hamilton. Spencer's escape was a longer process. He did not jump into the river, but hid along the banks. One of the attackers pursued him but Spencer killed the warrior before he could be overtaken. He wandered <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> several days before reaching Fort Hamilton.|$|E

Little of the {{aircraft}} would have remained, since it was created primarily from plywood and canvas. The parts most likely to endure would have been the engine and the aluminum fuel tanks. In Maine, bits and pieces of struts were found, and wood similar to the kind used to build the biplane. Engine metal was also found near the town of Machias, that was not typical to the United States or Canada.

[...] At the break of day, the New Englanders again set off toward the village, under orders from Church to drive any resistance before them. [...] The largest body of defenders fired on the raiders' right flank from behind trees and logs, but their fire was ineffective and they were driven off. [...] The raiders then entered the village and began plundering. [...] Some of the men broke into the liquor stores they found and began drinking, but Colonel Church quickly put a stop to that activity. [...] They {{spent the rest of the}} day destroying much of the village. [...] According to one of Church's dispatches, they destroyed 60 houses, 6 mills, and many barns, along with about 70 cattle.|$|E
500|$|Rousseau {{is named}} after French-Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Although Rousseau is French, actress Mira Furlan is Croatian, which led to {{speculation}} that Rousseau is not really from France. In one of the official Lost podcasts, producer Carlton Cuse joked, [...] "any French woman who speaks with a Croatian accent and {{has been living in}} <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> sixteen years eating bugs ... has got some issues, and those issues need to be overcome before she can actually go and embrace Alex". Furlan understood Rousseau's decision to not meet her daughter, believing that no one can ever be prepared for that moment. Furlan met Raymonde for the first time just minutes before shooting their reunion scene in the season three finale. The actors believed the scene to be a [...] "huge moment" [...] for their characters, which Furlan described as a [...] "basic human moment." [...] Furlan was glad to have [...] "such a beautiful partner," [...] and noted their physical resemblance.|$|E
500|$|The Blair Witch Project {{is thought}} to be the first widely {{released}} film marketed primarily by the Internet. The film's official website featured faux police reports and [...] "newsreel-style" [...] interviews. These augmented the film's found footage device to spark debates across the Internet over whether the film was a real-life documentary or a work of fiction. During screenings, the filmmakers made advertising efforts to promulgate the events in the film as factual, including the distribution of flyers at festivals such as the Sundance Film Festival, asking viewers to come forward with any information about the [...] "missing" [...] students. The campaign tactic was that viewers were being told, through missing persons posters, that the characters were missing while researching in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> the mythical Blair Witch. The IMDb page also listed the actors as [...] "missing, presumed dead" [...] {{in the first year of}} the film's availability. The film's website contains materials of actors posing as police and investigators giving testimony about their casework, and shared childhood photos of the actors to add a sense of realism.|$|E

500|$|Dama {{was born}} 26 May 1954 in Marolambo, near Toamasina. He earned a {{university}} degree in sociology {{and has served}} as a Deputy in the National Assembly. During his first term he represented Antananarivo, later moving to the rural district of Ambatofinandrahana where he was elected for a second term. Dama operates and hosts a local radio station, which serves as one of several fora for his efforts to educate the public on HIV/AIDS and good practice in the agriculture sector and in water management. Dama drew his musical influences from his father, who played guitar and sang the traditional songs of the Malagasy highlands, as well as his mother, who enjoyed writing short stories and articles about daily life in Madagascar. His father also frequently told stories of the 1947 Malagasy uprising, during which time he had been forced to flee and hide in <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> a six-month period; these stories developed in Dama and Raoul a skepticism toward politicians. Although raised a Catholic, as a child he sang in the local Protestant choir. He began composing lyrics at the age of eleven in French, but soon afterward was drawn to the [...] "musicality" [...] of the Malagasy language and wrote pieces in his mother tongue.|$|E

Both directions of NY32 lead to Saratoga National Historical Park, located just to the northeast of NY423's eastern terminus.|$|E

In 1998, she portrayed Della Green in the revival of St. Louis Woman, [...] and Carmen Jones in the 2002 Kennedy Center Special Performance of Carmen Jones. In the same year, she was also featured in the Tony/Drama Desk Award winning revival production of Stephen Sondheim's Into <b>the</b> <b>Woods,</b> <b>for</b> which she was nominated a Tony and Drama Desk Award for her performance as the Witch. [...] This production included songs revised for her. In 2010, Williams starred in a new Broadway musical revue entitled Sondheim on Sondheim, a look at Stephen Sondheim through his music, film and videotaped interviews. Sondheim ran from March 19 to June 13 at Studio 54 in New York City. In 2013, she starred as Jessie Mae Watts in the Horton Foote play The Trip to Bountiful, which was later turned into a 2014 television film.

2500|$|However, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the password was actually obtained by Lieutenant Colonel Harvey. According to an account given after the war by Frederick Snider, a neighbour of the Gages, Harvey had executed a ruse on the first sentry to be accosted. Pretending to be the American officer of the day making Grand Rounds, he approached the sentry and when challenged, came close to the sentry's ear as if to whisper the countersign. But with bayonet secreted in hand, he grabbed the surprised sentry by the throat and threw him to the ground. With the bayonet at his throat, the sentry gave up the password. This suggestion illustrates the incomplete research into several aspects of the Battle of Stoney Creek. Snider gave this account not long before his death in 1877 [...] and his source for it was the April 1871 issue of The Canadian Literary Journal. [...] Snider was confusing Harvey with Colonel Murray, June 1813 with December 1813 and Stoney Creek with Youngstown near Fort Niagara. Snider makes several obvious errors, such as [...] "the British General St. Vincent was found some days after wandering about in the woods nearly dead of hunger." [...] His name was Vincent and he did not wander about <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> days. [...] Snider's source for the provenance of the countersign should thus be considered to be unreliable.|$|E
2500|$|Male {{dominance}} is one thematic element {{found in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream. In A Midsummer Night's Dream, Lysander and Hermia escape into <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> a night {{where they do}} not fall under the laws of Theseus or Egeus. Upon their arrival in Athens, the couples are married. Marriage {{is seen as the}} ultimate social achievement for women while men can go on to do many other great things and gain social recognition. In The Imperial Votaress, Louis Montrose draws attention to male and female gender roles and norms present in the comedy in connection with Elizabethan culture. In reference to the triple wedding, he says, [...] "The festive conclusion in A Midsummer Night's Dream depends upon the success of a process by which the feminine pride and power manifested in Amazon warriors, possessive mothers, unruly wives, and wilful daughters are brought under the control of lords and husbands." [...] He says that the consummation of marriage is how power over a woman changes hands from father to husband. A connection between flowers and sexuality is drawn. The juice employed by Oberon can be seen as symbolising menstrual blood as well as the sexual blood shed by virgins. While blood as a result of menstruation is representative of a woman's power, blood {{as a result of a}} first sexual encounter represents man's power over women.|$|E
2500|$|The left {{battalion}} of the 7th Texas Infantry, and the 3rd Tennessee Infantry, wild with their easy {{victory over the}} 23rd Indiana Infantry, had pushed across the creek and past the 20th Ohio in a wave, encountering the Union battle line still standing in the woods. [...] For a few minutes, the Union line and Confederate line stood obscured in the thick woods and smoke and killed each other at short range, [...] "both lines [...] equally firm; both equally determined as a couple of bulldogs engaged in a death struggle". Just after Force returned to the creek bed, the Federal line was ordered to leave <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> {{the safety of the}} fence line, allowing the Union commanders to sort out what had happened. [...] In executing this movement, Colonel Richards was lost, and with him Manning Force's desperate plea for assistance. The Confederates, perceiving that the Federals were withdrawing, imagined that the Federal line was being forced back. [...] The rebels pushed forward with vigor, only to be ripped apart by a volley from federal troops now hiding behind the fence. [...] Aggravating the situation for the Confederates {{was the fact that the}} 31st Illinois, hearing the fighting erupt behind them, had merely to about-face from their position on the Union right flank, and step forward in line a few yards before they were in firing position to enfilade the line of the 3rd Tennessee Infantry.|$|E

2500|$|Byrne {{was born}} Jane Margaret Burke on May 24, 1933 at John B. Murphy Hospital in the Lake View {{neighborhood}} {{on the north}} side of Chicago, Illinois to Katherine Marie Burke (née Nolan), a stay at home wife and Edward Patrick Burke, vice president of Inland Steel. Raised on the city's north side, Byrne graduated from Saint Scholastica High School and attended St. Mary of <b>the</b> <b>Woods</b> <b>for</b> her freshman year of college. Byrne later transferred to Barat College, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and biology in 1965. Byrne entered politics to volunteer in John F. Kennedy's campaign for president in 1960. During that campaign she first met then Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. After meeting Daley, he appointed her to several positions beginning in 1964 with a job in the city's Head Start program. In June 1965, she was promoted and worked with the Chicago Committee of Urban Opportunity. In 1968, Byrne was appointed head of the City of Chicago's consumer affairs department. In 1972, Byrne served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and chairperson of the DNC resolutions committee in 1973. Byrne was appointed co–chairperson of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee by Daley, despite the rejection by the majority of Democratic leaders in 1975. The committee ousted Byrne shortly after Daley's death in late 1976. Shortly thereafter, Bryne accused the newly appointed mayor Michael Bilandic of being unfair to citizens of the city by placing a 12% increase on cab–fare which Byrne felt was the result of a [...] "backroom deal". Byrne was fired from her post of head of consumer affairs by Bilandic shortly after he was made aware of her charges against him in April 1977.|$|E
