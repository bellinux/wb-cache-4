5|$|In 2006, the {{municipality}} approved Lillestrøm SK's {{plans to build}} an indoor football pitch. The hall was inaugurated on 11 October 2007 and cost NOK62 million. In 2009, Lillestrøm launched itself as one of six candidate cities for Norway's joint bid with Sweden to host the UEFA Euro 2016. This would involve building a new venue seating between 35,000 and 44,000 in Lillestrøm. One of three potential locations was at Lillestrøm idrettspark. The stadium would be built in modules, so the upper tiers could be dismounted after the championship and installed on other venues.

Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid {{to host the}} 1972 Winter Olympics, with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, as environmental lobby groups strongly opposed <b>the</b> <b>bid,</b> which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chrétien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for <b>the</b> <b>bid,</b> which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan.

40|$|Bid {{opening in}} {{e-auction}} is e#cient when a homomorphic secret sharing function is employed to seal <b>the</b> <b>bids</b> and homomorphic secret reconstruction is employed to open <b>the</b> <b>bids.</b> However, this high e#ciency {{is based on}} an assumption: <b>the</b> <b>bids</b> are valid (e. g. within a special range). An undetected invalid bid can compromise correctness and fairness of the auction. Unfortunately, validity verification of <b>the</b> <b>bids</b> is ignored in the auction schemes employing homomorphic secret sharing (called homomorphic auction in this paper). In this paper, an attack against the homomorphic auction in <b>the</b> absence of <b>bid</b> validity check is presented and a necessary bid validity check mechanism is proposed.

5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> was rejected, the NPB team {{retained}} {{rights to}} the player.

40|$|Abstract—The 5 power {{generation}} groups of China have {{a feature of}} monopoly, so we apply a non-basic auction theory to make bidding rules {{in order to reduce}} the market power of power suppliers. Using non-basic auction theory, order statistics, and Monte Carlo simulation, we calculate <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> probabilities in different cases. Taking into account <b>bidding</b> probabilities and <b>the</b> revenue, we put forward <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> strategy models of the spot market and the spinning reserve market, which can be applied to calculate the power volume and <b>bid</b> in <b>the</b> multi-market so as to maximize profit and minimize <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> risk. Enough spinning reserve volume is important to the security and reliability of the electrical system, <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> strategy of spinning reserve market prompts power suppliers to bid, because they can get a rational profit and reduce <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> risk from <b>the</b> spinning reserve market. An example supports the validity of <b>the</b> multi-market <b>bidding</b> model. Keywords—Bidding strategy, Electrical market, Non-basic auction theory, Order statistic...|$|R
