5|$|As {{part of the}} game's {{conversion}} to Steamworks, Gold Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 26, 2015. Owners of the game from Steam or as a boxed retail Games For Windows Live can acquire a free Steamworks copy of the base game and purchase the new Gold Edition content.

5|$|Research is {{important}} in 4X games because technological progress is an engine for conquest. Battles are often won by superior military <b>technology</b> <b>or</b> greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically basic units remain important throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the show was {{operating}} on a strict budget, shots of the Chinese freighter were almost entirely created by digital <b>technology</b> <b>or</b> other special effects. For the opening scene of the ship at sea, a matte painting of a boat based on a toy model was superimposed onto a film strip of an empty ocean. Several scenes featuring the boat in port were created by filming an empty harbor and then superimposing a ship via digital technology. Special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich created a latex appliance that enabled the veterinarian to have his throat bitten out.|$|E
5|$|FLCN {{mutations}} are {{detected by}} sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means {{that some people}} with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are not detectable by current <b>technology,</b> <b>or</b> that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Venture capital (VC) {{is a type}} {{of private}} equity, a form of {{financing}} that is provided by firms or funds to small, early-stage, emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential, or which have demonstrated high growth (in terms of number of employees, annual revenue, or both). Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity, or an ownership stake, in the companies they invest in. Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky start-ups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful.
