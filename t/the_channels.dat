5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist.

5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E

In addition there are 21 regional or local DVB-T television channels. The HRT is also broadcasting a satellite TV channel. In 2016, there were 135 radio stations and 25 TV stations in Croatia.

5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took {{an hour and a}} half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{navigation}} {{was the subject}} of one of the last major attempts in the UK to attract commercial freight to the waterways. In 1983, it was upgraded to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard by deepening <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> and enlarging the locks as far as Rotherham. Conisbrough lock was removed altogether, and the two Eastwood locks were combined into one. The new lock was initially named the Sir Frank Price Lock, after the chairman of the British Waterways Board who formally opened it on 1 June 1983. The expected rise in freight traffic did not occur, however. At Kilnhurst and Long Sandall, the new larger locks were built alongside the original locks, and so a comparison of the relative sizes can be made.|$|E
5|$|However, British Waterways {{decided that}} their full {{restoration}} {{was an important}} aim in 2002, {{and the construction of}} the main stadium for the 2012 Summer Olympics on an island formed by the rivers provided funding to construct a new lock and sluices which stabilised water levels throughout the Olympic site. It was hoped that significant amounts of materials for the construction of the Olympic facilities would be delivered by barge, but this did not happen. Improvements to <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> which form a central feature of the Olympic Park included the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} 3 to over 30years. Adults of most species are of one sex {{throughout}} their lives. The gonads are masses of developing gametes (ova or sperm), and most species have four gonads, two in each valve. Those of articulates lie in <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> of the mantle lobes, while those of inarticulates lie near the gut. Ripe gametes float {{into the main}} coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity via the metanephridia, which open {{on either side of}} the mouth. Most species release both ova and sperm into the water, but females of some species keep the embryos in brood chambers until the larvae hatch.|$|E

However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts. Sediment was deposited in <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> and floodplains of large rivers. The rock facies of this formation suggest the presence of mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Speed Buggy {{lasted for}} one {{season with a}} total of sixteen episodes. Despite its short run, it was {{broadcast}} on the Big Three television networks years after its original run as <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> had purchased syndication rights. It was speculated that the series acquired a fan base due to its frequent rotation on American television. Critical response to Speed Buggy was generally positive; some critics enjoyed its shared themes with Josie & the Pussycats and Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, while others found it unmemorable and overly repetitive. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a four disc set.|$|E

5|$|The First Ostend Raid on 23 April 1918 {{was largely}} a failure, the blockships {{grounded}} too far from <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> to obstruct them.

In anticipation of a raid, the Germans had removed the navigation buoys and without them the British had difficulty finding the narrow channel into the harbour in poor weather. When they did discover the entrance, German resistance proved too strong for the operation to be completed as originally planned: the obsolete cruiser HMS Vindictive was sunk, but only partially blocked the channel.|$|E
