5|$|AXS TV, which {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} broadcast Wrestle Kingdom 9 from the TV Asahi Corporation, aired the event in five parts from October9 to November6, 2015, <b>to</b> <b>viewers</b> in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. Commentary was provided by Mauro Ranallo and Josh Barnett.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Dick Clark was {{well-known}} <b>to</b> <b>viewers</b> as {{the host}} of American Bandstand, a music series produced {{from the studios of}} Philadelphia television station WFIL-TV (now WPVI-TV) and broadcast by ABC (which itself aired a New Year's Eve special on December 31, 1959).|$|E
5|$|Jay Harrington, {{who plays}} Ted Crisp on the show, serves {{both as a}} main {{character}} and as an on-camera narrator. Throughout the show, he breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly <b>to</b> <b>viewers,</b> offering inside information and observations while the action continues around him. Another plot element {{involves the use of}} mock commercials for Veridian Dynamics, thematically related to individual episodes and placed at the end or beginning of actual commercial breaks in all but a couple of episodes.|$|E
50|$|After another {{commercial}} break, the banter {{continued with}} Ferguson sitting behind a desk. He usually read and responded <b>to</b> <b>viewer</b> e-mail and (since February 2010) Twitter messages for random responses <b>to</b> <b>viewer</b> questions.|$|R

5|$|Degrassi: The Next Generation is also {{available}} in various new media formats. Episodes are streamed on the websites of MuchMusic and TeenNick <b>to</b> <b>viewers</b> with Canadian or US IP addresses. Registered users of the Canadian and American iTunes Stores can purchase episodes for playback on home computers and certain iPods. In Canada, Puretracks also offers episodes for download. They are issued as a Windows Media 10 file, and the purchaser owns them forever, although the episodes can only be burned onto a disc three times and copied to a device three times. In the US, Zune and the Xbox Live Marketplace sell every episode of the series.|$|E
5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} not limited <b>to</b> <b>viewers</b> {{in their forties}} as the focus on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. The plots include characters and situations for all ages, and the series' general tone is family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such as men showing their emotions and women having greater autonomy in their lives) than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{notes that}} he was {{surprised}} {{they were allowed to}} do the pickle gag, which consisted of Stewie placing a cucumber on the sofa where Patrick's imaginary wife is sitting, but inserting it into her imaginary vagina (to see if it would turn into a pickle), but suggests that maybe broadcasting standards did not fully understand the scene. The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom <b>to</b> <b>viewers.</b> The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George W. Bush is portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E

50|$|The three subgenres of Modern Allegorism include whimsical, inspirational/spiritual, and paradoxical. These subgenres {{describe}} the mechanism {{through which the}} artist conveys the message. Whimsical modern allegories use humor in a non-critical fashion <b>to</b> encourage the <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> question their own perspectives and behavior. Inspirational/spiritual modern allegories attempt <b>to</b> inspire the <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> believe in their own abilities and trust their innate gifts. Paradoxical modern allegories position common elements {{in ways that are}} contrary <b>to</b> the <b>viewer's</b> expectation in order <b>to</b> encourage the <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the commonplace and see their own preconceptions in a new light.|$|R

5|$|The Dawn of Love {{intentionally}} {{presents a}} moral dilemma <b>to</b> <b>viewers.</b> By his open depiction of nudity and sensuality, Etty makes {{the same argument}} as that presented by Comus, that it is rational for the viewer to succumb to their lustful thoughts while in private. The picture presents the same moral challenge to the viewer as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to her better, moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering to desire.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} at the Paley Center for Media in New York City on October 20, 2010. It {{was shown in}} conjunction with the Robert M. Batscha University Seminar Series. The Paley Center screening included an online streaming broadcast—the first simultaneous film screening and panel question-and-answer for online and local audiences. The panel discussion was moderated by The New York Times journalist Noam Cohen, and featured both co-directors, in addition to Wikimedia Foundation representative Samuel Klein and Wikipedian in Residence at the British Museum Liam Wyatt. After the event, SnagFilms subsequently made the film available for free for six days <b>to</b> <b>viewers</b> in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Channel 4 {{was also}} accused of showing too many studio {{segments}} {{during the first}} few days of the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds set a new personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed {{during the first few}} days to explain Paralympic events and the classification system <b>to</b> <b>viewers,</b> and that it was operating three additional channels' worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount of live coverage was also affected by Olympic Broadcasting Services, who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to these}} delays, Urobuchi issued an apology <b>to</b> <b>viewers.</b> However, he also {{indicated}} that the postponements could be viewed {{in a positive light}} because they alleviated some production pressures placed on animation studio Shaft due to the tight broadcast schedule. Citing particularly challenging drawings for episodes 11 and 12, Urobuchi and Iwakami planned to have Shaft continue to improve the episodes immediately up until their new air time. Furthermore, Urobuchi remarked that if episode 11 in its current state had been aired as scheduled, the result most likely would have been disappointing. On March 23, 2011, the broadcast {{for the rest of the}} series was delayed indefinitely. However, the production team reported that they were continuing to work on the episodes and announced their intention to finish airing the series by April. Finally, on April 10, 2011, the official website for Puella Magi Madoka Magica announced that broadcasts would resume on April 21. Episodes 11 and 12 aired back-to-back on MBS to conclude the series, while TBS and CBC ran episode 10 in addition to 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{proceedings}} of the Parliament of Australia, Parliament of Canada, Parliament of the United Kingdom (usually Prime Minister's Questions and the State Opening of Parliament) and other governments are shown on C-SPAN when they discuss matters of importance <b>to</b> <b>viewers</b> in the U.S. Similarly, the networks will sometimes broadcast news reports {{from around the world}} when major events occur – for instance, C-SPAN broadcast CBC Television coverage of the September 11 attacks. C-SPAN also covers lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda and funerals of former presidents and other notable individuals. In 2005, C-SPAN covered Hurricane Katrina through NBC affiliate WDSU in New Orleans, as well as coverage of Hurricane Ike via CBS affiliate KHOU in Houston. C-SPAN also carries CBC coverage during events that affect Canadians, such as the Canadian federal elections, the death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau, and the 2003 North America blackout. During early 2011, C-SPAN carried broadcasts by Al Jazeera to cover the events in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab nations. Additionally, C-SPAN simulcasts NASA Space Shuttle mission launches and landings live, using video footage and audio sourced from NASA TV.|$|E
