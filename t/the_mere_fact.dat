5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that St. Jerome responded to the idea {{is a testament to the}} belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. <b>The</b> <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that an {{application}} for compulsory sequestration is brought by a creditor who is prepared to co-operate with the debtor, or who is motivated partly {{by a desire to}} assist the debtor, does not preclude the granting of a sequestration order.

If I set a house on fire, it is quite true that I may illuminate many other people's weaknesses as well as my own. It may be that the master of the house was burned because he was drunk: it may be that the mistress of the house was burned because she was stingy, and perished arguing about the expense of a fire-escape. It is, nevertheless, broadly true that they both were burned because I set fire to their house.

Second, this kind of learning meant that they were [...] "better prepared to evaluate that institutions {{that are supposed to}} meet our health needs [...] [...] [...]". Third, the historical lack of self-knowledge about the female body [...] "had had one major consequence - pregnancy" [...] and through greater information, women will have more ability to make proactive choices about when to get pregnant. Fourth, information about one's body is perhaps the most essential kind of education, because [...] "bodies are the physical bases from which we move out into the world". Without this basic information, women are alienated from their own body and necessarily on unequal footing with men.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> {{that the}} U-505 was {{captured}} and towed — rather than sunk after the codebooks {{had been taken}} — was considered to have endangered the Ultra secret. The US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral King, considered court-martialling Captain Gallery. To protect the secret, U-505s crewmen, who knew of the U-boat's capture, were isolated from other prisoners of war; the Red Cross were denied access to them. Ultimately, the Kriegsmarine declared the crew dead and informed the families to that effect. The last of the German crew was not returned until 1947.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} a fair hearing {{requires}} that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, {{and the opportunity to}} present their own case. <b>The</b> <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice.

25|$|Donald Akenson, Professor of Irish Studies in the {{department}} of history at Queen's University has argued that, with very few exceptions, the historians attempting to reconstruct a biography of the man apart from <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> <b>facts</b> of his existence and crucifixion have not followed sound historical practices. He has stated that there is an unhealthy reliance on consensus, for propositions, which should otherwise be based on primary sources, or rigorous interpretation. He also identifies a peculiar downward dating creep, and holds that some of the criteria being used are faulty. He says that the overwhelming majority of biblical scholars are employed in institutions whose roots are in religious beliefs. Because of this, more than any other group in present-day academia, biblical historians are under immense pressure to theologize their historical work. It is only through considerable individual heroism, that many biblical historians have managed to maintain the scholarly integrity of their work.|$|R

60|$|February 8th.--I read to-day, in {{the little}} office-Bible (greasy with perjuries) St. Luke's account of the agony, the trial, the crucifixion, and the resurrection; and how Christ {{appeared}} to the two disciples, {{on their way to}} Emmaus, and afterwards to a company of disciples. On both these latter occasions he expounded the Scriptures to them, and showed the application of the old prophecies to himself; and it is to be supposed that he made them fully, or at least sufficiently, aware what his character was,--whether God, or man, or both, or something between, together with all other essential points of doctrine. But none of this doctrine or of these expositions is recorded, <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> <b>facts</b> being most simply stated, and the conclusion to which he led them, that, whether God himself, or the Son of God, or merely the Son of man, he was, at all events, the Christ foretold in the Jewish Scriptures.

25|$|However, in Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110 (1954), the Supreme Court {{held that}} when a {{contractor}} was merely the federal government's purchasing agent, the legal incidence of the tax fell on the United States and hence the tax was invalid. Further rulings by the Supreme Court, however, indicated that Kern-Limerick has extremely limited implications for Supremacy Clause jurisprudence and the ruling {{is limited to the}} facts in that case. States countered by imposing use taxes on corporations instead, and the Supreme Court upheld such taxes in United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39 (1964.) The Court also held in United States v.

The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was ultra vires the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.|$|E

25|$|The {{first trial}} for piracy {{was of the}} 13 men, {{including}} Captain Thomas H. Baker, captured on privateer Savannah.

To increase pressure on Washington, the prisoners of war who would have been executed in retaliation were selected and their names made known. The trial went to the jury on the seventh day, but the next day the jury announced that it was deadlocked. The prisoners were sent back to prison to await a second trial. The United States government, however, had decided that it would no longer press the charges. The thirteen men would not be regarded as pirates, but as prisoners of war. They later were exchanged. The decision in effect meant that Washington was conceding the rights of belligerency to those who took up arms against it at sea.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|E
25|$|The dissent {{also took}} issue {{with most of the}} majority's conclusions. Federal {{immunity}} from taxation stemmed not from the common law but from the federal nature of the American system of government, he said. He admitted that Dravo Contracting was not an instrumentality of the federal government, but concluded that the tax did burden the government. Citing Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460 (1881); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Attorney General, 125 U.S. 530 (1888); and Massachusetts v. Western Union Tel. Co., 141 U.S. 40 (1891), McReynolds noted that none of these cases turned on the unique contractual relationship between the private company and the government (as the majority had distinguished them) but rather on <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that a tax was laid on a corporation engaged in carrying out the duties assigned to it by the federal government under its constitutional mandates. The Court had long held, he claimed, that taxes (such as an estate tax on an estate that held government bonds) which only indirectly impinged on the relationship between the federal government and a private entity were valid. But if a tax on the contract itself were permitted, there would be no end to unlimited taxation on the federal government, he warned.|$|E

At the same time the pope appointed Dom Sebastião de São Pedro, Augustinians (O.(E.)S.A.), who had been presented by the King of Portugal, to be the first bishop of Saint Thomas of Mylapur, and granted Philip and his heirs and successors in perpetuity the right of patronage ("Padroado") and presentation to the see, and the benefices that might be created therein, by <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> <b>facts</b> of their creation and dotation.
