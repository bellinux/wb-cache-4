5|$|Mary Shelley's first concern {{during these}} years was the welfare of Percy Florence. She honoured her late husband's wish that his son attend public school, and, with Sir Timothy's grudging help, had him educated at Harrow. To avoid {{boarding}} fees, she moved to Harrow on the Hill herself so that Percy could attend as a day scholar. Though Percy went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, and dabbled in politics and the law, he {{showed no sign of}} his parents' gifts. He was devoted <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> after he left university in 1841, he came to live with her.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1888, Gandhi aged 18, left Porbandar for Bombay (Mumbai). Upon arrival, {{he stayed}} with the local Modh Bania {{community}} {{while waiting for the}} ship travel arrangements. The head of the community knew Gandhi's father. After learning Gandhi's plans, he and other elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Gandhi informed them of his promise <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> her blessings. The local chief disregarded it, and excommunicated him an outcast. But Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London. His brother saw him off.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 2009, an 18-year-old male {{member of}} Anonymous {{ran into the}} New York Scientology {{building}} shirtless and covered with Vaseline, pubic hair, and toenail clippings. He then proceeded to toss books around and smear the mixture on objects in the building. The man, identified by police as Mahoud Samed Almahadin, was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and aggravated harassment as hate crimes. Two weeks later, 21-year-old film student and Anonymous member Jacob Speregen was charged with aggravated harassment and criminal mischief as hate crimes after he filmed Almahadin carrying out his prank. According <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> the video, Speregen was filming the event from behind the barricade. Scientology critics Mark Bunker and Jason Beghe disagreed with the individual's actions.|$|E

25|$|In November 1973, the Millennium '73 festival {{was held}} in the Houston Astrodome, and {{although}} this was near the height of Rawat's media fame, attendance was far lower than expected. When he turned 16, Rawat became emancipated and got married. He cut ties <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> eldest brother, and with the original Indian DLM organization. He retained control of the DLM everywhere else (at this point it was established in 55 countries).|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1900, King Alexander {{suddenly}} announced his engagement to the widowed Madame Draga Mašin, formerly a lady-in-waiting <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> 12 years older than him. The proposed union aroused great opposition: not only was Draga of unequal birth and obscure family, but at 36 years of age, the chances of her bearing an heir were slim. Alexander was an only child, and it was imperative to secure the succession.|$|E
60|$|It was half-past four; {{we had no}} time to lose. I {{thought for}} a minute. Andrea would have <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>and</b> find the needful clothes, then come back; it would all take time, and time meant life and death. Then, the sight of a young and {{beautiful}} woman might arouse the guard's attention, and Giulia might be recognised.|$|R

25|$|Emperor Paul disliked {{everything}} that was dear <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> Quarenghi's architecture obviously fell into this category. After the emperor took the Maltese knights under his protection, Quarenghi also joined the Order and served as its official architect until 1800. His commissions became less frequent, as the monotonous rhythm of solemn collonnades and the laconic clarity of symmetrical compositions appeared boring to those courtiers who had found Quarenghi's designs so delightful a decade earlier.|$|E
25|$|Lunel was keen {{to focus}} on all aspects of Stendhal's novel: historical, political, sentimental, but the final text {{concentrates}} on the latter, for which Sauguet's music effected a progressive ascension towards a more pure and rarefied love. The libretto starts when Fabrice, refusing military heroics, has made a clandestine return <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> aunt Gina near the Swiss-Italian frontier, thus first seeing Clélia. All chapters of Book I: the arrival of Napoleon and his followers in Lombardy, Fabrice's military exploits and Waterloo; are left out.|$|E
25|$|By 1871, Whistler {{returned}} to portraits and soon produced {{his most famous}} painting, the nearly monochromatic full-length figure entitled Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1, but usually (and incorrectly) referred to as Whistler's Mother. A model failed to appear one day, according to a letter from his mother, so Whistler turned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> suggested that he do her portrait. In his typically slow and experimental way, at first he had her stand, but that proved too tiring so the famous seated pose was adopted. It took dozens of sittings to complete.|$|E

50|$|One related story {{turns the}} motif on its head: after {{matching}} him in swimming {{and in other}} shooting contests, King Olaf of Norway converted Eindriði Pansa (the Splay-Footed) from heathenry by shooting at either a chess piece or a writing tablet on Eindriði's son's head. The king's shot narrowly missed but the boy was unharmed; Eindriði gave in <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>and</b> sister's pleas and did not try the feat himself.|$|R

25|$|The novel {{opens with}} images from Kiyoaki's childhood, {{in the years}} after the Russo-Japanese War: {{including}} a torchlight procession witnessed by Honda, a photograph of memorial services at Tokuriji on 26 June 1904, a lyrical description of the Matsugae estate near Shibuya, a visit by Emperor Meiji, and an account of Kiyoaki's role as a page for Princess Kasuga during New Year's Festivities at the Imperial Palace. We are introduced <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> grandmother, to Shigeyuki Iinuma, his hostile tutor, and to the serious Honda, a friend from the Peers School.|$|E
25|$|Ramakrishna's {{father died}} in 1843, after which family {{responsibilities}} fell on his elder brother Ramkumar. This loss drew him closer <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> he spent his time in household activities and daily worship of the household deities and became more involved in contemplative activities such as reading the sacred epics. When Ramakrishna was in his teens, the family's financial position worsened. Ramkumar started a Sanskrit school in Calcutta and {{also served as a}} priest. Ramakrishna moved to Calcutta in 1852 with Ramkumar to assist in the priestly work.|$|E
25|$|Burton {{was born}} in Indianapolis, the son of Bonnie L. (née Hardesty) and Charles W. Burton. His father, a former policeman, was abusive <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> never held a job for very long. The family moved constantly, living in trailer parks, cabins, and motels. In June 1950, some years after the couple divorced, his mother {{went to the police}} and got a {{restraining}} order against his father. He responded by kidnapping Burton's mother. Burton and his younger brother and sister were briefly sent to the Marion County Children's Guardian Home. After his mother escaped, Burton's father went to jail for two years. Burton's mother remarried, and Burton and his younger brother and sister had happier teenage years.|$|E

Blackford at first disliked his stepfather, but the two developed a close relationship as he grew older. The family continued to prosper, and when Blackford finally inherited his portion of his father’s estate he received $5,550.

Educated in Italy and Romania, Ovid Jr trained as a schoolteacher and then became a press officer at the Interior Ministry. He also had prospects of becoming a writer, and is especially remembered for a 1937 novel, Stăpânul ("The Master"). He adhered <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> uncle's fascist ideology: he was {{a staff writer for the}} Iron Guard paper Porunca Vremii, translated the political essays of Mussolini and Antonio Beltramelli, and campaigned in support of Italy during the Ethiopian War.
