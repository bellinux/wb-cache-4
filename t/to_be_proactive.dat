5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected her voice for both speaking and singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box. In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series Why Not? with Shania Twain.

25|$|Staff {{meetings}} were always held on Fridays in the Astronaut Office {{and it was}} here that Collins found himself on January 27, 1967. Don Gregory was running the meeting in the absence of Alan Shepard and so it was he who answered the red phone to be informed that there was a fire in the Apollo 1 CM. When the enormity of the situation was ascertained, it fell on Collins to go the Chaffee household to tell Martha Chaffee that her husband was dead. The Astronaut Office had learned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proactive</b> in informing astronauts' families of a death quickly, because of the death of Theodore Freeman in an aircraft crash, when a newspaper reporter was the first to his house.|$|E
500|$|Daley, at {{the time}} the Cook County State's Attorney, has been accused by the Illinois General Assembly of failing to act on {{information}} he possessed on the conduct of Burge and others. [...] Daley has acknowledged his responsibility <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proactive</b> in stopping torture, but denies any knowledge which could have made him responsible. On July 19, 2006, US Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. issued a press release calling Mayor Daley culpable, possibly even criminally culpable, for his failure to prosecute until the statute of limitations had run out. Jackson called for an investigation to determine if there was any planned delay in order to allow the cases to expire. Death penalty opponents requested that U.S. President Bill Clinton follow Ryan's lead in halting executions.|$|E
500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} benefits to {{this form of}} custody arrangement. One main benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents are legal equals, which means that both parents influence important decisions in the child's upbringing, which leads to less animosity and negativity between the parents, along with encouraging both parents <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proactive</b> in the child's upbringing. A second benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents exhibit a feeling of well being knowing they are working together in making decisions based on what their child's/children's needs are. This form of joint custody enables parents to focus solely on the children, {{with the emphasis on}} {{the health and well-being of}} the child/children. [...] By doing so, this has the potential to reverse some of the emotional effects on the children in the long-run. [...] Another benefit of joint legal custody is that it fosters an environment in which the parents of the child have some form of a means of communication in which open dialogue can lead to ensuring a safe, nurturing environment for the child.|$|E

2500|$|Those who {{are able}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proactive</b> can often {{overcome}} stressors {{and are more likely}} to be able to cope well with unexpected situations. [...] On the other hand, those who are more reactive will often experience more noticeable effects from an unexpected stressor. In the case of those who are passive, victims of a stressful event are more likely to suffer from long-term traumatic effects and often enact no intentional coping actions. These observations may suggest that the level of trauma associated with a victim is related to such independent coping abilities.|$|E
2500|$|Youth {{empowerment}} examines six interdependent dimensions: psychological, community, organizational, economic, {{social and}} cultural. [...] Psychological empowerment enhances individual's consciousness, belief in self-efficacy, awareness {{and knowledge of}} problems and solutions and of how individuals can address problems that harm their quality of life. This dimension aims to create self-confidence and give youth the skills to acquire knowledge. Community empowerment focuses on enhancing the community through leadership development, improving communication, and creating a network of support to mobilize the community to address concerns. Organizational empowerment aims to create a base of resources for a community, including voluntary organizations, unions and association that aim to protect, promote and advocate for the powerless. Economic empowerment teaches entrepreneurial skills, how to take ownership of their assets and how to have income security. Social empowerment teaches youth about social inclusion and literacy as well as helping kids find the resources <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proactive</b> in their communities. Cultural empowerment aims to recreate cultural practices and redefine cultural rules and norms for youth. Through these dimensions of empowerment, programs can work on empowering youth {{in one or more}} aspects of their lives.|$|E
2500|$|The San Jose University Library {{became one}} of the first {{academic}} libraries to pay attention to the needs of homeless people and implement changes to better serve this population. In 2007, the merged University Library and Public Library made the choice <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>proactive</b> in reaching out. Collaborations with nonprofit organizations in the area culminated in computer classes being taught, as well as nutrition classes, family literacy programs, and book discussion groups. After eighteen months, the library staff felt they still were not doing enough and [...] "analyzed program participation trends supplemented by observation and anecdotes" [...] in order to better understand the information needs of homeless people. When it was understood that these needs are complex, additional customer service training was provided to all staff who were interested. Once the staff more fully understood the needs of homeless people, it was determined that many programs in place already, with a few minor adjustments, would be helpful to homeless people. Programs were tailored to meet these needs. Additional changes implemented included temporary computer passes and generous in-house reading space to counteract the policies in place that may prevent a homeless person from obtaining a library card. New York Public Library offers services to homeless people that are residing in shelters.|$|E

40|$|Newspaper editorials have a mixed {{reputation}} in the public affairs community. While many previous studies have examined final editorial products as published, few have studied their actual production, {{and there is little}} research regarding the people and interests who attempt to influence editorial writing. This article takes a qualitative look at the forces that go into the production of editorials, specifically through a case study of 66 editorials over ten years in The Star-Ledger covering the debate over a sports arena in Newark, New Jersey. The arena project spanned five governors, two mayors, and had significant local, state, and regional implications. This study is unique for its access to the participants in the arena debate, and the wealth of time these elites gave us through the interviewing process.
