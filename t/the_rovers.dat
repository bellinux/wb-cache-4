5|$|Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> Annuals were {{produced}} {{every year from}} 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> never made the leap from page to screen, although he did make an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over in 1999, {{in the form of}} a cardboard cut-out. on 10 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> first {{appeared}} on 11 September 1954, as a weekly feature in the comic magazine Tiger, debuting {{on the front page}} of the first issue. After 22years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers,</b> launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features. At the peak of the comic's success about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback annuals and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> was serialised in the now defunct Today newspaper. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. Between 1988 and 1993, a Best of Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{different}} players scored for <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> {{first team}} in 2006–07. The team scored 74 goals in all competitions {{during the course}} of the season. The top goalscorer was Richard Walker, who finished the season on 23 goals.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Betty celebrates 30 {{years of}} working at <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return with a party {{attended}} by all the regulars. She considers retiring in 2002 and briefly moves to Wimbledon to be with Gordon and his wife Caroline (Elaine Donnelly; Sarah Thurstan). Feeling that Caroline does not want her there, Betty considers moving into a retirement home, however is convinced to stay in Weatherfield by her close friend Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire). Around the time of Betty's fortieth anniversary at <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return, she is sacked by new manager Poppy Morales (Sophiya Haque) after clashing with her on several occasions. Landlord Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) eventually tires of Poppy's poor treatment of the staff and fires her. Betty is re-instated, and plays the fairy godmother in the 2009 Rovers Return Christmas pantomime performance of Cinderella. In early February 2010, Betty has a party in <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> celebrating both her 90th birthday {{and the fact that}} she is the oldest barmaid in Weatherfield; however it backfires when 91-year-old Enid Crump (June Broughton) crashes the party and claims she is the oldest barmaid not Betty. Later Enid becomes sick after Steve serves her a 3-month old hotpot. Betty and Steve are left terrified when they realise that the hotpot could kill her, but she later recovers. During the Tram Crash of December 2010 Betty comforts Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) after her husband Ashley (Steven Arnold) is tragically crushed to death by the rubble.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> {{fans have}} good {{relations}} with Spanish club CE Sabadell FC, which initially began due to several Rovers fans noticing that the club had the same colours. Plans are being made for a pre-season friendly between the two clubs in July 2016.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} no new {{material}} since 2001, but reprints of the strip have appeared online and in print. The Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> website has archived all of the Match of the Day years' material, in addition to excerpts from other classic strips. In October 2007, Setanta bought the original strips, which they featured on their web site.|$|E

5|$|Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> is a British {{comic strip}} {{about the life}} and times of a fictional footballer named Roy Race, who played for Melchester Rovers. The strip first {{appeared}} in the Tiger in 1954, before giving its name to a weekly (and later monthly) comic magazine, published by IPC and Fleetway from 1976 until 1995, in which it was the main feature.|$|E
5|$|The story {{followed}} Roy Race, a striker for {{the fictional}} football team Melchester Rovers, based {{in a town}} {{of the same name}} in an unspecified part of England, where Roy lived with his family. In the first episode, a teenaged Roy and his best friend, Blackie Gray, signed for <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> after being spotted playing for a youth club team. Eight months later, Roy and Blackie made their first-team debuts against Elbury Wanderers in a game that ended in a 3–3 draw, with Roy scoring twice. He soon became a star, leading the team to either the Football League title or a cup almost every season. In January 1975 he was made player-manager, a position he retained for most of the next 20years. Although the strip followed <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> through nearly 40seasons, Roy did not age at the same rate and appeared to be at most in his late thirties by the time the weekly comic ended. This unrealistic longevity was never remarked upon by the weekly comic, although the monthly comic attempted to address the anomaly by explaining that more than one Roy Race had played for Melchester over the years.|$|E

5|$|A Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> {{computer}} game was released, on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1988. It was {{split into two}} parts: the first an adventure game, in which– taking the role of Roy Race– the player had to find and rescue the kidnapped Melchester team, before then playing the second part, which consisted of a charity match {{to raise funds for}} the club. The fewer players recovered before the match began, then the smaller the team who could take part. In the extreme, Roy would be the only player for Melchester. The game received mixed reactions; the Spectrum version received 7/10 from Your Sinclair, but only 3/10 from Sinclair User.|$|E
5|$|Betty and {{her husband}} Cyril move to Coronation Street in June 1969, helping her sister Maggie to run the local corner shop {{following}} the breakup of Maggie's marriage to Les Clegg. Maggie, however, resents Betty's interference and persuades landlord Jack Walker (Arthur Leslie) to give Betty {{a job as a}} barmaid at <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return Inn public house. Betty clashes with the landlady Annie (Doris Speed), who fears that Jack may find her attractive, and fires Betty as a result. Betty takes a job in a rival pub, and returns only when Annie apologises. Betty becomes close friends with fellow barmaid Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), who on occasion lodges with her, uses Betty as a chaperone on dates, and frequently seeks her advice in running her life.|$|E
5|$|Lewis is {{hired by}} Claudia Colby to {{accompany}} her to the Weatherfield Traders' Association Christmas party. Claudia introduces Lewis to her friend, Audrey Roberts, and he flirts with her. Audrey learns Lewis is a male escort and she later hires him to be her date for the Stylists' Dinner. Audrey contacts Lewis again and invites him {{to have dinner with}} her, but she becomes apprehensive and pretends to be ill when he arrives. Lewis persuades Audrey to let him into her home and he listens while she talks about her late husband. They then go out for dinner. Lewis visits <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return in Coronation Street and pretends not to know Audrey. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) recognises Lewis from the Christmas party and when he sees Lewis kissing Audrey, he jumps to the conclusion that they are having an affair.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 100 was {{announced}} in October 1959 it was described as the replacement for <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 90 and <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 105.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rover</b> has an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that {{provides}} 3-axis information on its position, {{which is used}} in <b>rover</b> navigation. <b>The</b> <b>rover's</b> computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> operational, such as by regulating <b>the</b> <b>rover's</b> temperature. Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to <b>the</b> <b>rover.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> 60 was {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 80 which used {{an updated version of}} the overhead-valve 2286 cc (138 in³) four used in <b>the</b> Land <b>Rover</b> of that time. <b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> 80 was announced 24 October 1959.|$|R
5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and {{expected}} <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that {{made it difficult for}} the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E
5|$|After Joe Colquhoun departed, he was succeeded {{first by}} Paul Trevillion, then by Yvonne Hutton, who {{illustrated}} from 1967 to 1974, before David Sque {{took over in}} 1975. Despite reportedly not being a football fan, {{he was responsible for}} one of the strip's more definitive looks in its early '80s period. He was replaced in 1986 by former 2000AD artist Mike White, who gave Roy a more muscular look and the strip a more modern feel. Barrie Mitchell took over in 1992, with a style quite similar to White's. A number of artists worked on the monthly comic, such as David Jukes, Sean Longcroft and Garry Marshall, in contrast to the lengthy tenures of the weekly strip's creative team. Tony Harding often illustrated Roy for the Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> annuals and also drew the Roy's Action Replay strip that appeared in All Action Monthly in the late eighties (Fleetway). Mitchell returned in 1997 as the sole artist of the Match of the Day strips for all four years.|$|E
5|$|Audrey and David begin feuding {{over the}} rights to the salon and Lewis notices that the arguing is taking its toll on Audrey's health. He {{suggests}} they go to Wales for a few days instead. When Audrey serves David with an injunction to try and reclaim her business, an argument breaks out and Audrey suffers a heart attack. Lewis comforts Audrey until the ambulance arrives and stays with her at the hospital. Lewis and Audrey go on holiday. On her return, Audrey reveals to her family that Lewis disappeared from the Eurostar on the way home. Lewis later turns up at the salon to see Audrey and explains that he disappeared because he saw Penny Thornley (Susan Hanson), a woman he once conned. Lewis asks Audrey to run away with him and she agrees. While they are packing, Audrey's family and Penny arrive. Penny reveals that she is going to call the police, but Audrey stops her and gives her the money Lewis took. When Nick refuses to give Lewis his job back, Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) hires him to work at <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return.|$|E
50|$|In many export markets, {{including}} Italy and France, <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> Metro was badged as <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 100 series, {{with the}} 1.1 known as <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 111 and <b>the</b> 1.4 called 114.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rover</b> has an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that {{provides}} 3-axis information on its position, {{which is used}} in <b>rover</b> navigation. <b>The</b> <b>rover's</b> computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> operational, such as by regulating <b>the</b> <b>rover's</b> temperature. Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to <b>the</b> <b>rover.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rover</b> installed its full surface operations software after the landing because its computers did not have sufficient main memory available during flight. The new software essentially replaced the flight software.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rover</b> {{contains}} accelerometers {{to detect}} which way is down (toward {{the surface of}} Mars) by measuring the pull of gravity. <b>The</b> <b>rover</b> computer then commanded the correct lander petal to open to place <b>the</b> <b>rover</b> upright.

5|$|Becky confronts Kylie after a bad {{reference}} {{that she}} provided to an adoption agency. At first Kylie pretends {{that she has}} a privileged life in order to impress Becky but it soon emerges that she is on the streets. She then moves into <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return Inn and instantaneously sparks a conflict with Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Becky and Steve soon discover {{that she has a}} four-year-old son called Max, whose custody she seeks. She sells Steve's motorbike and tries to sleep with him. After visiting Max at the foster parents' home, she takes him home. She sleeps with Gary Windass (Mikey North). Kylie is awarded custody of her son. Later she steals money from the till at Roy's Rolls, and jets off to Cyprus on holiday and leaves Max in Becky's care. She returns {{a couple of weeks later}} with a new boyfriend, Demetri. She tells Becky that she has come back to take Max to live in Cyprus, leaving Becky heartbroken. Kylie sees Becky's desperation as she cannot have children and offers to give Max to her in exchange for 20,000 pounds. Becky complies and Kylie leaves.|$|E
5|$|Becky starts dating local builder Jason Grimshaw, {{but after}} being {{with him for}} several months, she cheats on him with pub {{landlord}} Steve McDonald. Jason and Becky move in together, but when Jason's ex-wife Sarah Grimshaw (Tina O'Brien) reveals she is considering coming home, he ends things with Becky. Becky attacks Jason in <b>The</b> <b>Rovers</b> Return pub and then goes on a pub crawl, getting drunk and stealing a girl's purse in a nightclub, flashing her breasts in public, and vandalising a travel agency window and a police car. When the police bring Becky in for questioning over her actions, she encounters DC Hooch (Dominic Carter), an adversary from her past. Becky claims to have been with Steve {{on the night of}} her rampage and blackmails him to give her a false alibi, threatening to tell his partner Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) about their one-night stand.|$|E
5|$|Football-themed {{stories were}} {{a staple of}} British comics for boys from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of <b>the</b> <b>Rovers</b> was the most popular. To keep the strip exciting, Melchester was almost every year either {{competing}} for major honours or struggling against relegation to a lower division; a normal, uneventful season of mid-table mediocrity was unknown at Melchester Rovers. The strip followed {{the structure of the}} actual English football season, thus there were several months each year in summer when there was no league football. By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic regularly for only three or four years, therefore storylines were sometimes recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at least four times. Roy also made numerous appearances for England, depicted playing alongside actual players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis.|$|E
50|$|First {{introduced}} into <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 800 {{series with the}} 1996 facelift, including <b>the</b> flagship <b>Rover</b> Sterling Saloon and Coupe models, it has since also powered <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 75 and its sister car, the MG ZT, as well as <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> 45 and <b>the</b> MG ZS.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, BMW sold <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> {{and related}} MG car {{activities}} of <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> Group to <b>the</b> Phoenix Consortium, who established <b>the</b> MG <b>Rover</b> Group at Longbridge. BMW retained ownership of <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> marque, allowing MG Rover {{to use it}} under licence. In April 2005, Rover branded cars ceased to be produced when <b>the</b> MG <b>Rover</b> Group became insolvent.|$|R
50|$|The company traded as Rover, {{manufacturing}} cars between 1904 and 1967, when it {{was sold}} to Leyland Motor Corporation, becoming <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> marque. <b>The</b> <b>Rover</b> marque was used on cars produced by British Leyland (BL), who separated the assets of <b>the</b> original <b>Rover</b> Company as Land Rover in 1978 whilst <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> trademark continued to be used on vehicles produced by its successor companies - <b>the</b> Austin <b>Rover</b> Group (1982-1986), <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> Group (1986-2000), and then finally MG Rover (2000-2005). Following MG Rover's collapse in 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> marque became dormant, and was subsequently sold by BMW to Ford, who had bought Land Rover from BMW in 2000. The rights to <b>the</b> <b>Rover</b> brand were transferred along with the Jaguar Cars and Land Rover businesses, to Tata Motors in 2008.|$|R
