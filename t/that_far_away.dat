5|$|The Regional Finals {{were not}} all <b>that</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from Knoxville– the Lady Vols {{only had to}} travel a couple of hours, to Nashville, where they faced 5th-seeded Rutgers, 22–9. Rutgers had survived two close games to reach this point, {{defeating}} 12th-seeded Oregon, 79–76, in the first round, and then upsetting 4th-seeded Iowa State, 62–61 in the second. Their third-round game was not quite so close. Although Rutgers only trailed by two {{towards the end of}} the first period, UT was able to outscore Rutgers by six to close it out, and opened the second half up by building the lead to sixteen. The Scarlet Knights never recovered, losing 92–60. Holdsclaw and Catchings were again the leading scorers, with 25 and 23. The Lady Vols shot 52.2% from the field and forced Rutgers to 27 turnovers. This game gave Tennessee their 36th win, breaking Connecticut's record of 35, as the Lady Vols advanced to the Regional Finals.|$|E

Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh said, [...] "It will probably be more Hokie fans there than Stanford fans. <b>That</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from home it probably could be a hostile environment for us." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 12, 2015, Usher {{visited his}} former {{hometown}} Chattanooga making a surprise visit at Dalewood Middle School, the Orange Grove Center and the Center for the Creative Arts. Dalewood {{is the middle}} school he attended before moving to Atlanta and the school is not <b>that</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from the road [...] "Usher Raymond Parkway" [...] that was presented to Usher in 2001. Usher spoke to students at the Center for the Creative arts explaining the importance of education. His effort of giving back was to honor the legacy of his grandmother who passed early in the year. Who he called Nanny expressed to singer {{at a young age}} [...] "whatever you want to do, I promise you can do it. We're going to look back one day, your teachers and I, and be very proud of you". At CCC, a donation of an undisclosed amount was made by the singer that would pay for new surfaces for the floors of two dance studios, a new digital lighting board and LED lights for the performing arts school's auditorium. Usher's second stop was Orange Grove Center, a nonprofit that serves adults and children with intellectual disabilities. There, he took part in a groundbreaking for planned improvements to the facility's track, said development director Heidi Hoffecker. The track will be named the Nancy Lackey Memorial Track to honor his grandmother.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} recorded in 2005 for a DVD special feature, Remington Steele co-creator Michael Gleason and star Stephanie Zimbalist discuss {{the large number}} of women who have approached them over the years to express their appreciation for the character of Laura Holt. Speaking of the women she meets, Zimbalist said [...] "They are extraordinary women.... They are interesting. They do interesting things. They are smart. They're independent. They're sort of, what my character was – and I meet them all the time." [...] Also in 2005, Robin Rauzi published an article in the Los Angeles Times saying that Laura Holt was her hero. In a subsequent interview Rauzi elaborated, saying that Laura [...] "was one of the only examples of an unmarried modern career woman on TV that I could identify with at that time" [...] and that Laura [...] "didn’t seem <b>that</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from who I was and who I could be." [...] Rauzi concludes, [...] "I’ve decided to stop being embarrassed to say Remington Steele changed my life. It did and for the better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jemison {{graduated}} from Chicago's Morgan Park High School in 1973 and entered Stanford University {{at the age}} of 16. [...] "I was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me," [...] Jemison said. [...] "It’s not until recently that I realized that 16 was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to [...] go <b>that</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from home." [...] Jemison {{graduated from}} Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a B.A. in African and Afro-American Studies. At Stanford, she choreographed a musical and dance production called Out of the Shadows. She took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the Black Students Union in college. Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States. [...] "Some professors would just pretend I wasn't there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb, the dumbest question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would ask the same question, the professor would say, 'That's a very astute observation.'" [...] In an interview with the Des Moines Register in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her. [...] "I did have to say, 'I'm going to do this and I don't give a crap (damn).'" [...] She points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields.|$|E
