5|$|Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, {{like its}} {{predecessor}} , is a third-person shooter. Players can control each transformer in both its robot and vehicle forms. Instead {{of a traditional}} health system, the game features a system similar to the Halo series of video games. The player character has both a regenerating shield and health, the latter {{of which can be}} replenished by a health pack. The weapon selection in Fall of Cybertron is expanded, with new weapons that can take on very significant upgrades, including one that allows a weapon <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> to 75% faster. These are purchased through Teletran 1 kiosks found throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent deep {{convection}} continued <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up,</b> {{keeping the}} storm afloat {{for the next}} day and turning it away from the Azores. Danielle also changed direction and meandered slightly to the northwest, away from the Azores, due to very weak steering currents. After holding on as a minimal tropical storm, Danielle finally lost its deep convection due to high upper-level vertical shear and was downgraded to a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 20. The depression turned once again to the north, and continued to lose organization over cooler water. It degenerated into a remnant low on the afternoon of August 21 as the convection was completely sheared away from the center of Danielle. The remnant low remained in the open ocean, remaining devoid of any deep convection, until August 24 when it dissipated west-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
25|$|The Raiders' {{touchdown}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> their defense, who {{forced the}} Buccaneers to a fourth {{down on their}} ensuing possession. Oakland lineman Tim Johnson then blocked Tupa's punt, and Raiders defender Eric Johnson returned the ball 13 yards for a touchdown. Another two-point conversion for Oakland failed, but Tampa Bay's lead was cut to 34–15.|$|E

25|$|A hwacha or hwach'a (화차; 火車) (fire cart) was a {{multiple}} rocket launcher developed by Koreans based on ancient Han Chinese technological innovations and deployed in the defence of the Korean peninsula against Japanese invasion in the 1590s. It had the ability <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> to 200 singijeon, a type of fire arrow rocket, at one time. The hwacha consisted of a two-wheeled cart carrying a board filled with holes into which the singijeon were inserted.|$|E

25|$|After being {{completely}} dominated until this point, the Raiders offense finally struck back their next possession, advancing 79 yards in 9 plays, and scoring on a 23-yard touchdown pass from Daryle Lamonica to receiver Bill Miller. The score seemed <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> the Raiders' defense, and they forced the Packers to punt on their next drive. Raiders returner Rodger Bird gave them great field position with a 12-yard return to Green Bay's 40-yard line, but Oakland could only gain 1 yard with their next 3 plays {{and came up}} empty when George Blanda's 47-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts. Oakland's defense again forced Green Bay to punt after 3 plays on the ensuing drive, but this time after calling for a fair catch, Bird fumbled punter Donny Anderson's twisting, left footed kick, and Green Bay's Dick Capp recovered the ball. After 2 incomplete passes, Starr threw a 9-yard completion to Dowler to set up Chandler's third field goal from the 43 as time expired in the first half, giving the Packers a 16–7 lead.|$|E
500|$|The bunker {{consisted}} of three main elements. The {{main part of the}} building was a giant structure some [...] wide and [...] high, housing the LOX plant and a vault where missiles would be assembled and prepared. [...] Its walls were up to [...] thick and the bunker's working levels descended [...] below ground. The plant would house five Heylandt compressors, each capable of producing about 10 tons of LOX per day. About 150 tons of LOX were to be stored in insulated tanks on-site. The facility was intended to store up to 108 missiles and enough fuel to supply three days' worth of launches. The Germans planned <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> to 36 rockets a day from the site.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011 Veronica Henry {{reviewed}} Epiphany 2.32, saying [...] "To be fair, {{this would}} be a hard sell as a primary desktop browser for most users. In fact, there isn't even a setting to let you designate it as your default browser. But for those instance where you need <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> a lighting-fast browser for quick surfing, Epiphany will do the trick." [...] She further noted, [...] "Though I still use Firefox as my primary browser, lately it seems to run at a snail's pace. So, {{one of the first things}} I noticed about Epiphany is how quickly it launches. And subsequent page loads on my system are equally as fast." [...] Henry criticized Epiphany for its short list of extensions, singling out the lack of Firebug as a deficiency. Web instead supports Web Inspector offered by the WebKit engine, which has similar functionality.|$|E

500|$|Construction {{began in}} September 1943 with the {{building}} of railway lines to support the work, and excavation of the gun shafts began in October. The initial layout comprised two parallel complexes approximately [...] apart, each with five drifts which were to hold a stacked cluster of five HDP gun tubes, {{for a total of}} 25 guns. The smoothbore design of the HDP would enable a much higher rate of fire than was possible with conventional guns. The entire battery would be able <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> to 10 shots a minute, capable in theory of hitting London with 600 projectiles every hour. Both facilities were to be served by an underground railway tunnel of standard gauge, connected to the Calais-Boulogne main line, and underground ammunition storage galleries which were tunneled at a depth of about [...] The western site was abandoned at an early stage after being disrupted by Allied bombing, and only the eastern complex was built.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy played {{full-time}} {{with the}} Leafs {{for the first}} time in the 1943–44 season. Although the Leafs had won the Stanley Cup in 1942, at the time of Kennedy's arrival the Leafs were a team decimated by the loss of some of its best players to the war effort. Andy Lytle, Sports Editor of The Toronto Star, wrote of the Leaf team eliminated from the previous season's playoffs, [...] "I do not suppose that Toronto was so weakly represented in the N.H.L. playoffs since the club originated." [...] During training camp, Kennedy read in a newspaper interview of Coach Hap Day speaking about the best new prospects on the Leafs, but he had failed to mention Kennedy. This served <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> Kennedy to give an even greater effort towards making the team. Toronto's first pre-season exhibition game was against the St. Catharine Saints, a senior team now being coached by Kennedy's former junior coach Nels Stewart. After the game, Kennedy approached Stewart for advice, because he was disappointed he had not scored in the game. Stewart, who was the all-time NHL goal scoring leader until Maurice Richard overtook him in the 1952–53 season, advised when facing the goaltender to [...] "either draw him out, or pick the corner." ...|$|E
500|$|This simple tactic proved unstoppable. Soon, he had {{surpassed the}} 50-point barrier, causing arena speaker Dave Zinkoff <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> the {{previously}} sleepy crowd. Chamberlain also kept his cool despite getting perpetually triple and quadruple-teamed by the Knicks, {{who did not}} shy away from hard fouls to distract the center. McGuire was irate and demanded that the referees call more fouls, but Chamberlain could not be stopped. He scored another 28 points to lift his Warriors to a commanding 125–106 lead {{by the end of}} the third quarter. His own total stood at 69, nine shy of his previous scoring record. The Knicks' third center, Dave Budd, who alternated with the foul-troubled Imhoff at pivot, later stated that resistance was futile: [...] "You couldn't play [...] conventionally because he was so big. The only thing you could attempt to do was either front him, and in that case they'd try to lob it in to him, or beat him down the floor and set up where he wanted to get and force him out a couple of extra steps. The guy weighed 300 or 270 , so that wasn't easy, either." [...] Chamberlain now realized he could break his own 73-point scoring record (for a regulation 48-minute game) or his record 78 points, set in triple overtime.|$|E

2500|$|After {{receiving}} the opening kickoff {{of the second}} half, the Bengals drove 83 yards in 9 plays. [...] Charles Alexander started off the drive with a 13-yard carry, with a facemask penalty on Hicks giving an additional 5 yards. [...] Two plays later, Anderson converted a 3rd and 4 situation with a 19-yard pass to Steve Kreider, and eventually finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run {{to cut the deficit}} to 20–7. This seemed <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> Cincinnati's defense, who limited the 49ers to only 8 plays and 4 offensive yards for the entire third quarter.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generator}} {{was installed}} at {{what would become}} Bridge River Powerhouse No. 1 in 1948, with three more generators added by 1954, giving the plant a total output of 180,000 kilowatts - easily {{the largest in the}} province at that time. [...] A second tunnel, with two large penstocks, was built to supply a second powerhouse {{on the far side of}} the townsite. Work on this powerhouse (called No. 2) was carried out while the tunnel that would supply it was being bored, and it would have four generators, officially opening in 1960 with a generating capacity of 248,000 kilowatts. [...] Geoffrey Downton, the [...] "discoverer" [...] of the project, was invited to push the [...] "start" [...] button <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> the No. 2 generators.|$|E
2500|$|Yechezkel, upon being {{commanded}} by the almighty to consume bread baked by using human excrement as coal pleaded for leniency by exclaming {{that he was}} always scrupulous in watching what he ate in terms of Kashruth and purity and that never had [...] "Piggul" [...] (i.e. repulsive) meat entered his mouth (and therefore should not be instructed to bake his bread in such a repulsive fashion). [...] The Talmud, in examining the contextual [...] meaning of [...] "Piggul" [...] quotes the view of Rabbi Nathan who maintains that Yechezkiel's claim was that he never consumed meat from an animal of whom's gifts were not given to a Kohen.

The tour began on September 15 and lasted 6 weeks, visiting 48 states in the Continental U.S., with stops in more than 100 cities while covering 14,000 miles. The tours purpose was to [...] "encourage votes for Republicans in districts across the nation." [...] The stops in individual districts gave Steele, [...] "known for his bomb-throwing speaking style," [...] an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> local GOP activists.

2500|$|Top-ranked LSU {{defeated}} sixth-ranked, rival Ole Miss, 14–0 {{in a game}} {{dominated by}} defense and penalties. 68,000 fans packed Tiger Stadium to watch the Tigers win their first game against the Rebels since 1950. Ole Miss was LSU's most bitter rival at the time, and fans who heard and read about the Chinese Bandits and Billy Cannon wanted to see them first-hand. [...] "It's not a rivalry because somebody says it is," [...] said Cannon, [...] "or because you've been playing against a team for a long time. It's a rivalry when two good teams meet and either one could walk out the winner. This was a rivalry." [...] Banners were strung around the LSU campus with the words [...] "Go to Hell, Ole Miss."

2500|$|In the 1992–93 season, the Canadiens {{finished}} third in their division behind title winner Boston Bruins and a resurgent second place Quebec Nordiques. During {{the first round of}} the 1993 playoffs against the archrival Nordiques, Roy was in a goaltending duel against Ron Hextall; Hextall was also a Vezina and Conn Smythe winner with his previous team, the Philadelphia Flyers, when they had several ill-tempered post-season encounters with Roy's Canadiens in the 1980s. The Canadiens lost the first two games of the series with Roy letting in soft goals, and a newspaper in Roy's hometown district suggested that he be traded with the headline [...] "NORDIQUES WIN GAME, BATTLE OF GOALIES," [...] while the subhead added (Quebec goalie Ron) [...] "HEXTALL GETS BETTER OF ROY." [...] Nordiques Goaltending Coach Dan Bouchard also proclaimed that his team had [...] "solved Roy." [...] These comments seemed <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> Roy, who responded by winning the next four games against the Nordiques, sweeping the Buffalo Sabres in the next round and winning the first three against the New York Islanders to tie the record of an 11-game playoff winning streak. Roy also set a record with ten-straight playoff overtime wins — two against Quebec, three against Buffalo, two against the New York Islanders (where he denied Benoît Hogue and Pierre Turgeon on breakaways during overtime) and three against the Los Angeles Kings in the Finals. Roy had led his team, which did not have a player that finished in the top twenty regular season scoring, to the Stanley Cup championship and was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner.|$|E
