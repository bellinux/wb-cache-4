40|$|We {{investigated}} the local- and regional-scale thermodynamical and dynamical environments associated with intense convective systems in West Africa during 2003. We identified convective system cases from TRMM microwave imagery, classifying each case by <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>minimum</b> 85 -GHz brightness temperature {{and by the}} estimated elapsed time of propagation from high terrain. The speed of the mid-level jet, {{the magnitude of the}} low-level shear, and the surface equivalent potential temperature (theta(sub e)) were greater for the intense cases compared to the non-intense cases, although the differences between the means tended to be small, less than 3 K for surface theta(sub e). Hypothesis testing of a series of commonly used intensity prediction metrics resulted in significant results only for low-level metrics such as convective available potential energy and not for any of the mid- or upper-level metrics such as 700 -hPa theta(sub e). None of the environmental variables or intensity metrics by themselves or in combination appeared to be reliable direct predictors of intensity. In the regional scale analysis, the majority of intense convective systems occurred in the surface baroclinic zone where surface theta(sub e) exceeded 344 K and the 700 -hPa zonal wind speeds were less than - 6 /ms. Fewer intense cases compared to non-intense cases were associated with African easterly wave troughs. Fewer than 25 % of our cases occurred in environments with detectable Saharan dust loads, and the results for intense and non-intense cases were similar. Our results for the regional analysis were consistent with the seasonal movement of the WAM and the intertropical front, regional differences in topography, and AEW energetics...|$|E

40|$|Air Data Computer (ADC) as an {{autonomous}} system consisting of primary aerodynamic parameters sensors, evaluator and indexes, {{widely used in}} aviation technology, because {{of its ability to}} unite in itself all the gauges and indicators in a single system, eliminating duplication and inconsistency information. During the ADC safety analysis we will understand the definition of reliability, which is necessary to calculate, develop functional circuit reliability, based on the analysis of the elements of the system; mathematical model that fully binds the reliability of the system, reliability indices of elements, performance calculation reliability analysis results, adjustments calculated model and system structure. There are many works devoted by methods of reliability analysis. However, in affordable authors of literature, considered analysis of the structural circuit reliability, and fault tree analysis has not acquired adequate coverage. Purpose is to develop an ADC aircraft method of comprehensive analysis of reliability based association analysis block diagram of a system based on its functional circuit graph states its renewable and non-renewable elements, further development of the ADC mathematical model of reliability and method of construction and fault tree analysis. In this paper we examined qualitative and quantitative analysis of fault tree. The purpose of qualitative analysis is to determine the minimum cross section of tree failures identified for specific major events in <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Minimum</b> cross-sections - a set of elements, simultaneous translation of a working state to invalid causes failure of the system. The purpose of quantitative analysis is to build analytic function of reliability F(t), and features derived probability of failure P(t), the probability of failure of function P(t), probability density function f(t) and failure rate ?(t) for an aircraft ADC. And in particular obtained time dependent analysis of reliability and unreliability blocks.
