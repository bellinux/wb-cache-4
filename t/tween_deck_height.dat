50|$|Similar to B series, K-Series has {{two short}} blocks {{with the same}} design; the only {{difference}} between them being the <b>deck</b> <b>height.</b> K20 uses the short block with a <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> of 212mm where K23 and K24 block has a <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> of 231.5mm.|$|R
2500|$|Through the 1970 model year, the 232 {{shared a}} <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> with the [...] engines. Starting in 1971, AMC raised the <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> {{to produce the}} 258, and the 232 adopted the 199's longer {{connecting}} rods and shared <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> with the 258.

50|$|Although {{it has so}} many variations, {{the basic}} design differs very little among the B-Series. There are {{actually}} two short blocks which are used for the entire series. The main difference between them was the <b>deck</b> <b>height.</b> The one used for B16 and B17 engines (except for B16B) has a <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> of 203.9mm while the short block used for B15, B16B, B18 and B20 engines has a <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> of 212mm.|$|R

5000|$|The longer {{stroke of}} the 400 V8 {{required}} a taller <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> and it used larger main bearings {{as compared to}} the 351C.

5000|$|A useful {{comparison}} is the Oldsmobile V8 engine, which came in both small-block and big-block versions from 1965-1976. Both blocks have a bore spacing of 4.625 in, {{almost exactly the}} same as the Lincoln Y-block, but differ in <b>deck</b> <b>height,</b> with the small-block's being 9.330 in and the big-block's 10.625 in. By this measure the Lincoln Y-block has a larger engine block than the Oldsmobile [...] "big-block."

The Liuguanghe Bridge in China surpassed the Royal Gorge Bridge in 2001 to become the new highest bridge with a <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> of 974 ft. The Royal Gorge Bridge surrendered the title of the world's highest suspension bridge when the Beipan River Guanxing Highway Bridge in China was completed in 2003 with a <b>deck</b> <b>height</b> of 1200 ft. Several more even higher bridges, mostly in China, have been completed since 2003 causing the Royal Gorge Bridge {{to drop out of the}} top ten highest bridges in the world. The Royal Gorge Bridge remains the highest bridge in the United States and among the top twenty highest bridges in the world; however, several additional very high bridges are scheduled for completion through 2021. If all the planned bridges are completed, they will move the Royal Gorge Bridge out of the top twenty places in the rankings.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal armor {{protection}} against aerial bombs and plunging shellfire {{started with the}} flight deck, which acted as the main strength deck. The armor was generally 20 mm thick except for those areas around the elevator shafts and funnel uptakes where thickness increased to 40 mm {{in order to give}} the elevators necessary structural strength and the critical uptakes greater splinter protection. Beneath the lower hangar was the main armored <b>deck</b> (or <b>tween</b> <b>deck)</b> where armor thickness varied from 60 mm over the magazines to 40 mm over the machinery spaces. Along the peripheries, it formed a 45 degree slope where it joined the lower portion of the waterline belt armor.|$|R
