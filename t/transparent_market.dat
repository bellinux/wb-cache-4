40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Internet, we have seen {{existing}} markets transform and new ones emerge. In this paper, we contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon by developing a unified theory about the role that IT plays in affecting market information, transparency and market structure. In particular, we introduce a new theoretical framework which uncovers the process and the forces that, together with IT, facilitate or inhibit the emerging dominance of <b>transparent</b> electronic <b>markets.</b> <b>Transparent</b> electronic <b>markets</b> offer unbiased, complete, and accurate market information. Our effort to develop a unified theoretical framework begins with a thorough assessment of the prior literature. It also uses an inductive approach involving the case study method, in which we contrast and compare the forces that have led the air travel and financial securities markets to become increasingly transparent. Building on the electronic markets and electronic hierarchies research of Malone, Yates and Benjamin [1987], our findings suggest that IT alone does not explain a move to <b>transparent</b> electronic <b>markets.</b> Instead, we argue that enhanced electronic representation of products, and competitive and institutional forces have also {{played an important role in}} the process by which most sellers have come to favor <b>transparent</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

50|$|According to {{a typical}} {{economic}} theory, prices are optimally determined {{in a fair}} and <b>transparent</b> <b>market,</b> and not by a political or academic body. In deregulation of electricity markets, one immediate concern with pricing is that incumbent electricity providers would undercut the prices of new entrants, preventing competition and perpetuating the existing monopoly of providers. Thus, the SB7 bill introduced a phase-in period during which a price floor would be established (for incumbent electricity companies) to prevent this predatory practice, allowing new market entrants to become established. New market entrants could charge a price below the price to beat, but incumbents could not. This period was to last from 2002 to January 1, 2007. As of 2007 Texas investor owned utility affiliates no longer have price to beat tariffs.|$|E

We then conduct a laboratory experi-ment that tests and supports all of these predictions. A second experiment shows that most dealers choose to be of lower transparency when {{they are allowed to}} do so. However, the informational advantage of low-transparency decreases as there are more such dealers, while the high-transparency dealers get increasing bene"t from informed traders who attempt to broadcast deceptive trades. As a result, a small number of transparent dealers persist in our markets. (2000 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Key {{principles}} of fair trade include transparency and capacity building. (WFTO Fair trade principles). Particularly {{in the developing}} world, it is very common for small-scale farmers to have {{only one or two}} buyers for their commodity products. Prices thus can be set by the buyers along with quality criteria. Normally buyers do not provide transparency as to the weighing and grading of product. Unless the buyers are linked to a quality supply chain (such as a fair trade or organic supply chain), the buyers normally do not provide any capacity building as to how {{to improve the quality of}} the product and thus gain a higher price. Fair trade when practiced well must provide full transparency in terms of pricing, weighing, and quality standards. Also as the end goal is a superior quality product in all ways, good fair trade organizations provide good capacity building in terms of best production, harvest, and post-harvest practices. From my personal experience (with Green Net, Thailand) and helping many other farmer groups to develop along this path in the region, it is clear that when one honest and transparent buyer enters the local market, it forces other buyers to be more honest and transparent. Additionally in communities where farmers talk to each other (regardless of whether one is a member of a fair trade group or not), I have witnessed that there is knowledge transfer. Thus non-fair trade farmers may and often do improve their production, harvest, and post-harvest practices, yielding a higher quality product, which merits a higher price. This combined with a freer and more <b>transparent</b> <b>market,</b> thanks to the entry of a buyer (the fair trade buyer), means that non-fair trade farmers now are much more likely to be paid for the quality of their products and at the real market prices.|$|E
5000|$|If an {{antitrust}} claim {{does not}} fall within a per se illegal category, the plaintiff must show the conduct causes harm in [...] "restraint of trade" [...] under the Sherman Act §1 according to [...] "the facts peculiar {{to the business}} to which the restraint is applied". This essentially means that unless a plaintiff can point to a clear precedent, to which the situation is analogous, proof of an anti-competitive effect is more difficult. The {{reason for this is}} that the courts have endeavoured to draw a line between practices that restrain trade in a [...] "good" [...] compared to a [...] "bad" [...] way. In the first case, United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, the Supreme Court found that railroad companies had acted unlawfully by setting up an organisation to fix transport prices. The railroads had protested that their intention was to keep prices low, not high. The court found that this was not true, but stated that not every [...] "restraint of trade" [...] in a literal sense could be unlawful. Just as under the common law, the restraint of trade had to be [...] "unreasonable". In Chicago Board of Trade v. United States the Supreme Court found a [...] "good" [...] restraint of trade. The Chicago Board of Trade had a rule that commodities traders were not allowed to privately agree to sell or buy after the market's closing time (and then finalise the deals when it opened the next day). The reason for the Board of Trade having this rule was to ensure that all traders had an equal chance to trade at a <b>transparent</b> <b>market</b> price. It plainly restricted trading, but the Chicago Board of Trade argued this was beneficial. Brandeis J., giving judgment for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the rule to be pro-competitive, and comply with the rule of reason. It did not violate the Sherman Act §1. As he put it, ...|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{protection}} in most domains of financial regulation centers on transparency. Broadly construed, transparency involves making relevant {{information available to}} consumers {{as well as others}} who might act on their behalf, such as academics, journalists, newspapers, consumer organizations or other market watchdogs. By contrast, command and control regulation that affirmatively limits financial firms’ products or pricing is relatively uncommon. This Article describes a remarkable inversion of this pattern: while state insurance regulation frequently employs aggressive command and control consumer protection regulation, it typically does little or nothing to promote <b>transparent</b> <b>markets.</b> Rather, state lawmakers routinely either completely ignore transparency-oriented reforms or implement them in a self-evidently flawed manner. While acknowledging the limits of transparency-oriented consumer protection regulation, this Article argues that the lack of <b>transparent</b> insurance <b>markets</b> reflects a pervasive and unappreciated flaw in state insurance regulation. Despite their limitations, transparency-oriented regulatory strategies are an important complement to other more aggressive regulatory tools, as they can promote consumer choice, harness market discipline, and ensure regulatory accountability in ways that more aggressive regulatory tools often cannot. In order to promote more <b>transparent</b> insurance <b>markets,</b> the Article argues that the jurisdiction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should be expanded to encompass consumer {{protection in}} insurance.
