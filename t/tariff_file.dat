40|$|The <b>filed</b> <b>tariff</b> doctrine, {{fashioned}} by {{courts to}} protect consumers from rate discrimination, has strayed from its origins. Instead of protecting consumers, the doctrine {{has evolved into}} a shield for regulated firms against common law and antitrust claims that reinforce market norms. In the ideal world, Congress would expand the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies to allow them to penalize private misconduct. However, since that has not always happened, the <b>filed</b> <b>tariff</b> doctrine has encouraged private firms to expend resources in using the regulator as a strategy to immunize conduct from antitrust and common law antitrust claims. This Article assesses how the <b>filed</b> <b>tariff</b> doctrine creates an opportunity for strategic manipulation of the tariffing process, encouraging firms to rent seek by over-divulging information to regulators. Neither regulators nor courts are equipped or inclined to police such manipulation, resulting in an expansion of the application of the <b>filed</b> <b>tariff</b> shield. Under natural monopoly regulation, the <b>filed</b> <b>tariff</b> doctrine may have enhanced social welfare, to the extent it encourage private firms to focus their resources on the agency regulatory process. However, as regulation has moved away from the natural monopoly model, the <b>filed</b> <b>tariff</b> doctrine has contributed to a jurisdictional gap in the enforcement of market norms. As a result, federal regulators are unable to effectively deter private misconduct but common law and antitrust claims that also hold promise of deterrence are frequently barred from litigation in federal courts. With deregulation and the broadening of market norms, the jurisdictional gap has widened, threatening harm to consumers and competition. The Article concludes by proposing a way for courts to narrow the gap in enforcement of market norms - by lowering the <b>filed</b> <b>tariff</b> shield and looking to federal preemption law and antitrust defenses and immunities. These alternative doctrines provide courts the flexibility necessary to ensure effective deterrence in a dual enforcement regime. Although they may enhance uncertainty for private firms, the also hold promise to encourage private actors to focus their lobbying efforts on Congress, rather than on agencies that can give them the benefits of the <b>filed</b> <b>tariff</b> shield but lack the authority and resources to directly regulate them...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) {{requires}} {{electric utilities}} to offer six ancillary services. Most of the <b>tariffs</b> <b>filed</b> with FERC price these services {{on the basis}} of traditional cost-of-service (embedded) costs, Because most of these services are provided by generating units, however, {{it should be possible to}} create competitive markets for them. This paper describes, the structure of, and results from, a spreadsheet model that simulates markets for seven services: losses, regulation, spinning reserve, supplemental reserve, load following, energy imbalance, and voltage support. The model also analyzes, system control, although this service will continue to be provided solely by the system operator under cost-based prices. Developing this computer model demonstrated the likely complexity of markets for energy and ancillary services. This complexity arises because these markets are highly interdependent. For example, the cost of regulation (the frequent change in generator outputs to track the minute-to-minute fluctuations in system load) depends strongly on which units, are already being dispatched to provide energy and losses, their variable costs, and their operating levels relative to their maximum and minimum loading points. ...|$|R

40|$|In its Keogh {{decision}} the Supreme Court {{held that}} although the Interstate Commerce Act did not exempt railroads from antitrust liability, a private plaintiff may not recover treble damages based on an allegedly monopolistic <b>tariff</b> rate <b>filed</b> with a federal agency. Keogh very likely grew out of Justice Brandeis 2 ̆ 7 s own zeal for regulation and his concern {{for the protection of}} small business — in this case, mainly shippers whom he felt were protected from discrimination by filed rates. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Square D decision later conceded that Keogh may have been “unwise as a matter of policy,” but reaffirmed it on the ground that Congress had had ample opportunity to overturn it but had not done so. Under the doctrine consumer overcharge actions challenging a “filed” rate will be dismissed. The rate need not have been actively reviewed for accuracy or public interest considerations — indeed, it need not have been reviewed at all in any meaningful sense. The doctrine operates as a rule against collateral attack: once filed, a rate may not be collaterally attacked in the courts. However, an objector may be able to ask the regulatory agency to review a rate within its jurisdiction. Of course, that proceeding would not be in antitrust and would not provide treble damages and attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees as an inducement. The doctrine becomes more complex and even less rational under partial deregulation. Today, for example, some rates must be “filed” with the overseeing agency although the agency has little power to adjust the rates except in extraordinary circumstances. Supreme Court analysis of filed rates has focused on rates filed with federal agencies. Several lower court decisions have extended the doctrine to rates filed with state regulators, generally without distinguishing the issues. Extending the doctrine to state agencies raises the troublesome issue that rate filings may serve to confer an effective antitrust immunity in situations where antitrust’s “state action” doctrine would not apply. The filed rate doctrine does not contain anything equivalent to the “authorization” or “active supervision” requirements that the state action doctrine compels. For example, a state provision may authorize an exclusionary tariff, giving no thought to competitive consequences. The state agency in turn may approve such requests with little or no evaluation. While the provision in question would not survive scrutiny under the state action doctrine, the <b>tariff</b> <b>filing</b> itself may have effective immunity under the filed rate doctrine. The Third Circuit’s McCray decision applied the filed rate doctrine to price fixing among title insurers, expressly rejecting the argument that application required the defendant’s to show “meaningful review” by the state regulator. The filed rate doctrine should not be applied as an additional bar to antitrust enforcement. Rather, application of the antitrust laws should rest, as it usually does, on the power of the agency to immunize conduct and the extent and nature of its supervision...|$|R

40|$|Since 1935, {{shortly after}} the Supreme Court held that state {{regulation}} of interstate electricity transactions violated the Dormant Commerce Clause of the U. S. Constitution, {{the federal government has}} been the primary regulator of wholesale electricity generation. The Federal Power Act (FPA), which was passed to remedy the regulatory “gap” created by the Supreme Court’s holding, has received significant amendments in 1978, 1992 and 2005. Nonetheless, the basic crux of the Act, a requirement that federal regulators ensure “just and reasonable” rates and prevent “undue discrimination” or “undue preference,” has remained relatively unchanged since 1935. Yet the regulatory structures created to enforce those obligations would be unrecognizable to one of those early regulators. Indeed, federal electric utility regulation has evolved from a classic New Deal model based on “the cost of service” to a market-based regime premised on vigorous competition. Throughout the first fifty years of the FPA’s history, electricity generators <b>filed</b> <b>tariffs</b> with government technocrats who, at the request of an affected party, could review the generator’s cost to produce the electricity to determine whether the rates in the tariff were “just and reasonable. ” Today, the rate of return on most sales of electricity is determined by market competition. Rather than scrutinizing a utility’s books, regulators ensure that rates are just and reasonable by maintaining a healthy market. This “revolution” in electricity regulation occurred during a twenty-year period between 1980 and 2000. Surprisingly, given the scope and significance of the reforms, the changes were initiated largely through rulemaking and adjudication by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or “the Commission”), rather than congressional legislation. Although Congress ratified the Commission’s changes to the regulatory structure in both 1992 and 2005, Congress did not play a leading role in restructuring the electricity industry. Instead, the changes were the result of FERC’s reinterpretation of what was permitted and required by the basic standards in the 1935 version of the FPA —“just and reasonable” and “undue discrimination” or “undue preference. ” This paper argues that electricity restructuring provides an excellent example of politically legitimate Administrative constitutionalism or statutory reinterpretation. By acting pursuant to its delegated authority, within its established jurisdiction, and in a way that reflected Congressional preferences commission, the Commission exercised its authority in a politically legitimate fashion. Moreover, by doing so incrementally, it promoted deliberation, both within the Commission and with stakeholders in industry and Congress, about how its regulations should evolve. Of course this deliberation cannot give the agency the power to do what a statute says it cannot. But where a statute is vague or unclear, a robust dialogue and the involvement of outside stakeholders mitigate the concern about agencies “run amok. ” Indeed, combining robust agency deliberation with its experience and expertise should promote effective regulation that is responsive to the needs of industry and the policy preferences of Congress. This type of regulatory change is a desirable means of addressing statutory ambiguity and should be accepted, both by courts and in the scholarly understanding of the administrative state...|$|R
