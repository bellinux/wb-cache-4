60|$|Philippa {{laid down}} the book which she had been reading, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> husband. He made a little grimace.|$|E
60|$|She heard a sudden, slight sound behind her. With a cry she {{sprang to}} her feet and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> end.|$|E
60|$|An hysterical cry, choked and subdued, {{broke from}} her lips. He half carried, half {{led her to}} his easy-chair. Suddenly steadied by the {{presence}} of this unlooked-for emergency, he closed the outside door and relit the lamp with firm fingers. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her,</b> and his amazement at this strange visit became consternation.|$|E
60|$|Sprague seated {{himself on}} the log beside <b>her,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her,</b> and he seemed {{burdened}} with grave and important matters.|$|R
50|$|Sitting in an ambulance, Anna and Luke overhear {{the firefighters}} talking about {{discovering}} two charred corpses with no teeth. Anna sees a firefighter limp out from within, who <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her.</b> Much <b>to</b> her horror, it is {{revealed that the}} firefighter is David himself.|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS (on the hearthrug, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her).</b> Action, my dear! Marriage!! In {{that she}} must believe. She won't be {{convinced}} by anything short of it, because, you see, I have had some tremendous philanderings before and {{have gone back to}} her after them.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} {{thinking}} very busily, and the peasant's words had illumined for me a score of little obscure matters, had explained to me the queer behaviour and the odd speeches of Fifanti himself since that evening in the garden when the Cardinal-legate had announced to him his appointment as ducal secretary. I checked now in my stride, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miss Brown <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> employer. Save for {{a greater}} demureness of {{expression}} and the extreme simplicity of her attire, she had changed very little since she had given up her life of comparative luxury to become Peter Ruff's secretary. There {{was a sort of}} personal elegance which clung to her, notwithstanding her strenuous attempts to dress for her part, except for which she looked precisely as a private secretary and typist should look. She even wore a black bow {{at the back of her}} hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "My misgivings are all for {{the time}} when this siege shall be ended; when you and I shall have gone each our {{separate}} way," [...] he answered boldly. He <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> now, and his voice rang a little tense. [...] "But for being here to guide this fine resistance and lend you the little aid I can---- No, no, I have no misgiving for that. It is the dearest frolic ever my soldiering led me into. I came to Roccaleone with a message of warning; but underneath, deep down in my heart, I bore the hope that mine should {{be more than a}} messenger's part; that mine it might be to remain by you and do such work as I am doing." ...|$|E
60|$|He let {{his hand}} fall to his side, and <b>turned,</b> fully <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|At times, however, she rebelled at her fate. There were hours, even yet, {{when she}} lay {{alone in her}} bed hearing her father's regular stertorous {{breathing}} till a great wave of longing to live swept upon her, and she was forced <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> pillow to stifle her mingled coughing and sobbing.|$|R
60|$|Lady Harman <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> hostess and {{answered}} her smile. Wilkins caught at {{his chair and}} stood up.|$|R
60|$|From his apparel, {{he was a}} man of position, and he {{was evidently}} in heated {{discussion}} with some one whom Norman of Torn could not see. The man, a great, tall black-haired and mustached nobleman, was pounding upon a table to emphasize his words, and presently he sprang up as though rushing toward the one to whom he had been speaking. He disappeared from the watcher's view for a moment and then, at the far side of the apartment, Norman of Torn saw him again just as he roughly grasped the figure of a woman who evidently was attempting to escape him. As she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> tormentor, all the devil in the Devil of Torn surged in his aching head, for the face he saw was that of Joan de Tany.|$|E
5000|$|The parish {{church of}} Gateley is called St Helen's. The nave is {{dates from the}} 15th century. The chancel a Victorian rebuilding. The church tower is of the Perpendicular style. There are two shields on {{south-west}} buttress. Tower has rectangular vice, the belfry windows have been partly blocked. On {{south side of the}} nave is a round headed arch made up of late medieval tiles although the doorway is of late Saxon origins. The south porch has three niches. The church floor has been renewed but is of brick. The primitive font has a marble plinth [...] There is a rood screen with fine paintings thought to be East Anglia, which are of a local flavour. The Saints chosen for the screen are for local devotions. From left to right they are Saint Etheldreda, foundress of the Diocese of Ely shown as a nun with a Latin inscription, Scta Adria, or Saint Audrey. Next is Saint Elizabeth, also shown dressed in a nun's habit and her arms crossed as if in an echo of the Visitation, The Blessed Virgin, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> cousin. A third image is of the Mistress of Ridibowne, a local devotion. Virtually nothing is known about her. Ridibowne was probably either Redbowne in Lincolnshire or Redbowne in Hertfordshire.On {{the other side of the}} screen are paintings of Saint Louis of France, Henry VI labelled in Latin as 'the Blessed Martyr Henry VI', St Augustine and Sir John Schorne, conjuring the devil into a boot. Sir John Schorne was a clergyman, he is said to be best known for his ability to cure the gout.|$|E
6000|$|... "To run away? What do you mean?" [...] demanded Louisa, {{placing her}} hand on the girl's shoulder, forcing her <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> round and <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|She tore herself away. But {{again he}} took her in his arms, {{and this time he}} kissed her on the mouth. She tried <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> away.|$|R
60|$|She gave {{a little}} moan of anguish and despair and <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chairback. Her {{shoulders}} shook with weeping, but she listened. He went to her and stood {{with his hand on}} the chairback.|$|R
50|$|The video depicts Branigan, {{sitting in}} her bedroom while her lover sleeps. Tempted by the allure of the city at night, she gets dressed up and goes out. Brief {{encounters}} with a mysterious man in a full-face white mask lead Branigan from the dance floor of a night club to an underground room where the masked man stands {{in the midst of}} an orgiastic gathering that he beckons her to join. Branigan allows herself to be led into the group, but ultimately flees in fright. Returning home, Branigan finds that the masked man and some of his throng are, somehow, now in her bedroom. The masked man lowers Branigan to her couch and she surrenders herself to him. The masked man, standing over Branigan, now lying unconscious on the floor, turns and walks towards the bedroom window, fading away in the morning light. Branigan, consumed by guilt, gets up and turns out the light. The final scene shows Branigan lying awake in bed, when <b>her</b> lover <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her,</b> his <b>face</b> hidden behind a familiar white mask.|$|R
6000|$|The {{girl that}} was going to live in a palace and walk on ground of her own was ready to die with terror. Not for {{anything}} in the world would she have <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> head <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> sister. Her heart was beating madly. She said with subdued haste-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have never}} thought of considering.' He innocently <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> scrutinize <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> She winced a little. But the {{instinct}} was premature. Time had taken no liberties with her features as yet; nor had trouble very roughly handled her.|$|R
6000|$|He {{loosened}} rein, {{and away}} they went a second time. D'Urberville <b>turned</b> his <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as they rocked, and said, in playful raillery: [...] "Now then, put your arms round my waist again, {{as you did}} before, my Beauty." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was about}} to beckon to his retinue, who had stood respectfully aside during this brief colloquy, when with a quick, wholly {{unexpected}} movement, the young girl placed her hand upon his arm and forced him once more <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> and <b>face</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the closing}} scenes, Empress Wan grasps bright red cloth and {{speaks of the}} [...] "flames of desire" [...] that she has satiated by taking the throne. Through her private celebrations, she is {{suddenly}} pierced by a flying blade from an unknown source. As she is dying, she <b>turns</b> around <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> assailant. Her confusion shifts to horror and anguish, as the blade is then dropped into a mossy koi bed, and the blood soaks the water. The film abruptly finishes, with the audience unsure who the mysterious assailant was.|$|R
60|$|If Mrs. Gallilee, after {{answering}} {{in those}} terms, {{had looked at}} her niece, instead of looking at her governess, she would have seen Carmina--distrustful of her own self-control--move on the sofa so as <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the wall. As it was, Miss Minerva's attitude and look silently claimed some explanation.|$|R
60|$|And yet, was it vanity {{which was}} {{expressed}} in that face? No; but dread, horror, almost disgust, as she gazed with side-long, startled eyes, struggling, and yet struggling in vain, <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> from some horrible sight, {{as if her}} own image had been the Gorgon's head.|$|R
60|$|As {{his glance}} rested upon this woman, whom fate had destined {{to alter the}} entire course of his life, Norman of Torn {{saw that she was}} beautiful, and that she was of that class against whom he had preyed for years with his band of outlaw cut-throats. Then he <b>turned</b> once more <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> enemies with the strange {{inconsistency}} which had ever marked his methods.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now hark to me, and don't holler so loud," [...] {{she said}} <b>turning</b> his <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{questioning}} eyes. [...] "What's gone of you anyway, nigger boy?" [...] It should be premised that Cressy's terms of endearment were mainly negro-dialectical, reminiscences of her brief babyhood, her slave-nurse, {{and the only}} playmates she had ever known.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned and}} cannoned {{into a man}} on the sidewalk, {{recoiling}} with an oath. Bessie took his arm and said nothing--as she had said nothing when he had ordered <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> a little more to the light. They walked for some time in silence, the girl steering him deftly through the crowd.|$|R
5000|$|... 5a. Scene and Aria. To Arlecchino's consternation, {{his wife}} Colombina appears {{just as he}} is trying to use his new key to open up Matteo's house. Not {{recognizing}} him initially, she asks the presumed Captain to protect her as an abandoned wife. As he <b>turns</b> round <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her,</b> she suddenly realizes that the [...] "Captain" [...] is actually Arlecchino and begins reproaching him for his faithlessness, only pausing <b>to</b> powder <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> In response Arlecchino delivers a short speech concerning his views on marriage and fidelity: Die Treue, Madame, ist ein Laster, das meiner Ehrsamkeit nicht ansteht. - [...] "Fealty, madame, is a vice which does not apply to my respectability." ...|$|R
60|$|Hook smiled on {{them with}} his teeth closed, {{and took a step}} toward Wendy. His {{intention}} was <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something else instead.|$|R
6000|$|... "No! No! This is {{no place}} for aristos," [...] cried one of the women in a voice which many excesses and many vices had {{rendered}} hoarse and rough. [...] "Spy or not, we don't want you in here. Do we?" [...] she added as with arms akimbo she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> those of <b>her</b> own sex, who behind the men had come up in order {{to see what was going}} on.|$|R
60|$|And {{while she}} stood thus, while Fan waited for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> hard by there sounded a great clatter and {{rattling}} {{of the old}} ramshackle machine, and pounding of the donkey's hoofs on the gravel, and vigorous thwacks from sticks and hands and hats on his rump by his backers, accompanied with much noise of cheering and shouting.|$|R
6000|$|They {{had stopped}} at the {{crossing}} of a street; a heavy dray was lumbering slowly past them. Georgina, as she stood there, <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lover, and rested her eyes for some moments on his own. At last: [...] "Nothing will help us; I don't think we are very happy," [...] she answered, while her strange, ironical, inconsequent smile played about her beautiful lips.|$|R
60|$|The captain came on boldly, {{armed with}} sword and dagger, {{and in that}} moment, feeling himself spent, Garnache bitterly repented having relinquished his cloak. Yet he made a {{stubborn}} fight, and whilst they fenced and stamped about that room, Marius came to watch them, staggering to his mother's side and leaning heavily upon Tressan's shoulder. The Marquise <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> him, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> livid <b>to</b> the lips.|$|R
60|$|Something in the {{expression}} of her eyes, as she asked that question, warned Magdalen <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> further inward from the window than she had turned it yet. The bare doubt whether the housekeeper might not have seen her already under too strong a light shook her self-possession for the moment. She gave herself time to recover it, and merely answered by a bow.|$|R
6000|$|... [She {{does not}} answer. She hardly hears what he says. He hesitates [...] an instant wretchedly, {{and then goes}} quickly out of the room. [...] DAISY stands {{as if she were}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> stone. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> is haggard. [...] In a minute LEE TAI comes softly in. He stands at the door, [...] looking at her, then gives a little cough. She turns round and sees [...] him.|$|R
