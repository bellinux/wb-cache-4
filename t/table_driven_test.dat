40|$|Most of the {{commonly}} used modal testing methods {{are based on}} multiple point excitation. An alternative {{to this kind of}} excitation is driven-base testing using a multi-axis shaker <b>table.</b> <b>Driven</b> base <b>tests</b> excellently deliver all the eigenmodes of vibration which significantly react to a total acceleration of the structure through its interface to a primary structure in real operation. As a typical example, the article presents the modal identification of a large propeller which was performed on DLR's multi-axis vibration table MAVIS in Goettingen. For the first time, the interface forces between the structure and the shaker table were measured during the investigation of such a dynamically complex structure under base excitation. The analysis of interface forces and moments yields the effective and generalized masses of the structure, whereas the analysis of the structural responses deliver the eigenfrequencies, modal damping values, and mode shapes. The paper summarizes the theoretical background, elucidates the test procedure and test data evaluation, and presents typical test results which emphasize the measured interface forces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{consists}} of the two parts. In the first one we compare three string matching algorithms: Dömölki algorithm, also known as SHIFT OR algorithm, O(n×m), <b>Table</b> <b>driven</b> O((n + m) ×lg m) and Aho Corasick O(m + n). <b>Table</b> <b>driven</b> algorithm pass trough the same states as Dömölki one but have compact states encoding. The <b>table</b> <b>driven</b> algorithm can be also considered as Aho Corasick algorithm with eliminated ǫ-transitions. We advocate that the <b>table</b> <b>driven</b> algorithm is the best solution for matching multiple patterns of reasonable size. The {{second part of the}} paper deal with bottom-up syntax analysis. We have shown that the backward deterministic syntax analysis can be implemented via extension of a string matching automaton by a stack; or two stacks, if we want to go beyond context free grammars. The implementation of a parser this type is as easy as writing a recursive descent parser; we need to supply only the transition table, which can be easily derived from the grammar. Finally, we discuss some compiler engineering details. ...|$|R

40|$|The medium {{access control}} (MAC) {{technique}} of standard WLANs, called the distributed coordination function (DCF), is {{carrier sense multiple access}} based on collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme with binary slotted exponential backoff. It has a two way handshaking technique for packet transmission and also defines an additional four way handshaking technique called RTS/CTS mechanism, which is used to reduce the hidden terminal problem. The RTS/CTS frames carry the information of the packet length to be transmitted which can be read by any listening stations, to update a network allocation vector (NAV) about the information of the period of time in which the channel is busy. In this paper a method is proposed called the <b>table</b> <b>driven</b> technique (which has two parts called <b>table</b> <b>driven</b> DCF and <b>table</b> <b>driven</b> RTS/CTS) which is similar to the standard DCF (IEEE 802. 11) and RTS/CTS (IEEE 802. 11) system without having the exponential backoff. In this technique users use the optimum transmission probability by estimating the number of stations from the traffic conditions in a sliding window fashion one period at a time, thereby increasing the throughput compared to the standard DCF (IEEE 802. 11) and RTS/CTS (IEEE 802. 11) mechanism while maintaining the same fairness and the delay performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{existence}} of coverage holes in cellular networks {{is a common}} problem for mobile operators. Traditionally, the cellular coverage is computed using sophisticated planning tools, and then optimized through <b>drive</b> <b>tests.</b> With the <b>drive</b> <b>tests</b> information, the operators detect the poorly covered areas and take actions to eliminate them. The introduction of self-organized or “cognitive ” techniques, would allow the operators to maxi-mize the network’s information obtained through <b>drive</b> <b>tests</b> or reported by the mobile users. In this paper we propose the use of spatial Bayesian geo-statistics to build a Radio Environment Map (REM) for real coverage hole detection purposes. Results show {{that the number of}} pixels forming the coverage holes, as well as the probability of detecting them, can be significantly increased with the use of REMs, compared to the case where only network measurements are used.
