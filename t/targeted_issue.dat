40|$|As {{political}} elites become more polarized, and political rhetoric becomes increasingly conflictual, normative concerns have emerged {{about the state}} of citizen opinion. Do citizens weigh information even-handedly, or is their focus more myopic? Are citizens driven to extremes by exposure to one-sided rhetoric from elites? Using a novel experimental design, I assess the extent to which individuals ’ attitudes toward marijuana legalization are influenced by targeted arguments in favor or opposition. Exposure to targeted argumentation leads to biased information processing on the part of subjects, with normatively concerning implications for opinion. Results suggest that biased processing leads to polarized opinion not only on the <b>targeted</b> <b>issue,</b> but also spreads to unrelated issues. These effects are moderated only by accessibility of prior beliefs. These findings suggest a point of concern for the objectivity of citizens when faced with one-sided political debate. Citizen attention to politics and how they respond to political debate remains issue of great scholarly concern. While both early work on voting and opinion (Berelson et al. 1954; Converse 1964) and more recent studies of levels of political knowledge among the mass publi...|$|E
40|$|Though {{proactive}} followership {{behavior is}} {{often viewed as}} instrumental to group success, leaders do not always respond favorably to the actions of overly eager followers. Guided by a constructivist perspective, we investigated how interpretations of followership differ across the settings in which acts of leadership and followership emerge. In thematically analyzing data from semi-structured interviews with leaders of high-performing teams, we depict how the construal of follower behaviors relates to various contextual factors underscoring leader-follower interactions. Prototypical characteristics were described in relation to ideal followership (i. e., active independent thought, ability to process self-related information accurately, collective orientation, relational transparency). However, proactive followership behaviors were subject to the situational and relational demands that were salient during leader-follower interactions. Notably, the presence of third party observers, {{the demands of the}} task, stage in the decision making process, suitability of the <b>targeted</b> <b>issue,</b> and relational dynamics influenced which follower behaviors were viewed as appropriate from the leaderâ��s perspective. These findings provide insight into when leaders are more likely to endorse proactive followership, suggesting that proactive followership requires an awareness of how to calibrate oneâ��s actions in accordance with prevailing circumstance...|$|E
40|$|Privacy {{preservation}} is {{that the}} most <b>targeted</b> <b>issue</b> in information publication, because the sensitive data shouldn't be leaked. For this sake, several privacy preservation data mining algorithms are proposed. In this work, feature selection using evolutionary algorithm and data masking coupled with slicing is treated as a multiple objective optimisation to preserve privacy. To start with, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is carried out over the datasets to perceive the sensitive attributes and prioritise the attributes for treatment as per their determined sensitive level. In the next phase, to distort the data, noise {{is added to the}} higher level sensitive value using Hybrid Data Transformation (HDT) method. In the following phase slicing algorithm groups the correlated attributes organized and by this means reduces the dimensionality by retaining the Advanced Clustering Algorithm (ACA). With the aim of getting the optimal dimensions of buckets, tuple segregating is accomplished by Metaheuristic Firefly Algorithm (MFA). The investigational consequences imply that the anticipated technique can reserve confidentiality and therefore the information utility is additionally high. Slicing algorithm allows the protection of association and usefulness in which effects in decreasing the information dimensionality and information loss. Performance analysis is created over OCC 7 and OCC 15 and our optimization method proves its effectiveness over two totally different datasets by showing 92. 98 % and 96. 92 % respectively...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 62 - 68. Hypergraph partitioning is recently used in distributed {{information retrieval}} (IR) and spatial databases to correctly capture the communication and disk access costs. In the hypergraph models for these areas, {{the quality of}} the partitions obtained using hypergraph partitioning can be crucial for the objective of the targeted problem. Replication is a widely used terminology to address different performance issues in distributed IR and database systems. The main motivation behind replication is to improve the performance of the <b>targeted</b> <b>issue</b> at the cost of using more space. In this work, we focus on replicated hypergraph partitioning schemes that improve the quality of hypergraph partitioning by vertex replication. To this end, we propose a replicated partitioning scheme where replication and partitioning are performed in conjunction. Our approach utilizes successful multilevel and recursive bipartitioning methodologies for hypergraph partitioning. The replication is achieved in the uncoarsening phase of the multilevel methodology by extending the efficient Fiduccia-Mattheyses (FM) iterative improvement heuristic. We call this extended heuristic replicated FM (rFM). The proposed rFM heuristic supports move, replication and unreplication operations on the vertices by introducing new algorithms and vertex states. We show rFM has the same complexity as FM and integrate the proposed replication scheme into the multilevel hypergraph partitioning tool PaToH. We test the proposed replication scheme on realistic datasets and obtain promising results. Selvitopi, Reha OğuzM. S...|$|E
40|$|Abstract of thesis {{entitled}} Policy Making and Remaking in Education Policy Change: an Analysis of Policies on the Admission of Zexiao Students by Senior Secondary Schools in Beijing, China {{submitted by}} XIAO Chong for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy at The University of Hong Kong in August 2016 With reference to the making and remaking of policies on the admission of zexiao students to senior secondary schools (SSSs) in Beijing, People’s Republic of China (PRC), this qualitative empirical study explores the complexities and dynamics of the interactions among the central government, local governments and schools in regards to education policy change. In this study, zexiao refers to public SSSs’ admission of students whose academic performance fails to reach minimum admission requirements, subject to their paying fees in addition to standard tuition. It examines, at the organizational level and in different stages of education policy change, how involved policy actors’ interests, considerations, and capabilities determined how they made, interpreted, implemented, or remade relevant policies, leading to policy change on various scales. Data were collected from document analysis and semi-structured interviews, conducted in 2014, with 17 school principals/vice principals from 17 public SSSs and 13 educational officials from the central, Beijing municipal, and district governments. Regarding the admission of zexiao students, this study finds, firstly, that when central and local governments are incapable of solving certain issues, relevant responsibilities and authority are decentralized to lower level actors, together with increased flexibility (derived from deliberately given autonomy and/or leeway arising from loopholes) in policy interpretation and/or implementation. In such a situation, public actors cooperate with the end beneficiaries to resolve their common issues. Secondly, by utilizing any form of said flexibility, lower level policy actors manipulate the interpretation and implementation of relevant policies, because of their not being capable of bearing the decentralized responsibilities. Discrepancies between policy making and policy implementation, along with irregularities, are officially tolerated unless negative outcomes occur and public dissatisfaction emerges, at which point regulatory policies are made to control the discrepancies and irregularities within an acceptable limit. In such circumstances, collaboration and compromise between public actors and affected actors can be observed. Thirdly, when central and local governments’ ability to solve the <b>targeted</b> <b>issue</b> is strengthened, responsibilities and authority are centralized, official toleration is lessened, and flexibility is reduced, either by setting and strengthening the bottom-line for operations, withdrawal of autonomy, fixing loopholes, and/or promotion by steps. In this process, public actors force the target group to give up part of their interests. To explain these findings, this study proposes a theoretical framework for understanding policy change in China, which is interpreted {{as a consequence of}} adjustments to policy space. It defines the concept of policy space as the flexibility in a policy that allows concerned actors to manipulate its interpretation and implementation. By making use of policy space, different actors can differently interpret the policy and/or use different strategies to implement, adjust and/or adapt it according to their own agenda, needs, and conditions. This can generate different chemistries in the interactions between these actors (e. g. collaboration, compromise, and competition) and therefore result in different policy outcomes, as expected by or deviated from the policy. However, policy space is not unlimited, and can be confined and constrained by policymakers’ bottom-line. Changes in external context, actors, and/or their interests and bottom-lines, can result in different dynamics and interactions, and hence to different policy outcomes, ranging from slight adjustments to radical changes. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Answers to {{attitude}} {{questions in}} surveys can vary markedly {{depending on the}} preceding items in the questionnaire. This study concerns such context effects. More than 1, 100 re-spondents were asked about six <b>target</b> <b>issues</b> in a telephone sur-vey. Before answering the target questions, most of the respon-dents had been asked about one of two sets of related issues; the remainder received unrelated, "neutral " context items. For {{five of the six}} <b>target</b> <b>issues,</b> the two groups receiving different sets of context items differed significantly in their answers to the target questions. However, only one of the substantive context groups differed significantly from the group that received the neutral context items. Additional results indicated that context effects were larger when respondents reported that their beliefs about the <b>target</b> <b>issue</b> were both mixed and important. Coding of open-ended responses to follow-up questions suggested that the con-text items may have changed how respondents thought about the <b>target</b> <b>issues.</b> Context effects appear to arise through several distinct processes. Ac-cording to Tourangeau and Rasinski (1988), answers to attitude ques-tions are produced in several stages (involving the comprehension of the item, retrieval of relevant material from memory, formation of an overall judgment, and selection of a response), and the outcome o...|$|R

40|$|This project {{examined}} the affective consequences of expressing moral convictions to an opposing majority. It was predicted that moral conviction would {{function as a}} buffer to the common negative emotions that occur when speaking out against majority opinion (e. g., fear; Asch, 1956; Berns, et al., 2005). It was also hypothesized that moral conviction would enhance positive feelings among those who speak out (e. g., pride). Two studies were conducting using two different research paradigms. Study 1 used a normative influence paradigm modeled after Hornsey, Smith, and Begg (2007). Participants 2 ̆ 7 opinions and strength of moral conviction about the <b>target</b> <b>issue</b> (torture of suspected terrorists) were assessed. Participants, after being {{led to believe that}} the majority of their fellow students held the opposing opinion, were asked if {{they would be willing to}} have their opinion (with their full names) published in the school paper. Results show that simply having high moral conviction about the issue was associated with a feeling of strength - the effect of moral conviction on affect did not depend on speaking out. Study 2 used a computer-based version of an Asch-type conformity paradigm. The <b>target</b> <b>issue</b> was lowering the legal drinking age to 18. As in Study 1 there was a main effect of moral conviction; however an increase in moral conviction was associated with an increase in negative emotions after exposure to the normative influence and no increase in positive emotions. The difference between the main effects of moral conviction on affect found in the two studies is attributed to the difference in <b>target</b> <b>issues.</b> Study 2 also revealed that attitude direction has significant direct effects on affect...|$|R

The survey <b>targeted</b> <b>issues</b> related to referral and needs identification, assessment, certification, case progress feedback, and evaluation. Results: Less than half of the occupational therapists systematized the assessment prior to intervention and very few conducted any evaluation afterwards. Feedback from workmen or grant managers to the occupational therapists on each case's adaptation progress was often asked for but rarely given. The majority of the participants were satisfied with the housing adaptation process in general, while at the same time they indicated a need for further improvements in the process. Differences between occupational therapists related to employer and year of graduation were found on the majority of the <b>targeted</b> <b>issues.</b> Conclusions: To conclude, to a very large extent housing adaptations seem to be based on non-standardized procedures for assessment, and only a few of them are evaluated systematically...|$|R
