The boron in boric acid reduces the {{probability}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>fission</b> by absorbing some thermal neutrons. Fission chain reactions are generally driven by the probability that free neutrons will result in fission and {{is determined by the}} material and geometric properties of the reactor.

By increasing boric acid concentration in the reactor coolant, the probability that a neutron will cause fission is reduced. Changes in boric acid concentration can effectively regulate the rate of fission taking place in the reactor. Boric acid is used only in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) whereas boiling water reactors (BWRs) employ control rod pattern and coolant flow for power control. BWRs use an aqueous solution of boric acid and borax or Sodium Pentaborate for an emergency shut down system. Boric acid may be dissolved in spent fuel pools used to store spent fuel elements.

The power of the reactor is determined by the instantaneous rate of fission events that take place in the fuel. As the water heats up, it expands and becomes less dense, which provides fewer molecules per volume to moderate the neutrons, hence fewer neutrons are slowed to the required thermal energies to sustain <b>thermal</b> <b>fission.</b> Conversely, when the coolant water temperature decreases, its density increases and a greater number of neutrons reach the required thermal energy, increasing the number of fissions per unit of time, creating more heat.

40|$|The fission {{processes}} of thermal excited nuclei are conventionally studied by statistical models which rely on inputs of phenomenological level densities and potential barriers. Therefore the microscopic descriptions of spontaneous fission and induced fission are very desirable for a unified understanding of various fission processes. We propose {{to study the}} fission rates, at both low and high temperatures, with microscopically calculated temperature-dependent fission barriers and collective mass parameters. The fission barriers are calculated by the finite-temperature Skyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS method. The mass parameters are calculated by the temperature-dependent cranking approximation. The <b>thermal</b> <b>fission</b> rates {{can be obtained by}} the imaginary free energy approach at all temperatures, in which fission barriers are naturally temperature dependent. The fission at low temperatures can be described mainly as a barrier-tunneling process. While the fission at high temperatures has to incorporate the reflection above barriers. Our results of spontaneous fission rates reasonably agree with other studies and experiments. The temperature dependencies of fission barrier heights and curvatures have been discussed. The temperature dependent behaviors of mass parameters have also been discussed.

40|$|Studies of finer {{details in}} mass and charge {{distribution}} fission {{leads to a}} better understanding of the fission process. Experimental determination of independent and cumulative yields using radiochemical techniques as well as mass spectrometers and fission product recoil separators form the basis of such studies. It has been established that closed shells as well as an even number of nucleons influence both mass and charge distributions. The magnitudes of these effects may be estimated from existing experimental yield data and various fission models. Using our measurements of several fission yields and those existing in the literature we have calculated even-odd proton and neutron effects for various low energy fissioning systems. Where enough data existed, direct calculations were made, whereas for other cases the Zp-model of WAHL has been used.

Data related to this production are therefore requested by nuclear industry. In the present paper, we report results from measurements of the 4 He and 3 H emission probabilities (denoted LRA/B and t/B, respectively). These measurements concern both <b>thermal</b> neutron-induced <b>fission</b> reactions as well as spontaneous fission decays. For spontaneous fission, data are reported for nuclides ranging from 238 Pu up to 252 Cf. For <b>thermal</b> neutron-induced <b>fission,</b> results cover target nuclei between 229 Th and 251 Cf. Based on these and other results, semi-empirical relations are proposed.
