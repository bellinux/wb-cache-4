5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine <b>thrust.</b> <b>The</b> oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine <b>thrust.</b> <b>The</b> oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Female mice {{were placed}} with males and {{subjected}} to three different treatments.

The third group experienced a variable number of pre-ejaculatory <b>thrusts</b> only. <b>The</b> results indicated that a large number ofpre-ejaculatory thrusts is neither necessary, nor sufficient, for the induction of luteal activity in the female mouse. The ejaculatory reflex and the formation of the copulatory plug are sufficient to induce luteal activity regardless of the number of pre=req- ejaculatory <b>thrusts.</b> <b>The</b> results are compared with those of similar work on the rat...|$|R
5|$|Silurian rocks {{form the}} Southern Uplands of Scotland, which were pushed {{up from the}} sea bed during the {{collision}} with Baltica/Avalonia. The majority of the rocks are weakly metamorphosed coarse greywacke. The Highlands were also affected by these collisions, creating a series of thrust faults in the northwest Highlands including the Moine <b>Thrust,</b> <b>the</b> understanding of which {{played an important role}} in 19th century geological thinking. Volcanic activity occurred across Scotland as a result of the collision of the tectonic plates, with volcanoes in southern Scotland, and magma chambers in the north, which today form the granite mountains such as the Cairngorms.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of <b>thrust.</b> <b>The</b> variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.|$|E

On May 19, the Iraqis were about to drive west through Nablus toward Tulkarm, and asked the Syrians to make a diversion in the Degania area to protect their right flank. The Syrians complied, their main objective being to seize the bridge across the river north of Degania Alef, thus blocking any Israeli attack from Tiberias against the Iraqi line of communications.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>thrust</b> {{characteristic}} {{and efficiency}} of synthetic jet underwater is easily affected by the geometrical parameters. In this paper, the influence of nozzle geometrical parameters on <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> of synthetic jet underwater is investigated through numerical method. The geometrical parameters studied include nozzle diameter and nozzle height. The numerical method is validated using the experiment data. A mathematical model of <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> is established. This model decomposes <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> into three parts. By adjusting the weights of these parts, the dynamic characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> can be rebuilt. Using this method, the mechanism behind <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> variation with nozzle geometrical parameters is analyzed. The variation of <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> with <b>the</b> nozzle diameter is induced by the increase of the acceleration force and the decrease of the pressure force. When the nozzle diameter is small, <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> is velocity dominated. While when diameter is large, <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> is acceleration dominated. <b>The</b> <b>thrust</b> variation with nozzle height has two different patterns. The pressure force dominates the first pattern of <b>thrust</b> variation. And <b>the</b> acceleration force contributes more to the second pattern of <b>thrust</b> variation. <b>The</b> results in this paper {{can be used for}} the efficiency oriented optimal design of synthetic jet actuator underwater.

5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to the landing gear in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric <b>thrust,</b> <b>the</b> number one engine (outboard on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine <b>thrust.</b> <b>The</b> standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E
5|$|With {{no other}} choices left, Feige {{drew up a}} plan for another offensive. The thinly {{stretched}} forces of the 169th division had to split up {{to take over the}} defense line along the entire frontline between Kayrala and its adjacent lakes. The Finnish 6th Division would then be freed to undertake another massive flanking operation. Coming from the very south, they would circumvent the Soviet positions at Kayrala and thrust to a position east of it behind the Soviet lines at Lake Nurmi. The 169th Division would do the same, but from the north, resulting in a large pincer movement to trap the Soviets. At the beginning of August 1941 this plan was launched with the Finnish 6th Division heading the renewed drive of the XXXVI Corps with the 169th Division following. The plan met with unexpected success. The attack completely surprised the Soviets and a large firefight developed around Kayraly. The German-Finnish force was able to encircle large parts of the Soviet 42nd Rifle Corps and its 104th Division. Although some units escaped, large Soviet formations were subsequently destroyed and the Soviets had to leave most of their equipment behind. In the face of the new German <b>thrust,</b> <b>the</b> Soviets retreated to the Tuutsa River. They tried to establish a new defensive line around Alakurtti, but were unable to hold out against the pursuing Finnish-German units. After the Soviets lost Alakurtti they withdrew to the Voyta River where the old 1939 Soviet border fortifications were situated.|$|E

25|$|Mach3 {{performance}} in the 1950s was difficult to achieve. Jet engines compress incoming air, then mix it with fuel and ignite the mixture. The resulting expansion of gases produces <b>thrust.</b> <b>The</b> compressors generally can ingest air only at subsonic speeds. To operate supersonically, aircraft use advanced intakes to slow the supersonic air to a usable speed. The energy lost in this process heats the air, which means the engine has to operate at ever-higher temperatures to provide net <b>thrust.</b> <b>The</b> limiting factor in this process is {{the temperature of the}} materials in the engines, in particular, the turbine blades just behind the combustion chambers. Using materials available at the time, speeds much beyond Mach2.5 were difficult to achieve.|$|E
