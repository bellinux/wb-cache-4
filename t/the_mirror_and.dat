5|$|Record {{charts in}} the United Kingdom began life on 14 November 1952 when NME imitated an idea started in American Billboard {{magazine}} and began compiling a hit parade. Prior to 15 February 1969, when the British Market Research Bureau chart was established, {{there had been}} no universally accepted chart. During this time the BBC used aggregated results of charts from <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> <b>and</b> other sources to compile the Pick of the Pops chart. However, according to The Official Charts Company and Guinness' British Hit Singles & Albums, the NME is considered the official British singles chart before 10 March 1960. After that date and until 1969 a chart compiled by Record Retailer is considered the official British singles chart.|$|E

The road is now called Goldfinger Avenue. Southend Airport was used for the scene where Goldfinger flies to Switzerland. Ian Fleming visited the set of Goldfinger in April 1964; he died a few months later in August 1964, shortly before the film's release.

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. Sitting in a small room, she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature her looking towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a blurry shot of Hamasaki looking away from <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> <b>and</b> the TV screens from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E

5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. <b>The</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
5|$|The novel Fairest of All: A Tale of the Wicked Queen by Serena Valentino, {{published}} by Disney Press in 2009, {{tells a story}} much more sympathetic to the Queen than most other Disney media.

According to the book, her mother was a witch and the King died in a war against another kingdom prior to the events of the film. After her husband's death, the Queen slowly descends into madness. By the end of novel, Snow White gets <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> the Queen becomes the spirit inside the mirror after her death in the film.|$|E

The bedroom was modified in the 18th century {{by the addition of}} a new fireplace (about 1700) and sculptured borders of cascades of flowers around <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> added in 1784.

25|$|Until {{recently}} {{it was thought}} that self-recognition was absent from animals without a neocortex, and was restricted to mammals with large brains and well developed social cognition. However, in 2008 a study of self-recognition in corvids reported significant results for magpies. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common ancestor nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> mark tests showed that neocortex-less magpies are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> mark test {{in a manner similar to}} apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness. However even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Occurrence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and old individuals. For monkeys, non-primate mammals, and in a number of bird species, exploration of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> social displays were observed. However, hints at mirror-induced self-directed behavior have been obtained.|$|E
25|$|DSLRs {{generally}} have greater cost, size, and weight. They also have louder operation, {{due to the}} SLR mirror mechanism. Sony's fixed mirror design manages to avoid this problem. However, that design has the disadvantage {{that some of the}} light received from the lens is diverted by <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> thus the image sensor receives about 30% less light compared with other DSLR designs.|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{components of}} a Fourier transform spectrometer include a polychromatic light source and a Michelson Interferometer with a movable mirror. When light goes into the interferometer, it is separated into two beams. 50% of the light reaches <b>the</b> static <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other half reaches <b>the</b> movable <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> two light beams reflect from <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> <b>and</b> combine as a single beam again at the beam splitter. The combined beam travels through the sample and is finally collected by the detector. The retardation (total path difference) of the light beams between <b>the</b> static <b>mirror</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> movable <b>mirror</b> results in interference patterns. The IR absorption by the sample occurs at many frequencies and the resulting infereogram is composed of all frequencies except for those absorbed.
