5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. He {{has no idea what}} to do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown even though there was no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials <b>tell</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{they play}} their {{favorite}} game, Eels and Escalators. Patrick always gets escalators but SpongeBob always gets eels. Eventually, he loses {{the game and}} accidentally utters the swear word. Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to <b>tell</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him, inadvertently getting Patrick to say the word in the process. When SpongeBob bursts {{through the front door}} and tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish explanations, and takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them paint the Krusty Krab as punishment.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, after further {{evidence}} {{was written in}} the record and the prosecution and defense made their closing statements, Ward formally sentenced Heirens to three life terms. As Heirens waited to be transferred to Stateville Prison from the Cook County Jail, Sheriff Michael Mulcahy asked Heirens if Suzanne Degnan suffered when she was killed. Heirens answered:I can't tell you if she suffered, Sheriff Mulcahy. I didn't kill her. <b>Tell</b> <b>Mr.</b> Degnan to please look after his other daughter, because whoever killed Suzanne is still out there.|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to <b>tell</b> <b>Mr</b> Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

[...] "It turns out that it was an effort to make the company's [...] {{accurate}} ... It now appears the chairman reacted with righteous indignation.

500|$|Although {{the cause}} of women's {{suffrage}} remained her principal concern, {{at least until the}} First World War, Cobden was active in other campaigns. In 1903 she defended the principles of free trade, as expressed by her father, against Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform crusade. [...] Chamberlain had called for a policy of Imperial Preference, and the imposition of tariffs against countries opposed to Britain's imperial interests. To a meeting in Manchester, Cobden expressed confidence that [...] "Manchester... will <b>tell</b> <b>Mr</b> Chamberlain that it is still loyal to our old flag: free trade, peace and goodwill among nations". [...] In 1904, Richard Cobden's centenary year, she published The Hungry Forties, described by Anthony Howe in a biographical article as [...] "an evocative and brilliantly successful tract". [...] It was one of several free trade books and pamphlets issued by the Fisher Unwin press which, together with celebratory centenary events, helped to define free trade as a major progressive cause of the Edwardian era.|$|E
500|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob reads a [...] "bad word" [...] off a dumpster behind the Krusty Krab, but {{does not know what}} it means. Patrick explains to him that it is a [...] "sentence enhancer" [...] which is used [...] "when you want to talk fancy." [...] The two start using it in every sentence they speak. However, when Mr. Krabs hears them, he warns the two never to use the word again or any of the 13 bad words. Later on, SpongeBob accidentally swears again. Patrick then runs to <b>tell</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him. However, when Mr. Krabs accidentally injures his toe, he utters all the 13 bad words. The two cannot believe it and run to Mama Krabs to tell on him. Mama Krabs, who is appalled by their use of the words, makes the three paint her house as punishment.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] The episode focused on {{the life cycle of}} birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. [...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street <b>tell</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hooper's friend Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, [...] "Just because". [...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.|$|E

Before they close the door, Duncan yells to the Baudelaire orphans [...] "Look in the notebooks! V.F.D.!" [...] before they are captured.

Charlie and Grandpa Joe end up goading the other three grandparents out of bed, pointing out that their bed can't make it up to Marine One, forcing them to leap out of bed, not wanting to miss the opportunity. As the helicopter prepares to take the family to a department store so Charlie's grandparents may obtain clothes to replace their pyjamas, Charlie and Grandpa Joe remark between themselves that their adventures have only [...] "just begun".|$|E

It follows the casting and creative process, in which Mr G's short temper and perfectionism make the project increasingly more difficult for all involved. Finally, Annabel's parents intervene and <b>tell</b> <b>Mr</b> G they are uncomfortable of the dramatisation of their late daughter's life and death, in particular the song [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] that painted Annabel as a vapid party girl addicted to drugs. Mr G then quickly writes [...] "Mr G: The Musical" [...] and is forced to cast a boy with Down syndrome as the lead. Mr G's beloved dog Celine is hit by a car, and all aspects of his life seem to be in a downward spiral. However, the musical goes off without a hitch, with Mr G providing the vocals. In reflection, Mr G expresses happiness that [...] "Mr G: The Musical" [...] was able to happen, and claims the project was salvaged due to his creative genius.
