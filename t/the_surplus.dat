5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home heating fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold on the payroll tax exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million surplus for the previous year and a $59 surplus forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities.

40|$|Given the {{emphasis}} on social provisioning in heterodox economics, two of its central theoretical organizing principles are the concepts of the total social product and <b>the</b> social <b>surplus.</b> This appears to link heterodox economics to <b>the</b> social <b>surplus</b> approach associated with the classical economists and currently with Sraffian economists.
