5|$|Unlike Schaefer, {{many members}} of RKO's board of {{governors}} did not like Welles or the control that his contract gave him. However such board members as Nelson Rockefeller and NBC chief David Sarnoff were sympathetic to Welles. Throughout production Welles had problems with these executives not respecting his contract's stipulation of non-interference and several spies arrived on set to report what they saw to <b>the</b> <b>executives.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> would sometimes arrive on set unannounced the entire cast and crew would suddenly start playing softball until they left. Before official shooting began <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> intercepted all copies of the script and delayed their delivery to Welles. They had one copy sent to their office in New York, resulting in it being leaked to press.|$|E
5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over <b>the</b> <b>executives.</b> Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E

5|$|Back in New York, {{executives}} of the Pan American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host a broadcast of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. <b>The</b> <b>executives</b> first introduce him to Alan's work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary, The Last Road to Hell, depicting executions in several war-torn countries. One of <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> tells Monroe that Alan staged such dramatic scenes to get more exciting footage. Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which first follows the group's trek through the jungle. After walking for days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe's leg with a machete to save his life, but he quickly dies and is left behind. The remaining four locate the Yacumo. Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew forces the tribe into a hut and burn it down in order to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe criticizes the staged scenes and poor treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio {{began to think}} of a supernatural spin on the pirate genre.

5|$|In post-production, Embassy's self-imposed role {{in making}} Crimewave was even greater.

Miyata also circulated a petition targeted at employees calling on the reinstatement of Woodford. As Olympus has a 70-percent market share in endoscopy, the scandal caused anxiety and concern among the medical profession, which sees Olympus endoscopes as irreplaceable.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{difference}} between a generalized secretary and skilled executive assistants is that <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> assistant is required {{to be able to}} interact extensively with the general public, vendors, customers, and any other person or group that <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> is responsible to interact with. As the level that <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> interacts with increases so does the level of skill required in <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> assistant that works with <b>the</b> <b>executive.</b> Those executive assistants that work with corporate officers must be capable of emulating the style, corporate philosophy, and corporate persona of <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> for which they work.

The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J.

To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E
