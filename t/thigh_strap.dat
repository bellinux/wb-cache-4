40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{investigated}} the effect of body size and shape and harness fit on suspension tolerance time. BackgroundFall victims may develop suspension trauma, a potentially fatal reduction of return blood flow from legs to the heart and brain, after a successfully arrested fall {{if they are not}} rescued quickly or the harness does not fit them well. MethodFor this study, 20 men and 17 women with construction experience were suspended from the dorsal D-ring of a full-body fall-arrest harness. Their suspension tolerance time, physical characteristics, and harness fit levels were assessed. ResultsBody characteristics (i. e., weight, stature, upper- and lower-torso depths) were associated with decreased suspension tolerance time (r = 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 019. 36 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c. 45, p 22 ̆ 0304. 03). In addition, harness fit affected suspension tolerance time; workers with a torso angle of suspension greater than 3520, a <b>thigh</b> <b>strap</b> angle greater than 5020, or a poorly fitting harness size had shorter suspension tolerance time (mean differences = 14, 11, and 9. 8 min, respectively, p 22 ̆ 0304. 05). ConclusionBody size and harness fit were predictors of suspension tolerance time. Selecting well-fit harnesses and establishing a 9 -min rescue plan are suggested to ensure that no more than 5...|$|E

5000|$|Models {{vary from}} a small {{clipboard}} with <b>thigh</b> <b>straps</b> to more elaborate designs with multiple panels that fold much like a wallet (usually with a means to hold the folded board closed such as a snap or velcro.) As the kneeboard is designed to keep flight-pertinent information close at hand, it may have charts and information (such as IFR references) printed directly on it, or include pockets and clips to hold maps, approach plates, and aids to calculation such as the E6B Flight Computer. The popularity of cockpit iPads have necessitated the need for kneeboards designed to hold iPads or other tablets.|$|R
50|$|Packrafts have {{historically}} been used as portable boats for long distance wilderness travel, usage that reached its apogee in the Higman-McKittrick 4,500 mile expedition along the Pacific Coast from Seattle to the Aleutian Islands. This classical use has been modified by most packraft owners to shorter day trips that mix trail hiking and river and creek floats or lake paddles. In Europe packrafts are used together with train travel. Most of these hike and paddle applications are in gentler water of Class II or less. However, low-flow steep creeks rated to Class V and other whitewater runs that were previously considered suitable only for kayaks and bigger rafts, are now run frequently by packrafters. The addition of spray decks and <b>thigh</b> <b>straps</b> allow more precise control of the craft. Eskimo rolling in packrafts is now done routinely. Packrafts are increasingly popular among fishers and hunters as well as travelers who wish to carry a lightweight craft on airplanes.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} is surveyed to determine human tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. Pertinent {{human and animal}} experiments applicable to space flight and to crash impact forces are analyzed and discussed. These data are compared and presented {{on the basis of}} a trapezoidal pulse. The effects of body restraint and of acceleration direction, onset rate, and plateau duration on the maximum tolerable and survivable rapidly applied accelerations are shown. Results of the survey indicate that adequate torso and extremity restraint is the primary variable in tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. The harness, or restraint system, must be arranged to transmit the major portion of the accelerating force directly to the pelvic structure and not via the vertebral column. When the conditions of adequate restraint have been met, then the other variables, direction, magnitude, and onset rate of rapidly applied accelerations, govern maximum tolerance and injury limits. The results also indicate that adequately stressed aft-faced passenger seats offer maximum complete body support with minimum objectionable harnessing. Such a seat, whether designed for 20 -, 30 -, or 40 -G dynamic loading, would include lap strap, chest (axillary) strap, and winged-back seat to increase headward and lateral G protection, full-height integral head rest, arm rests (load-bearing) with recessed hand-holds and provisions to prevent arms from slipping either laterally or beyond the seat back, and leg support to keep the legs from being wedged under the seat. For crew members and others whose duties require forward-facing seats, maximum complete body support requires lap, shoulder, and <b>thigh</b> <b>straps,</b> lap-belt tie-down strap, and full-height seat back with integral head support...|$|R
50|$|She {{missed the}} Australian tournaments the {{following}} week, electing {{to go straight}} to Melbourne for the 2017 Australian Open. Drawn against seventh seed Garbiñe Muguruza, to whom she had lost at the same point two years earlier, she had a royal chance to reverse that result once it became clear that Muguruza was finding it very uncomfortable to play with a hamstring strain incurred in her previous match in Brisbane. Erakovic held a set point on Muguruza's serve at 5-4, but couldn't convert, and then dropped her own serve as Muguruza went on to take the first set 7-5. A long medical time-out followed before Muguruza reappeared with her <b>thigh</b> heavily <b>strapped.</b> Erakovic broke service to lead 4-1, and was two points away from another break, with Muguruza moving very gingerly, when everything turned against the New Zealander. Muguruza managed to hold that serve, and then won the next four games in a row as Erakovic made a string of unforced errors. The final score was 7-5, 6-4. Once again, with her ranking so low, Erakovic was unable to find a partner to compete in the doubles.|$|R
30|$|Participants {{underwent}} {{the muscle}} strength test of maximum voluntary isometric contraction by knee extension (MVIC) at a knee angle of 90 degree, {{as described by}} previous studies (Andrews et al. 1996; Demura and Demura 2013; Sipila et al. 1996). After physically warm-up, they sit at 90 degree of the hips and knees flexion on a chair without back support. A strain gauge-type tension sensor (T.K.K. 1269 f, Takei Scientific Instruments Company, Ltd., Nigata, Japan) was installed at the right ankle to measure the maximum force. Both their <b>thighs</b> were tightly <b>strapped</b> with a belt into the chair. After they crossed their upper {{arms in front of}} their chest, they extended the right knee with maximum effort. They were asked not to move their upper body. The test was conducted twice and the higher value is used for analysis.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This article {{describes}} the derivation of strap lengths and adjustments to fall-arrest harnesses {{and the development of}} harness size configurations. Background: Updated harness sizing configurations are needed to accommodate diverse populations in the current workforce. Method: Three-dimensional torso anthropometric data from 243 women and 258 men were incorporated into eight validated equations to develop a cost-effective harness sizing plan and to define strap lengths. Results: To met strap adjustable range goals and to accommodate 95 % to 98 % of the estimated population, two sizing options were identified. Conclusion: Study outcomes suggest system improve-ment with three to four sizes for women and three to four sizes for men, on which the adjustment ranges of the torso straps were within 15 to 17 cm and within 20 to 23 cm on <b>thigh</b> and hip <b>straps.</b> Application: This research provided harness sizing and cut-length information for harness design {{to reduce the risk of}} worker injury that results from poor fit or improper size selection...|$|R
50|$|The last {{match in}} the round robin stage {{featured}} Agnieszka Radwańska who replaced co-alternate Vera Zvonareva and Victoria Azarenka. Azarenka needed to win to clinch the last semifinal place or it would go to Wozniacki. Azarenka appeared to be cruising to the straight sets win that would have seen her top the white group when she took a 6-4 5-2 lead over Radwańska. After Azarenka broke in the opening game and although Radwańska broke {{back in the second}} game, the opening game set the tone as the Belarusian broke again in the 5th and 6th games to race out to a 5-2 lead. Azarenka did suffer a minor blip in concentration {{towards the end of the}} first set as she allowed Radwańska one of the breaks back, it was only a temporary lapse as the Belarusian served it out at the second attempt. Azarenka ran away with match in the early stages of the second set, breaking in the first and third games. But the Pole, refused to give up and was rewarded for her patience when she broke back in the sixth game. Azarenka recovered her composure by immediately breaking back and setting up a chance to serve out the match. But the Belarusian undid all her good work with consecutive double faults to hand momentum back to Radwańska. The Pole raced through the next five games to seal the second set and level the match. The match was just one game into the third set when Azarenka was forced to take a medical timeout to have her left <b>thigh</b> heavily <b>strapped.</b> Three games later Azarenka was break points down and in tears after trying to race up the court to a drop shot. The Belarusian saved the first break point, but again she was left sobbing and kneeling on the ground next before going on to double fault and hand her opponent the break. One more medical timeout and one and a half games later and Azarenka decided she could not continue. Radwańska won 4-6 7-5 4-1, Azarenka retired due to cramp. The result meant that Janković topped the group with Wozniacki the runner up.|$|R
30|$|Proprioception was {{evaluated}} using the kinaesthetic test TDPM (Reider et al., 2003) on a Biodex-type isokinetic equipment (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). Both knees were evaluated one after another, {{starting with the}} uninjured knee to reassure athletes. Athletes were seated with 5 [*]cm between the popliteal fossa and the seat to prevent contact with the underlying surface. Athletes wore shorts to minimize material rubbing against their skin. The <b>thigh</b> was <b>strapped</b> and the leg {{was connected to the}} mobile arm of the Biodex using a pneumatic cuff {{at the level of the}} ankle. The centre of rotation was placed at the level of the lateral condyle of the knee. For each participant, the anatomic zero point was considered to be the extension position. Athletes were blind-folded and listened to music loud enough to cover any sounds from equipment sound, using headphones, because white noise was impossible with the other patients. The same music was used for all persons. Athletes used a press-button to stop the equipment with a single press of the thumb. Before initiating the TDPM test, a full explanation was given to each patient. Each athlete performed two practice tests (listening to music and blind-folded) to become familiar with the procedure. The starting position of each measurement was a 15 ° knee flexion (Pitman et al., 1992). After an unspecified period of time, the limb was moved into flexion with a 4 °/sec angular velocity. Athletes were asked to use the thumb-button as soon as they detected a knee movement. Pressure on the button instantaneously stopped the movement. The range of motion between the initiation of the movement and the stopping of the machine was recorded in degrees. The examiner then returned the device to the initial position, replacing the leg at 15 ° flexion, by an extension movement to 0 ° then a flexion of the knee to 15 ° which was calculated by a program in the Biodex. At the starting position, the athlete was informed that the next test would begin. The entire TDPM procedure included 10 tests for both limbs. The range of motion between the start position and the perception of movement were averaged for each knee. In first, we checked the reproducibility of this TDPM procedure on an isokinetic Biodex-style machine. In this context, we performed two measures on a healthy control population at a 1 day interval. The study was approved by the Ethics Biomedical Commission of the Academic Hospital of the UCL of Louvain-la-Neuve (Number: B 403 2012 14, 124). All participants provided written informed consent.|$|R
