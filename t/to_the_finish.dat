5|$|A {{total of}} 22 teams {{were invited to}} {{participate}} in the 1995 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 198 cyclists. Out of the 198 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 122 riders made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Milan.|$|E
5|$|Of the 86 riders {{that began}} the Giro d'Italia on 15 May, 24 {{of them made}} it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Rome on 6 June. Riders were allowed to ride {{on their own or}} {{as a member of a}} team. There were five teams that competed in the race: Atala-Dunlop, Bianchi-Pirelli, Fiat-Pirelli, Legnano-Dunlop, and Senior-Polack.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} {{started at the}} Mont Saint-Michel island monastery and {{finished}} north on at Utah Beach. The second stage was held between Saint-Lô and Cherbourg-en-Cotentin. The third stage left Manche in Granville and headed south <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Angers. Stage four took the race further south, between Saumur and Limoges, with the fifth stage crossing the elevated region of Massif Central <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> at the Le Lioran mountain resort. Stage six headed to Montauban before {{the entrance to the}} Pyrenees in stage seven. This mountain range also hosted two further stages: a roller-coaster stage eight and the finish in Andorra in stage nine. The following three stages, 10 to 12, crossed the south of the country eastwards to Mont Ventoux. After an individual time trial, stage 14 took the race northwards through the Rhône Valley, which was followed by a stage that took the race into the Jura Mountains. Stage 16 ended with a finish in Bern, Switzerland. The next four stages took place in and around the Alps, before a long transfer took the Tour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.|$|E

5|$|The peloton {{remained}} intact for roughly {{the first half}} of the sixth stage. Luigi Ganna and Carlo Galetti broke away from the pack and made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Rome where Ganna then edged out Galetti for the stage victory. During the next stage, a group of six riders lead for the most part before Galetti and Ganna broke away again. The two riders made their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Genoa, where a large crowd of spectators came to see the finish. Ganna went on to win his second consecutive stage, while Galetti extended his lead over the rest of the field. The race's eighth stage contained some harsh climbs, most notably the Giovi. The finish of the stage was hotly contested as Galetti, Ganna, and Eberardo Pavesi finished at the same time, with Galetti winning the stage in the end.|$|E
5|$|The season 6 {{finale of}} CBS's reality show The Amazing Race ended in Ping Tom Memorial Park.

5|$|A {{total of}} 101 riders started the second Giro d'Italia {{out of the}} 118 that signed up to participate. Of the 101 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 18 May, twenty of them made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Milan on 5 June. Riders were allowed to ride {{on their own or}} {{as a member of a}} team. There were six teams that competed in the race: Atala-Continental, Atena-Dunlop, Bianchi-Dunlop, Legnano-Dunlop, Otav-Pirelli, and Stucchi-Pirelli.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 18 teams {{were invited to}} {{participate}} in the 1994 Giro d'Italia, of which 17 participated. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 153 cyclists. The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager were introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place on 22 May, in the courtyard of the Bologna. Of the riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 99 riders made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Milan.|$|E
50|$|The Martial Arts tree {{consists}} of charge-up skills and finishing moves. Attacking with a charge-up skill increases {{the number of}} charges, up <b>to</b> three, then <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> move releases <b>the</b> charges in a single powerful blow (note that a normal attack also counts as a <b>finishing</b> move). <b>The</b> charge-up skills include attacks like Blades of Ice and Fists of Fire, which add elemental damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> blow, and also skills like Cobra Strike, which adds life and mana stealing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> attack. <b>The</b> <b>finishing</b> blows are, for the most part, kicks, such as Dragon Talon, which releases a number of kicks in quick succession, and Dragon Flight, which teleports on to a target and kicks them, releasing any charges.|$|R

The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager are introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place at the Palazzo dei Normanni on 11 May. From the riders that began this edition, 143 made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Merano.|$|E

Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists. The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager are introduced in front the media and local dignitaries – took place at the Verona Arena on 15 May. From the riders that began this edition, 135 made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Lucca.|$|E
5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the climb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> At {{the foot of}} the climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E

5|$|On {{the final}} climb, the Paterberg, Sagan rode away from Vanmarcke, who {{was caught by}} Cancellara {{at the top of}} the climb. They rode in pursuit of Sagan, who had a 15-second lead at the summit. The chasing pair were unable to bring Sagan back and he rode <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> to win his first Monument. Cancellara {{finished}} second, 25 seconds back, with Vanmarcke allowing him to take second place. Kristoff won the sprint for fourth place, ahead of Luke Rowe (Sky), 49 seconds behind Sagan.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{editions of}} the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy. The {{addition}} of the Côte de Cherave, however, added an unknown factor into the race: it was considered {{much more likely than}} in previous years that a group of riders could break away from the peloton on the penultimate climb and hold an advantage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line. No breakaway had won La Flèche Wallonne since 2003.|$|E
5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from a {{standing}} position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish.</b> In 800m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced {{to reduce the amount}} of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|E

5|$|Stage eleven was {{marred by}} rainy weather, which caused many splits in the peloton. Fabio Fontanelli won the stage {{as a member of}} the lead group, but tenth-place {{finisher}} Bruno Leali gained a six-second race lead by finishing more than three minutes in front of overall leader Miguel Indurain. The Giro's twelfth stage began with a large climb which led to many attacks. Despite the flurry of attacks, the whole peloton eventually made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line together for a sprint finish that was won by Russian Dimitri Konyshev.|$|E
5|$|The event {{began with}} a long {{primarily}} flat stage that was won by Dario Beni. He lost the lead after the next stage to the eventual winner Luigi Ganna, who in turn lost it to Carlo Galetti after the mountainous third stage. Ganna regained the lead after the fourth stage and successfully defended {{it all the way}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Milan, winning three stages en route. Atala won the team classification.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the second Giro d'Italia began with a large send off in the start city of Milan. The finish in Udine was hotly contested as five riders came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line in a pack. Ernesto Azzini managed to out-sprint the other four riders in the leading group to win the stage. The next stage saw the first non-Italian stage winner {{in the history of}} the Giro d'Italia, the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq. Dortignacq managed to {{breakaway}} from his fellow group member Carlo Galetti and then solo to the stage victory while five other riders chased close behind. Galetti's second-place finish on the stage was high enough for him to take the lead of the race. The French success enraged the Italian fans and led the competing riders to ban unite against the foreign riders. The third stage saw three major Italian riders, Luigi Ganna, Carlo Galetti, and Eberardo Pavesi, and attack early on in the stage. The three riders then rode together all the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Teramo. Galetti went on to win the stage, with Ganna and Pavesi following in quick succession.|$|E
