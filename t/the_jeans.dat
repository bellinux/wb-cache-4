5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies the {{interstellar}} medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter. In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined by <b>the</b> <b>Jeans</b> length) to form compact protostars.|$|E
5|$|This {{cosmology}} {{was accepted}} by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later scientists. Edmund Halley (1720) and Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux (1744) noted independently that the assumption of an infinite space filled uniformly with stars {{would lead to the}} prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the Sun itself; this became known as Olbers' paradox in the 19th century. Newton believed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity. This instability was clarified in 1902 by <b>the</b> <b>Jeans</b> instability criterion. One solution to these paradoxes is the Charlier Universe, in which the matter is arranged hierarchically (systems of orbiting bodies that are themselves orbiting in a larger system, ad infinitum) in a fractal way such that the Universe has a negligibly small overall density; such a cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in 1761 by Johann Heinrich Lambert. A significant astronomical advance of the 18th century was the realization by Thomas Wright, Immanuel Kant and others of nebulae.|$|E

5000|$|The {{difference}} between <b>the</b> $300 <b>jeans</b> and <b>the</b> $30 <b>jeans</b> often {{has to do}} with the fabric quality, hardware, washes, design details, abrasions, and where they are manufactured. A [...] "fancy" [...] pair of jeans that has been treated with abrasions, extra washes, etc., to break the denim down to achieve a texture has undergone a certain amount of damage to get the 'worn in' feel. In this sense, <b>the</b> expensive <b>jeans</b> may be more delicate than the cheap ones. Jeans brands also try to stand out from season to season by using patented materials, such as rivets and stitching, and by using special washes and distressing methods. These might involve dying, pressing, and even using sandpaper and drills on <b>the</b> raw <b>jeans.</b> These methods can be particularly expensive when done in the U.S., where factories must meet more stringent environmental and labor standards than in many low-cost nations.|$|R

[...] Basically, when clouds of gas and dust enter into a density wave and are compressed the rate of star formation increases as some clouds meet <b>the</b> <b>Jeans</b> criterion, and collapse to form new stars. [...] Since star formation does not happen immediately, the stars are slightly behind the density waves. [...] The hot OB stars that are created ionize the gas of the interstellar medium, and form H II regions.
