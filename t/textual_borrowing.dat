40|$|English as an Additional Language (EAL) students' <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> in {{disciplinary}} {{writing has}} attracted wide research interest in recent years. However, {{much of the}} research was conducted in the regular curriculum setting while the relevance of the issue in a writing-for-publication context has largely been overlooked. In particular, disciplinary experts' perspectives concerning <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> have not been explored in-depth. The present study fills such a gap in the literature by looking into how an expert writer, a professor of biochemistry in a Chinese university, perceived novices' <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> in their initial drafts and eliminated such borrowing as he redrafted novice texts for publication. The study revealed that the expert had complete tolerance for his students' copying and that his elimination of it during redrafting was guided by his genre expertise and rhetorical skills for publishing. The paper also pointed out that the shortage of explicit teaching from the supervisor to his students as well as the lack of active participation of his students in the writing process was bound to the publication pressure in the local institutional context. © 2012 Elsevier Inc [...] link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Bringing a novice, L 2 writer's perspectives and struggles {{to the fore}} using a Bakhtinian framework, I adopt a broad approach that demonstrates that learning how to cite sources {{may be the result}} of a complex, contextualized interplay of cultural, linguistic, educational, disciplinary influences, and developing L 2 writing competence. This exploratory case study reports on the <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> practices of a novice, Korean student in a TESOL program at a U. S. university, including how and why she incorporated source texts into her writing by examining the products and processes of her retrospective and concurrent writing-from-sources tasks. Data analyses entailed triangulating data from (1) semi-structured interviews on her academic literacy experiences, (2) textual analysis of an authentic, course-related research paper in terms of the amount and nature of <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> by source text type, (3) retrospective interviews on her research paper, (4) performance on Deckert's (1993) modified Plagiarism Identification Questionnaire, (5) textual analysis of an ensuing paraphrasing task, and (6) a post-questionnaire interview on previous instruction on plagiarism. Findings revealed that her lax criteria of textual ownership of words came from centripetal and centrifugal forces, that is, authoritative and internally persuasive discourses from her previous and current contexts, including addressivity to her professor's words to use her own words. Patchwriting occurred at the intersections of a coping, procedural display, and learning strategies to appropriate disciplinary content and academic discourse. Different patterns of <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> manifested by source text type, suggesting that, despite transgressive <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing,</b> her source texts also served as sources of input and models of how to write a research paper. At times, the textual boundaries between borrowing of content and imitation became hazy when the surrounding contexts in which her patchwriting occurred was examined. I conclude by offering implications that address aspects of discursive, perspectivial, and pedagogical tensions that have been relatively overlooked at the expense of ethical tension...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} fate of Classical theories of eloquence in early sixteenth-century France. Eloquence is a treasured commonplace inherited by the humanists from ancient Greece and Rome. It denotes the potent combination of elegant speech and irresistibly persuasive power, whether in oral or written form. Early modern writers were eager to translate this linguistic force into their vernacular to strengthen both their language and their literature. The twin projects of fashioning a French eloquence and a strong French language- in other words, "making eloquence French" and "making French eloquent" - participate in {{a growing sense of}} nationalism that is mediated by discourses on national language and literature. At the same time, however, imaginative writing shows itself to be less interested in the success stories of an eloquent France and more in the failures of eloquence. The process of domesticating eloquence sparks an ideological divide between imaginative writing and prescriptive texts such as treatises on rhetoric and poetry. The writers of my corpus mostly evoke the tradition of rhetorical theory to undermine it and, in so doing, they expose the vanity of eloquence. What are the stakes behind the representation of such a failure in the larger scope of the humanist project, at the heart of which is this kind of language? What does the failure of eloquence tell us about vernacular literary production in the early modern period? Taking these questions as a point of departure, this dissertation investigates how Classical and Renaissance concepts of eloquence are dissected in three major prose works published before the publication of Joachim Du Bellay's Deffence et illustration de la langue française in 1549. These works cannot be defined by one, single genre: instead, they are <b>textual</b> hybrids, <b>borrowing</b> discursive practices from history, fable, chronicle, autobiography, romance, and novel. It is the contention of this dissertation that the writers of my corpus fully utilize the manifold possibilities of hybrid imaginative writing in order to question eloquence and, more specifically, to expose the impossibility of a perfect eloquence. Such writing provides both a defective and an ideal space for this exploration. It is defective in that imaginative writing cannot account for the traditional requirements of an oral eloquent speech, namely, persuading by adapting according {{to the needs of the}} moment and by exploiting proximity to the audience to gain sway over their affective response. An eloquent speech set into print cannot recreate the speech-act of the orator. However, imaginative writing uses its fixity precisely to create situations in which eloquence can be closely scrutinized. It becomes important to set the reading audience at a safe distance from the performance of eloquence being read, for eloquence is often framed as a harmful contagion. The ideal reader of written eloquence is one who is in the know about how eloquence works, and is thus immune to its effects. The dissertation consists of three chapters, each dedicated to a major prose writer of the early sixteenth century in France: Jean Lemaire de Belges, François Rabelais, and Hélisenne de Crenne. An historical and conceptual introduction chapter precedes the analysis, and I end with a conclusion that looks forward to the later stylistic experiments of Michel de Montaigne. The dissertation contributes to the history of rhetoric in Renaissance France, and engages debates about the emergence of modern `literature' from earlier rhetorical traditions...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions of appropriation include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice of appropriation. This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions of appropriation by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development of appropriation beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding of appropriation might be extended and redefined. Here, appropriation is recognized as another source of lyric expression, critical innovation, and conceptual development in contemporary poetry. This thesis encourages a new perspective on the purpose and processes of poetic appropriation and the consequences of its declarative potential for both poet and poem...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigated}} how seven English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) international students at two graduate {{programs at the}} University of Ottawa wrote course papers {{in light of the}} university's policies on plagiarism. Informed by the New Literacy Studies, Bourdieu's social theory, Bakhtin's theory of language, and Ivanic's analytical framework of writer identity, the inquiry drew upon multiple sources of data involving field observations, artifact analysis, and interviews with the students, their course professors, and other faculty members over two consecutive academic sessions. The results indicate that patchwriting, defined as one writer working closely with other writers' texts while leaving behind traces of those texts (Howard, 1999), is a major strategy through which students make other peoples' words and ideas their own. The study further differentiates between localized patchwriting and global patchwriting, and offers an account of the reasons that give rise to each. It also discusses how educational practice simultaneously calls upon students to write as professionals and students, and considers the role that university plagiarism policies play in students' decision as to which identity to take up and textually enact. The study discusses faculty's mediation of plagiarism policies, and identifies a dissonance between their pedagogic response and the university's legalistic treatment of student <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> practices that violate common practice. The research also considers the impact of institutional plagiarism policies on students and professors, and makes suggestions for the re-consideration of university plagiarism policies and documents...|$|E
40|$|Plagiarism {{detection}} methods have improved signi cantly {{over the last}} decades, {{and as a result}} of the advanced research conducted by computa- tional and mostly forensic linguists, simple and sophisticated <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> strategies can now be identi ed more easily. In particular, simple text compari- son algorithms developed by computational linguists allow literal, word-for-word plagiarism (i. e. where identical strings of text are reused across di erent docu- ments) to be easily detected (semi-) automatically (e. g. Turnitin or SafeAssign), although these methods tend to perform less well when the borrowing is obfus- cated by introducing edits to the original text. In this case, more sophisticated linguistic techniques, such as an analysis of lexical overlap (Johnson, 1997), are required to detect the borrowing. However, these have limited applicability in cases of ‘translingual’ plagiarism, where a text is translated and borrowed with- out acknowledgment from an original in another language. Considering that (a) traditionally non-professional translation (e. g. literal or free machine trans- lation) is the method used to plagiarise; (b) the plagiarist usually edits the text for grammar and syntax, especially when machine-translated; and (c) lexical items are those that tend to be translated more correctly, and carried over to the derivative text, this paper proposes a method for ‘translingual’ plagiarism detec- tion that is grounded on translation and interlanguage theories (Selinker, 1972; Bassnett and Lefevere, 1998), as well as on the principle of ‘linguistic unique- ness’ (Coulthard, 2004). Empirical evidence from the CorRUPT corpus (Corpus of Reused and Plagiarised Texts), a corpus of real academic and non-academic texts that were investigated and accused of plagiarising originals in other languages, is used to illustrate the applicability of the methodology proposed for ‘translingual’ plagiarism detection. Finally, applications of the method as an investigative tool in forensic contexts are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In Hong Kong, where English {{is used as}} {{the main}} medium of {{instruction}} in universities, the majority of undergraduates studying in various disciplines are local students whose first language is Chinese. Although there were many studies of second language (L 2) writing in English, {{many of them were}} oriented towards product or process and were conducted in artificial settings. There have been relatively few situated studies of English L 2 writing in higher education in the social contexts in which students undertake their writing tasks. This study seeks to address this primary question: How do nonnative-English-speaking (NNES) business undergraduates in Hong Kong undertake the assessed writing tasks of their disciplinary courses? Case study was used to examine two NNES undergraduate students undertaking their assessed writing tasks in a Hong Kong university. Data were collected over a period of two years and from multiple sources: text-based interviews, participant diaries, and documents (texts produced by the participants, course documents and source materials). Inductive analysis was employed {{to make sense of the}} data. Specifically, data were organised, coded, categorised and integrated. The results revealed that the processes through which the participants accomplished their disciplinary writing tasks were complex and influenced in various ways by the contexts in which the writing took place. Task specifications for the assigned tasks, mostly done in groups, were often not clearly stated. This gave rise to the employment of different strategies by students to represent the tasks, guess readers‘ expectations and interact with group mates to achieve their purposes. They also relied heavily on the Web as information sources to complete their tasks, which gave rise to problems such as <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing.</b> The thesis closes by exploring the pedagogical implications, which include the idea that English for Academic Purposes courses should move towards more discipline-specific to better help students cope with their disciplinary writing demands.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{an extraordinary}} {{dialogue between the}} poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. My methodology uses Hughes's Birthday Letters as a limit case when approaching Plath's oeuvre, focussing on intertextual examples that solidify my arguments of a dialogue which began when the poets met and continued after Plath's death. Often a dialogue is signalled when a poem by each writer shares the same title. On other occasions, a shared biographical event is re-visioned separately by Plath and Hughes. Though I refer to biographical material when relevant, my {{focus is on the}} poetry. Working through a theory of dialoguic intertextuality — arrived at through Charles Balditin's dialogic theory, Julia Kristeva's theory of intertextuality and Gerard Genette's theories of metatextuality and hypertextuality — I define dialoguic intertextuality as a sequential and subjective interchange of ideas between texts and the authors of those texts. The text, part of the author's created personae, replaces or supplements conversations that refer to a known and shared system of knowledge — biographical events, for example — thus becoming further embedded in a subsequent text. This thesis questions several of Hughes's decisions as Plath's literary executor, uncovering instances of dubious <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> and even theft. I argue that Hughes, when compared with Plath, is far more strident in representing the couple's power struggles over textual ownership, and gender and national difference. Their work addresses creation and creativity (particularly creation of life versus creation of poetry), birth, death and rebirth. The poets' preoccupations with parental roles and the suppression and revelation of perceived truths in their poetry are also discussed. Hughes often inserted biographical elements in his poetry that are all but obscured in Plath's work. While Hughes's poetry insists on his version of truth about key events of their lives, Plath's poetry resists his readings. As a tangible outcome of their dialogue, these insistences and resistances form the foundation of this thesis...|$|E
40|$|In EFL {{contexts}} like China where {{research and}} application of findings {{in the field of}} English for Academic Purposes (EAP) is still in its infancy, graduate students are in urgent need of support in developing their academic literacy, especially in terms of academic writing and research article writing skills under the forces of globalization of education. This study sets out to develop a contextualized EAP genre-based approach to scaffold novice academic writers and examine its impact through assessment tasks and analysis of students’ uptake. The theoretical traditions of ESP research article (RA) genre analysis (e. g. Swales, 1990, 2004; Swale & Feak, 2004) and lexical bundle studies (e. g. Biber & Barbieri, 2007; Hyland, 2008) are drawn upon and two dimensions of building blocks of academic discourse are conceptualized: the top-down dimension (i. e., genre schematic structuring) and the bottom-up dimension(i. e. general and move-specific academic lexical phrases). Then, the Sydney School genre-based Teaching and Learning Cycle and corpus-informed explicit bundle instruction were incorporated into the ESP genre-based framework to generate a new theoretical and pedagogical model taking into consideration the needs of the local context. In order to evaluate this innovative course thoroughly in a natural and intact classroom, careful triangulations of data were achieved. A mixed-methods programme evaluation framework was developed with two major components, namely an intervention study and individual case studies. In terms of the average gains of the whole class, there was significant improvement in the receptive test of knowledge of genre and bundles after the course. In addition, the instruction significantly narrowed the achievement gap among the high, mid and low starting level students. Most importantly, the increase in the appropriate use of lexical phrases in rewriting suggests the effectiveness of the course in enabling active production. Regression analysis further indicated a strong relationship between the development of bundle knowledge and that of genre and genre-specific features. The rich descriptions of the two student cases delineate the different learning trajectories of learners of distinct starting levels. Although the low starting level learner showed much slower in-class uptake, her active engagement and integration of knowledge in the rewriting task by drawing on various resources has increased her understanding of the RA genre. The high starting level learner with satisfactory in-class uptake, however, suffered from lots of <b>textual</b> <b>borrowing</b> in writing due to her high expectation of academic content but lack of corresponding genre and linguistic competences. The fact that both learners exhibited a strong lack of basic linguistic resources to verbalize their sophisticated thinking in the rewriting task pointed to the importance of developing the linguistic aspects in the initial stage of genre knowledge development in EFL contexts, which has been neglected in previous studies focusing on ESL contexts. The careful investigation of the instructional context has led to detailed discussions of a few prominent issues in the pedagogical design, in particular, the importance of focusing on the role of “task” in curriculum and pedagogical design in future research of genre-based pedagogy. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
