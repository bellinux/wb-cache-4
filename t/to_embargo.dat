25|$|Once the war began, the Confederacy pinned its {{hopes on}} {{military}} intervention by Great Britain and France. As for King Cotton, Confederate leaders were {{unaware that the}} British were not dependent on Southern cotton and that Great Britain had stocks on hand to last over a year, having developed alternative sources of cotton, most notably in India and Egypt. Great Britain was unwilling to risk war with the U.S. to acquire more cotton {{at the risk of}} losing the large quantities of food imported from the North. Meanwhile, the Confederate national government had lost control of its own foreign policy when cotton planters, factors, and financiers spontaneously decided <b>to</b> <b>embargo</b> shipments of cotton to Europe in early 1861. It was a hugely expensive mistake, depriving the Confederacy {{of millions of dollars in}} cash it would desperately need.|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} events led to the attack on Pearl Harbor. War between Japan and the United States had been a {{possibility}} that each nation's military forces planned for in the 1920s, though real tension did not begin until the 1931 invasion of Manchuria by Japan. Over the next decade, Japan expanded slowly into China, leading to the Second Sino-Japanese war in 1937. In 1940 Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort <b>to</b> <b>embargo</b> all imports into China, including war supplies purchased from the U.S. This move prompted the United States <b>to</b> <b>embargo</b> all oil exports, leading the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) to estimate it had {{less than two years}} of bunker oil remaining and to support the existing plans to seize oil resources in the Dutch East Indies. Planning had been underway for some time on an attack on the [...] "Southern Resource Area" [...] to add it to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Japan envisioned in the Pacific.|$|E
2500|$|... "Direct blowing" [...] {{assumes the}} coal and the {{oxidizer}} being supplied towards {{each other from}} the {{opposite sides of the}} reactor channel. In this case the oxidizer passes through coke and (more likely) ashes to the reaction zone where it interacts with coal. The hot gas produced then passes fresh fuel and heats it while absorbing some products of thermal destruction of the fuel, such as tars and phenols. Thus, the gas requires significant refining before being used in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Products of the refinement are highly toxic and require special facilities for their utilization. As a result, the plant utilizing the described technologies has to be very large to be economically efficient. One of such plants called SASOL is situated in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). It was built due <b>to</b> <b>embargo</b> applied to the country preventing it from importing oil and natural gas. RSA is rich in Bituminous coal and Anthracite and was able to arrange the use of the well known high pressure [...] "Lurgi" [...] gasification process developed in Germany {{in the first half of}} 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|During the Rhodesian Bush War, {{almost the}} entire white male {{population}} between eighteen and fifty-eight was affected by various military commitments, and individuals spent up to five or {{six months of the}} year on combat duty away from their normal occupations in the civil service, commerce, industry, or agriculture. These long periods of service in the field led to an increased emigration of men of military age. In November 1963, state media cited the chief reasons for emigration as uncertainty about the future, economic decline due <b>to</b> <b>embargo</b> and war, and the heavy commitments of national service, which was described as [...] "the overriding factor causing people to leave". Of the male emigrants in 1976 about half fell into the 15 to 39 age bracket. Between 1960 and 1976 160,182 whites immigrated, while 157,724 departed. This dynamic turnover rate led to depressions in the property market, a slump in the construction industry, and a decline in retail sales. The number of white Rhodesians peaked in 1975 at 278,000 and rapidly declined as the bush war intensified. In 1976 around 14,000 whites left the country, marking the first year since Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 that more whites had left the country than arrived, with most leaving for South Africa. This became known as the 'chicken run', the earliest use of which was recorded the following year, [...] often by Rhodesians who remained to contemptuously describe those who had left. Other phrases such as 'taking the gap' or 'gapping it' were also used. As the outward flow increased, the phrase 'owl run' also came into use as leaving the country was deemed by many to be a wise choice. Disfavour with the biracial Zimbabwe Rhodesia administration in 1979 also contributed to a mass exodus.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{the policy}} of the Confederate populace was <b>to</b> <b>embargo</b> cotton {{shipments}} to Europe in hope of forcing them to recognize the Confederacy's independence to resume trade. The plan failed, and furthermore the Union's naval blockade of Southern ports drastically shrunk North Carolina's international commerce via shipping. Internally, the Confederacy had far fewer railroads than the Union. The breakdown of the Confederate transportation system took a heavy toll on North Carolina residents, as did the runaway inflation of the war years and food shortages in the cities. In the spring of 1863, there were food riots in Salisbury.|$|E
