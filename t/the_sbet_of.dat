It was observed that the addition of metal oxides to the TiO 2 increases catalytic activity in the combustion of all the contaminants present in the model effluent (CH 4, C 10 H 8 and CO). The catalysts were characterised using the following techniques: SBET, XRD, DTG/DTA and TPD-NH 3; and from these it was observed that the support presented only the anatase phase in all the catalysts, despite having been subjected to temperatures in excess of 1. 000 K during combustion. The highest acidity among all the solids tested, measured by TPD-NH 3, was obtained for the FeOx/TiO 2 catalysts, which were also those which showed the greatest catalytic activity. This high level of activity {{may be related to the}} formation of isolated metallic phases; i. e. hematite (Fe 2 O 3), which would be the active phase in the combustion of C 10 H 8 and CH 4.

The surface area and porous texture of the CHMW-MO-ACs were characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 77 [*]K. <b>The</b> <b>SBET</b> and pore volume were achieved in their highest value of 920 [*]m 2 /g and 0. 703 [*]cm 3 /g, respectively. Thermal gravity analysis and scanning electron microscope images showed that CHMW-MO-ACs have a high thermal resistance and pore development. The results indicated that CHMW-MO is a good precursor material for preparing activated carbon, and CHMW-MO-AC with well-developed mesopore volume can be prepared by H 3 PO 4 activation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Batch {{adsorption}} of recalcitrant melanoidin {{using the}} abundantly available {{coal fly ash}} was carried out. It had low specific surface area (<b>SBET)</b> <b>of</b> 1. 7287 m/g and pore volume of 0. 002245 cm/g while qualitative evaluation of the predominant phases in it was done by XRD analysis. Colour removal efficiency {{was found to be}} dependent on various factors studied. Maximum colour removal was achieved around pH 6, whereas increasing sorbent mass from 10 g/L to 200 g/L enhanced colour reduction from 25 % to 86 % at 298 K. Spontaneity of the process was suggested by negative Gibbs free energy while positive values for enthalpy change showed endothermic nature of the process. Non-linear optimization of error functions resulted in Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson isotherms describing sorption equilibrium data best. The coal fly ash had maximum sorption capacity of 53 mg/g and could thus be used as a low cost adsorbent in melanoidin removal. Keywords—Adsorption, Isotherms, Melanoidin, South African coal fly ash.

40|$|Heteroatom (nitrogen and sulfur) -codoped porous carbons (N-S-PCs) {{with high}} surface areas and hierarchically porous {{structures}} were successfully synthesized via direct pyrolysis of {{a mixture of}} glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and thiourea. The resulting N-S-PCs exhibit excellent adsorption abilities and are highly efficient for potassium persulfate activation when employed as catalysts for the oxidative degradation of sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) solutions. The adsorption capacities of N-S-PC- 2 (which contains 4. 51 atom % nitrogen and 0. 22 atom % sulfur and exhibits <b>SBET</b> <b>of</b> 1608 m 2 g− 1) are 73, 7, and 3 times {{higher than those of}} graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide, and commercial singlewalled carbon nanotube, respectively. For oxidation, the reaction rate constant of N-S-PC- 2 is 0. 28 min− 1. This approach not only contributes to the large-scale production and application of high-quality catalysts in water remediation but also provides an innovative strategy for the production of heteroatom-doped PCs for energy applications...|$|R

X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and N 2 adsorption–desorption techniques were used to characterize the structure, morphology and <b>SBET</b> <b>of</b> CoxMn 1 −xO 2 nanostructures. Nucleation–dissolution–recrystallization and reduction migration species mechanism was suggested {{for the growth of}} the nanowires. The effect of molar ratios of reactants and morphology of products were investigated in terms of MB degradation. The catalyst characterization was performed by mass spectra, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms.

40|$|To {{assess the}} geochemical {{reactivity}} and oral bioaccessibility of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in urban soils from the Porto area, four extractions were performed including Aqua Regia (AR; pseudototal), 0. 43 M HNO(3) (reactive), 0. 01 M CaCl(2) (available), and 0. 4 M glycine at pH = 1. 5, SBET method (oral bioaccessible pool). Oral bioaccessibility in urban soils {{was higher than}} in samples from rural, industrial and mining areas which is most likely related to sources of metals and parent materials of corresponding soils. The availability and reactivity were described well by non-linear Freundlich-type equations when considering differences in soil properties. The resulting empirical models are able to predict availability and reactivity {{and can be used}} to improve the accuracy of risk assessment. Furthermore, a close 1 : 1 relationship exists between results from the 0. 43 M HNO(3) method and <b>the</b> <b>SBET</b> method which substantially facilitates risk assessment procedures and reduces analytical costs...|$|R
40|$|High-surface-area {{mesoporous}} MgO-templated nanocarbons {{made with}} reinforcing fibres from scrap tyres and a bituminous waste as carbon precursors were employed for the simultaneous adsorption of Cd 2 + and reactive Cibacron Brilliant Yellow 3 G-P dye. A commercial activated carbon (AC) Darco KB-WJ {{was also used}} for comparison purposes. The effect of the pH of the solution was studied to establish whether acidic pH favours the adsorption of reactive dye and alkaline pH improves the removal of Cd 2 +. Because the surface chemistry of the three adsorbents was similar, the focus {{in this study was}} directed towards their textural characteristics. It was found that <b>the</b> larger <b>the</b> <b>SBET,</b> <b>the</b> greater the amount of dye removal. The adsorption isotherms corresponding to the commercial AC fitted to the Langmuir–Freundlich model, whereas {{in the case of the}} nanocarbons the Langmuir model provided the best fit. The results obtained show that Cd 2 + is successfully adsorbed in the presence of the dye due to the ion exchange between the Na+ from the dye and the Cd 2 +. It was also found that a high total and mesopore volume, and a high SBET played a determinant role in the simultaneous adsorption. The research leading to these results has received funding from the Spanish MICINN CTM 2009 - 10227. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Zirconia samples, {{prepared}} by precipitation from {{a solution of}} zirconyl chloride at a constant pH of 10, were calcined in flowing air at temperatures up to 850 °C in order to study the development and stability of the porous texture {{in conjunction with the}} development {{of the structure of the}} resulting materials as a function of calcination temperature. The gel precipitation technique employed yields a high surface area zirconia (<b>SBET</b> <b>of</b> 111 m 2 g− 1 after calcination at 450 °C) with a well-developed mesoporous texture. The porous texture is, however, unstable under the experimental conditions employed, the initial high specific surface area being lost quite rapidly with increase in calcination temperature; calcination at 850 °C brings about a reduction of the (BET) specific surface area by approximately 97 %. Two process were identified as being responsible for the changes in pore structure and surface area: (i) crystallite growth and an accompanying phase transformation; and (ii) inter-crystallite sintering (neck-formation and growth); both these phenomena probably occur via a mechanism of surface diffusion. The inter-crystallite sintering process becomes more pronounced at higher calcination temperatures...|$|R

The optimal conditions for the preparation were searched and the tests of adsorption of uranium and thorium ions were affected. The best product was obtained by used of the ratio of activated agent/precursor equal 3 and activation of the mixture in air at 250 0;C during two hours after prepocessing at 120 0;C in air. Under these conditions the maximal adsorption capacity of methylene blue and specific area (<b>SBET)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new adsorbent were 526 mg/g and 630 m 2 /g, respectively.

The crystal phases of the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (PANalytical X'Pert Pro, Holland, The Netherlands), in a 2 θ range from 10 ° to 80 °, using Cu Kα radiation. The microstructure of the product was further analyzed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Tecnai G 2 [*]F- 30, FEI Company, Holland, The Netherlands). The diffuse reflectance was performed on a UV-visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometer (TU- 1901, Puxi Analytic Instrument Ltd., Beijing, China) using an integrating sphere with an incident angle of 8 °. The optical absorption measurement was calculated by transforming the diffuse reflectance data by the program in apparatus. All the samples for diffuse reflectance measurements are powder samples.
