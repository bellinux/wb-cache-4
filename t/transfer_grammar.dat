50|$|Zellig Sabbettai Harris (October 23, 1909 - May 22, 1992) {{was a very}} {{influential}} American linguist, mathematical syntactician, and methodologist of science. Originally a Semiticist, he {{is best known for}} his work in structural linguistics and discourse analysis and for the discovery of transformational structure in language. These developments from the first 10 years of his career were published within the first 25. His contributions in the subsequent 35 years of his career include <b>transfer</b> <b>grammar,</b> string analysis (adjunction grammar), elementary sentence-differences (and decomposition lattices), algebraic structures in language, operator grammar, sublanguage grammar, a theory of linguistic information, and a principled account of the nature and origin of language.|$|E
50|$|Harris's central methodological concern {{beginning}} with his earliest publications was to avoid obscuring the essential characteristics of language behind unacknowledged presuppositions, such as {{are inherent in}} conventions of notation or presentation. In this vein, among his most illuminating works in the 1940s are restatements of analyses by other linguists, done {{with the intention of}} displaying properties of the linguistic phenomena which are invariant across diverse representations This anticipates later work on linguistic universals. Also very relevant here is his work on <b>transfer</b> <b>grammar,</b> which presents the intersection of the grammars of two languages, clarifying precisely those features in which they differ and the relation between corresponding such features. This has obvious benefits for machine translation.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{transfer}} dictionary model that explains how words and pair of words {{can be translated}} from one language to another in a concise way. The dictionary is being used in a English-Portuguese translation machine project, however, the transfer dictionary model is generic enough {{to be applied to}} other projects as well. 1 Introduction The machine translation based on the transfer approach operates in three steps: 1) analysis : maps sentence As into a syntax tree Ast. 2) transfer : maps the structure Ast into another syntax tree Bst, through the use of some <b>transfer</b> <b>grammar.</b> 3) generation : maps the syntax tree Bst into the sentence Bs. The <b>transfer</b> <b>grammar</b> is a set of rules heavily dependent on the kind of structure resulted from the analysis. For instance [1]: [gov : know; subj : 1; obj : 2 [NP]] => [gov : conhecer; subj : 1; obj : 2]. This rule species that if the verb " has a subject and an object of type NP (noun phrase) then it must be translated as [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This paper, titled "Knowledge-based machine translation, the CMU approach", is in two {{distinct}} halves, the first (and longer) {{of which is}} essentially an overview of existing approaches to MT (interactive, pre-editing and post-editing). Considering {{the extent to which}} it covers somewhat basic material, it is rather too long, though the accompanying pictures might usefully be transferred to overhead projector slides for use in introductory lectures that many of us have to give from time to time. Nevertheless, in the midst of this is a section on "the knowledge-based approach" (KBMT) (p. 75) which invites a number of comments. In this approach, translation is achieved via a "language-free meaning representation"; it is a pity that the authors do not address some of the more obvious drawbacks to the "intefiingua" approach, to counterbalance some of the perhaps controversial remarks made about the transfer approach. For example, citing two papers from Coling 1976, they state that A <b>transfer</b> <b>grammar...</b> is a large, amorphous, ad hoc set of rules, referencing specific lexical entries, that map phrases in one language into corresponding phrases in another language. Thus, a complete <b>transfer</b> <b>grammar</b> needs to be created for each pair of languages [...] over 5, 000 gargantuan grammars to translate between the 72 most active languages. (p. 75) To be sure, a <b>transfer</b> <b>grammar</b> "may" be large, amorphous, and ad hoc, but must it necessarily be so? That the grammar should reference "specific lexical entries" cannot be held against it (cf. LFG, which is later cited approvingly). And one wonders where the figure of 72 for the "most active languages" comes from. The authors may also be being a little naive (or controver- sial) in claiming generation to be "the simpler, less computationally dema [...] ...|$|E

In connection with the problem of structural transfer, a study was made of the behavior of some English verbs and their German equivalents in a fixed number of constructions.

After completion of the prototype for research purposes, a product version for machine translation Russian-German has been simultaneously developed at no additional cost. The prototype, programmed in LISP, has been ported into C++ for PC support. The completed lexica Russian and Russian-German each contain more than 100, 000 entries. The main themes included the possible treatments of multi-word terms in analysis, transfer and generation, as well as their incorporation into lexica and the creation of manageable, user-friendly mechanisms for the entering of new terms by the user. The system will first appear on the market as a single user work station, with plans for a Workgroup version to follow. Work on the demonstrator for machine translation German-Russian has begun.

40|$|Developing {{commercially viable}} machine {{translation}} software from one language to another {{is a very}} expensive endeavor, {{both in terms of}} the software development effort required {{and in terms of the}} linguistic resources which need to be assembled. To properly implement machine translation, it is generally accepted that one needs a bi-lingual dictionary of at least 250, 000 words as the basic foundation, as well as general morphological software for both source language and target language which will automatically parse sentences into their constituent adjective-noun-verb-object structure. Finally one needs a <b>transfer</b> <b>grammar</b> which maps the grammatical structure from the first language into the translated language. (For more information about the details of machine translation, the reader is referred to the excellent book Translation Engines, by Arthur Trujillo, published by Springer, 1999). From the point of view of the Tamil language, neither the fundamental linguistic resources are available in machine-readable form nor are the commercial prospects sufficiently large to warrant the considerable software development involved.

40|$|Keywords: English-Hungarian machine translation, robust {{bottom-up}} parsing, incorporated lexicon, immediate <b>transfer,</b> <b>grammar</b> development workbench The {{compromise between}} a natural language grammar’s expressive {{power and the}} performance of the resulting system is a crucial issue for the developer of any MT application. By opting for a high-performance approach, such as finite state technology, one inevitably has to sacrifice descriptive power, whilst theoretically motivated formalisms such as HPSG or LFG rarely have implementations that are efficient enough for commercial use. The MetaMorpho formalism, and Moose, our parser implementation, is an attempt at a reasonable compromise. The MetaMorpho formalism. The grammar operates with rule pairs that consist of one rewrite rule used during bottom-up parsing and one or more corresponding transfer rules that are applied during top-down generation. The set of parse rules effectively forms a phrase-structure (context free) grammar where each symbol has a list of typed features. Features can either have a set of symbolic values, i. e., {SG, PL}, or contain a string, such as the lexical form of a structure’s head; however, the formalism does not allow for embedded feature structures or functions. The righthand side of the parse rule can state conditions for any of its symbols ’ values. Each rule can stat...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{rule-based}} method to improve efficiency in bottom-up chart generation with GG, an open-source reversible large-scale HPSG for German. Following an indepth analysis of efficiency {{problems in the}} baseline system, we show that costly combinatorial explosion in brute force bottom-up search can be largely avoided using information already contained implicitly in the input semantics: either (i) information is globally present, but {{needs to be made}} locally available to a particular elementary predication, or (ii) semantic configurations in the input have a clear translation to syntactic constraints, provided some knowledge of the grammar. We propose several performance features targeting inflection and extraction, as well as more language-specific features, relating to verb movement and discontinuous complex predicates. In a series of experiments on three different test suites we show that 7 out of 8 features are consistently effective in reducing generation times, both in isolation and in combination. Combining all efficiency measures, we observe a speedup factor of 4. 5 for our less complex test suites, increasing to almost 28 for the more complex one: the fact that performance benefits drastically increase with input length suggests that our method scales up well {{in the sense that it}} effectively heads off the problem with exponential growth. The present approach of using a generator-internal <b>transfer</b> <b>grammar</b> has the added advantage that it locates performance-related issues close to the grammar, thereby keeping the external semantic interface as general as possible...|$|E
