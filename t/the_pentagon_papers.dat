50|$|The episode first leaked {{into public}} print {{in a pair}} of {{articles}} by Robert H. Estabrook in The Washington Post in February 1967 and was then the subject of an intense investigation by Los Angeles Times reporters David Kraslow and Stuart H.

25|$|New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), was a {{landmark}} {{decision by the}} United States Supreme Court on the First Amendment.

5|$|The ACLU {{supported}} The New York Times in its 1971 {{suit against}} the government, requesting permission to publish <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>papers.</b> The court upheld the Times and ACLU in the New York Times Co. v.

5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and for putting <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> into the public record in 1971 at some risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then {{played a crucial role}} in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on June 13, 1971, The New York Times began {{printing}} {{large portions}} of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers.</b> The papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the Vietnam War, of which former Defense Department analyst Daniel Ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public. Ellsberg had {{for a year and}} a half approached members of Congress – such as William Fulbright, George McGovern, Charles Mathias, and Pete McCloskey – about publishing the documents, on the grounds that the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution, but all had refused. Instead, Ellsberg gave the documents to the Times.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Sheinbaum {{was asked}} to help {{organize}} <b>the</b> Daniel Ellsberg <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> defense team. He helped assemble the team of attorneys and became the main fundraiser and spokesperson, raising nearly one million dollars from over 25,000 contributors.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Gelb was Executive Assistant for Senator Jacob Javits from 1966 to 1967.

5|$|In 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers,</b> {{a secret}} United States Department of Defense {{history of the}} United States' {{political}} and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. The New York Times began publishing excerpts {{as a series of}} articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions taken by U.S. Marines well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{sought a}} restraining order that barred the Times from publishing any further articles based upon <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers.</b> In addition to The New York Times Company, the Justice Department named the following defendants: Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, president and publisher; Harding Bancroft and Ivan Veit, executive vice presidents; Francis Cox, James Goodale, Sydney Gruson, Walter Mattson, John McCabe, John Mortimer and James Reston, vice presidents; John B. Oakes, editorial page editor; A.M.

25|$|Her tenure is {{credited}} with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting after it began to live down its reputation as a house organ for the Kennedy and Johnson administration, working to ensure that The New York Times did not surpass its Washington reporting of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> and Watergate scandal. During this time, Katharine Graham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40 million in 1984. Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the Post newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan {{accounted for more than}} 60% of the entire company revenue stream.|$|E

5000|$|Daniel Ellsberg, the {{whistleblower}} and leaker of <b>the</b> top-secret <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> in 1971, {{stated in}} an interview with CNN that he thought Snowden had done an [...] "incalculable" [...] service to his country and that his leaks might prevent the United States from becoming a surveillance state. He said Snowden had acted with the same sort of courage and patriotism as a soldier in battle. In an op-ed the following morning, Ellsberg added that [...] "there has not been in American history a more important leak than Edward Snowden's release of NSA material ... including <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> Papers." [...] Ray McGovern, a retired CIA officer turned political activist, agreed with Ellsberg and added, [...] "This time today I'm feeling much more hopeful for our democracy than I was feeling this time yesterday." ...|$|R
25|$|The U.S. {{military}} (and MACSOG personnel) kept tight security over {{knowledge of}} the unit's operations and existence until the early 1980s. Although {{there had been some}} small leaks by the media during the conflict, they were usually erroneous and easily dismissed. More specific was the release of documents dealing with {{the early days of the}} operation in <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> and by the testimony of ex-SOG personnel during congressional investigations into the bombing campaigns in Laos and Cambodia in the early 1970s. Historians interested in the unit's activities had to wait until the early 1990s, when MACSOG's Annexes to the annual MACV Command Histories and a Pentagon documentation study of the organization were declassified for the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs' hearings on the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue.|$|E
25|$|Members of both Houses {{have certain}} privileges, {{based on those}} enjoyed {{by the members of}} the British Parliament. Members attending, going to or {{returning}} from either House are privileged from arrest, except for treason, felony or breach of the peace. One may not sue a Senator or Representative for slander occurring during Congressional debate, nor may speech by a member of Congress during a Congressional session be the basis for criminal prosecution. The latter was affirmed when Mike Gravel published over 4,000 pages of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> in the Congressional Record, which might have otherwise been a criminal offense. This clause has also been interpreted in Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972) to provide protection to aides and staff of sitting members of Congress, so long as their activities relate to legislative matters.|$|E
25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers.</b> One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E
5000|$|In later {{conflicts}} {{the degree}} to which war reporting was subject to censorship varied, and in some cases it has been alleged that the censorship was as much political as military in purpose. This was particularly true during the Vietnam War. The executive branch of the federal government attempted to prevent The New York Times from publishing <b>the</b> top-secret <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> during <b>the</b> Vietnam War, warning that doing so would be considered an act of treason under the Espionage Act of 1917. The newspaper prevailed in the famous New York Times Co. v. United States case.|$|R
5000|$|Adams {{appeared}} as a defense witness at the 1973 trial of Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo. The case involved {{their role in the}} unauthorized publication of <b>the</b> top secret <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers,</b> a 47-volume, government-produced, secret history of the Vietnam War. The prosecution alleged felony violations of the Espionage Act of 1917, and of signed secrecy agreements. The charges involved disclosure of government secrets, yet not to foreign powers, but to American newspapers.|$|R
5000|$|As of June 7, 2011, Manning had not {{yet been}} {{formally}} charged. Instead Manning was held under a [...] "Prevention of Injury" [...] assignment until April 2011, which Daniel Ellsberg, source of <b>the</b> 1971 released <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers,</b> and David House, founder of the Private Manning Support Network, called [...] "no-touch torture". House said this caused Manning to [...] "degrade over time—physically, mentally, and emotionally." [...] Dennis Kucinich and Daniel Ellsberg compared the treatment to what happened inside the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq (e.g., nudity, isolation, harassment, sleep-deprivation).|$|R
500|$|Also, when Nixon {{had sought}} {{information}} to discredit Daniel Ellsberg, who had leaked <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers,</b> his operatives had burglarized {{the office of}} Ellsberg’s psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis Fielding.

500|$|In {{seeking a}} {{temporary}} restraining order, government lawyers argued that The Progressive {{was about to}} break the law, causing irreparable harm. The data in the article was born classified, so {{it did not matter}} that it was an original work of the author. They noted that prior restraint had been upheld by the courts before in matters of national security, and argued that <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> decision did not apply as the Atomic Energy Act specifically allowed for injunctive relief. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> were historical, whereas the hydrogen bomb was a current military weapon. Finally, they pointed out that the government had obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty not to assist non-nuclear states in acquiring nuclear weapons. In granting the temporary restraining order on March 9, Warren said that he would have [...] "to think long and hard before I gave the hydrogen bomb to Idi Amin." ...|$|E
500|$|Justice Black {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a leading defender of First Amendment rights such as {{the freedom of speech}} and of the press. He refused to accept the doctrine that the freedom of speech could be curtailed on national security grounds. Thus, in New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), he voted to allow newspapers to publish <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> despite the Nixon Administration's contention that publication would have security implications. In his concurring opinion, Black stated, ...|$|E
25|$|Following {{his time}} in the White House, Holbrooke served as a special {{assistant}} to Under Secretaries of State (then the number-two position in the State Department) Nicholas Katzenbach and Elliot Richardson. In 1968, Holbrooke was asked {{to be part of the}} American delegation to the 1968 Paris peace talks, which was led by former New York Governor Averell Harriman and Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance. He also drafted a volume of <b>the</b> now famous <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers,</b> a top-secret report on the government’s decision-making in Vietnam. Following these assignments, Holbrooke spent a year as a mid-career fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University.|$|R
2500|$|In 1971 the NSA and CIA {{were engaged}} in {{domestic}} spying. [...] The Department of Defense was eavesdropping on Henry Kissinger. [...] The White House, and Camp David were wired for sound. [...] Nixon and Kissenger were eavesdropping on their aides and on reporters. Nixon's [...] "plumbers" [...] included former CIA officials Howard Hunt and Jim McCord. [...] On July 7, 1971, John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy chief, told DCI Cushman, Nixon's hatchet-man in the CIA, to let Cushman [...] "know that [...] was in fact doing some things for the President... you should consider he has pretty much carte blanche" [...] Importantly, this included a camera, disguises, a voice altering device, and ID papers furnished by the CIA, {{as well as the}} CIA's participation developing film from the burglary Hunt staged on <b>the</b> office of <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Papers</b> leaker Daniel Ellsberg's psychologist.|$|R
5000|$|On January 4, 2007, US District Court Judge Jack B. Weinstein {{issued a}} {{temporary}} restraining order forbidding a number of activists and their organizations in the psychiatric survivors movement, including MindFreedom International and the Alliance for Human Research Protection from disseminating ostensibly leaked documents purporting to show that Eli Lilly and Company knowingly concealed information on potentially lethal side-effects of Zyprexa for years.http://www.mindfreedom.org/mfi-blog/topics/Zyprexakills The [...] "Zyprexa documents" [...] had been sealed by an earlier court order in a mass tort case; they were widely disseminated after Alaska attorney James Gottstein issued a subpoena for them in an unrelated case.
