40|$|We {{present a}} rare case of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, a rare benign glioneuronal tumor {{of the central}} nervous system. It {{generally}} occurs in the supratentorial region and the <b>temporal</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> in children and young adults. The most common presentation is epilepsy. The supratentorial tumor without any signs of mass effect or peritumoral edema is the conventionally accepted diagnostic criteria. In this case of a 19 -year-old male with intractable epilepsy, atypical features such as {{the location of the}} tumor and the presence of mass effect and peritumoral edema made imaging diagnosis difficult. Diagnosis was confirmed through histopathology. Due to its recent discovery and relatively rare occurrence it is important for radiologists to recognize this disease entity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{structural}} bases of natural defense mechanisms {{of the human brain}} against chronic ischemia. Materials and methods. To accomplish this, histological, immunohistochemical (NSE, calbindin, NPY, p 38) and morphometric examinations of intraoperative biopsy specimens were performed to determine the reorganization of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the ischemic penumbra of the <b>temporal</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> (CC). Morphometric analysis was made using the specially developed algorithms to verify neurons and their elements in the ImageJ 1. 46 program. Results. The reduction in the total numerical density of neurons and synapses in chronic ischemia was ascertained to be accompanied by the compensatorily enhanced expression of NSE, calbindin, p 38, and NPY in the remaining CC neurons. There were signs of hypertrophy of inhibitory CC interneurons and growth of their processes. In consequence, the impact of inhibitory CC interneurons on excitatory neurons was likely to enhance. Conclusion. In chronic ischemia, the human brain is anticipated to respond to damage to some cells via compensatory excitatory and inhibitory neuronal reorganization directed towards its natural defense against excitatory damage and towards better conditions for compensatory recovery of the structure and function of CC.   </div...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We have {{investigated}} the extent and pattern of immunostaining for ubiquitin protein (UBQ) in 60 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclu-sions (FTLD-U), 37 of whom were ascertained in Manchester UK and 23 in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, UK. There were three distinct histological patterns accord-ing to the form and distribution of the UBQ pathology. Histological type 1 was present in 19 patients (32 %) and characterised {{by the presence of}} a moderate number, or numerous, UBQ immunoreactive neurites and intran-euronal cytoplasmic inclusions within layer II of the frontal and <b>temporal</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex,</b> and cytoplasmic inclusions within granule cells of the dentate gyrus; neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) of a “cat’s eye” or “lentiform ” appearance were present in 17 of these patients. In histological type 2 (16 patients, 27 %), UBQ neurites were predominantly, or exclusively, present with few intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions within layer II of the cerebral cortex, while in histologi-cal type 3 (25 patients, 42 %), UBQ intraneuronal cyto-plasmic inclusions either within the cortical layer II or in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, with few or no UBQ neurites, were seen. In neither of these latter two groups were NII present. The inXuence of histological type on clinical phenotype was highly signiWcant with type 1 histology being associated clinically with cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or progressive non-Xuent aphasia (PNFA), type 2 histology with semantic dementia (SD), and type 3 histology with FTD, or FTD and motor neurone disease (MND) ...|$|E

40|$|GM 1 {{gangliosidosis}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} lysosomal storage disorder {{caused by an}} enzyme deficiency of β-galactosidase (β-gal) leading to toxic accumulation of GM 1 ganglioside in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and progressive neurodegeneration. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated gene delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the CNS has shown great potential for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases with neurological involvement. In this work we use MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to assess the spatial distribution of gangliosides, ganglioside metabolites and related lipids in a GM 1 gangliosidosis mouse brain model following adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy. Deficiency of β-galactosidase enzyme in a β-gal-/- mouse brain showed an overall 8 -fold increase in GM 1 relative to the control by MSI analysis, with specific spatial localization based on its ceramide content. Bilateral thalamic injection of AAVrh 10 -bgal in β-gal-/- mice significantly reduced GM 1 levels relative to untreated β-gal-/- mice. The therapeutic efficacy of this approach is through distribution of functional enzyme via axonal transport through the extensive connectivity of the thalamus with most of the brain, with some exceptions such as the temporal cortex. Accordingly MSI showed AAV gene therapy reduced GM 1 nearly to the control levels in all regions of the brain except in the <b>temporal</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex.</b> This correlated with low levels of bgal in this brain region as assessed by histochemical staining of tissue sections. MSI also detected asialo-GM 1 and other ganglioside metabolites elevated in untreated β-gal-/- mice, which were also reduced after AAV therapy. Interestingly sulfated galactocereberosides reduced in the myelin sheath in untreated β-gal-/- mice were restored to normal levels after AAV therapy. Overall, this study demonstrates that MALDI MSI can be used to map specific target analytes and their metabolites while also offering the ability to detect unanticipated effects caused by gene therapy...|$|E

Large-scale whole genome DNA methylation profiling of the normal human brain offers tremendous potential in understanding the role of DNA methylation in brain development and function.

40|$|Among {{the major}} {{evolutionary}} advances in humans is the striking {{development of the}} human <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex,</b> especially the frontal and <b>temporal</b> regions. The <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> is a mantle of between 2. 6 to 16 billion neurons with each neuron receiving 10, 000 to 100, 000 synapses in their dendritic trees (e. g., Pakkenberg, 1966).

The temporal regions, in turn, play essential roles in social perception and communication. The neocortex, in particular, is a recent development in evolutionary time, and the means for guiding behavior through the environment, albeit in a more rigid and stereotyped fashion, emerged prior to neocortical expansion.

Case presentation At 6 [*]months after the onset, diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) of brain MRI revealed an increased signal intensity in the bilateral frontal, <b>temporal,</b> and parietal <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> with left dominancy except for the occipital lobe. However, her follow-up MRI at four years showed the high-signal regions spreading to the occipital <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> in DWI and FLAIR images, and bilateral frontal cerebral white matter in FLAIR images.

However, whether ANP 32 A {{has an effect}} on the mammalian developing brain is still in question. In this study, it was shown that brain was the organ that expressed the most abundant ANP 32 A by human multiple tissue expression (MTE) array. The distribution of ANP 32 A in the different adult brain areas was diverse dramatically, with high expression in cerebellum, <b>temporal</b> lobe, and <b>cerebral</b> <b>cortex</b> and with low expression in pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. The expression of ANP 32 A was higher in the adult brain than in the fetal brain of not only humans but also mice in a time-dependent manner.
