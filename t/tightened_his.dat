5|$|These words {{indicate}} that Tong Yabghu {{was eager to}} retain control of the westernmost portion of the Silk Route, as he <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> grip of its other segments all the way east to China. In April 630 Böri Shad determined to expand his control of Transcaucasia and sent his general Chorpan Tarkhan with as little as 30,000 cavalry to invade Armenia. Using a characteristic ploy of nomadic warriors, Chorpan Tarkhan ambushed and annihilated a Persian force of 10,000 dispatched by Shahrbaraz to counter the invasion. Turks knew the Sassanid response would be harsh, they plundered cities and withdrew their forces back to the steppes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, Sargsyan <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> {{grip on the}} Armed Forces, {{establishing}} himself as a virtual strongman. After strongly supporting Ter-Petrosyan to retain power, he forced the president out of office in 1998 due to his support for concessions in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement negotiations, and helped Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan to be elected president. With their relations deteriorated, Sargsyan merged the influential war veterans group Yerkrapah into the Republican Party and joined forces with Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan. In the May 1999 elections, their reform-minded alliance secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. Sargsyan became prime minister, emerging as the de facto decision-maker in Armenia with effective {{control of the military}} and the legislature.|$|E
25|$|In October 1995, Bédié {{overwhelmingly}} won re-election {{against a}} fragmented and disorganised opposition. He <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> hold over political life, jailing several hundred opposition supporters. In contrast, the economic outlook improved, at least superficially, with decreasing inflation and {{an attempt to}} remove foreign debt.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{committed}} the crowning act of folly as <b>tightening</b> <b>his</b> grasp on his bridle {{he turned to}} the lads behind him.|$|R

25|$|With the {{archbishop}} absent, Sverre <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> {{grip on the}} bishops, and on Nikolas Arnesson in particular. Nikolas was the half-brother of Inge Krokrygg and had become bishop of Oslo in 1190 against Sverre's wish. After {{the destruction of the}} Øyskjeggs at Florvåg, Sverre arranged a meeting with Nikolas where he claimed to have proof that the bishop had colluded with the Øyskjeggs. The king accused Nikolas of treason and threatened severe punishment. Nikolas submitted, and on 29 June, together with the other bishops, he crowned Sverre as King of Norway. Sverre's domestic priest was elected bishop of Bergen.|$|E
25|$|From early on, Straucher campaigned {{intensely}} for the Austrian {{authorities to}} recognize a separate Jewish community in the entire Duchy of Bukovina, {{as part of a}} process to grant all ethnic groups proportional representation. Their request was supported by Yulian Romanchuk, a representative of the Ruthenians (Ukrainians) in Galicia (the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria), whose participation in the move followed a tradition of collaboration between Ukrainian and Jewish activists. Straucher also <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> contacts with the region's large ethnic Romanian community: as early as 1883, he spoke at a cultural meeting of Societatea Academică Junimea, a student club, offering his praise to the Romanian Orthodox clergy.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the attack, Vladmir Markin, {{spokesman}} for the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor (SKP) of the Russian Federation, stated that the Central Investigation Department of the North Caucasus and the Southern Federal District would investigate the attacks. On 2 September, Ramzan Kadyrov announced a reward of more than $300,000 for information about each of the insurgency leaders involved in the operation, which Chechen commentators interpreted {{as an indicator of}} the government's weakness. Kadyrov also <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> control over information coming from Tsentoroy by not allowing any of the village's 5,000 inhabitants to leave {{in the days after the}} attack; the citizenry were also allegedly under the threat of death not to talk about the siege or the damage inflicted by the rebels.|$|E

25|$|Langer impresses {{me because}} he has proven himself as a {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the two singles matches, both from the Red Group, saw Nadal's {{replacement}} Gilles Simon take on top seed Roger Federer, to record his second straight win against the Swiss in two career meetings. Federer took the first opportunity, breaking the Frenchman to lead 3–2 and win the set 6–4. The Swiss continued his domination {{early in the second}} set, breaking to 2–1, before Simon broke back to even the score. Both players held their serve until the last game, when the Frenchman, taking advantage of Federer's repeated forehand errors, broke to a 6–4 victory. Federer's errors kept on going, as Simon <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> game, breaking the Swiss one more time, and clinching a 4–6, 6–4, 6–3 comeback victory, repeat of his first Toronto Masters win over Federer. The loss was Federer's fourth in his seven-year, thirty-matches Masters Cup history, and marked the second time he started the tournament with a round robin loss, after his defeat by Fernando González in 2007. The second match was set to be the first complete encounter of Andy Murray and Andy Roddick since a Memphis semifinal (won by Roddick), after a Miami Masters quarterfinal (Roddick retired) and a Queen's Club quarterfinal (Murray withdrew). In Shanghai, Murray converted his first break opportunities to win the first set 6–4. Roddick struck back in the second set, dominating the game to a 5–0 lead, closing on the set 6–1. The final set followed exactly the same pattern, with Murray taking the lead this time, to claim victory on the score of 6–4, 1–6, 6–1.|$|E
500|$|Philip was {{now able}} to settle Thessaly at his leisure. He {{probably}} first finished the siege of Pagasae, to deny the Athenians a landing place in Thessaly. Pagasae {{was not part of}} the Thessalian Confederation, and Philip therefore took it as his own, and garrisoned it. The fall of Pagasae now left Pherae totally isolated. Lycophron, rather than suffer the fate of Onomarchos, struck a bargain with Philip, and in return for handing Pherae over to Philip, he was allowed, along with 2000 of his mercenaries, to go to Phocis. Philip now worked to unite the traditionally fractious cities of Thessaly under his rule. He took direct control of several cities in western Thessaly, exiling the dissidents, and in one case refounding the city with a Macedonian population; he <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> control of Perrhaebia, and invaded Magnesia, also taking it as his own and garrisoning it; [...] "when finished, he was lord of Thessaly." ...|$|E

500|$|John {{treated the}} interdict as [...] "the {{equivalent}} of a papal declaration of war". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to {{drive a wedge between}} those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy, this did not appear to greatly worry the king. Two of John's close allies, Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued. John simply <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> existing measures and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys: one 1213 estimate, for example, suggested the church had lost an estimated 100,000 marks (equivalent to £66,666 at the time) to John. Official figures suggest that around 14% of annual income from the English church was being appropriated by John each year.|$|E

2500|$|As Stalin <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> {{grip on the}} Soviet intelligentsia and {{decreed that}} all writers and artists must conform to socialist realism, Babel {{increasingly}} withdrew from public life. During the campaign against [...] "Formalism", Babel was publicly denounced for low productivity. At the time, many other Soviet writers were terrified and frantically rewrote their past work to conform to Stalin's wishes. However, Babel was unimpressed and confided in his protégé, the writer Ilya Ehrenburg, [...] "In six months time, they'll leave the formalists in peace and start some other campaign." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, {{this must}} be looked to," [...] cried Jack, seizing <b>his</b> rifle and <b>tightening</b> <b>his</b> belt; [...] "we must follow, for if they escape our hands they will {{certainly}} be retaken by their former captors." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hallo, Davy! {{where are}} you bound for?" [...] inquired the captain, on observing that Butts was {{wrapping}} himself carefully in <b>his</b> fur-coat, <b>tightening</b> <b>his</b> belt, and putting on his mittens as if bent on a long journey.|$|R
2500|$|... "Jones had a {{handsome}} and strange voice. His singing was always partly about {{the appeal of}} the tones he produced, regardless of the meaning of the words. In this sense, Jones had something in common with singers of formal music and opera, though his means of vocal production were radically different from theirs. He sang {{from the back of his}} throat, rather than from deep in his diaphragm. He <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> larynx to squeeze sound out. He clenched his jaw, instead of wriggling it free. He forced wind through his teeth, and the notes sounded weirdly beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stalin's cult of personality, {{which began}} to {{manifest}} itself {{already in the}} late 1930s, was marginalized during World War II; to mobilize the population against the enemy, Soviet films focused on historical heroes who defended Russia or on the feats of the people themselves. The premier's character appeared in only two pictures during the war. However, as victory seemed secure, Stalin <b>tightened</b> <b>his</b> control over {{every aspect of the}} Soviet society, including cinema. After 1945, his cult returned to the screen with greater intensity than ever before, and he was credited as the sole architect of Germany's defeat. Denise J. Youngblood wrote that shortly afterwards, there remained only three kinds of war heroes: [...] "the dead, the maimed and Stalin." ...|$|E

50|$|The second-half of {{the film}} is almost pure action, {{fast-moving}} and lethal, but in the absence of major progression in the narrative, some footage tends to drag. Fortunately, the director, also the writer, <b>tightens</b> <b>his</b> hold in the end with a highly dramatic climax.|$|R

Stephen fears {{that he no longer}} looks good, but Mrs. Jewls says that it is what is on the inside that counts, so that if he needs to look important, he'll have to wear expensive underwear instead of a tight tie.|$|R
