When Captain Mar-Vell tries to plead to <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Intelligence</b> to spare them from the experiments, <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Intelligence</b> states that [...] "traitors to the Kree Empire have no say."

After his glass chamber is shattered by Thor, Vision attempts to connect to <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Intelligence.</b> It shuts down and starts rebooting.
