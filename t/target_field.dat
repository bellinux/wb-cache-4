5|$|Extensions to both Metro {{lines are}} planned as of September 2017. The Blue Line {{extension}} will branch northward from the <b>Target</b> <b>Field</b> station, adding 11 stations to the line: two more in Minneapolis, two in Golden Valley, one each in Robbinsdale and Crystal, and five in Brooklyn Park. The Green Line extension will branch west from <b>Target</b> <b>Field</b> station and include 15 new stations: five in Minneapolis, three each in Saint Louis Park and Hopkins, one in Minnetonka, and three in Eden Prairie. The Metropolitan Council estimated in 2017 that the Green Line extension {{will be open}} for passenger service in 2021 and the Blue Line extension {{will be ready for}} passenger service the following year.|$|E

5|$|The Minnesota Twins {{have played}} in the Major League Baseball since 1961, having won the 1987 and 1991 World Series. The team has played at <b>Target</b> <b>Field</b> since 2010. The Minneapolis Lakers of the National Basketball Association played in the Minneapolis Auditorium from 1947 to 1960, after which they {{relocated}} to Los Angeles. The Minnesota Timberwolves joined the NBA in 1989, and play in the Target Center since 1990.|$|E

30|$|The {{experiments}} in Fig.  7 show that, {{compared to the}} forecasting using a single <b>target</b> <b>fields,</b> using a very few number of <b>target</b> <b>fields,</b> such as 2 – 7 can almost always help improve the forecasting accuracy, {{as shown in the}} left corner of Fig.  7. This is indeed consistent with our hypothesis that using multiple <b>target</b> <b>fields</b> can help improve the forecasting results. Moreover, when continuously adding more target variables, as shown on the right section of Fig.  7, the forecasting accuracy will actually drop, which suggests that too many correlations may add confusion to the forecasting modules and result in deteriorated results (similar to the case in supervised learning where continuously adding extra features may in fact deteriorate the classification accuracy).|$|R

5|$|Amtrak's daily Empire Builder (Chicago–Seattle/Portland) train {{runs through}} Minnesota, calling at the Saint Paul Union Depot {{and five other}} stations. Intercity bus {{providers}} include Jefferson Lines, Greyhound, and Megabus. Local public transit is provided by bus networks in the larger cities and by two rail services. The Northstar Line commuter rail service runs from Big Lake to the <b>Target</b> <b>Field</b> station in downtown Minneapolis. From there, light rail runs to Saint Paul Union Depot on the Green Line, and to the MSP airport and the Mall of America via the Blue Line.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Blue Line, {{which was}} {{initially}} {{known as the}} Hiawatha Line, began in 2001. The line opened in two phases in 2004, beginning with a 12-station stretch from the Warehouse District / Hennepin Avenue station through the Fort Snelling station in June. In December, five more stations were opened, continuing service south of Fort Snelling to the Mall of America station. Two additional Blue Line stations opened in late 2009: a new northern terminus at <b>Target</b> <b>Field</b> and the American Boulevard station in Bloomington. Construction on the Green Line, which was initially designated as the Central Corridor, began in 2010. The line opened in its entirety in June 2014.|$|E
5|$|A tie-breaker was {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 86–76. The Twins, who had won the regular season series against the Tigers, 11 games to 7, were thus awarded home field due to a rules change prior to the 2009 season. It was the third tie-breaker played in MLB from 2007–2009. It was also the second consecutive tiebreaker for the AL Central title after 2008, when the Chicago White Sox defeated the Twins to win the division. The tie-breaker is counted as the 163rd regular season game played by both teams and all events in the game are added to regular season statistics. This was the Twins' final regular season game at the Metrodome as the team moved to <b>Target</b> <b>Field</b> for the 2010 season. The tie-breaker was later named the Best Regular-Season Game of the Decade by Sports Illustrated.|$|E
30|$|For the 133 topics, {{we notice}} {{that all the}} methods are also better than using all the highest {{correlated}} forecaster. The best method {{is the one that}} uses 7 random fields. Intuitively, when selecting multiple <b>target</b> <b>fields</b> for forecasting, it makes sense to use strongly correlated fields to build forecasters. Unfortunately, our experiments show that using strongly correlated <b>fields</b> as <b>target</b> is, in fact, not always helpful. This is possibly because strongly correlated fields will introduce strong correlations in transformed dataset (as we have already explained about the WEKA data transformation process for forecasting [38]). It is well known that feature correlations will introduce complication in supervised learning, and possibly deteriorate the learning results. In comparison, using randomly selected <b>target</b> <b>fields</b> achieve the best performance.|$|R

5|$|Fares for Metro {{light rail}} service {{are the same}} as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other light rail and bus routes within 2.5 hours from the time a fare is paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro light rail services: fares within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive than regular fares but may not be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The <b>Target</b> <b>Field</b> station provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit service. The A Line bus rapid transit line connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro light rail stations – 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling – have designated park and ride lots.|$|E
5|$|The field {{selected}} for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It {{had to be at}} a high galactic latitude, because dust and obscuring matter in the plane of the Milky Way's disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The <b>target</b> <b>field</b> had to avoid known bright sources of visible light (such as foreground stars), and infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background infrared 'cirrus', the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas (H I regions).|$|E
5|$|The Minnesota {{franchise}} {{began its}} {{life as the}} Washington Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 1901 to 1960. In the early twentieth century, the Senators were managed consecutively by three future members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, bookended by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson managed the team for four seasons from 1929 to 1932, and he was followed by Joe Cronin, who led {{for the next two}} seasons (1933–1934). In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota, and Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager Cookie Lavagetto, and played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in downtown Minneapolis from 1982 to 2009. Under manager Ron Gardenhire, the team moved to <b>Target</b> <b>Field</b> beginning in the 2010 season.|$|E

40|$|Typographic {{and visual}} {{information}} {{is an integral}} part of textual documents. Most information extraction systems ignore most of this visual information, processing the text as a linear sequence of words. Thus, much valuable information is lost. In this paper, we show how to make use of this visual information for information extraction. We present an algorithm that allows to automatically extract specific fields of the document (such as the title, author, etc.), based exclusively on the visual formatting of the document, without any reference to the semantic content. The algorithm employs a machine learning approach, whereby the system is first provided with a set of training documents in which the <b>target</b> <b>fields</b> are manually tagged, and automatically learns how to extract these fields in future documents. We implemented the algorithm in a system for automatic analysis of documents in PDF format. We present experimental results of applying the system on a set of financial documents, extracting nine different <b>target</b> <b>fields.</b> Overall, the system achieved a 90 % accuracy...|$|R

The most fundamental question in this evaluation should be answered first. “Why subsidize education?” Education is a public good in that it benefits a community along with those educated. From a societal perspective, when the private benefit of education to an individual is much less than the total benefit generated to individual and community, individuals tend to under-invest in education.

40|$|An inverse {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of biologically loaded radio-frequency (RF) coils for magnetic resonance imaging applications is described. Free space time-harmonic electromagnetic Green 2 ̆ 7 s functions and de-emphasized B- 1 <b>target</b> <b>fields</b> are used to calculate the current density on the coil cylinder. In theory, with the B- 1 field de-emphasized {{in the middle of the}} RF transverse plane, the calculated current distribution can generate an internal magnetic field that can reduce the central overemphasis effect caused by field/tissue interactions at high frequencies. The current distribution of a head coil operating at 4 T (170 MHz) is calculated using an inverse methodology with de-emphasized B- 1. <b>target</b> <b>fields.</b> An in-house finite-difference time-domain routine is employed to evaluate B- 1 field and signal intensity inside a homogenous cylindrical phantom and then a complete human head model.

40|$|Quantum sensors {{have the}} {{potential}} to outperform their classical counterparts. For classical sensing, the uncertainty of the estimation of the <b>target</b> <b>fields</b> decreases 1 /√(T) with measurement time T. On the other hand, by using quantum resources, one can decrease the uncertainty with time to 1 /T - the Heisenberg limit. However as quantum states are susceptible to dephasing, it has been not clear whether one can achieve the Heisenberg limit for a measurement time scaling longer than the coherence time of those states. Here, we propose a scheme that estimates the amplitude of globally applied fields with Heisenberg limited sensitivity in principle for an arbitrary time scale under the effect of dephasing. We use one way quantum computing based teleportation between qubits to prevent the correlation between the quantum state and its local environment from increasing, and have shown that such a teleportation protocol can suppress the local dephasing while the information from the <b>target</b> <b>fields</b> keeps growing. Our methods has the potential to realize a quantum sensor with a sensitivity far beyond that of any classical sensors...|$|R
