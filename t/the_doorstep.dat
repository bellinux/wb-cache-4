5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe {{was adopted}} as North Devon's Liberal {{candidate}} in April 1952. His political stance matched {{that of other}} young activists, who believed that the party should offer a radical non-socialist alternative to the Conservative government. He and others founded the Radical Reform Group, to drive the party in that direction. He {{spent much of his}} spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and on <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as colonialism and apartheid. When Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Winston Churchill as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign. He succeeded in halving the Conservative majority in the constituency, and restoring the Liberals to second place.|$|E
