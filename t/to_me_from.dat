500|$|The {{audience}} {{reception of}} Jonas Quinn was sparked with controversy over Michael Shanks' {{departure from the}} show. When rumors began late in 2001 that Showtime would also not be renewing StargateSG-1 after its fifth season, panicking fans rallied to save the show and Daniel's character, starting massive write-in campaigns and setting up websites such as the [...] "Save Daniel Jackson" [...] site. The SciFi Channel eventually ordered a sixth season of the show, but the character of Jonas continued to be distrusted by loyal fans, who were concerned that Daniel's death might cause the SG-1 team to lose its moral compass. Robert C. Cooper summarized that [...] "there's been {{quite a bit of}} ire directed by fans towards Daniel's replacement" [...] after the airing of [...] "Meridian", but he hoped that the character would grow on fans eventually.

[...] The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it {{was chosen as the}} closing track because [...] "a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast {{and not being able to}} keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because at that point, I needed to.

Citing the literal meaning of [...] — [...] "this is {{the word of the}} release" [...] — the Mishnah held that a creditor could accept payment of a debt notwithstanding an intervening Sabbatical year, if the creditor had first by word told the debtor that the creditor relinquished the debt. A prosbul prevents the remission of debts in the Sabbatical year.
