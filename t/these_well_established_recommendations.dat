The analysis of this mechanism is less well understood but promises to provide more detailed information.

40|$|Background: Type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) {{is predicted}} to affect about 500 million individuals by 2030, and is closely linked to cardiovascular disease. Exercise is considered a cornerstone in both the prevention and treatment of T 2 D, but despite the clear-cut evidence and <b>well</b> <b>established</b> <b>recommendations</b> few patients with T 2 D exercise enough according to today’s guidelines. Objectives: To compare two different time-efficient high intensity exercise protocols in patients with T 2 D, and to investigate the effect on glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: Subjects with T 2 D were recruited and randomly assigned to either low-volume high intensity interval training (HIT) or extremely low-volume sprint interval training (SIT). Both groups exercised {{three days a week}} for 12 weeks. Changes in glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA 1 c), aerobic capacity (VO 2 peak), blood lipids, blood pressure and body composition were measured. Results: HIT and SIT combined reduced HbA 1 c significantly (- 0. 54 percentage points, p = 0. 005) only in the patients with the poorest glycemic control at baseline. Both HIT and SIT improved VO 2 peak, with no significant difference between groups. HIT, but not SIT, improved body fat percentage and visceral fat area. In hypertensive subjects blood pressure was reduced following HIT and SIT combined. Conclusion: Time-efficient interval training of high intensity can improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes-patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia, but not in wellcontrolled subjects. Aerobic capacity, body composition and hypertension can be improved in type 2 diabetes following substantially less weekly time of training than currently recommended, given that intensity of training is high. </p...|$|R

50|$|The terms {{closed system}} and open system {{have long been}} defined in the widely (and long before any sort of {{amplifier}} was invented) established subject of thermodynamics, in terms {{that have nothing to}} do with the concepts of feedback and feedforward. The terms 'feedforward' and 'feedback' arose first in the 1920s in the theory of amplifier design, more recently than the thermodynamic terms. Negative feedback was eventually patented by H.S Black in 1934. In thermodynamics, an open system is one that can take in and give out ponderable matter. In thermodynamics, a closed system is one that cannot take in or give out ponderable matter, but may be able to take in or give out radiation and heat and work or any form of energy. In thermodynamics, a closed system can be further restricted, by being 'isolated': an isolated system cannot take in nor give out either ponderable matter or any form of energy.

Through in-depth interviews with a range of stakeholders in the software industry, this research found that common, linear NPD models are not appropriate in the development of new software.

After recalling <b>these</b> <b>well</b> <b>established</b> facts, we discuss how to apply infinite mass limit to the physical situation. We provide predictions concerning semi-leptonic decays and non-leptonic ones, based on quark models. We then present in more detail the dynamical approaches: the relativistic quark model à la Bakamjian-Thomas and lattice QCD. We summarise lattice QCD results in the infinite mass limit and compare them to the quark model predictions. We then present preliminary lattice QCD results with finite b and c quark masses. A systematic comparison between theory and experiment is performed. We show that some large discrepancies exist between different experiments. Altogether the predictions at infinite mass are in fair agreement with experiment for non-leptonic decays contrary to what happens for semileptonic decays. We conclude by considering the prospects to clarify both the experimental situation, the theoretical one and the comparison between both.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{commonly}} diagnosed cancer among women, but despite survival rates improvement, {{it is still the}} second major cause of cancer related death. In postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER) dependent breast cancer, hormone therapy is an option, either by direct inhibition of ER using tamoxifen or by aromatase inhibition, resulting in decreased estrogen production. In this paper these two endocrine therapy approaches are compared in terms of their impact on bone health. Guidance for the prevention of bone loss and occurrence of fractures in postmenopausal women receiving AIs is also proposed. Despite intervention strategies to maintain bone health in AI-treated patients are not <b>well</b> <b>established,</b> <b>recommendations</b> by international societies to identify women with high risk of fracture and advice on the preventive anti-fracture therapy are exposed. Finally, available therapeutic options for management of bone loss in patients receiving AIs are presented. The search strategy for this literature review was conducted by using the key words “aromatase inhibitor*” and “bone loss” OR “aromatase inhibitor*” and “osteoporosis” in the MEDLINE/PubMed database. Nowadays, hormone-responsive breast cancer in postmenopausal women is preferably being treated with AIs instead of tamoxifen, due to clear benefits in disease-free survival and reduced recurrence. AIs have an advantageous side effect profile compared to tamoxifen, however all AIs have detrimental long-term effects on bone, due to nearly complete depletion of estrogens, resulting in increased bone loss and increased risk of fracture. Current recommendations state that all women treated with AIs should be evaluated for their fracture risk prior to initiation of AI-treatment, taking in consideration individual bone mineral density and several risk factors. The thresholds to introduce preventive therapy and drugs proposed differ among the available recommendations. Lifestyle modifications and adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation have been documented to have good impact in long-term bone health. Additionally, bisphosphonates are the first therapeutic option for AI induced bone loss and should be continued as long as AI-treatment is maintained, being iv zoledronic acid 4 mg every 6 months the best tolerated option...|$|R
