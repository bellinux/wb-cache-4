40|$|AbstractIndia {{has a huge}} {{population}} base {{of women in the}} age group between 10 - 50 years. However, the market for feminine hygiene products is the least penetrated in India. An exploratory study was conducted regarding the diffusion & adoption of sanitary napkins along with its brand awareness among the low-income group women in Mumbai. This group was selected because of their lack of education and knowledge, limited financial resources and use of traditional menstrual hygiene products. The authors of this paper have attempted to use the conceptual framework of the Model of Diffusion of Innovation by Rogers (2003) and conceptual model of product adoption at Base of the Pyramid by Cheryl Nakata and Kelly Weidner (2012), to study the diffusion and adoption of feminine hygiene products to the <b>target</b> <b>group.</b> Working <b>status,</b> education, type of home and monthly household income were important influencers in usage or non usage of sanitary napkins. Sanitary napkins were perceived as essential but not a necessity product due to the affordability issue by the <b>target</b> <b>group.</b> It was concluded that in order to increase diffusion & adoption of sanitary napkins among the <b>target</b> <b>group,</b> companies in the business of feminine personal hygiene should provide affordable sanitary protection which can simultaneously help in achieving compelling social objectives in an emerging market like India...|$|R
40|$|Most health {{professionals}} {{understand the importance}} of <b>targeting</b> behaviors, not <b>groups,</b> for disease prevention. Yet with regard to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) education programming, <b>target</b> <b>groups</b> have been defined by salient demographic traits, including race, in part due to incomplete knowledge about risk behaviors in various groups. As a result, community and school-based education programs have suffered some mistrust and resentment. This article reports the findings of original research on attitude and behavioral differences between and within racial groups for a college student sample, in response to AIDS education programming. Differences in baseline attitudes and behaviors showed that AIDS-related risk cannot be primarily associated with minority <b>group</b> <b>status.</b> Implications on refinement of targeting strategies are discussed...|$|R

The research plan pursued the availability, personal experience with, and objective frequency of, free- time locomotive activities of the <b>target</b> <b>group.</b> Methods: The <b>status</b> and the level of locomotive activities offered to handicapped persons were established using mixed research (a combination of qualitative and quantitative research). The collecting of data took place in the form of controlled interviews within which a non-standardized questionnaire divided in six topical modules was filled out with respondents of the age of 18 to 40 (the average age was 31. 4). Such topical modules comprised of 94 polytomic questions, 20 dichotomic questions, and 6 open questions that were responded to by the total of 40 persons (20 males and 20 females) from 5 facilities. Personal questioning of a manager also took place in each facility, the manager responding to five pre-defined open and informative questions.

Dietary assessment was based on weighed inventory method and 24 h recall obtained from their mothers. The nutrient intakes were compared with the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). A structured pretested questionnaire was utilised to gather information on the sociodemographic and economic characteristics, household food purchase and infant feeding practices of the children’s mothers. Anthropometric measurements of height and weight of the subjects were used in calculating weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height. Data was analysed using SPSS version 12. 0. There {{were no significant differences between}} the males and females except for males having a significant higher Lean Body Mass (LBM) than the females. Using weight-for-age, 82. 13 % of the Under- 5 children were underweight, 33. 52 % were stunted while 85. 15 % were wasted. The intakes of protein, iron, calcium and vitamin A were inadequate in both males and females. Majority of mothers of the children were uneducated (80. 7 %) and earned a paltry monthly income in the range of N 1, 500 -N 5, 900. The findings show that the nutritional status of Under- 5 children in the study location which happens to be a rural area, was quite poor. Also from the results, it is evident that malnutrition is still a major public health problem among young children due to the poor socioeconomic status (poverty and poor educational background) of their parents, and thus, there is a need for better nutrition of the Nigerian child...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} how Huset KBH can communicate to exchange students in Copenhagen. The goal is to attract this <b>target</b> <b>group</b> {{to the events of}} the culture house. The event, Husets PULS 2013, is used as a case in this study. The quantitative method is used to gather information about the <b>target</b> <b>group’s</b> media- and culture habits. It is concluded that the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> do not know about Huset KBH. Furthermore the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> favours concerts, movies and theatre and it often uses Facebook, which is the <b>target</b> <b>group’s</b> preferred communication channel. The results are used in an analysis of the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> and {{on the basis of the}} analysis a facebook event is produced for the case, Husets PULS 2013. After evaluating the facebook event it is assessed as being insufficient regarding attracting the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> to Huset KBH. A SWOT-analysis is therefore composed. This contributes to identify Huset KBHs opportunities and threats. It is concluded that communicating successfully to the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> involves an interaction with different communication channels. The channels are among others the use of ambassadors, posters and Facebook. This papers outcome is a plan of action that Huset KBH from now on can pursue when communicating to the <b>target</b> <b>group...</b>|$|R

Through <b>target</b> <b>group</b> analysis and observation, qualitative interviews and quantitative questionnaires are we able to identify our <b>target</b> <b>group’s</b> needs in speech communication. The <b>target</b> <b>group</b> analysis {{has made it possible}} for us to get a clear insight in their oral presentations and their strengths and weaknesses in their presentations. We focused on various rhetorical elements in our empirical study. However, we chose only to focus on the most central rhetorical elements such as body language, nervousness, speaking loudly and clearly and structuring presentations and time. Our <b>target</b> <b>group</b> was in general competent speakers, but they could advantageously improve their body language and speak more clearly and loudly...|$|R

40|$|Lifestyle {{factors and}} {{determinants}} of behaviour in specific <b>target</b> groupsomic <b>groups</b> are important <b>target</b> <b>groups</b> for health promotion. Those in low socio-economic groups have, comparatively speaking, the most unfavourable profile {{when it comes}} to lifestyle. In health policy documents, the need for focusing on specific <b>target</b> <b>groups,</b> in particular, migrants and low socio-economic groups, is emphasised. There is, however, a gap between proposed actions in health policy and actual local practice, where interventions take place. Important reasons for there being insufficient attention paid to specific <b>target</b> <b>groups</b> are the lack of political support for health promotion at the local level, and insufficient funds and professional capacity. In the near future, to cut across the unfavourable trends in risk behaviour in several specific <b>target</b> <b>groups,</b> changes in health promotion policy and practice are needed. Health Promotion can react to these unfavourabl trends, offering tailor-made services to specific <b>target</b> <b>groups.</b> In cooperation with the different parties involved, authorities should be able to create an environment where people are capable of making healthy choices and empowered to take their own responsibility in healthy and happy living...|$|R

40|$|Mobility {{in public}} environments is an {{important}} part of people's everyday life. However, living with functional limitations often means limited mobility. To plan for public environments that enable mobility for everybody, knowledge about various user groups' mobility is important. Up until now, knowledge concerning the mobility of people with cognitive functional limitations has been scarce. The aim of this paper is to explore, from experts' perspectives, mobility in public environments among people with cognitive functional limitations (<b>target</b> <b>group).</b> The findings of focus group interviews with experts showed that the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> had to keep external and internal challenges at a manageable level in order to maintain mobility. The <b>target</b> <b>group's</b> mobility is interpreted as depending on both the individuals' cognitive capacity in relation to environmental demands as well as the motility of the members of the <b>target</b> <b>group,</b> i. e. how they form their opinions about their possibilities for mobility. Both those aspects are important for planners to consider in order keep the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> mobile...|$|R

We predicted that integration pattern and <b>group</b> <b>status</b> would interact such that {{the responses of the}} members of high <b>status</b> <b>group</b> would be most positive under conditions of an assimilation pattern, whereas members of low <b>status</b> <b>groups</b> were expected to favour an integration-equality pattern.

The merger was then announced and the integration pattern was manipulated (e. g., in terms of the logo, location, and decision rules). The main dependent variables were assessed after the merged groups had worked together on a third task. As expected, there was evidence that the effects of <b>group</b> <b>status</b> on responses to the merger were moderated by integration pattern.

40|$|The central {{question}} {{in this study}} is whether the language and math delays of the different socio-economic and ethnic minority <b>groups</b> <b>targeted</b> by Dutch educational disadvantage policy have diminished or not. Data are from the years 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2008. Information from a total of 90, 000 pupils in Grades 2 and 8 was selected to represent the start and end points of primary education. The conclusion is that large differences exist between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils at the start of primary school. Minority <b>target</b> <b>group</b> pupils have a substantial language delay. In the last year of primary school, this delay has diminished somewhat but it is still substantial. In the period 1995 - 2008 the delays of the minority <b>target</b> <b>group</b> pupils have declined by more than 40 %. Part of the non-minority <b>target</b> <b>group</b> pupils also made gains, but these are less than those observed for the minority <b>target</b> <b>group</b> pupils.
