5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{established}} Route30, an unsigned legislative route {{extending from}} Niagara Falls, Niagara County {{in the southwest}} to Rouses Point, Clinton County, in the northeast. From Rochester to Red Creek, Route30 was assigned <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road. Between Red Creek and the hamlet of Union Square (now Maple View) {{in the town of}} Mexico, it included most of modern NY104. At the same time, the roadway alongside the Niagara River between Ridge Road in Lewiston and Pine Avenue in downtown Niagara Falls was designated, but not signed, as part of Route18. By 1914, Route30 was amended to also include the section of Ridge Road from Porter (modern NY429) to Ridgeway (NY63). In 1914, another section—from Ridgeway to the Orleans–Monroe county line—was also included in Route30's definition as a spur route. The spur route became part of Route30 on March 1, 1921, when the mainline route was realigned to follow Ridge Road between Ridgeway and Rochester.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 renumbering, NY78 {{was split}} into two new routes. North of Ovid, it served {{as the basis for}} NY15A, which {{continued}} southeast to Interlaken over the original alignment of NY15. The remainder of NY78 became part of NY44, a lengthy north–south route extending from NY13 in Caton <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road (then NY3 and later US104) in Wolcott. From Caton to Watkins Glen, NY44 was assigned to what is now NY225 and NY414. North of Romulus, the route utilized the alignment of legislative Route36 from Romulus to Seneca Falls and modern NY89 from a junction east of Seneca Falls to Wolcott. In the vicinity of Seneca Falls, NY44 overlapped with US20 and NY5. US44 was assigned in April1935; as a result, NY44 was renumbered to NY414 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new U.S. Highway.|$|E
5|$|NY414 {{has been}} {{truncated}} twice over the years. The {{first of these}} occurred on January1, 1949, when it was cut back on its southern end to Corning. NY414 was truncated to its current northern terminus in the mid-1960s following {{the construction of the}} super two highway for US104 between Sodus and NY414. US104 continued to use the former alignment of NY414 along Lake Bluff Road to connect <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road until the remainder of the super two east to Red Creek was completed in the early 1970s. This portion of Lake Bluff Road is now maintained by Wayne County as CR254. In Seneca County, NY414 was realigned slightly in the early 1950s to bypass the hamlet of Romulus to the east, moving it off CR148 and NY96 and onto a new road leading directly to Ovid.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} modern NY429 north of Sanborn was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} Route30, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route30 entered Sanborn from the west on what is now NY31 and followed current NY429 north <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road, where it turned east toward Rochester. All of legislative Route30 west of Rochester became part of NY31 in the mid-1920s, while the remainder {{of what is now}} NY429 outside of North Tonawanda was taken over by the state of New York by 1926. In the late 1920s, NY31 was realigned between Niagara Falls and the Lewiston–Cambria town line to follow Ridge Road west to the village of Lewiston. Its former routing to Niagara Falls via Sanborn became NY31A.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak, {{infantry}} in the 8th Scottish Rifles, 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division) advanced {{with the}} 7th Light Horse and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments (2nd Light Horse Brigade), covered by infantry in the 7th Scottish Rifles, 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division on the left, {{who had brought}} 16 machine guns and Lewis guns into a position from which they could sweep the crest and reverse slopes of Wellington Ridge. The Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment, with the 7th Light Horse Regiment and supported on the left by Scottish Rifles' infantry posts, fixed bayonets and stormed Wellington Ridge. They encountered heavy rifle and machine gun fire, but rushed up the sandy slope and quickly broke through the German and Ottoman front line. After clearing Wellington Ridge, the mounted riflemen, light horsemen and infantrymen pressed forward from ridge <b>to</b> <b>ridge</b> without pause. These troops swept down on a body of about 1,000 to 1,500 Ottoman soldiers, who became demoralised. As {{a result of this}} attack, a white flag was hoisted and by 05:00 the German and Ottoman soldiers who had stubbornly defended their positions on Wellington Ridge, dominating the camps at Romani, were captured. A total of 1,500 became prisoners in the neighbourhood of Wellington Ridge; 864 soldiers surrendered to infantry in the 8th Scottish Rifles alone, while others were captured by the light horse and mounted rifles regiments. By 05:30, the main German and Ottoman force was in a disorganised retreat towards Katia, with the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades and the Ayrshire and Leicestershire batteries not far behind. At 06:00, a further 119 men surrendered to the infantry in No. 3 Redoubt; while these prisoners were being dealt with, it became apparent that {{they were part of a}} rearguard and that a full retreat was under way. At 06:30, Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all troops and to initiate a vigorous general advance eastwards.|$|E
5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads once again split. Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. Once past Wanakah, the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the birth}} of their first child, Thomas Forrester, Dr. Taylor Forrestermarried to Ridgebecomes {{pregnant}} with twins. Throughout the pregnancy, Taylor suffers with tuberculosis, although she delivers the children without medication. Steffy and Phoebe Forrester are born on September 21, 1999, as Taylor almost dies. Steffy is named after her grandmother, Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery). In February 2001, a family trip to Saint Thomaswhere Ridge and Taylor renew their vowsends in devastation when two-year-old Steffy supposedly falls overboard during a storm and is presumed dead. However, Steffy has been kidnapped by Ridge's unstable ex-girlfriend Morgan DeWitt (Sarah Buxton)who was previously obsessed with having a child with him and Steffy is confined her to the walls of Morgan's home. Months after Steffy's supposed death, Taylor visits Morgan and discovers that Steffy is alive. Morgan then takes Taylor and Steffy hostage, but they are saved by Ridge. Morgan tries to flee but is arrested. The next year, Taylor is supposedly killed after being shot by another unstable resident, Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown), while trying to save Ridge's former love Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) from being shot. Much to Thomas, Phoebe and Steffy's dismay, Ridge marries Brooke months later. The children have difficulty accepting Brooke as their stepmother. In 2005, Taylor is found alive and she returns to her marriage <b>to</b> <b>Ridge,</b> having missed much of Steffy's childhood. In 2006, Steffy leaves town for boarding school in England after Taylor and Ridge divorce.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{established}} a statewide legislative route system that initially consisted of 37 unsigned routes. Much {{of what is}} now NY31 west of Jordan became part of one of three routes, namely Route14, Route20, and Route30. Route30 began at the Niagara Falls city line (delimited by modern NY61) and followed current NY31 east to Sanborn, where it turned north onto modern NY429. The route followed current NY429 <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road in Porter, at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to what is now NY63 in Ridgeway. Route30 went south here, utilizing modern NY63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined what is now NY31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY31 to the Rochester city line. In the vicinity of Brockport, however, Route30 was routed on West Avenue and modern NY19 instead. From the southeastern city line to NY96 in the village of Pittsford, Monroe Avenue (modern NY31) was part of Route14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment what is now NY31 between current NY31F and NY350 in the village of Macedon and NY317 in Jordan was part of Route20.|$|E
25|$|NY89 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It initially began at the junction of NY44 (modern NY414) and Ernsberger Road in the town of Varick and followed the latter eastward to Cayuga Lake, where NY89 turned north onto its modern alignment. At Seneca Falls, the route broke from its current routing and proceeded westward on what is now NY318 to Magee. Here, NY89 turned back to the north, following modern NY414 and Lake Bluff Road <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road (then-US104) north of North Rose. At the time, the current routing of NY89 north of Seneca Falls and the continuation of NY89 along Auburn Street <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road in Wolcott was part of NY44 while the section from Ithaca to Varick had yet to be constructed.|$|E

25|$|As {{traffic on}} {{boulevard}} began {{to increase in}} the 1950s and 1960s, many plans were introduced to improve the highway. Ideas ranged from widening the highway to building a new expressway to current day I-79. During the 1960s, a southern extension of the boulevard to Pittsburgh's North Side was discussed and by 1973 the highway opened from the Fort Duquesne Bridge <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Avenue and the McKees Rocks Bridge to Beaver Avenue and Chateau Street.

25|$|Ridge Road was {{constructed}} as a concrete road between Provinces and MD 176 in 1929. The highway was originally the easternmost part of MD 175. MD 713 was assigned <b>to</b> <b>Ridge</b> Road by 1946 after MD 175 had been extended southeast toward Odenton. MD 713 was widened between MD 175 and MD 176 in 1951. The highway was extended south from MD 175 to its present terminus {{at the entrance}} to Fort Meade in 1967. MD 713 was relocated and expanded to a multi-lane divided highway from south of Ridge Chapel Road to the intersection of New Ridge Road and Ridge Road north of MD 176 in 1995 in conjunction with the construction of MD 100 and the interchange between the two highways. A section of New Ridge Road remained part of MD 713 until the state highway was truncated at MD 176 in 1999. The old alignment of Ridge Road became part of MD 713B (Ridge Chapel Road) and all of MD 713C (Teague Road) south of MD 100, and MD 713D (Ridge Road) north of MD 100 to MD 176. The newly relocated section of MD 713 was relocated again in 2000 with the construction of Arundel Mills Boulevard to create a four-way intersection between the boulevard, the Ridge Road segment of MD 713, and an entrance to Arundel Mills, which opened the same year.|$|E

On 22 July 1898, approximately 1500 rebels entered Guatemala from Mexico equipped with Mauser rifles to end Estrada Cabrera regime, but their adventure was swiftly neutralized, as Estrada Cabrera sent twelve thousand troops to stop them, declared Martial Law and secured the help of a British navy ship to attack the Port of Ocós if needed. The {{commander in chief of the}} Guatemalan Army was former president Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, who defeated the rebels in Vado Ancho on 5 August of that year.
