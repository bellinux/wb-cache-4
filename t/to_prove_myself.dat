500|$|In an {{interview}} with CBC Sports, Sweatt explained {{the reason for his}} retirement. Sweatt intends to work as a financial advisor and expects to make more money than if he were playing in the AHL. [...] "I didn't need <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>myself</b> all over again. I didn't want to be a bubble guy again. I didn't want to be the guy in the still living the dream at age 30 and sacrificing my goals outside the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>myself.</b> I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E
500|$|Danny Elfman {{had great}} enthusiasm for {{returning}} because [...] "I didn't have <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>myself</b> {{from the first}} film. I remember Jon Peters was very skeptical at first to hire me." [...] Elfman's work schedule was 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. [...] "When completing this movie I realized it {{was something of a}} film score and an opera. It was 95 minutes long, twice the amount of the average film score." [...] Burton allowed Elfman to be more artistic with the sequel score, such as the [...] "scraping" [...] on violins for the cat themes. Under the pressure of finishing the score, however, {{the relationship between the two}} strained, which — along with further [...] "creative differences" [...] on The Nightmare Before Christmas — led Burton to use Howard Shore to score his next film Ed Wood. The musician co-orchestrated [...] "Face to Face", which was written and performed by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The song can be heard in one scene during the film and during the end credits.|$|E

500|$|Leroux {{stated that}} {{at a very early}} age, she knew she wanted to play for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team. To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most difficult things I ever had to do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it. Now I have a chance <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>myself,</b> and that's what I enjoy, and that's why I did what I did." ...|$|E
500|$|On 26 December 1887, Frederick {{wrote that}} his [...] "chronic catarrh" [...] {{appeared}} to be taking [...] "a turn for the better and that [...] "a further bond has been forged between our people and myself; may God preserve it by giving me, when I resume my duties, the capacity <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>myself</b> worthy of the great trust that has been shown me!" [...] A week later, however, on 5 January 1888, his hoarseness and the swelling under his left vocal cord returned, with the previously unaffected {{right side of his}} throat becoming inflamed. He ran high fevers and began coughing violently, with his breathing becoming more laboured. The doctors diagnosed perichondritis, an infection of the throat membrane. Frederick again became unable to speak, and suffered violent headaches and insomnia. On 29 January, Mackenzie returned to San Remo from a trip to Spain, and after examining his patient recommended an immediate tracheotomy. [...] The operation was conducted at 4 p.m. on 8 February, by which time Frederick was continually suffering from insomnia and [...] "embarrassing bouts of suffocation." [...] A cannula was fitted to allow Frederick to breathe; for the remainder of his life he was unable to speak and often communicated through writing. During the operation, Dr. Bergmann almost killed him by missing the incision in the trachea and forcing the cannula into the wrong place. [...] Frederick started to cough and bleed, and Bergmann placed his forefinger into the wound to enlarge it. The bleeding subsided after two hours, but Bergmann's actions resulted in an abscess in Frederick's neck, producing pus which would give Frederick discomfort for the remaining months of his life. Later, Frederick would ask [...] "Why did Bergmann put his finger in my throat?" [...] and complain that [...] "Bergmann ill-treated [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|In July, Tunney competed at the British Championships in Guildford, United Kingdom. [...] She placed {{second in}} the all around {{competition}} with a score of 53.900. [...] In event finals, she placed first on uneven bars scoring 13.750 and fifth on floor scoring 12.850. [...] Tunney said, [...] "I'm really happy. [...] I got a bit nervous at times but I wanted <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>myself</b> again after the Europeans and I think I've done that today." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes I become {{afraid of}} my own generalizations upon the massed misery of this Ghetto life, and feel that my {{impressions}} are exaggerated, that I am {{too close to the}} picture and lack perspective. At such moments I find it well to turn to the testimony of other men <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> that I am not becoming over-wrought and addle-pated. Frederick Harrison has always struck me as being a level-headed, well-controlled man, and he says:- ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Arizona Daily Star Walker said, [...] "There was a serious breakdown and a huge lack of effort to promote this album. Really, this project has gotten lost. It's kind of heartbreaking as an artist, but it's one of those lumps you take on the chin. I have a lot of ambition and a lot of heart and a lot of things <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> I'm not happy with the level we're at.

2500|$|In the 1985 NBA All-Star Game, Thomas {{was joined}} on the Eastern Conference squad by star rookie Michael Jordan. Jordan wound up {{attempting}} nine shots, relatively few for a starting player. Afterward, Thomas {{and his fellow}} veteran East players were accused of having planned to [...] "freeze out" [...] Jordan from their offense by not passing him the ball, supposedly out of spite over the attention Jordan was receiving. No player involved has ever confirmed that the freeze-out occurred, but the story has long been reported {{and has never been}} refuted by Jordan. Thomas has ridiculed the idea of him being the mastermind behind a supposed freeze-out as [...] "ludicrous", pointing out that he was a relatively young player on a team that included Larry Bird, Julius Erving and Moses Malone. During Michael Jordan's Hall of Fame induction, in which Thomas introduced John Stockton, who was also being inducted, Jordan dismissed the claims about a freeze-out having taken place, saying [...] "I was just happy to be there, being the young guy surrounded by all these greats, I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>myself</b> and I hope that I did prove myself to you guys." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{said after}} the game, {{referring}} to being drafted late [...] "I {{think a lot of}} people thought I had a lot of wear and tear on me, too much, so they didn’t know how much I have left, I just kind of laughed it off. I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>myself</b> even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E

5000|$|Hammond, {{who both}} smoked and drank daily, {{advocated}} consistent and proper exercise {{as the key}} to good health. He continued a daily regimen of running into his 80s and on his birthdays ran four miles on a track [...] "just <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> that I am not getting old. And I plan to keep it up as long as I live, which probably won't be much over 110." [...] At the age of 86, Hammond slipped into a coma and died two weeks later, on October 30, 1944. He was survived by two of his four daughters.|$|R

5000|$|In December, Vaculik {{returned}} to competition at Elite Canada in Oakville, Canada. She placed {{second in the}} all around final with a score of 52.950. [...] In event finals, she placed first on uneven bars scoring 14.150 and tied for first on floor scoring 13.900. [...] "I didn't have any expectations going into my first major competition after a one year absence," [...] she said, [...] "I just wanted to experience competition again and feel through my routines in a competitive frame of mind.

5000|$|Townsend {{then began}} work on his next solo album, Ziltoid the Omniscient. [...] "And I really mean solo, in the true sense of the word", {{explained}} Townsend. [...] "Nobody was around. For four months I worked completely on my own. I recorded each instrumental track and I also programmed all the drums. ... I was sound engineer and producer and I mixed every note in my cellar {{with a minimum of}} gear. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> that I could do it all on my own." [...] Townsend programmed the drums using Drumkit from Hell, a software drum machine provided to him by Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah.|$|R
60|$|In {{the month}} of January [blank], when Dora and I were walking from Town-End, Grasmere, across the vale, snow being on the ground, she espied in the thick though {{leafless}} hedge a bird's-nest half filled with snow. Out of this comfortless appearance arose this Sonnet, which was, in fact, written without the least reference to any individual object, but merely <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> that I could, if I thought fit, write in a strain that poets have been fond of. On the 14th of February in the same year, my daughter, in a sportive mood, sent it as a Valentine under a fictitious name to her cousin C. W.|$|R
60|$|David {{had noticed}} nothing, but I was strangely uncomfortable, and, despite my efforts at talk, often lapsed into silence, to be roused from it by {{a feeling that}} Paterson {{was looking at me}} covertly. Pooh! what vapours of the {{imagination}} were these. I blew them from me, and <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> so to speak, that they were dissipated, I asked him to see David home. As soon as I was alone, I flung me down on the floor laughing, then as quickly jumped up and was after them, and very sober too, for it was come to me abruptly as an odd thing that Paterson had set off without asking where David lived.|$|R

2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly.

And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> that I was a rapper." ...|$|R

5000|$|Isaac {{dropped out}} of the 1973 Talledega 500 mid-race in an {{impulsive}} decision which surprised his pit crew and the team owner. [...] "I wasn't afraid I was going to wreck...I don't have anything <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> or to anybody else. I know how it feels to win and lose. I know how it feels to be a champion. And now I know how it feels to quit. It just entered my mind at that moment," [...] Isaac said. [...] "I decided to quit and that was that. (Team owner) Bud Moore didn't know I had quit until after the race. I didn't know about (Larry) Smith at that time." [...] (Larry Smith was the first fatality at Talledega Speedway, which happened earlier in the race). Isaac did not participate in any further 1973 NASCAR Winston Cup races after Talladega, and the presumption by sports commentators in late 1973 was that he was retiring from the sport.|$|R
