Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends.|$|E
5|$|Soul Reaver {{takes place}} within the fictional world of Nosgoth, where {{the health of the}} land is tied to the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, and each pillar in turn is {{represented}} by a guardian. Before the events of Soul Reaver, the guardians became corrupt, and, after Kain killed eight of them, he discovered he was the final one. Refusing to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars, he doomed Nosgoth to eternal decay and proceeded to raise his vampire lieutenants, including Raziel, to besiege the land. By the time of Soul Reavers introduction, the vampires are now the land's dominant species and apex predators, the humans have been decimated, and the vampire tribes have each claimed a region of Nosgoth and turned their attention to internal matters. Unknown to the vampires, beneath Nosgoth lurks The Elder God, an ancient and powerful entity. The Elder God controls <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> Fate, a cycle of reincarnation of souls that circle the Wheel in a loop of predestination; however, because vampires are immortal, their souls do not spin with the Wheel, causing the land to decay as the Wheel stalls. By the time that Raziel is revived centuries after the game's opening cinematic, Nosgoth is on the brink of collapse, little more than a wasteland wracked with cataclysms and earthquakes.|$|E
