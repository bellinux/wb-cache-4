The survey collected data from approximately 6, 000 households from every province, {{both inside and outside}} municipal areas in Thailand. The study estimates the change in household consumption by using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. The result shows that the members within the household facing <b>the</b> chronic <b>illness</b> would reduce <b>the</b> consumption by around 4 %.
