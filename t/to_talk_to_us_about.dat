5000|$|Since {{the signing}} of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which {{followed}} Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Israel, multiple Israeli heads of state have visited Egypt on numerous occasions. However, Sadat's successor, Hosni Mubarak, visited Israel only once—for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in 1995—and never participated in talks on Israeli soil. In 2008, while on the Knesset speaker's podium during its memorial for Rehavam Ze'evi, Lieberman raised the issue and said, [...] "Mubarak never agreed to come here as president. He wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us?</b> Let him come here. He doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us?</b> He can go to hell." ...|$|R

[...] Vijay had first explored the script in his college days and drew inspiration from an English professor who used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the freedom movement a lot, furthering Vijay's interest in history. He visualizes about the people who lived in the pre-independence period of India and explored the concept of how it would have been if an English girl fell in love with an Indian boy, laying the foundations for the script. The script took six months to write, with leading Tamil writer Prabanjan and visits to see independence veterans being helpful in understanding the history of the city of Madras between 1945 and 1947.|$|E

We would like to start by thanking our contacts as Chalmers, as well as our interviewees who took time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the international student recruitment situation at Chalmers.

This report offers documentation and observations related to efforts undertaken during the demonstrations ' first year. In preparing this report, our staff gratefully acknowledge the contributions made to our effort by so many across the country. Project directors in each state, people with disabilities, their family members and friends, advocates, agency staff and administrators all took the time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the initiative or send us information. Additionally, we benefited from the advice and editorial comment offered us by staff at the Self-Determination National Program Office and our Advisory Team. We hope that you will find the enclosed report useful. If you have any comments about our findings or observations, please feel free to contact us. We are presently undertaking a follow-up impact assessment to complement this first year report. We hope to complete our field activities by early Summer, 2000 and have findings to share with you again soon after. We look forward to working with you again in this next round of inquiry...|$|E

In 1960, {{he set up}} the newspaper Makhi (Μάχη), meaning battle, or struggle, {{which was one of}} the first Greek newspapers in circulation in the nation of Cyprus. In 1961, in a series of newspaper articles, he admitted his service fighting the occupying police officers in 1956 during the resistance campaign against British rule of the Greek island of Cyprus.

40|$|At {{the start}} of a wider project with a {{regional}} group of secondary schools, we asked the core subject departments of English, Mathematics and Science <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> examples, grounded in their own classroom experience, of what they regarded as successful use of ICT to support teaching and learning. From this evidence base we built a model identifying and organising the main ideas expressed by teachers. We think that such a model is of interest because it indicates the concerns of practitioners and captures an aspect of their expertise, refined through their accumulated experience in a range of school conditions. Here we will offer an overview of the model, focusing on the ideas expressed by Mathematics departments. A much fuller report dealing with all three subjects is available (Ruthven, Hennessy & Brindley, submitted), as well as the report of an earlier pilot analysis focusing specifically on Mathematics (Ruthven & Hennessy, 2002). Across the core subjects, several major themes emerged from the departmental accounts of successful computer use. Each points to important ways in which teachers considered that the use of ICT tools and resources could support teaching and learning. Effecting working processes and improving production Teachers pointed to ways in which use of ICT could expedite and – more broadly – facilitate th...|$|E
40|$|American {{animator}} Robert Breer {{has been}} credited in introducing the first visual bomb to cinema in his loop film Image by Images I (1954), Two abstract animated films by Robert Breer are examined: 69 (1968 5 minutes) and Fuji (1974 10 minutes). Using Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological perspective, though these films are not representational or photographic {{in the traditional}} sense it is argued that they are still able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> real experiences because ‘the lived perspective, that which we actually perceive, is not a geometric or photographic one. ’(Merleau-Ponty, 1964 b: 14) 69 provides a metaphor for a system that collapses and Fuji as an articulation of that embodied seeing required for train travel. It is argued that Breer’s work in its explorations of style ahead of content is research into an act of viewing that offers a contemporary simulation of the impact of a traumatic experience on the body. Just as one cannot grab each object in the landscape at the speed of train travel nor can one grab or understand each frame that is presented to the retina of a Robert Breer film. What is required to attain “stillness” is a more dissociated way of looking that allows the images to wash over you. Such a “stillness” may be more about suppression than contemplation and could involve a process of metamorphosis. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} ‘craft knowledge ’ is {{not heard}} very often these days {{when talking about}} teaching. A critical evaluation of research into ‘best practice ’ for effective teaching, uncovers a variety of available strategies that apply {{in a variety of}} ways. The successful teacher needs to develop a repertoire of appropriate skills to meet the varied demands of classroom teaching. Formal opportunities for in-service training give teachers ongoing access to these important skills but these, on their own, may not readily transform into effective teaching practice in the classroom. The thesis of this paper is that it is in the context of dialogue amongst colleagues on the job, often spontaneous, that teachers can further develop their ‘craft’. The following, imagined, dialogue between a teacher {{in the early years of}} teaching and a longer serving colleague, suggests how this might happen. Prologue One day at teachers ’ college, after we had ventured forth into the world of the real live classroom several times on practicum placements in host schools, we were wakened out of a sort of ‘resignedness ’ brought on by another episode in the life of someone called Beeby who seemed to have existed in the last century. One of our number was heard to be saying to the lecturer: “It’s all very well hearing about this stuff, but we want to find out about is what to do when we are in a classroom” Yes, well, the ears were open. What would the man say? We wouldn’t be surprised by anything much, especially after that lecturer who was supposed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> aspects of Maori culture. He didn’t turn up for the first session, and sent us all away after about an hour of the second 1 hour session...|$|E

50|$|In non-finite clauses (clauses {{in which}} the verb is left unconjugated), the relativizer appears {{as an object of}} preposition, or in other words, {{directly}} after a preposition in the sentence. These relative clauses appear to be introduced by the preposition itself, but they are actually introduced by both the preposition and the relativizer, since these two grammatical particles form a “prepositional phrase”; and it is this phrase that introduces the clause. For example: 35) A yard in which to have a party 36) The baker in whom to place your trust 37) A student *who <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> just walked inNote that (37) is ungrammatical because the relativizer introduces a non-finite relative clause, but it is not contained within a propositional phrase.|$|R
