5|$|Alex O'Loughlin portrays Mick St. John, {{a private}} {{investigator}} who {{was turned into a}} vampire on the night of his wedding by his bride, Coraline. Mick is 85 years old, and unlike other vampires, he has standards and does not hunt women, children, or innocents. Although he realizes that he has feelings for Beth, he is reluctant <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship with her, knowing that being a vampire would hinder any sort of normal life. He is shown to be unusually mature and physically strong for a vampire of his age.|$|E

5|$|Malcolm's kingdom did {{not extend}} over the full {{territory}} of modern Scotland: {{the north and west}} of Scotland remained under Scandinavian, Norse-Gael, and Gaelic rule, and the territories under the rule of the Kings of Scots {{did not extend}} much beyond the limits established by Malcolm II until the 12th century. Malcolm III fought a series of wars against the Kingdom of England, which may have had as its objective the conquest of the English earldom of Northumbria. These wars did not result in any significant advances southward. Malcolm's primary achievement was <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>a</b> lineage that ruled Scotland for many years, although his role as founder of a dynasty {{has more to do with}} the propaganda of his youngest son David I and his descendants than with history.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} legislation to place a one-year moratorium on new Colorado health insurance mandates with independent Rep.

However, they announced {{at the start of the}} session that their proposal would not include an immediate moratorium on insurance mandates, and the legislation was killed on its first hearing in a House committee. Roberts also withdrew one of her proposals <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>a</b> pilot program for training of Certified Nursing Assistants, on account of its cost. Roberts also sponsored a contentious piece of legislation with general election opponent Sen. Bruce Whitehead, negotiated by Governor Ritter's office, to require utilities to convert some Front Range coal-fired power plants to natural gas.|$|E

Around March 2009, a coalition of lawmakers encouraged the Administration <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>a</b> variation of the VH-71 program. A letter issued by several members of Congress urged the President to support a VH-71 program.

5|$|While {{out to sea}} in August of the 1965 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, Stormfury meteorologists {{decided that}} Hurricane Betsy was {{a good candidate for}} seeding. However, the storm immediately swung towards land, and on September 1, the planned flights were canceled. For some reason, the press was not notified that there were no seedings, and several newspapers reported that it had begun. As Betsy passed close to the Bahamas and smashed into southern Florida, the public and Congress thought that seeding was underway and blamed Stormfury. It took two months for Stormfury officials to convince Congress that Betsy was not seeded, and the project was allowed <b>to</b> <b>continue.</b> <b>A</b> second candidate, Hurricane Elena, stayed too far out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>a</b> chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E

25|$|Among the Doric temples, the Peisistratid Olympieion at Athens has {{a special}} position. Although this {{building}} was never completed, its architect apparently attempted to adapt the Ionic dipteros. Column drums built into the later foundations indicate that it was originally planned as a Doric temple. Nonetheless, its ground plan follows the Ionic examples of Samos so closely {{that it would be}} hard to reconcile such a solution with a Doric triglyph frieze. After the expulsion of Hippias in 510 BC, work on this structure was stopped: Democratic Athens had no desire <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>a</b> monument of tyrannical self-aggrandisation.|$|E

25|$|Senior {{secondary}} education often refers {{to three years}} high school (or called senior middle school) education, as from grade 10 to grade 12.

This, however, is not compulsory for senior {{secondary education}}, where junior graduates may choose <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>a</b> three-year academic education in academic high schools, which will eventually lead to university, or to switch to a vocational course in vocational high schools.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{suffered}} drastic {{reductions in}} its {{terms of trade}} {{as a result of}} the 1973 oil shock. In the early 1970s, the performance of the export sector was undermined by an overvalued currency. With the trade balance under pressure, the oil shock led to a sharply higher import bill. Brazil opted <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>a</b> high-growth policy. Furthermore, it adopted renewed strategies of import substitution industrialization and of economic diversification. In the mid-1970s, the regime began implementing a development plan aimed at increasing self-sufficiency in many sectors and creating new comparative advantages. Its main components were to promote import substitution of basic industrial inputs (steel, aluminium, fertilizers, petrochemicals), to make large investments in the expansion of the economic infrastructure, and to promote exports.|$|E

Lifelong e-learningcourses can be different from typical e-learning courses because {{they are designed to}} provide"lifelong, voluntary, and self-motivated" pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professionalreasons. This study uses three popular behavioral models to identify factors that can affectstudent intent <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> in <b>a</b> lifelong e-learning course.
