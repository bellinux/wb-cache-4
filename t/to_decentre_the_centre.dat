40|$|It is {{important}} for educators to recognise that <b>the</b> various calls <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> subject—or self—should not be interpreted as necessarily requiring {{the removal of the}} subject altogether. Through the individualism of the Enlightenment <b>the</b> self was <b>centred.</b> This highly individualistic notion of the sovereign self has now been decentred especially through post-structuralist literature. It is contended here however, that this tendency <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> subject has been taken to an extreme at times, especially by some designers of school frameworks and curricula, who have eliminated the subject altogether. Such elimination is argued to contribute to the numbers of youth who are dropping out of school. By adopting an existential perspective and by drawing mainly upon Kierkegaard 2 ̆ 7 s subjective truth and Dewey 2 ̆ 7 s notion of centeredness, the case is made that for education the subject should not only be included but should actually be centred—at least momentarily...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a growing number}} of {{scholars}} in science studies and related fields are developing new ontologies to displace entrenched dualisms. These efforts often go together with a renewed interest in the roles played by symbolisms and tools in knowledge and being. This article brings Maurice Merleau-Ponty into these conversations, positioning him as a precursor of today’s innovative recastings of technoscience. While Merleau-Ponty is often invoked in relation to his early work on the body and embodiment, this article focuses on his later work, where the investigation of perception is integrated with an ontological exploration. The resulting approach revolves around the highly original idea of the body as a standard of measurement. We further develop this idea by coining the term ‘the measuring body’, which {{to a greater extent than}} did Merleau-Ponty accentuates the relative autonomy of symbolisms and tools and their capacity <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> perceiving body...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} render intelligible {{the meaning of}} the vibrant {{tradition}} of people-led war crimes tribunals (PWCTs) which has emerged in the past half a century. Drawing upon recent postcolonial critiques of extant literature on geographies of care and responsibility, and informed by Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL), we question the capacity of the international legal system to provide justice for ‘others’ (especially subaltern and colonised communities) at a distance. We situate PWCTs {{in the context of the}} claim that the international legal system is systemically contaminated because it is conceptually Western. We interrogate the seminal Russell Tribunal on Vietnam (1966 – 67) and in so doing are led to place under scrutiny the postcolonial and dialectical ethics which characterised the work of French philosopher, literary giant, and political activist Jean-Paul Sartre before, during, and after his tenure as Executive President of this tribunal. We argue that insofar as PWCTs speak subaltern truth to power, they work <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> Western ethical, legal, and juridical canon and confront insidious epistemic injustices. We conclude that any search for a postcolonial ethics to guide caring from afar can both inform and be informed by PWCTs...|$|R
40|$|The Situationist International (SI) {{have become}} a {{canonical}} reference point when discussing artists? participation in political action or activism. This article attempts <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> SI from this position, by tracing their theories and representations of political agency and labour. I argue that their notion of agency is deeply conflicted, epitomized by the dual invocations ?never work/all power to the workers? councils. I examine how the SI?s representations of agency betray an attraction to and fascination with 1960 s reactionary fantasies around brainwashing, conditioning, control and torture. Their practical descriptions of a constructed situation, which ?makes people live? are, in fact, closer to torturous state control than total liberation. The notions of agency they mobilise draw on colonial and classist sources, which actually deny the agency of radical movements. As a result, the SI produce a series of weak fantasies of participation, in which agency is denied and ?demanding the impossible? is actually a demand to constitute and police the impossible. Artistic-political agency was both guarded centre and constituent other. The SI?s policing of their identity, tied in name to the agency of ?situations?, involved the ongoing exclusion and repression of other artists? more practically-engaged labour within social movements...|$|R
40|$|The moves within postcolonial {{theory to}} "provincialise Europe" {{encourage}} an {{acknowledgement of the}} parochial nature of much of what still passes for universal theory in the western academy. Within geography, postcolonialism has generated {{a strong interest in}} colonial histories and contemporary postcolonial politics, but this has not displaced the dominant parochial forms of theorising in the discipline. The paper argues for a more cosmopolitan theoretical project within geography, one whose routes through a range of intellectual traditions and contexts might encourage a broader scope to conversations about space and nature, and produce more lively and creative insights into some of the urgent political issues facing the world today. A geography whose intellectual vision is limited to the concerns and perspectives of the richest countries in the world has little hope of effectively participating in the debates that will matter in the twenty-first century. Within the frame of this long-term intellectual project, this paper will suggest some initial practical steps which researchers, writers, teachers and students in geography might take <b>to</b> start <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> predominant Euro-Americanism of the discipline. The specific sources of inspiration for this argument are drawn from comparative urbanism and Southern African geography. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the lived cultures or cultural practices of gaming - the where, when and with whom gaming occurs. It follows David Morley?s suggestion that we need <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> media from our analytical framework in order to grasp both the relations between new and ?old? media, as well the way we live with them. It is an argument taken literally in this article, where an alternative framework of ontological narrative is developed as the primary means through which an understanding of the relationships between gamers and technology is reached. It focuses on interviews with gaming households and is interested in the ways gamers actively narrate gaming experiences, their gaming selves, and the gaming technology. Using ontological narrative as a central signifier facilitates discussions of the relationship between technology and the social which go beyond what the technology ?itself? can offer. It also insists on a socio-political context for the discussion itself. Through a more ontological narrative approach, videogames are framed as agents in negotiations with the power dynamics of the house, but their agency is complicated through issues of performativity, pleasure and identity. Finally, this approach allows for a much more nuanced understanding of the way games and the meanings they hold for the gamers are enmeshed in the everyday...|$|R
40|$|This article uses {{historical}} {{evidence about the}} competing designs of kitchens in 1920 s German social housing to argue that historians (and, to an extent, geographers) have overlooked the coercive capacity of space to compel certain forms of social relationship. Such has been the potency of the ‘cultural’ model in history and geography that the ‘material’ world has been cloaked by language and symbol. Bourgeois politicians, planners and reformers in 1920 s Germany were not only compelled to think about domestic space for the poor for the first time, but had to actually produce the physical space {{if they wanted to}} make their ideologies ‘live’. This article also shows that if we disaggregate the space of the home into its constituent parts (rather than simply contrasting the private and the public realms), different gender ideologies could be designed into domestic space, forcing families to adopt ways of living and patterns of sociability according to the priorities of, variously, ‘Americanizers’, socialists, conservatives and liberals. The kitchen designs of Frankfurt are well known, but in fact those of Munich were probably more widespread, and so this work further serves <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> canon of Modernism which dominates much discussion of Weimar building...|$|R
40|$|The modernist {{conception}} of the autonomous ‘subject’ as centred, sovereign, and coherently rational, acting intentionally, knowledgeably, and volitionally, has been challenged {{from a variety of}} sources, including poststructuralism, feminism, and posthumanism. A different kind of attack on the modernist subject has recently been staged by neurobiologists who have started <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> subject from within —to ‘naturalise’ (and materialise) the subject. This biological naturalism—the new ‘life sciences’—claims to challenge our conceptions of self, the ethical subject, and what we conceive of as ‘life’. But what conceptions we have of the configurations of the self is fundamental to our understandings and conceptions of ethics. This paper traces a debate between German neurobiologists and (post) humanist philosophers on the ontology of such things as ‘free will’, ‘ethical agency’, and the ‘self' {{as an example of how}} the dispute between naturalists and nonnaturalist or postnaturalists is instrumental in sharpening our understanding of the self and of ethical agency. The paper argues that naturalism is bound to fail due to its inability to grasp the intersubjectivist nature of ethical agency, a theme which links up with recent geographical writing on ethics. I suggest, building on a recent contribution of Huib Ernste in this journal, that we should consider Helmuth Plessner’s concept of eccentric positionality and ontology of the possible as a postmetaphysical kind of ethical humanism. ...|$|R
40|$|Gravity Shift is a video {{installation}} {{that looks}} at how we might read gravity through witnessing another body. It aims <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> viewer's relationship <b>to</b> the installation through presentation of a dancer whose movement is affected by a moving pull of gravity. Variation of Gravity The direction of gravity perceived by an audience remains a constant downwards in live dance and performance. Though there are countless theatrical techniques that try to defy this (aerial flying wires, balletic techniques etc), performers are inevitably subservient to omnipresent attraction exerted by gravity. In live performance both audience and performers experience this pull creating a universal sense of “down” {{both on and off}} stage. This shared sensation aids {{to create a sense of}} stability or centredness within the viewer’s mind as the effect of gravity witnessed on stage concurs with their own local sensations. Post-modern art, particularly installation art has frequently sought to question assumed stabilities through a shifting of the viewer’s perception. This installation aims to create a situation that <b>decentres</b> <b>the</b> viewer’s physical awareness through presentation of human movement where the pull of gravity has been dynamically distorted. Techniques for adjusting the perceived direction of gravity Video inherently separates the space of the viewer from the space of the performer. For video the performance space is the frame rather than the shared physical arena and its orientation is defined entirely by the viewpoint of a camera operator not the audience. The project exploits this property in order to change the perceived direction of gravity. In practice this involved the creation of an automated dance floor which could pivot in conjunction with a video camera. From the point of view of the camera the dance floor would always be aligned to the camera’s frame...|$|R

Locating Spatial Big Data in the historical and geographical contexts of Sydney and Hong Kong, it traces how situated knowledges mediate and moderate the rising potency of discourses of cartographic reason and data logics as colonial cartographic imaginations expressed in land divisions and urban planning continue on, {{in a world that}} increasingly values models of calculability, interoperability and authority. It draws on ethnographic material gathered through walking interviews in both cities, and in doing so, it argues that by using ethnographic ‘moments’, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> focus on data processes to consider the critical potential of a politics of everyday experiences that produce and reflect the structures of data logics. Through these ethnographic moments, this article examines how mobile technologies are complicit in the production of Spatial Big Data, and the impact this has on the increasing regimentation and surveillance of modes of being and expression via mobile media. At the same time, it will argue that while spatial calculability has expanded from cartographic reason into data logics, the epistemological universality of Spatial Big Data is constantly being resisted – in moments of experimentation, failure, intuition, memory and desire, the ghosts of the incalculable epistemes, experiences and people, forgotten by the emphasis on calculation, continue to speak...|$|R

The upshot of Gergen’s socio-technological determinism is totalitarianism as well as agonism between individual and social aspects. Taylor seemingly steers away from centring one aspect. He nevertheless partially centres intention (interpretation). This gives his de/centring also an undecided and agonistic picture; that is a self in a never-ending conflict with itself and surroundings.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore {{photographic}} attempts by African American women artists to produce experimental and diverse self-representations {{of the black}} female body. It considers the works of two black women photographers, Myra Greene and Renée Cox, and their contribution to a new visual language that focuses on abstractions and multifarious depictions of the black female body to explore the ever shifting identity of African Americans. The first chapter focuses on photographer Myra Greene and how she embraces abstraction, ambiguity and obfuscation {{as a form of}} intellectual and aesthetic empowerment. The artist deliberately complicates readings of her body in order <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> black body and shift it out from under the intense scrutiny of the ethnographic gaze. The second chapter examines the work of Renée Cox. It is an interdisciplinary analysis of the artist’s multifarious and multilayered self-representations to reflect the impossibility of defining the black female experience as one monolithic construct. By engaging with ideas of recontextulisation, reappropriation and inversion, both photographers are self-aware rather than complicit in the perpetuation of the black woman’s body in exhibition. They deliberately embrace notions of hybridity and ambiguity to defy single interpretation and contest ways in which the black female body continues to be read through representation of the past. This thesis considers the importance of positioning these women in a larger artistic movement of African American women artists who explore similar systems of observing and defining the black female body. In very different ways, Cox and Greene both challenge derogatory cultural and historical representations. I will explore their artistic efforts to reinstate and appropriate self-representations in a black female creative paradigm, for purposes of individual and communal empowerment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis proffers a {{detailed}} study, not an overview or a survey, of three contemporary Scottish women writers and six novels; moreover, <b>the</b> thesis attempts <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> Anglocentric British literary establishment. The primary theoretical approach drawn {{on in the}} analysis is feminism; the tenets of postcolonialism, poststructuralism, postmodernism, and the avant-garde are also integrated. Original and unpublished comments taken from personal interviews conducted with Tennant, Elphinstone, and Galloway are interwoven with textual interpretation throughout the thesis; this detailed new information confirms the critical conclusions drawn in all six novels. Chapter One reviews the field of Scottish literature and identifies a variety of critical approaches {{to the study of}} Scottish literature. At the same time, the review of literature defines a gap in the current field of research in Scottish literature and, in particular, Scottish women's writing. The chapter offers alternate critical approaches to Scottish literature and concludes with a brief overview of the six novels which make-up the thesis. Chapters Two, Three, and four offer in-depth examinations of Emma Tennant's novels The Bad Sister, Sisters and Strangers: A Mortal Tale, and Faustine. The analysis explores how Tennant exposes the way in which ideology and cultural institutions condition and limit women's access to positive female roles and self-hood. The discussion reveals how social discourses and the media construct women as powerless subjects who are often compelled to collude with their 'oppression'. An investigation into narrative techniques like orality and intertextuality discloses how Tennant calls into question the very nature of literature and how her writing offers a feminist postmodern challenge to conventional representations of womenhood and femininity in literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{religious}} dimensions of visitor experiences in public museums is an under-researched area, {{partly because of}} assumptions of the secular nature of the museum space, the dominant assumptions and methods of museum evaluation studies and the relative lack of study of material religion in public spaces {{not intended to be}} devotional. This project addresses this by examining the processes through which visitors experience sacred presences in the museum. This research employed Actor Network Theory (Latour 2004) in order <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> more prominent components within visitor studies and evaluations (such as the visitor). Using ANT, this study conceives religious interactions as networks that combine objects, people and divine/supernatural presences, all of which have the capacity to affect the network. This network approach was then used to explore and analyse interactions at two religious-themed exhibitions at the British Museum, and the religious tour groups that visit its permanent galleries. The study found that the sacred was evoked {{in a number of ways}} in the museum; through embodied interactions with artefacts, as memories, and through engagements with scripture. Each encounter had to negotiate an array of actors that were both present and absent within the museum space. These actors, which had the ability to facilitate and inhibit visitors' religious experiences, included elements often overlooked by museum professionals and within visitor studies (such as overheard comments and glass display cases). The findings also revealed how perceptions of the museum as secular shaped visitor norms and thereby influenced whether the museum became a site of conflict or opportunity for sacred encounters. Furthermore, the research demonstrated the limited capacity of museum staff to influence visitors’ interactions as, irrespective of the museum’s intentions, the commingling of certain objects, spaces and visitors can facilitate experiences of the divine...|$|R
40|$|This project forms part of {{a growing}} {{engagement}} with biology by critical psychology and, more broadly, body studies. The specific focus is on the neurological body whose dogmatic exclusion from critical endeavours is challenged by arguing that neuroscience offers a vital resource for emancipatory agendas. Rather than conversely treating biology as a site for the factual supplementation of social theory the aim is to engage (negotiate) with neuroscience more directly and critically. In this process a discursive reductionism and attempted escape from complicity associated with critical psychology are addressed. Similarly a naïve and apolitical empiricism claimed by neuroscience is disrupted. The primary objective is however to demonstrate the utility of neuroscience in developing critical theory. These objectives are pursued through the ‘method’ of deconstruction, (mis) reading several highly regarded neuroscience texts written by prominent neuroscientists, working within the convolutions of these texts so as develop openings for critical conceptualisations of (neural) corporeality. In this manner the various spectres associated with neurology, including essentialism, determinism, individualism, reductionism and dualism, are displaced. This includes, amongst others, the omnipresent mind/body and body/society binaries. The (mis) readings address a number of prominent themes associated with contemporary neuroscience: Attempts at specifying an identity for (part of) the brain are shown to rely on a necessary relationship with the excluded other (such as the body, the socio-cultural, and the environment). Similarly, attempts at articulating a centre, a point from which agency can proceed, which finds existing identity in the functions of the prefrontal cortices, are also undone by the (multiple, affective, and unconscious) other which <b>decentres</b> <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> by being <b>the</b> essential supplement for any such claims. The causal metaphysic must likewise proceed within the play of différance, a logic of difference and deferral that undermines causal routes, innate origins and autocratic centres. Finally, reductionism must advance as a necessary strategy through which to engage with complexity, its ambitions always impossible as the aneconomic is forever in excess of any economy. The emancipatory viability of such (mis) readings is discussed within a context where the open and malleable body has been co-opted by contemporary neo-liberal geoculture. PsychologyD. Litt. et Phil.

40|$|Deconstruction in {{architecture}} has made great claims <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> human subject. Architects such as Peter Eisenman claim {{to work with}} the concepts and history of architecture in a way which is free of any false hopes for a final return to an apprehension by a human subject whose needs are the origin of the discipline. However, much of the architecture of deconstruction is not consistent in this aim and, as Jacques Derrida has pointed out, indulges itself instead in constructing an experience of absence. In the politics of the discipline 2 ̆ 7 deconstruction 2 ̆ 7 plays the role of a rationalist, knowledge-centred architecture, which stands in opposition to a humanist, phenomenological approach which valorizes experience. The non-sequitur 2 ̆ 7 experience of absence 2 ̆ 7 forms a circuit in this pattern of oppositions and thus deconstruction {{in architecture}} tends towards being a mere negative theology, a reversed humanism. Moreover, the architectural project of constructing experiences of otherness or the absence of a privileged subject position is not unfamiliar. Kurt Schwitters 2 ̆ 7 Merzbau can be shown to take mental constructs, such as the history and politics of the avant-garde, and to play them against devices which have the aim of bringing to consciousness an apprehension of the body as a perceptual apparatus. Walter Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s contemporary texts on the conceptualization of experience in relation to art, technology and the city can be used to provide terms for an description of the Merzbau. The point is not to further the analysis of the Merzbau nor to exemplify Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s theory but rather to remember the breadth and sophistication of these early twentieth century inquiries into experience, when compared to the present architectural deconstruction both of 2 ̆ 7 experience 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 constructivism 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|Between 2006 - 2007 in Quebec {{the passage}} of a {{controversial}} code of conduct in the rural municipality of Hérouxville cast the debate over Reasonable Accommodation into the media spotlight. The question of integrating minorities and immigrants into pluralistic Quebec society has provoked discussions over the fragility of Quebec identity. A social crisis has been linked to the delicate majority status that Quebecois now enjoy in the province. Some Quebecois conceive that Muslim beliefs and practices threaten the social cohesion of their society based on fundamental values such as gender equality, secularism and tolerance. This social discourse effectively reinforces their identity of a tolerant superior group vis-à-vis the “Other” which must be either tolerated or “civilized” in order to accept and learn the contemporary way of life in Quebec society. Taken together, Quebec is engaging in a deep soul-searching as claims of racism, xenophobia and intolerance rise {{to the surface of the}} ongoing debate over the accommodation of difference. The role of the media was central in turning the Reasonable Accommodation debate into a social crisis. The strategies and framing employed by the print media along with the selective coverage of certain issues caused polarization between minority and majority groups My inquiry asks: does a critical textual analysis of the news print media’s representations of Muslim women reveal a subtle racialized discourse? I invoke an Orientalist lens to show how racializing discourses manifest in a guarded subtext over the preservation of Quebec identity which effectually reinforces hierarchical relations between a dominant group and subordinate group. My methodology employs a critical textual analysis of 12 Gazette and La Presse news print articles in order to uncover the deeper and more nuanced implied meaning of negative dichotomization (Us-Them), inferiorization and demonization of the Other, the desire to expel the Other, along with feeling of victimization and generalization about an entire group. Identified as discursive mechanisms, this research situates and anchors the implied meaning of the representations of Muslim women in the particular historical experience of Quebecois and their distinct language and culture. My analysis reveals instances of a subtle, hidden, new form of racism which is less explicit than traditional forms of racism once were. Some of the media processes and framing which are identified allowed the reasonable accommodation debates to degenerate into a state of “moral panic”. I demonstrate that Muslim women are marginalized and discriminated against on the basis of their race, gender and cultural identity. Essentially, the news print media creates damaging portrayals of Muslim women in an effort to insulate a protectionist nature in Quebec that buttresses a conviction that these representations are universal which are in fact stereotypical and mythical. In order to counter these negative portrayals students must be taught how to think critically about the media and develop the appropriate media literacy tools so that they can understand what social equity means among varying ethnocultural groups. In an effort <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> <b>the</b> dominant, white identity, developing a critical pedagogy within an anti-racism framework enables students to recognize stereotypical imagery and discrimination and at the same time it educates students about the normativity of whiteness and its powerful entrenchment in schools. ...|$|R

In experiment 1, participants relocated the objects either from the same position of learning by taking as reference their own body (centred egocentric condition) or from a 908 decentred position (allocentric condition). Performance was measured in terms of linear distance errors and angular distance errors. Results revealed that the allocentric condition was more difficult than <b>the</b> <b>centred</b> egocentric condition. In experiment 2, participants performed either <b>the</b> <b>centred</b> egocentric condition or a decentred egocentric condition, in which the body position during the test was the same as at encoding (egocentric) but the frame of reference was based on a point <b>decentred</b> by 908. <b>The</b> <b>decentred</b> egocentric condition was found to be more difficult than <b>the</b> <b>centred</b> egocentric condition.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of photographs {{has been a}} milestone {{in the development of}} society by making life richer and more comprehensive. Dental photography as part of clinical medical photography plays a role primarily as a document, but also as a tool for educating students and continuing education of dentists. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present possible applications of traditional and digital photography in dentistry at the present stage of technological development. Dental photography requires some knowledge and equipment to obtain quality images of intraoral structures. The control of depth of field (DOF) is one of the important factors for successful dental photography. DOF can be control-led by changing relative aperture, using special lenses with <b>decentring</b> <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> effect of Scheimpflug’s principle as well as the use of specialized software which uses series of images with selective focus to form a composite picture. Special significance of dental photography is documentation and ability to record maximum information in conditions that can be repeated. Standardization of conditions during recording oral cavity, adequate storage and archiving of dental photographs are also important prerequisites for quality and useful photography...|$|R
40|$|The present {{doctoral}} thesis consists {{in a study}} of the conditions of possibility of knowledge for a post-ecocidal age otherwise called Age of Re-Embodiments. The epistemological trajectory largely inaugurated by Socrates's equation of the beautiful with the intelligible is assumed as intrinsically ecocidcil. The figure of a transcendent God that reverts plurality back to one and becoming to being is taken as the operative metaphor that systematizes and provides coherence to the epistemological tradition. In assessing the official project of sustainable development as continuous with the latter, valuable cognitive artillery to proceed with our study is instead found in Nietzsche's work and that of part of his entourage -Heidegger, Derrida, Foucault, Deleuze, Vattimo, Plotnitsky. Nietzsche's philosophy of the future and Derrida's set of undecidables are reworked as an anaiytics of transposition. The main remit of the transposition is that of reinscribing the solipsist positions -the conditions of possibility of knowledge-of eplsteme in the cultural matrix -the transposition or reconfigurative operator par excellence. Customarily, one finds positions hierarchizing their opposite poles -productivity/sustainable development, realism/constructivism, living organism/inert matter, theism/atheism, anthropocentrism/ecocentrism. Transpositions, subsequently renamed transposements, conform to the third figures of such dichotomous binary pairs. Each chapter revolves around one or a set of related transposements. Conjointly but irreducibly plural, the transposements at issue come <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> and occupy <b>the</b> objectifying place of God. Within the epistemological trajectory, the project of the Enlightenment is portrayed as initiating an immanent turn further carried out by authors in the post-Kantian tradition. The majority of transposements herein proposed are geared at completing the immanent mobilization. It is claimed that a static immanent plane is a metaphysical farce. Rather, when the impetus of the immanent spatiality is fully released the latter indefectibly manifests itself in concrete degrees within the constrained-engaged immanent continuum.

He is renowned internationally for his research and scholarship in open and distance education, and is recognised {{as one of the}} most prolific contributors to the field. Terry Evans has undertaken international consultancies in on research, policy and educational development. He is the editor or co-editor of ten books including Changing University Teaching: reflections on creating new educational technologies (with D Nation, London, Kogan Page, 2000); Opening Education: policies and practices from open and distance education (with D Nation, London, Routledge, 1996) and Shifting Borders: globalisation, localisation and open and distance education (with L Rowan & L Bartlett, Geelong, Deakin University Press, 1997). In 1995 he was awarded the Open and Distance Learning Association's Award for Research Excellence for his book Understanding Learners in Open and Distance Education (London, Kogan Page, 1994). Professor Evans's recent research and writing is in the fields of open, flexible and distance education, including work on interactive television in schools, professional and vocational education and training, internationalisation, new educational technologies and postgraduate pedagogy. He has held several research grants from Australian Research Council, Commonwealth Government and other agencies. Globalisation can be characterised, Giddens (1994) suggests, as a process of "intensified reflexivity" that creates the conditions for "a world of clever people". Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are fundamental to globalisation and they have also been incorporated into the new educational technologies deployed by educators to (re) create "a world of clever people". Together, education and the ICTs are strong forces for globalisation where both curriculum and pedagogy shape the knowledge and values of the rising generation of "clever people". This paper posits some research issues and questions that the seminar participants may wish to ponder. These issues and questions might be usefully pursued in transnational collaborative research or are germane to its conduct and context. These matters include: the place of ICTs in research work; the challenge of globally inclusive curricula and the impact of English as the global language; and ICTs <b>decentring</b> <b>the</b> research <b>centre.</b> published_or_final_versionCentre for Information Technology in Education, University of Hong Kon...|$|R

" - See more at: [URL] ? The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore relationships between social tagging and key poststructuralist principles; to devise and construct an analytical framework through which key poststructuralist principles are converted into workable research questions and applied to analyse Librarything tags, and to assess the validity of performing such an analysis. The research hypothesis is that tagging represents an imperfect analogy for the poststructuralist project. Design/methodology/approach ? Tags from LibraryThing and from a library OPAC were compared and constrasted with Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and publishers? descriptions. Research questions derived from poststructuralism, asked whether tags destabilise meaning, whether and how far the death of the author is expressed in tags, and whether tags deconstruct LCSH. Findings ? Tags can temporarily destabilise meaning by obfuscating the structure of a word. Meaning is destabilised, perhaps only momentarily, and then it is recreated; it might resemble the original meaning, or it may not, however any attempt to make tags useful or functional necessarily imposes some form of structure. The analysis indicates that in tagging, the author, if not dead, is ignored. Authoritative interpretations are not pervasively mimicked in the tags. In relation <b>to</b> LCSH, tagging <b>decentres</b> <b>the</b> dominant view, but neither exposes nor judges it. Nor does tagging achieve the final stage of the deconstructive process, showing the dominant view to be a constructed reality. Originality/value ? This is one of very few studies to have attempted a critical theoretical approach to social tagging. It offers a novel methodological approach to undertaking analysis based on poststructuralist theory. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Utopias and dystopias are {{forms of}} social {{criticism}} in which the author draws on an existing society to create a perfected (utopian) or exaggerated (dystopian) projection which {{is set in a}} different time and/or space from the original. As reactions to problematic, or potentially problematic, situations and developments, utopias and dystopias are always connected to change [...] -they explicitly or implicitly present an argument for change, and/or they embody a response to it. This thesis focuses on four English authors who wrote utopias and/or dystopias between {{the latter part of the}} Nineteenth Century and the middle part of the Twentieth: Richard Jefferies, William Morris, H. G. Wells, and Aldous Huxley. In each case they not only responded to recent, endemic, or continuing change, but also implicitly or explicitly sought it. The narratives they wrote are founded in change and emerged during a time of flux. Jefferies responded to a declining rural culture, Morris to an expanding industrial culture, Wells to the material uncertainties evoked by evolution theory, and Huxley to the post-Darwin, post-War metaphysical incertitude which appeared to him <b>to</b> have <b>decentred</b> <b>the</b> culture. Each author also sought appropriate change to remedy the particular circumstances of which he was critical. This thesis looks at these authors, not simply in terms of their response to change, but in terms of their attitudes to the relatively enduring structures of nature and history. Nature, in its various manifestations, had different connotations for different authors. To Jefferies, nature [...] -as local landscape and cosmic immensity, as ears of corn and universal life force [...] -offered, amongst other things, an essential continuity that modern life was eroding. For Morris, nature offered inspiration and the possibility of a harmonious interrelationship with humanity once the restless era of capitalism had been succeeded by a restful future in communism. To Wells, both external and internal nature offered a dangerous unpredictability which must be controlled, while Huxley believed that humanity's struggle with the environment and consequent negative impact on it could be dissolved in the possibility of epiphanic fusion with the cosmos. Central to all their various conceptions of, and attitudes toward, nature, however, is the question of what are the shaping characteristics of humanity's relationship with nature. The unfolding of history, in the simple sense of time passing, was not synonymous with progress for these writers, and the perception that the temporal current was actually carrying society, or elements of it, toward regression and/or fragmentation inspired their remedial dystopian and utopian texts.

40|$|The {{distinction}} between different spatial representations in the peripersonal space was examined in two experiments by requiring sighted blindfolded and blind participants {{to remember the}} locations of objects haptically explored. In Experiment 1, object relocation took place from either {{the same position as}} learning -with <b>the</b> same (<b>centred</b> egocentric condition) or 90 °-rotated (rotated egocentric condition) object array- or from a position different from the learning position (allocentric condition). Results revealed that, in both sighted and blind people, distance errors were higher in the allocentric and rotated conditions than in <b>the</b> <b>centred</b> egocentric condition, and that blind participants made more distance errors than sighted subjects only in the allocentric condition. Experiment 2 repeated rotated egocentric and allocentric conditions, while <b>the</b> <b>centred</b> egocentric condition was replaced by a decentred egocentric condition in which object relocation took place from the same position as learning (egocentric) but started from a <b>decentred</b> point. <b>The</b> <b>decentred</b> egocentric condition was found to remain significantly different from the rotated condition, but not from the allocentric condition. Moreover, blind participants performed less well in the allocentric condition, but were specifically impaired. Overall, our results confirm that different types of spatial constraints and representations, including <b>the</b> <b>decentred</b> egocentric one, can be distinguished in the peripersonal space and that blind people are as efficient as sighted in the egocentric and rotated conditions, but they encounter difficulties in recalling locations also in the peripersonal space, especially when an allocentric condition is required...|$|R

Examining Achebe 2 ̆ 7 s authorial intention in Things Fall Apart, especially as epitomised in the character of Okwokwo, the protagonist, Njeng argues that Achebe corroborates Conrad 2 ̆ 7 s portrait of the African. In writing Things Fall Apart, Achebe falls under the 2 ̆ 2 postcolonial writer 2 ̆ 7 s strain 2 ̆ 2 resisting {{and at the same time}} seduced by Occidental ideology. In his novel, Achebe tries to veil his desire for the Occident by presenting Okwonkwo initially as a prominent character only to fulfil this desire in the course of <b>the</b> narrative by <b>decentring</b> <b>the</b> protagonist. Achebe 2 ̆ 7 s characterisation is centrifugal, that is, he constructs the events of the story to unfold such that Okwonkwo is systematically removed from <b>the</b> <b>centre.</b> This <b>decentring</b> of <b>the</b> protagonist diminishes him as well as the African values he is supposed to represent. This centrifugal aesthetics of constructing events resulting in the protagonist removed from <b>the</b> <b>centre,</b> satisfied Achebe 2 ̆ 7 s intention of supplanting African values with Western values. Removing the protagonist from <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> of events creates space for the antagonist to take root, supplanting African religion and culture with Western ideology and hegemony. Njeng postulates that Things Fall Apart appeals to Occidental audiences because Achebe concedes them the place they have always thrived for and thus the novel continues to reverberate in Western discourse...|$|R
40|$|To {{what extent}} can {{anthropology}} still {{help us to}} understand {{the world around us}} at a time when this world is characterized by processes of political and economic multipolarity, and the decolonization of knowledge? The political questioning of cultural decentring is an opportunity for anthropology to build a new epistemological conception of decentring. Against and beyond cultural relativism, ethnicism or ontological perspectivism, the issue is knowing how <b>to</b> <b>decentre</b> in any situation, here and now', from oneself as much as from each we', searching for tangible and intangible limits, and making those borders places of observation and understanding of increasingly more cosmopolitan social and cultural lives. I develop and propose this new conception in three stages. The first contextual stage highlights the importance of border situations and the necessity to account for them in order to tackle globalization as an observable social fact, beyond and against frozen representations of Others' cultures and identities. The second stage explores the possibility of a post-culturalist decentring. In this reflection I turn to philosophy, from Rousseau to Foucault and Agamben, to find cues for an epistemological conception of <b>decentring.</b> In <b>the</b> last part I emphasize the understanding of situations, and rehabilitate reflexive ethnography and the situational inductive approach as the foundations of contemporary anthropology...|$|R
