At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E

While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb and Bergstein chose Emile Ardolino as the film's director, who had won the 1983 Academy Award for the documentary, He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'. Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project; he even sent a message {{from where he was}} sequestered on jury duty, insisting that he was the best choice as director. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold.

Since the hip protectors were not effective in preventing hip fractures in our study, the main objective became to examine whether the use of hip protectors results in lower <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> per participant in the hip protector group as compared with the control group. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> of a hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation in frail, institutionalized elderly were calculated. Residents from apartment houses for the elderly, homes for the elderly and nursing homes with a high risk for hip fractures were randomized to the hip protector group (n = 276) or control group (n = 285). Costs were calculated for the hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation until 1 year after the fracture. Six months after each hip fracture, a nurse was interviewed and after 12 months, a questionnaire was sent to the general practitioner or nursing home physician to determine the utilization of health care resources. Differences in costs between the groups were analyzed using non-parametric bootstrapping. Eighteen hip fractures occurred in the intervention group and 20 hip fractures (in 19 persons) in the control group (log rank P-value = 0. 86). <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> per participant, including the costs of the intervention, were € 913 in the intervention group and 502 in the control group (cost difference of €- 411; 95 % confidence interval: - 723; 57). <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> of a hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation were € 8100 (95 % CI: 6716 - 10, 010).

When some costs are sunk and some are not sunk, total fixed costs (TFC) equal sunk fixed costs (SFC) plus non-sunk fixed costs (NSFC) or TFC = SFC + NSFC.
