25|$|Solhi al-Wadi's immense overall activity, {{especially}} his administrative, teaching and performing duties, allowed him limited time for composing, but he cherished <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> he could satisfy the great urge {{he had to}} express himself. He believed that he should contribute {{to the world of}} music by whatever means he was capable of. His works are performed enthusiastically by musicians in Syria and other countries. In addition to that he received throughout his artistic life commissions to compose music for Arabic films, something he accepted and fulfilled with pleasure, but even though incidental music brought him fame all over the Arab world, his compositions for chamber ensembles figure among his finest creative achievements.|$|E
25|$|Explaining {{the causes}} of {{delusions}} continues to be challenging and several theories have been developed. One is the genetic or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with delusional disorder {{are at increased risk}} of delusional traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of delusional disorder in <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> coping with life and maintaining high self-esteem becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.|$|E
500|$|Nora Ephron {{wrote the}} {{introduction}} to Beckerman's eponymous 1995 book, which she immediately thought had dramatic possibilities. [...] She identified with the stories in Love, Loss, and What I Wore because the book [...] "is not about fashion; it is about what clothes really are to us, <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> we are constantly trying to find our identity through them". [...] Soon after its publication, Ephron gave the book to eight of her friends for Christmas. She became interested in writing her {{own version of the}} book. [...] Once she decided to adapt Love, Loss, and What I Wore into a play, she and her sister emailed 100 women for stories.|$|E

500|$|This {{would cause}} {{problems}} for the studio, Universal and partner MGM. [...] "The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It was one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> {{you sit down and}} think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?" [...] Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had [...] "negative attributes" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] the original character.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to questions posed by The Guardian and handed to the band via their lawyer, Pussy Riot accused Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church of orchestrating the case. Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken to the courtroom, and not go in at all and everything would've gone the same way. The fact that we took part physically [...] didn't actually change anything." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{praised the}} episode and specific elements of it, like Michael {{wandering around the}} office drunk {{and many of the}} documentary-style interviews, like Charles talking about his effect on women, Toby comparing Michael to a movie on a plane and Kevin being too lazy to compliment Michael in person. But he said the episode was [...] "elevated" [...] by Michael and Pam forming a partnership at the end: [...] "Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer are always brilliant in <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> they have to show multiple emotions at once, so it was nice to finally see them get to do it side-by-side." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the Spirit of Creation might transiently smile, a {{smile that}} would be like the passing of a cloud. All the {{mountain}} wilderness about us would be radiantly lit. (You know <b>those</b> swift <b>moments,</b> <b>when</b> warmth and brightness drift by, in lonely and desolate places.) ...|$|R
60|$|And he, {{still under}} the spell of <b>those</b> magic <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> he had knelt at her feet, {{understood}} her prayer, and closing his eyes just for one brief moment in order to shut out for ever that radiant vision of a pure angel whom he had worshipped, turned quietly to Anne Mie.|$|R
60|$|But {{best of all}} to me, are <b>those</b> quiet <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> Alured's earnest spirit shows itself, and {{he talks}} out what is in his heart; {{that it is a}} great {{responsibility}} to stand in the place such a man as Fulk would have had--yes--and to have been saved at the cost of Trevor's life.|$|R
500|$|... "Make Me Over" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's love of British rock, while strains of [...] "Learn You Inside Out" [...] were inspired by the Plastic Ono Band. When asked about the song [...] "Learn You Inside Out", Wade said, [...] "I wrote it really quick. We decided just to freestyle. It was one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> we really grew as a band, being able to reach each other and know where we're going." [...] The song [...] "Disarray" [...] {{was inspired}} by Wade's strict and religious family. When asked about the song, he said, [...] "Angels, demons. We all fight them both, and anyone who pretends they don’t is not someone I want to hang out with." [...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its starkness. We love the idea of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band had}} been flooded with [...] "hyperbolic praise," [...] and deemed [...] "the next big thing" [...] by {{multiple}} media outlets. Before recording the follow-up to its debut, the band released the acoustic EP/DVD My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue. The EP was the band's first charting on the Billboard 200 at number 153. From Under the Cork Tree {{was recorded in}} Burbank, California, and served as {{the first time the}} band had stayed in California {{for an extended period of}} time. The group lived in corporate housing during the making of the album. In contrast to Take This to Your Graves rushed recording schedule, Fall Out Boy took a much more gradual pace while working on From Under the Cork Tree. It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on Grave. Stump felt that this process was much more [...] "smooth" [...] as every member was able to focus on his individual strengths. He explained: [...] "We haven't had any of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> I play the music and he'll say, 'I don't like that,' and he'll read me lyrics and I'll say, 'I don't like those lyrics.' It's very natural and fun." [...] Despite this, the band had great difficulty creating its desired sound for the album, constantly scrapping new material. Two weeks before recording sessions began, the group abandoned ten songs and wrote eight more, including the album's first single, [...] "Sugar, We're Goin Down." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 January 2016 {{a feature}} {{article on the}} BBC News website opened with the words: [...] "It was one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> the whole world seems to care." [...] It went on to quote Alan Kurdi's aunt Tima Kurdi: ...|$|E
50|$|Her playing {{has been}} {{described}} as “crystalline” with Philip Kennicott stating, She’s a natty player fastidious when it comes to textures and transparency. Her occasional re-discovery of quietness was refreshing, and she bought out <b>those</b> rare <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> Tchaikovsky says two things at once rather than one thing very insistently. There seems to be intelligence at work.|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} {{is representative of}} the studies I have completed during my time in the MFA program. Poetry workshops and seminars on prosody, translation, fragmentation, and constraint-based writing have contributed to the creation of this project. Thematically, my work is largely concerned with identity, the relationship between the external world and internal experiences, and perception. It attempts to capture something of the epiphanic, <b>those</b> rare <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> the ordinary becomes ineffable...|$|R
60|$|Ed Linton was a short, heavy man, and his stocky build gave {{evidence}} of considerable strength. His former strokes {{had not been}} made {{at the expense of}} exertion, but now he got ready for a supreme effort. A sudden silence clamped down upon the exuberant cowboys.

2500|$|... "I am most {{surprised}} by <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> I have {{felt as if}} the sentences, dreams, and pages that have made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination– that another power has found them and generously presented them to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hypomania, manifesting with {{feelings}} of euphoria, omnipotence, or grandiosity, are prone to appear in <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> medication effects are maximum; [...] dysphoria, characterized by sadness, psychomotor slowing, fatigue or apathy are typical with DRT withdrawal. Different impulse control disorders have been described including gambling, compulsive shopping, eating disorders and hypersexuality. Behavioral disturbances, most commonly aggressive tendencies, are the norm. Psychosis is also common.|$|E
2500|$|Seniors {{participate}} in a four-day Kairos Retreat, during which they, together with faculty, share their lives, particularly <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> they have experienced God, emptiness, joy, pain, or healing.

There is a special session of this retreat each year open also to juniors, often referred to as [...] "Junior Kairos".|$|E
60|$|With Mrs. Morel {{it was one}} of <b>those</b> still <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> {{the small}} frets vanish, and the beauty of things stands out, and she had the peace and the {{strength}} to see herself. Now and again, a swallow cut close to her. Now and again, Annie came up with a handful of alder-currants. The baby was restless on his mother's knee, clambering with his hands at the light.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} admired works of {{contemporary}} architecture, the building has been hailed as a [...] "signal moment in the architectural culture", because it represents [...] "one of <b>those</b> rare <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> critics, academics, {{and the general public}} were all completely united about something."

2500|$|Richard Corliss of Time gave Dune a {{negative}} review, stating, [...] "Most sci-fi movies offer escape, a holiday from homework, but Dune is {{as difficult as}} a final exam. You have to cram for it." [...] He noted that [...] "MacLachlan, 25, grows impressively in the role; his features, soft and spoiled at the beginning, take on a he-manly glamour once he assumes his mission." [...] He ended by saying [...] "The actors seem hypnotized by the spell Lynch has woven around them—especially the lustrous Francesca Annis, as Paul's mother, who whispers her lines with the urgency of erotic revelation. In <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> Annis is onscreen, Dune finds the emotional center that has eluded it in its parade of rococo decor and austere special effects. She reminds us of what movies can achieve {{when they have a}} heart as well as a mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{suddenly}} she fell mute, and glancing {{down at her}} face, I read in an instant the thing she had thought to do. It was one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> one sees.|$|E
60|$|It was but {{moderately}} successful, for Stephen, {{like all}} men {{of culture and}} neat habits, took Nature only at <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> he had gone out to take her, and of her wild heart he had a secret fear.|$|E
60|$|They {{were walking}} hand in hand, {{looking at each}} other; Maggie, indeed, was hurrying along, for she felt it time to be gone. But the sense that their parting was near made her more anxious lest she should have unintentionally left some painful {{impression}} on Philip's mind. It was one of <b>those</b> dangerous <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> speech is at once sincere and deceptive; when feeling, rising high above its average depth, leaves floodmarks which are never reached again.|$|R
60|$|Benjulia {{turned away}} {{again with the}} air of a {{disappointed}} man. A violent moral shock sometimes has a serious effect on the brain--especially when it is the brain of an excitable woman. Always a physiologist, even in <b>those</b> rare <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> he was amusing himself, it had just struck Benjulia that the cook--after her outbreak of fury--might be a case worth studying. But, she had got relief in crying; her brain was safe; she had ceased to interest him. He returned to the dining-room.|$|R
60|$|Clementina and the Vice-Consul {{afterwards}} {{agreed that}} Mrs. Lander must have sent {{the will to}} Mr. Orson in one of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> of suspicion <b>when</b> she distrusted everyone about her, or in that trouble concerning her husband's kindred which had grown upon her more and more, {{as a means of}} assuring them that they were provided for.|$|R
60|$|Young Staunton {{was about}} to speak, {{but it was one}} of <b>those</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> those, who, like Jeanie Deans, possess the {{advantage}} of a steady courage and unruffled temper, can assume the superiority over more ardent but less determined spirits.|$|E
6000|$|... "Every circumstance," [...] she said, [...] "occurring in <b>those</b> <b>moments,</b> <b>when</b> I still {{enjoyed a}} delusive idea of happiness, is deeply {{imprinted}} in my remembrance, which, respecting {{all that has}} since happened, is waste and unvaried as an Arabian desert.

"To {{me these}} evening strolls {{have been the}} happiest hours of an unhappy life; and if any gentle reader shall {{hereafter}} find pleasure in perusing these lucubrations, I am not unwilling he should know, that the plan of them has been usually traced in <b>those</b> <b>moments,</b> <b>when</b> relief from toil and clamour, combined with the quiet scenery around me, has disposed my mind {{to the task of}} composition.|$|E
2500|$|... "You see, everyone's {{starved for}} {{attention}} in Gypsy. [...] That craving, after all, is the motor that keeps showbiz puttering along.

There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in <b>those</b> uncommon <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{speaking}} to NME, lead singer Kelly Jones said {{the song is}} [...] "about finding some hope in life.

40|$|In the Platonic dialogues, {{the enigmatic}} {{concept of the}} good tends to retreat at <b>those</b> very <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> it is {{supposed}} to show itself. This paper examines the relation between the beautiful and the good as the good takes refuge in the beautiful. Hans-Georg Gadamer holds a particular interest in these retreats since they show that there is actually an emphasis on appearances and the human good in Plato. In contrast, Emmanuel Levinas is critical of the primacy of vision and the beautiful from an ethical perspective. The relevant passages in the dialogues will be interpreted with respect to this divergence...|$|R
