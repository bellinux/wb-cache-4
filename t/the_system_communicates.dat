40|$|SLR 2000 is {{a system}} concept for an autonomous, {{unmanned}} satellite laser ranging station with a single shot range precision of one centimeter or better. The goal {{of the program is}} to provide 24 hour tracking coverage and to reduce both capitalization and operating and maintenance costs by an order of magnitude relative to current outlays. The dominant cost driver in present systems is the onsite manpower required to operate the system, to service and maintain the complex subsystems (most notably the laser), and to ensure that the transmitted laser beam is not a hazard to onsite personnel or overflying aircraft. In performing initial tradeoff studies of the SLR 2000 system, preference was given to simple hardware over complex and to passive techniques over active resulting in the concept described here. The SLR 2000 system consists of an optical head mounted to a concrete pier which in turn contains a single rack of electronic equipment.

40|$|The use of {{electronics}} connected to local networks and the Internet is growingall the time. Nowadays {{you can control}} your electronics in your house even when away from home, which opens up for potential security threats. The purpose of this report is {{to point out the}} potential risks with connecting home electronics to the Internet and to shed light on what security mechanisms that are needed in these kinds of systems. This report contains a theoretical part in which relevant material has been summarized. This material includes the smart home solution Tellstick Net and the wireless technologies ZigBee and Z-Wave, which are commonly used in home automation. The Tellstick Net system was mapped out and a risk analysis with attack trees was performed. After the analysis of the system, the implementation of two potential security threats were attempted. The two attempted attacks were replay attack and cross-site request forgery. The replay attack was unsuccessful due to the way <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>communicates</b> and keeps connections alive. However, the cross-site request forgery was discovered to be successful in some cases. It depended on if the browser of the target supported cross-origin resource sharing, as that property protects against cross-site request forgery. Finally, the report discusses what impact the found security deficiencies have, what they entail and how they reflect on the need for security in smart technologies for the home...|$|E
40|$|Since cyclists do {{not have}} their {{auditory}} and visual channels completely available while riding a bicycle, it is unsafe for them to use the GPS navigation tool provided by smartphones, {{which is based on}} audio and visual cues. In such situations, the haptic channel can be suitable to deliver information. Therefore, a research developing a system that uses haptic cues to give bicycle riders turn-by-turn information was carried out. The proposed solution uses two vibrotactile motors, each one located on each wrist. The motors are controlled by an Arduino board connected via Bluetooth to an Android App which oversees the GPS navigation and provides real-time turn-by-turn instructions. The cyclist is informed on the direction by the vibration of the motors: if the motor vibrating is located on the left wrist then s/he would have to turn left, and the same applies to the other side. We used two types of buzzes: a single buzz indicates a distance of approximately 60 m, and a double buzz points out that the turn is imminent. When both motors are activated at the same time <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>communicates</b> to the user the arrival to the destination.

40|$|PRP, Parallel Recursive Procedures, is a {{high level}} system for coding {{parallel}} programs. Basically, it allows the user to take a sequential program using recursion, {{and be able to}} run in on several computers. The system has a preprocessor that will rewrite parts of the user's code into code that the PRP system can distribute to other computers. The recursive method will then be executed in parallel on these machines (workers). The workers will then return parts of the final answer, that an administrator in the system will use to determine the final answer for the recursive method. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>communicates</b> over the internet, and any computer running a worker-process can join an execution. This thesis describes the system in detail, and how the existing implementation of it could be improved. The thesis has its focus on user-friendlyness. The initial system was very hard to set up right. The thesis discusses how to automize the setup of the system. One of the goals was to make it into a system that people find easy and powerful enough, so that they will actually try to use it. This is mainly achived by creating a graphical user interface, accumalating the neccasary data from the user through the GUI. Then, based on the data, the new system will automaticly perform commands like preprocessing source code, compiling code, moving files et. c. The thesis also discusses improvements to the system while it is running. The goal here is to do extensive monitoring of system data, and controlling parts of the execution. By showing the user details of the system during runtime, it is hoped that the user will find it more interesting.
