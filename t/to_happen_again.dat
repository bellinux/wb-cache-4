25|$|That {{which has}} {{happened}} is a warning. To forget it is guilt. It must be continually remembered. It was possible for this to happen, and it remains possible for it <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again</b> at any minute. Only in knowledge can it be prevented.|$|E
25|$|In West Germany, Münch {{took part}} in {{discussion}} meetings and commemoration ceremonies. He was appreciated for having saved many Auschwitz prisoners {{at the risk of}} his own life. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, he made a journey back to the concentration camp. Münch was invited by Eva Mozes Kor, a survivor of Josef Mengele's experiments on twins. Münch and Kor signed public declarations regarding what had happened there and declaring that such a thing should never be allowed <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{may have}} {{encountered}} {{the idea of}} the Eternal Recurrence in the works of Heinrich Heine, who speculated that one day a person would be born with the same thought-processes as himself, and that the same applied to every other individual. Nietzsche expanded on this thought to form his theory, which he put forth in The Gay Science and developed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Schopenhauer directly influenced this theory. Schopenhauer postulated that a person who unconditionally affirms life would do so even if everything that has happened were <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again</b> repeatedly.|$|E

25|$|Sherman White, {{along with}} {{teammates}} Bigos and Smith, disregarded Sollazzo's intended fix {{for a game}} played on January16 against Duquesne. The three combined for 64points as the Blackbirds downed the Dukes, 84–52. Sollazzo supposedly lost a $30,000 bet because of it and threatened White for it <b>to</b> never <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R

25|$|The timing flaw {{consisted}} of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, {{and making a}} second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered safe mode, and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4, which alerted engineers {{that they needed to}} contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again</b> because no similar tasks were planned {{for the remainder of the}} encounter.|$|E
25|$|Much {{as it had}} in the House, debate {{centered}} around the number of candidates in a contingency election and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution. Again, small Federalist states vehemently argued that three candidates gave too much power to large states to pick presidents. Senator Pierce Butler of South Carolina argued that the issues with the election of 1800 were unlikely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again</b> and he would not advocate changing the Constitution simply to stop a Federalist Vice President. John Quincy Adams argued that the change from five to three gave an advantage to the people that violated the federative principle of the Constitution. Rather than have the office of the President balanced between the states and the people, Adams felt designation of President and Vice President would tip that scale in favor of the people.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{and public}} service {{officials}} have speculated on the threat of another very large earthquake occurring in southern California and what type and scale of damage might result. The portion of the fault that ruptured in 1857 has settled into a period of dormancy and this {{has given rise to}} suggestions that future slip along that zone may be characterized by a very large 1857-type event followed by another period of inactivity. The communities of Frazier Park, Palmdale, and Wrightwood are all located very close to the San Andreas fault, though much of the Los Angeles area could be affected even at a greater distance from the rupture area if a similar event were to reoccur there. Swaminathan Krishnan, assistant professor of civil engineering and geophysics at the California Institute of Technology, said that if a similar rupture from Parkfield to Wrightwood were <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again,</b> it would severely affect the Los Angeles area, with the San Fernando Valley being particularly hard hit.|$|E

50|$|Kitchener placed great {{importance}} on transport and communications. Reliance on river transport, and {{the vagaries of}} the Nile flooding, had reduced Garnet Wolseley's Nile Expedition to failure in 1885, and Kitchener was determined not <b>to</b> let that <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> This required the building of new railways to support his invasion forces.|$|R
500|$|The book {{opens with}} the {{statement}} that [...] "war no longer exists"; that is, war as [...] "battle in a field between men and machinery" [...] or [...] "a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs" [...] is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> The premise of the book is that the world is experiencing a new paradigm of war in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, which Smith dubs [...] "war amongst the people", in which nebulous, open-ended conflicts have become the norm. Smith believes that Western, industrialised armies struggle to win in [...] "wars amongst the people" [...] because their opponents are not uniformed armies. He uses the term [...] "rhizomatic" [...] to describe terrorist and guerrilla movements; he states his belief that such fighters can adapt much more easily than state institutions, and that they exhibit a greater understanding of the utility of force. Rather than being part of a recognisable army, the fighters are part of the civilian population, and their objectives are more political than military—they seek to [...] "win hearts and minds" [...] rather than take or hold territory. As a consequence, wars are no longer confined to a battlefield, but the theatre of operations is fluid, and commanders now operate inside the theatre.|$|E
2500|$|Dupas {{was again}} {{released}} from prison in February 1985. Approximately one month later, he raped a 21-year-old woman on a beach at Blairgowrie. After alighting from his car, Dupas followed the woman and attacked her, holding {{her to the ground}} at knifepoint before raping her. He later told police: [...] "I'm sorry for what happened. Everyone was telling me I'm OK now. I never thought it was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> I only wanted to live a normal life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Allied {{sinking of}} Sanct Svithun [...] an unescorted Norwegian {{passenger}} ship [...] led to strong reactions in Norway, {{with the leadership}} of the Norwegian resistance movement sending a letter of protest to the press office of the Norwegian government in exile in London on 20 October 1943. In the letter the resistance stated that [...] "We have received message from a trusted source in Western Norway who has been gathering reliable intelligence from eye witnesses and survivors about the sinking of Sanct Svithun. He declares that the German reports in the media are by and large correct. When the negative impacts have not been greater, the reason is that everyone back home refuse to believe that the English could have behaved in such a manner. This is in conflict with the experiences that people back home have made over almost three years. If anything like this was <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again,</b> it would be highly damaging." [...] The letter was presented to Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Trygve Lie and debated in a government conference.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the rise}} of free agency and trades, many sportswriters {{believe that it is}} highly {{unlikely}} that another group of players of comparable size will spend their entire careers with a single team. Buck Showalter, the Yankees manager during the Core Four's major league debuts in 1995, said, [...] "You won't see anything like this <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> There are too many variables for that <b>to</b> ever <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> And what you have to remember is the makeup of those guys. The common thread was their agenda. They didn't branch off. They didn't want to disappoint each other. They were guys who never wanted to let their teammates down." ...|$|R

50|$|Using {{random numbers}} for {{cryptography}} was first done around 1917 for securing teleprinter communications. It proved unfeasible {{for the reasons}} mentioned above.

2500|$|In 2009, four {{sales representatives}} for Eli Lilly filed {{separate}} qui tam lawsuits {{against the company}} for illegally marketing the drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly {{for the treatment of}} dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind. [...] "That was a blemish for us," [...] John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. [...] "We don’t ever want that <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."

2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was when I knew that this was the real deal, that the magic was about <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> Suddenly we could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you kind of get that out of the way early in the day but I never did. I made a point to hold onto it. And you know the turtle, the {{malicious}} turtle, was pretty easy to fire that fucker right out of the hole. There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again,</b> when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E
