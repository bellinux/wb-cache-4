5|$|While the {{committees}} are established by formal Senate rules, {{there are a}} number of caucuses <b>that</b> <b>exercise</b> significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus, each of which has a leader and a whip, referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip. As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as the Majority Leader, and their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus. The Majority Leader and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party's participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist their candidates. The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|A 2016 Cochrane review stated <b>that</b> <b>exercise</b> therapy could {{contribute}} to alleviation of some symptoms of CFS, especially fatigue. The Cochrane review also noted that research was inconclusive as to which, if any, type of exercise therapy was superior, and concluded that no evidence had been found suggesting <b>that</b> <b>exercise</b> therapy worsened outcomes. A 2015 review article determined that serious adverse effects, or harms, from exercise therapy were poorly reported in most studies, and determined there was insufficient evidence for a conclusion.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} tested the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>exercising</b> self-control causes {{an increase in}} approach motivation. Study 1 found <b>that</b> <b>exercising</b> (vs. not exercising) self-control increases self-reported approach motivation. Study 2 a identified a behavior—betting on low-stakes gambles—that is correlated with approach motivation but is relatively uncorrelated with self-control, and Study 2 b observed <b>that</b> <b>exercising</b> self-control temporarily increases this behavior. Last, Study 3 found <b>that</b> <b>exercising</b> self-control facilitates the perception of a reward-relevant symbol (i. e., a dollar sign) but not a reward-irrelevant symbol (i. e., a percent sign). Altogether, these results support the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>exercising</b> self-control temporarily increases approach motivation. Failures of self-control that follow from prior efforts at self-control (i. e., ego depletion) may be explained in part by increased approach motivation...|$|R

Later he developed the multistage test, consisting of several stages of progressively greater workloads. It was this multistage test, a description of which was first published in 1963, that became known as the Bruce Protocol. In the initial paper, Bruce reported that the test could detect signs of such conditions as angina pectoris, a previous heart attack, or a ventricular aneurysm. Bruce his and colleagues also demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>exercise</b> testing was useful in screening apparently healthy people for early signs of coronary artery disease.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{explored}} the thermoregulatory capacity of rodent tails by subjecting test organisms to {{varying levels of}} physical activity and quantifying heat conduction via the animals' tails. One study demonstrated a significant disparity in heat dissipation from a rat's tail relative to its abdomen. This observation was attributed to the higher proportion of vascularity in the tail, {{as well as its}} higher surface area to volume ratio, which directly relates to heat's ability to dissipate via the skin. These findings were confirmed in a separate study analyzing the relationships of heat storage and mechanical efficiency in rodents <b>that</b> <b>exercise</b> in warm environments. In this study, the tail was a focal point in measuring heat accumulation and modulation.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{review of}} {{published}} scientific research suggested <b>that</b> <b>exercise</b> generally improves sleep for most people, and helps sleep {{disorders such as}} insomnia. The optimum time to exercise may be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though exercise {{at any time of}} day is beneficial, with the exception of heavy exercise taken shortly before bedtime, which may disturb sleep. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw detailed conclusions about the relationship between exercise and sleep. Sleeping medications such as Ambien and Lunesta are an increasingly popular treatment for insomnia. Although these nonbenzodiazepine medications are generally believed to be better and safer than earlier generations of sedatives, they have still generated some controversy and discussion regarding side-effects. White noise appears to be a promising treatment for insomnia.|$|E

25|$|Insulin is {{a hormone}} which helps {{regulate}} glucose {{levels in the}} body. When blood glucose is high, insulin is released from the Islets of Langerhans. Insulin, among other things, will then facilitate the uptake of glucose into cells via increased expression and translocation of glucose transporter GLUT-4. Under conditions of exercise, however, blood sugar levels are not necessarily high, and insulin is not necessarily activated, yet muscles are still able to bring in glucose. AMPK seems to be responsible in part for this exercise-induced glucose uptake. Goodyear et al. observed that with exercise, the concentration of GLUT-4 was increased in the plasma membrane, but decreased in the microsomal membranes, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>exercise</b> facilitates the translocation of vesicular GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane. While acute exercise increases GLUT-4 translocation, endurance training will increase {{the total amount of}} GLUT-4 protein available. It has been shown that both electrical contraction and AICAR treatment increase AMPK activation, glucose uptake, and GLUT-4 translocation in perfused rat hindlimb muscle, linking exercise-induced glucose uptake to AMPK. Chronic AICAR injections, simulating some of the effects of endurance training, also increase the total amount of GLUT-4 protein in the muscle cell.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{activity}} is body movement that works your muscles and requires {{more energy than}} resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims <b>that</b> <b>exercise</b> may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.|$|E

500|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy is}} currently the most effective clinical treatment for psychostimulant addictions. Additionally, research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running), prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct therapy (i.e., a supplemental treatment) for amphetamine addiction. Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions.There is accelerating evidence that physical exercise is a useful treatment for preventing and reducing drug addiction... In some individuals, exercise has its own rewarding effects, and a behavioral economic interaction may occur, such that physical and social rewards of exercise can substitute for the rewarding effects of drug abuse.... The value of this form of treatment for drug addiction in laboratory animals and humans is <b>that</b> <b>exercise,</b> if it can substitute for the rewarding effects of drugs, could be self-maintained {{over an extended period}} of time. Work to date in [...] regarding exercise as a treatment for drug addiction supports this hypothesis.... Animal and human research on physical exercise as a treatment for stimulant addiction indicates that this is one of the most promising treatments on the horizon.}} In particular, aerobic exercise decreases psychostimulant self-administration, reduces the reinstatement (i.e., relapse) of drug-seeking, and induces increased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) density in the striatum. This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use, which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density. [...] One review noted <b>that</b> <b>exercise</b> may also prevent the development of a drug addiction by altering ΔFosB or [...] immunoreactivity in the striatum or other parts of the reward system.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} {{returned to}} the England on 4 February 1943, and was placed {{under the command of}} XI Corps, and based in Essex. Between 4–12 March, the division participated in Exercise Spartan; the largest military exercise ever held in the United Kingdom. David French commented that the exercise [...] "was designed to analyse the problems that would arise after a force had landed on a hostile shore and was advancing from a bridgehead." [...] The exercise revealed weaknesses in elements of the senior leadership, in particular the officers in overall command of the armies deployed for the exercise, and highlighted the improvements made in general by the infantry. This was followed, in April and May, by exercise Jantzen. This was an administrative undertaking by the division and the headquarters of I Corps, aimed at improving the support techniques that would be used in the upcoming invasion of Europe. In May, the division was transferred to II Corps, and moved to Kent following-which Major-General Charles Wainwright took command, and was to remained {{until the end of the}} war. The division was earmarked for a role in Operation Overlord and Marcus Cunliffe wrote <b>that</b> <b>Exercise</b> Spartan [...] "seemed to be every indication that" [...] the division was to be a front-line unit. In September, the division, in conjunction with the 1st Polish Armoured Division, was placed under the control of II Canadian Corps for Exercise Link. In the months following the exercise, the division was relegated to 'Lower Establishment' status. This meant that the division was now to be strictly used for home defence in a static role compared to 'Higher Establishment' divisions that were intended for deployment overseas and combat. As part of this change in priorities, the division also became a training formation and one intended to find suitable replacements for fighting formations. By October, the division had also been assigned to anti-invasion duties in Kent. While based there, German cross-Channel guns periodically shelled the area, and in 1944 V-1 flying bombs became a minor issue. In December 1943, the division (reinforced, for the exercise, by the 31st Tank Brigade) played the defending force in Exercise Vulcan; a four-day training exercise aimed at improving the attacking process of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division.|$|E
