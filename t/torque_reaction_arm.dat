50|$|The Honda RC30 had a 'Pro Squat Rear Brake Linkage' {{that linked}} the rear caliper {{to the frame}} via a linkage through the swingarm, {{reducing}} rear wheel hop under braking. The NC30 had the swingarm machined to allow a torque arm shaft and featured the cast boss on the frame but the linkage was not fitted and the caliper was instead held in place with a simple <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> bolted into the swingarm.|$|E

50|$|The {{flat-twin}} engine in the 1897 Lanchester 8 hp phaeton had two counter-rotating crankshafts. Each piston {{was attached to}} one crankshaft by a thick connecting rod and to the other crankshaft by two thinner connecting rods, one {{on either side of}} the other piston's thick connecting rod. This allowed both cylinders to have the same axis. It also had the <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> of one crankshaft cancel the <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> of the other, cancelling <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> in the engine. The pistons in the Lanchester engine moved so that one piston was on top while the other was at bottom dead center, creating an uneven firing cycle. Lanchester used this engine design until 1904.|$|R

50|$|<b>Torque</b> <b>Reaction</b> - A variant on the thwackbot is the <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> hammer, {{also known}} as axlebots. These robots have two very large wheels with the small body of the robot hanging in between them. A long weapon boom has a {{vertically}} oriented hammer, pick, or axe on the end. On acceleration, the weapon boom swings upward and over {{to the rear of}} the robot to offset the motor torque. When the robot reverses direction, the weapon will swing forcibly back over the top and hopefully impact the opponent. These robots are simple and can put on a flashy, aggressive show, but their attack power is relatively small and, like thwackbots, they can be hard to control. BattleBots 2.0 middleweight champion Spaz was a <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> pickaxe robot, whilst Robot Wars Grand Finalist Stinger opted for a disc, later replaced with a bludgeoning mace.|$|R

50|$|This layout {{also allows}} the {{transmission}} and motor {{to be directly}} bolted to each other - with independent suspension on the driven wheels; this removes {{the need for the}} chassis to transfer engine <b>torque</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since 2014 it is {{possible}} to torque tighten bolts without the use of a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm,</b> and thus without pinch point. This is a great break-through in the industry. <b>Reaction</b> <b>arm</b> free <b>torqueing</b> {{is possible}} due to the usage of a reaction washer. The knurled side of the washer hold on to the construction/flange and the bolt or nut turn over a smooth and through-hardened surface. The reaction washer will become a stationary object underneath the nut, eliminating the use of <b>reaction</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R

50|$|The M.39 had {{features}} specializing it for Schneider Trophy competition. The course circuit required left turns, so {{the left}} wingtip was slightly {{farther from the}} fuselage than the right wingtip {{to allow it to}} make tighter left-hand turns.

5000|$|Paralever is {{a further}} advance in BMW's {{single-sided}} rear suspension technology (photo right). It decouples <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> as the suspension compresses and extends, avoiding the tendency to squat under braking and reducing tyre chatter on the road surface.

5000|$|Whereas a {{chain-driven}} bike would [...] "squat" [...] at {{the rear}} under acceleration, a shaft drive machine would do the opposite, causing the seat (and rider) to rise upwards, a phenomenon known as [...] "shaft-jacking". This anti-intuitive sensation can be disconcerting to riders, and parallelogram suspensions seek to neutralize such unwelcome <b>torque</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} hub gears, {{there is a}} <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> that must be countered if the {{internals}} are not to rotate, and this is routed to the bicycle’s frame by means of specially designed wheel dropout slots (OEM versions), or a torque bar bolted to the frame (EX) or the disc brake mount (DB).|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{flexibly}} mounted to isolate <b>torque</b> <b>reactions.</b> It was {{fitted with a}} statically and dynamically balanced three bearing crankshaft; big ends fitted with steel-backed white-metal liners; three bearing camshaft with steel-backed white-metal liners; air silencer; and automatic advance and vacuum control of the distributor with over-riding hand adjustment for varying grades of fuel.|$|R
50|$|Straight-twins {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being more compact, relatively simple, and cheaper to make in comparison to V- or flat-twins. They may be prone to vibration, either because of the irregular firing interval present in 180° crank engines or the large uncountered reciprocating mass in 360° crank engines. Inline-twins also suffer further from torsional <b>torque</b> <b>reactions</b> and vibration.|$|R

50|$|The hub axle of a {{hub gear}} (unlike {{that of a}} {{derailleur}} system) will carry torque in all gears except direct drive, and so must be securely braced against rotation. While anti-rotation washers between the dropout and axle nut have often proved adequate, wider-ranging modern systems use a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> affixed to the chain stay. Rear wheels with drum brakes (a feature on some commuter bicycles) require a <b>reaction</b> <b>arm</b> anyway.|$|R

50|$|Early {{flat-twin}} motorcycles' engines were {{mounted with}} the cylinders {{in line with}} the frame. This caused uneven cooling of the cylinders and required the motorcycle to have a long wheelbase. Later flat-twin motorcycles' engines were mounted with their cylinders across the frame for better air cooling and a shorter wheelbase. Disadvantages of this layout include <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> in the motorcycle in turns and the potential to damage cylinder heads.|$|R
40|$|Articulated {{payloads}} on spacecraft, such as antenna telemetry {{systems and}} robotic elements, impart <b>reaction</b> <b>torques</b> {{back into the}} vehicle which can significantly affect the performance of other payloads.

The effects of <b>reaction</b> <b>torques</b> encountered on Landsat are presented and compared with simulated and measured data of prototype systems employing these improvements...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{dynamics}} coupling between a free-floating base and a manipulator, the non-stationary {{base of a}} space robot will face the issue of base disturbance due to a manipulator’s motion. The <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acted on the satellite base’s centroid is an important index to measure the satellite base’s disturbance. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is made, and a novel way to derive the analytical form of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is proposed. In addition, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> null-space is derived, in which the manipulator’s joint motion is dynamically decoupled from {{the motion of the}} satellite base, and its novel expression demonstrates the equivalence between the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> null-space and the reaction null-space. Furthermore, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acted as an optimization index can be utilized to achieve satellite base disturbance minimization in the generalized Jacobian-based end-effector Cartesian path tracking task. Besides, supposing that the redundant degrees of freedom are abundant to achieve reaction torque-based active control, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> can be used to realize satellite base attitude control, that is, base attitude adjustment or maintenance. Moreover, because reaction torque-based control is a second-order control scheme, joint torque minimization can be regarded as the optimization task in reaction torque-based active or in-active control. A real-time simulation system of a 7 -DOF space robot under Linux/RTAI is developed to verify and test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed ideas. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that the corresponding analysis about the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is correct and the proposed methods are feasible...|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of this layout {{is that it}} exposes the cylinders and valve covers to the danger of collision damage. Longitudinal crankshaft mounting is also associated with a <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> that tends to twist the motorcycle to one side on sharp acceleration or when opening the throttle in neutral and {{in the opposite direction}} on sharp deceleration. Many modern motorcycle manufacturers correct for this effect by rotating flywheels or alternators in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft.|$|R
40|$|The joint has a rigid hub (3) mounted {{inside an}} annular rigid {{armature}} (2). A flexible material is interposed between the hub and the armature for ensuring certain clearance and filtration of vibrations. A breaker arm rubbing block (4) is disposed between the hub and the armature, and produces a dampening effect by alternation of adherence and sliding for {{the displacement of}} the hub and the armature along a longitudinal direction of a <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> rod (1) ...|$|R
50|$|The Project 371 team's final {{powertrain}} layout was a 1 L liquid-cooled, horizontally-opposed four-cylinder, SOHC engine, with a gear-driven generator at {{the back}} end of the crankshaft. Using gears to drive the generator caused it to spin backwards (relative to the crankshaft) and thus to counteract the engine <b>torque</b> <b>reaction.</b> Cylinder blocks and crankcase were integral, with the transmission situated below the crankcase to keep the unit construction engine as compact as possible. Final drive was by shaft.|$|R
