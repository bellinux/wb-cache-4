5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Revolution, the new {{government}} began persecuting the Church. To destroy the Church's influence over <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics {{that resulted in the}} deaths of thousands, including several priests who were also knights of Columbus. Known as <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> martyrs, these men have been canonized.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> {{government}} {{declared the}} region in Nayarit near the landfall of Kenna as a disaster area, allowing for the usage of emergency funds. Immediately {{after the passage of}} the hurricane, <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Red Cross prepared 180technical staff and volunteers from seven states to deliver 125MT of food, medicine, and clothes to the areas most affected. <b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> government deployed <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Army to the area to remove fallen trees and establish water treatment plants to assist the affected population. <b>The</b> <b>Mexican</b> Navy was sent to assist to support medical personnel in the San Blas area, and the government Department for Family Development assisted <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Red Cross in delivering food. Grupo Modelo, brewers of Corona beer, sent 6,600gallons (25,000liters) of drinking water and 1000food sets for the San Blas area.|$|E
5|$|After an {{erroneous}} scouting {{report of}} approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin {{to the ground}} on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property {{to keep it out}} of the hands of <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> army, and fled to the east.|$|E
50|$|On 19 November at 3 PM, 150 mounted Mexican men {{occupied}} La Somita.At sunset, <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> {{used their}} 6-pounder to fire upon the Americans along Main Street, which did little damage. <b>The</b> <b>Mexicans</b> were beaten back from {{an attack on}} the Mott house at 10 PM and the south end of Main street, <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> retiring only at daylight.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mexicans,</b> naturally, were {{fearful of}} the ever-encroaching Americans, and on several {{occasions}} feelings ran high between the suspicious neighbors. In 1828, for example, when the Miller County militia was called out to remove the Shawnees from Pecan Point, <b>Mexican</b> officials reminded <b>the</b> Arkansans that the area was claimed by Mexico. Arkansas Adjutant General Rector warned <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> not to interfere. Rector threatened to hang <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> officials [...] "on a tree by the neck like a dog." [...] Two years later <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> rubbed salt in the wounded pride of the Arkansans by threatening to move <b>Mexicans</b> settlers into <b>the</b> disputed Miller County area.|$|R

5|$|Following a coup in <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> government, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna became {{president}} and revoked many freedoms previously {{enjoyed by the}} Texans further deteriorating the government's relations with the region's settlers. Texas declared its independence and revolted in 1835.

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> War of Independence, the {{missions}} were secularized {{and the land}} taken by <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> government. In 1834, Lieutenant Antonio del Valle was assigned to inventory the property of Mission San Fernando. The rancho {{was supposed to be}} returned to the Tataviam, but Governor Alvarado deeded it to his friend Del Valle instead on January 22, 1839. The Del Valle family moved into the former estancia buildings (near what is now Castaic).|$|E

50|$|A {{large crowd}} {{gathered}} in El Paso, including John Hale and his friend, former town Marshal George Campbell. There was animosity among Americans about <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> being heavily armed {{within the city}} limit, {{but at the same}} time tensions were high among <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans,</b> who wanted justice for their two young men who had been killed. Constable Krempkau was fluent in Spanish and was inquired to interpret for the judge. An inquest was held in court. The court was adjourned and the crowd dispersed. <b>The</b> <b>Mexicans,</b> bringing <b>the</b> two bodies, quietly rode back to Mexico.|$|R

5|$|Given the {{superficial}} {{similarities between the}} two flags, the Italian flag and <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> flag have been compared over time. However, the Italian tricolour actually uses lighter shades of green and red and the two have different aspect ratios; the Italian flag's aspect ratio is 2:3, while <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> flag's aspect ratio of 4:7 results in a more elongated rectangular shape. When Italy became a republic in 1946, <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> naval ensign was a plain tricolour; for this reason, on demand of the international naval authorities, Italy could not adopt a sole national flag similar to France as it wished.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{that more}} {{settlers}} {{would reduce the}} near-constant Comanche raids, Mexican Texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain. Under <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> immigration system, large swathes of land were allotted to empresarios, who recruited settlers from the United States, Europe, and <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> interior. The first grant, to Moses Austin, was passed to his son Stephen F. Austin after his death.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, CMLL left the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) but {{retained}} {{control of the}} NWA World Welterweight Championship as their main championship of the welterweight division. They also promoted <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> National Welterweight Championship as a secondary title for the Welterweight division. In 1991 they decided to create a series of CMLL-branded world championships, {{one of which was}} for the welterweight division. They held a four-man tournament on February 15, 1992, to crown the first welterweight champion. The participants were Fuerza Guerrera, El Felino, América and El Khalifa; in the finals, Fuerza Guerrera defeated El Khalifa to become the first champion. On July 16, 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> National Welterweight Champion defeated CMLL Welterweight Champion América, vacating <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> National Welterweight Championship.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mexicans</b> and natives were repulsed {{but soon}} regrouped and {{assaulted}} the American position.

60|$|Ralph retreated, {{and none}} too soon, {{for a second}} later several bullets entered the window and buried {{themselves}} in the wall opposite. <b>The</b> <b>Mexicans</b> were firing from several roofs in the neighbourhood.

5|$|The siege {{culminated in}} an early-morning assault by Mexican troops which left {{almost all of}} the {{defenders}} dead. Some reports claimed that several Texians surrendered but were quickly executed on Santa Anna's orders. Of the Texians who fought during the battle, only two survived: Travis's slave, Joe, was assumed by <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> soldiers to be a noncombatant, and Brigido Guerrero, who had deserted from <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Army several months before, convinced <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> soldiers that he had been taken prisoner by the Texians. Alamo co-commander James Bowie's freedman, Sam, was also spared, although it is not known if he participated in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{towns of}} Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned {{to keep them}} out of the hands of <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> army. Santa Anna was intent on {{executing}} members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco.|$|E
