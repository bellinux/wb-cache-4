Like that study, the current study suggests that in stable intertrochanteric fractures a distal interlocking screw is likely unnecessary for torsional stability. Caution must be taken when applying this study to clinical practice, as the lesser trochanter in our 3 -part fracture model was held loosely in place, making it by definition a stable fracture. In order to clinically replicate the conditions of this study, the calcar region of the neck and proximal femur would have to be reduced in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a <b>stable</b> fracture pattern.

However, this algorithm needs an entropy fix to avoid nonsmoothness in the expansion regions. The entropy conservation equation is used as a guideline to introduce an optimal numerical diffusion in the smooth regions and a limiter based switchover is introduced for numerical diffusion based on jump conditions at the large gradients. The resulting new scheme is entropy stable, accurate and captures steady discontinuities exactly while avoiding an entropy fix. Comment: 17 pages, 51 figures, Journal articl...|$|R

In contrast to traditional switching architectures where the scheduler is implemented by one single centralized scheduling device, the proposed architecture connects several single scheduling devices in series and a distributed scheduling algorithm is run sequentially on them, whereby the inputs of each single scheduling device build connections {{to a group}} of outputs, considering both their local transmission requests as well as global outputs availability information. We show that a pipeline pattern can be used to increase the efficiency of the scheduling scheme with scheduling algorithms running in parallel on all the separate scheduling devices. We first introduce a distributed parallel round robin scheduling algorithm (DPRR) for the proposed architecture. Through the analysis of simulation results on various admissible traffics, it is shown that the performance of DPRR is much better than, or very close to the performance of, other round robin scheduling algorithms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel scalable scheduling architecture for high-performance crossbar-based switches with virtual output queuing (VOQ) scheme. In contrast to traditional switching architectures where the scheduler is implemented by one single centralized scheduling device, the proposed scheduling architecture connects several small scheduling devices in series and the arbitration algorithm is executed in parallel. Thereby the inputs of each single scheduling device establish connections {{to a group}} of outputs, by considering both their local transmission requests as well as global outputs availability information. The advantage of this architecture lies in its ability to implement large schedulers (> 64) with several small scheduling devices as well as in its capability to achieve high-performance scheduling.

Through the analysis of simulation results on various admissible traffics, it is shown that the performance of DPRR is much better than the performance of other round robin scheduling algorithms commonly used on centralized schedulers.

This report will validate various models, including a state space model, based on the data collected from the Yamaha R- 50 and find a best-fit model to use in the process of control synthesis so that a better control system for the UAVs could be created.

The aim of this thesis is to present an analysis of how torque modulation can be used to mitigate the longitudinal vibrations felt by the passengers in the vehicle when it is subjected to impacts through speed lowering obstacles. A study is performed to understand how road disturbances are inducing longitudinal vibrations and forces in the wheel assembly. The typical behaviour of the system is analysed in order {{to come up with a}} solution on the problem. The study has mainly been performed in a simulation environment using Simpack as MBS software and the vehicle model has been validated through proving ground tests. In order to enable torque modulation when the vehicle is subjected to an impact, a hypothetical controller is created in Simulink and co-simulated with Simpack. The results show improvement in lowering the high seat rail acceleration peaks of impact harshness although there is room for improvement regarding the controller <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more <b>stable</b> and robust.
