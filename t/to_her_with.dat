After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick {{from his pocket and}} hands it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E
60|$|There were a {{few moments}} of stillness. Then gradually, the tension, the {{withholding}} relaxed in him, and he began <b>to</b> flow towards <b>her.</b> She was beyond him, the unattainable. But he let go his hold on himself, he relinquished himself, and knew the subterranean force of his desire <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>to</b> be <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> <b>to</b> mingle <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> losing himself <b>to</b> find <b>her,</b> <b>to</b> find himself in <b>her.</b> He began <b>to</b> approach <b>her,</b> <b>to</b> draw near.|$|R

25|$|After Sartre died in 1980, de Beauvoir {{published}} his letters <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> edits {{to spare the}} feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After de Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have de Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. De Beauvoir's adopted daughter and literary heir Sylvie Le Bon, unlike Elkaïm, published de Beauvoir's unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.|$|E

Winick proposed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> a cartoon he made for the occasion, and which he presented to her while wearing a gorilla suit. The cartoon presented Ling with two choices to answer his proposal. After she accepted his proposal, he summoned three singing Elvises. Winick and Ling married in a civil ceremony on August 26, 2001. Writer Armistead Maupin spoke at their ceremony. As of 2008, they have two children, {{a son and a}} daughter, whom they work to keep out of the spotlight, preferring to omit photos of them from social media, and publications who interview the couple to omit their names.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Swan Lake {{was based}} on the story of Ondine, a German myth with a theme common in Romanticism that was adapted by Hans Christian Andersen for his story The Little Mermaid. Ondine was a beautiful and immortal water nymph. The only threat to her eternal happiness was if {{she fell in love with}} a mortal and bore his child, as she would then lose her immortality. Ondine duly fell in love with a dashing knight, Sir Lawrence, and they were married, the knight pledging unfailing love and faithfulness <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> his every waking breath. A year after their wedding Ondine bore Lawrence a son. From that moment she began to age. As Ondine’s beauty faded, Lawrence lost interest in her.|$|E

He approaches Plunder Island, which is governed by his love Elaine Marley and under siege by the zombie pirate LeChuck. LeChuck captures him and locks him in the ship's hold. Seeking a way out, Guybrush fires an unrestrained cannon (causing LeChuck to drop a magical voodoo cannonball and explode), finds a diamond ring in the treasure hold, and escapes the ship as it sinks. He reunites with Elaine and proposes <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> the diamond ring. However, the ring is revealed to be cursed, and when Elaine puts it on she {{is transformed into a}} gold statue and stolen by marauders.|$|E
500|$|This episode also {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of the Welsh actress Margaret John as Old Nan. 84-year-old Margaret John died on 2 February 2011, {{a few months after}} having finished recording her scenes in Game of Thrones, which was her last role on television. With a 50-year acting career, she is remembered for her role of Doris on the BBC television show Gavin and Stacy. Executive producers David Benioff and Dan Weiss issued a statement grieving her death.

500|$|Elizabeth's reign saw the {{emergence}} of Puritanism, which encompassed those Protestants who, whilst they agreed {{that there should be}} one national church, felt that the church had been but partially reformed. Puritanism ranged from hostility to the content of the Prayer Book and [...] "popish" [...] ceremony, to a desire that church governance be radically reformed. Grindal was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1575 and chose to oppose even the Queen in his desire to forward the Puritan agenda. He ended a 6,000-word reproach <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with,</b> [...] "Bear with me, I beseech you Madam, if I choose rather to offend your earthly majesty than to offend the heavenly majesty of God." [...] He was placed under house arrest for his trouble and though he was not deprived, his death in 1583 {{put an end to the}} hopes of his supporters.|$|E

500|$|In 1926, Roosevelt mailed Rutherfurd {{a copy of}} {{his first}} public lecture after his [...] 1921 paralytic illness, privately {{dedicating}} it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> an inscription. At his first memorable presidential inauguration on March 4, 1933, Roosevelt made arrangements for Rutherfurd to attend and witness his swearing-in. When her husband later suffered a stroke, she contacted Roosevelt to arrange for him to be cared for at well-regarded Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Historian/author Doris Kearns Goodwin speculated that an entry in the White House ushers diary for August 1, 1941 included a code name for Lucy Rutherfurd, suggesting that she attended a private dinner with the president then. After her husband's death when the two began seeing each other more occasionally, Rutherfurd also arranged for her friend Elizabeth Shoumatoff, (1888–1980), a well-known artist, to paint Roosevelt's portrait.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Nettles had an eye surgically removed as {{a result}} of cancer {{diagnosed}} several years earlier. She lived for two more years, dying in 1985. Applewhite told their followers that she had [...] "traveled to the Next Level" [...] because she had [...] "too much energy to remain on Earth", abandoning her body to make the journey. His attempt to explain her death in the terms of the group's doctrine was successful, preventing the departure of all but one member. Applewhite became very depressed. He claimed that Nettles still communicated with him, but he suffered from a crisis of faith. His students supported him during this time, greatly encouraging him. He then organized a ceremony in which he symbolically married his followers; Lalich views this as an attempt to ensure unity. Applewhite told his followers that he had been left behind by Nettles because he still had more to learn—he felt that she occupied [...] "a higher spiritual role" [...] than he did. He began identifying her as [...] "the Father" [...] and often referred <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> male pronouns.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the bear}} was dressed {{and in the}} chair, the {{audience}} would be allowed into the tent. The showman would tell the audience that the Pig-faced Lady could not speak, but would answer questions put <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>with</b> one grunt for [...] "yes" [...] and two for [...] "no". The audience would ask her questions, {{and a member of}} the crew would poke the bear with a stick to make it grunt in reply. The Pig-faced Lady would then eat a meal of gruel, beer and apples, served in a silver trough. The display of [...] "pig-faced ladies" [...] became extremely popular, to the extent that by 1861 Charles Dickens remarked that [...] "no fair was complete without one". Exhibitions of this type were particularly popular in Dublin; an exhibition in Plymouth in the 1880s was less successful, and a disbelieving mob pulled the wig and hat from a [...] "Pig-faced Lady" [...] in her tent and proceeded to attack the showmen. The fate of the bear is not recorded.|$|E

500|$|Sometimes, Mary and George {{appear to}} have been distant parents. At first, they failed to notice the nanny's abuse of the young Princes Edward and Albert, and their {{youngest}} son, Prince John, was housed in a private farm on the Sandringham Estate, in Bill's care, perhaps to hide his epilepsy from the public. However, despite Mary's austere public image and her strait-laced private life, Mary was a caring mother in many respects, revealing a fun-loving and frivolous side to her children and teaching them history and music. Edward wrote fondly of his mother in his memoirs: [...] "Her soft voice, her cultivated mind, the cosy room overflowing with personal treasures were all inseparable ingredients of the happiness associated with this last hour of a child's day... Such was my mother's pride in her children that everything that happened to each one was of the utmost importance <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>With</b> the birth of each new child, Mama started an album in which she painstakingly recorded each progressive stage of our childhood". He expressed a less charitable view, however, in private letters to his wife after his mother's death: [...] "My sadness was mixed with incredulity that any mother could have been so hard and cruel towards her eldest son for so many years and yet so demanding at the end without relenting a scrap. I'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death." ...|$|E
500|$|During Leopold's illness {{performances}} were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According {{to the writer}} and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J.C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, [...] "an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [...] contemporaries". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical [...] "Symphony No. 0" [...] from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> an appropriate inscription in January 1765. Wolfgang also wrote his first vocal works, the motet [...] "God is our Refuge", K. 20, and the tenor aria Va, dal furor portata, K. 21.|$|E
