500|$|When it was renewed for {{a second}} season, Veronica Mars became the lowest-rated show in network history to be renewed and the only UPN drama from the 2004-05 {{television}} season to be renewed. Starting in the second season, Veronica Mars was moved to Wednesday nights, placing it in direct competition with ABC's popular Lost. Rob Thomas said that, [...] "I wish the juggernaut that is Lost wasn't our direct competition." [...] At the same time, Veronica Mars was placed after UPN's America's Next Top Model. On {{the date of the}} airing of this episode, Bell and Thomas talked to The New York Times, where Thomas commented, [...] "We let Veronica say things <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all day to think about it, would be the perfect retort." ...|$|E
500|$|Half of {{the first}} day's footage came out {{overexposed}} and unusable. Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming {{would come out of}} the director's own pocket. Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget. The director operated the camera himself in an effort to [...] "get as close to the movie as I can," [...] and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself. Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of Ken Loach's films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, [...] "I noticed that there's a space that's inviolate, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> within something, you cross the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic". Most of the day was spent shooting {{because a lot of the}} film was shot with available light.|$|E
2500|$|Cast members eagerly {{accepted}} upon first being approached. Lumet went to Sean Connery first, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> {{the biggest}} star, {{the rest will}} come along. Bergman was initially offered the role of Princess Dragomiroff, but instead requested to play Greta Ohlsson. Lumet said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You used to {{care about}} it,--very much. You used to say <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>get</b> to the top it shouldn't be your own fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow me to hint to <b>you,</b> Archer, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could <b>get</b> {{some food}} and drink for these ladies, instead of {{discussing}} my personal appearance, {{it would be much}} more practical." ...|$|R
2500|$|In April 2013, Womack {{said of her}} departure, [...] "I {{think it}} was {{definitely}} {{the right time to}} give the character a break. The danger is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> one character who is subject to so much trauma, angst and depression, it becomes difficult to play it realistically." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{am going}} to make you go to church. You'll be a socialist or {{something}} like <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to be too much of a poet and don't--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> {{the police}} here at once, Jonas, we shall find both the thief and the loot under our very roof," [...] she replied, not without asperity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, flushing. [...] "Allow me to hint to <b>you,</b> Archer, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could <b>get</b> some {{food and drink}} for these ladies, instead of {{discussing}} my personal appearance, {{it would be much}} more practical." ...|$|R
50|$|Players cannot seem to {{coordinate}} mutual cooperation, thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection. In this way, iterated rounds facilitate {{the evolution of}} stable strategies. Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies, which have implications to complex social interaction. One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift. This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy - <b>that</b> is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> away with cheating, repeat <b>that</b> behavior, however <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> caught, switch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nearly fifty dollars," [...] {{said his}} father; [...] "and {{what can you}} do with all <b>that</b> money, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it? O, no, Hibby; I can't let you have any money for that. And besides, these lotteries, and the betting about the run of the ship, are as bad as gambling. They are gambling, in fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Lewisham remembered certain advice Dunkerley {{had given}} him in the old Whortley days. He hesitated. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "I don't pay <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> me {{anything}} there's the commission--if you don't--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not easily," [...] replied Kenneth with a laugh; [...] "but I {{was going}} to say <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it {{invested}} at five per cent, that would give you an income of five hundred pounds a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] said Jim Leonard. [...] "But what I mean is, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> {{hurt you}} mustn't hollo, or cry, or anything; {{and even when}} they're {{scalping}} you, you mustn't even make a face, so as {{to let them know}} that you feel it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's new to me--that driver--an' I ain't trustin' any new men these days," [...] went on Anderson. [...] "Here now, Dorn. Read <b>that.</b> An' <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>get</b> red-headed--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does <b>that</b> matter, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> foxes?" [...] {{continued}} the Master. [...] "But the fact is, gentlemen {{in a county}} like this always want to have everything done for them, and never {{to do anything for}} themselves. I'm sick of it, I know. Nobody is fonder of hunting a country than I am, and I think I know what I'm about." ...|$|R
2500|$|There is also {{an ongoing}} debate about the {{influence}} of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. [...] "The worry is <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> all <b>that</b> information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?" [...] said Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at UEA and author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot: the Last Victorian.|$|R
6000|$|Rowland {{shook him}} by the hand. [...] "Willingly. Do as you desire, I shall miss you, and I venture to believe you 'll pass some lonely hours. But I have only one request to make: <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into trouble of any kind whatever, you will {{immediately}} let me know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another {{advantage}} of being a good shot--I mean a really good shot--is <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> forced into an affair, and are desirous of giving a lesson, but no more, to an opponent, you have it in your power to wing him; whereas, if you are only a tolerably good shot, you can't pick your spot, and may--to your lasting regret--kill him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count upon you for, Mr. Carter?" [...] Mr. Carter's lips twitched slightly, but he replied succinctly: [...] "Funds within reason, {{detailed}} information on any point, and NO OFFICIAL RECOGNITION. I mean <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> yourselves into trouble with the police, I can't officially help you out of it. You're on your own." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, Penn State {{head coach}} Joe Paterno said of Randle El, [...] "He {{is just the}} whole offense. It is scary to watch him. He is so quick <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>get</b> on him and you {{wait for him to}} pitch the ball, he will take off on you. He is just an amazing athlete. I don't know how <b>you</b> <b>get</b> ready for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} be too sanguine, Dick. It is just possible, dear boy, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> all goes well you may be back as you say, in forty-eight hours, but we will make up our minds to twice <b>that</b> time. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> here sooner, all the better; but I don't expect that they will hit us, and after tiring a bit the chances are they will not care to waste ammunition, and will try to starve us out." ...|$|R
6000|$|The officer {{advanced}} and grasped his hand warmly. [...] "I am glad indeed to see you," [...] he said; [...] "Skinner is my subaltern, and has often spoken {{to me of}} what he considered your hopeless journey {{to try to find}} your brother, and said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did <b>get</b> through it alive you were as likely as not to turn up here. I congratulate you indeed. Have you been successful?" [...] and he looked doubtfully at Rupert's companions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I should say, Herrara, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> no {{orders to}} join in the pursuit, you had best get all the wounded {{collected}} and brought here, and let the regiment light fires and bivouac. There is no chance of getting medical assistance, outside the regiment, tonight. Of course, all the British surgeons will have their hands full with their own men. Still, I only suggest this, for of course you are now in command." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{are some}} one-grain quinine capsules," [...] she said. [...] "They have no taste, and I am quite sure <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into a low country {{it would be}} a good thing for you to take at least one of them every morning. People may have given you all sorts of things for your journey, but I do not believe any one has given you this." [...] And she handed me the box over the top of the gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "And a great many. Couldn't we get Sir Gregory Grogram?" [...] Mr. Low {{shook his}} head. [...] "I {{know very well}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> men who are really,--really swells, for {{that is what it}} is, Mr. Low,--and pay them well enough, and so make it really an {{important}} thing, they can browbeat any judge and hoodwink any jury. I daresay it is very dreadful to say so, Mr. Low; but, nevertheless, I believe it, and as this man is certainly innocent it ought to be done. I daresay it's very shocking, but I do think that twenty thousand pounds spent among the lawyers would get him off." ...|$|E
5000|$|And {{somehow they}} are, eventually. [...] "Somewhere on the Other Side" [...] {{is built on}} the hope <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> through the hard part, things do get better. [...] "I wrote that {{in the depths of}} despair," [...] says Day. [...] "It's almost like an early American Quaker spiritual. I was just trying to remind myself <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I could make it through this, there would be a sacred place that I could get to on the other side.” ...|$|R
2500|$|On 27 May, Spence sent four UVF {{members to}} kill IRA {{volunteer}} Leo Martin, {{who lived in}} Belfast. Unable to find their target, the men drove around the Falls district {{in search of a}} Catholic. They shot John Scullion, a Catholic civilian, as he walked home. He died of his wounds on 11 June. Spence later wrote [...] "At the time, the attitude was <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> couldn't <b>get</b> an IRA man you should shoot a Taig, he's your last resort".|$|R
6000|$|... "I do, very much, and I shall go {{back into}} the garden and take another mouthful. I came thus far simply to say this. I told <b>you</b> last year <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to <b>get</b> into trouble I should feel terribly sold. That's how I feel to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{will be more}} {{precious}} to you, I think, in the practical study of art, than the conviction, which will force itself on you more and more every hour, of the way all things are bound together, little and great, in spirit and in matter. So <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> once the right clue to any group of them, it will grasp the simplest, yet reach to the highest truths. You know I have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire. Now, down to the least detail of method and subject, that will hold.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{all very}} well to say [...] "drink me," [...] "but I'll look first," [...] said the wise little Alice, [...] "and see whether the bottle's marked [...] "poison" [...] or not," [...] for Alice had read several nice little stories about {{children}} that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had given them, such as, <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into the fire, it will burn you, and that, if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she had never forgotten that, if you drink a bottle marked [...] "poison," [...] it {{is almost certain to}} disagree with you, sooner or later.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} have a letter written to our landlady, inclosing the sum due to her and a week's rent in advance; and {{say that we are}} hastily called away to Blaye, but may return in a few days, and begging her to keep the rooms vacant for a week, for which you leave the money. You had better write the letter at once, so <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> my message you can leave instantly. There is nothing like being {{prepared}} for everything. Of course the arrest of the Flambards would not really affect us in any way, or add to our danger; but if the coachman were to hear of it before we got there, he might disregard his master's orders, and return at once with the carriage." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, {{the charity}} {{introduced}} a U.S. Libraries initiative {{with a goal}} of [...] "ensuring <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> to a public library, you can reach the internet". Only 35% of the world's population {{has access to the}} Internet. The foundation has given grants, installed computers and software, and provided training and technical support in partnership with public libraries nationwide in an effort to increase access and knowledge. Helping provide access and training for these resources, this foundation helps move public libraries into the digital age.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since you insist," [...] replied Hunter. [...] "To begin with, {{we propose}} {{to start the}} creamery {{for the benefit of}} the stock-raising farmers in this district, and several things lead me to believe <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> once <b>get</b> your grip on the {{management}} it will in process of time be run for your benefit exclusively. That is one reason I voted against your scheme, and I'm rather glad the decision rested with me, because"--he paused a moment--"I, at least, don't owe you any money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay ay," [...] she muttered, [...] "it {{would have}} bin strange <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hadn't wished that; you was always up to mischief, Tommy; always; or else wishin' {{to be up}} to it, {{although}} you might know as well as I know myself, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did <b>get</b> leave to go hout to the Rock (which you're for ever wantin' to do), it would be wet feet an dirty pinafores mornin', noon, an' night, which it's little you care for that, you bad boy, though it causes me no end of washin' an' dryin',--ay ay!" ...|$|R
