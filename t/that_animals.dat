5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> from Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands. Such a difference in size {{might be related to}} the fact that Saint Kitts is larger than Nevis, in accordance with the trend <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> become larger on larger islands. However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences in the mode of exploitation by Amerindians.|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{following}} well-worn example, first {{put forward by}} Fred Dretske. You’re at the zoo, and in the pen {{in front of you}} is a striped horse-like animal. The sign on the pen says “Zebra. ” Assuming <b>that</b> <b>animal</b> really is a zebra, it would seem that your evidence is perfectly adequate to enable you to know that it’s a zebra. So you know: (ZEBRA- 1) <b>That</b> <b>animal</b> is a zebra. Now what about the claim <b>that</b> this <b>animal</b> is just a mule painted to look like a zebra? You know <b>that</b> if the <b>animal</b> is a zebra, it isn’t a mule, and a fortiori it isn’t a cleverlydisguised mule. Hence, you know: (ZEBRA- 2) If <b>that</b> <b>animal</b> is a zebra, it isn’t a cleverly-disguised mule. But are you really in a position to know: (ZEBRA- 3) <b>That</b> <b>animal</b> isn’t a cleverly-disguised mule? You may have some reason to believe ZEBRA- 3. Zoos don’t typically try to fool people like that; they have security systems to keep out pranksters; and so on. But your evidence doesn’t seem to be good enough to know <b>that</b> the <b>animal</b> in the pen is not a cleverlydisguised mule. You haven’t made any special tests, or anything like that. So Dretske thinks you don’t know it. But he still wants to say that, as long as the possibility <b>that</b> the <b>animal</b> is a cleverly-disguised mule is not a relevant epistemic possibility, you can kno...|$|R
5|$|There are {{no reports}} of {{dopamine}} in archaea, {{but it has been}} detected in some types of bacteria and in the protozoan called Tetrahymena. Perhaps more importantly, there are types of bacteria that contain homologs of all the enzymes <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> use to synthesize dopamine. It has been proposed <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria, via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time, perhaps {{as a result of the}} symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria.|$|E

5|$|As a boy, Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) {{read the}} Comte de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle from the {{previous}} century, as well as Linnaeus and Fabricius. He was brought to Paris by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1795, {{not long after the}} French Revolution. He soon became a professor of animal anatomy at the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, surviving changes of government from revolutionary to Napoleonic to monarchy. Essentially on his own he created the discipline of vertebrate palaeontology and the accompanying comparative method. He demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> had become extinct.|$|E

5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} the claim <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, {{as they are}} fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E
5|$|The {{obsession}} {{led him to}} deny <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> {{could be}} colored for other reasons: for protection by mimicry, as the naturalist Henry Walter Bates had proposed, supported by many examples of butterflies from South America; through sexual selection, as Charles Darwin had argued, again supported by many observations. The unbalanced treatment of animal coloration in Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom encapsulates Thayer's partial understanding and his rejection of other theories.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|During {{a renewed}} {{investigation}} of the crime in 2005, the Department of Justice exhumed Till's remains to conduct an autopsy and DNA analysis which confirmed the identification of his body. Till was reburied in a new casket later that year. In 2009, his original glass-topped casket was found, rusting in a dilapidated storage shed at the cemetery. The casket was discolored and the interior fabric torn. It bore evidence <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> {{had been living in}} it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. acquired the casket a month later. According to director Lonnie Bunch III, it is an artifact with the potential to stop future visitors and make them think.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, he {{starred in}} {{supporting}} roles in Year of the Dog and Rendition. Year of the Dog {{is a dark}} comedy about a lonely middle-aged woman, played by Molly Shannon, who finds <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> are the only beings she can truly rely on. Sarsgaard plays Newt, an androgynous dog trainer, and love interest for Shannon's character. He starred alongside Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin, Reese Witherspoon, and Jake Gyllenhaal in Rendition, a Gavin Hood-directed political thriller about the US policy of extraordinary rendition. Viewed as a sex symbol, Sarsgaard was named one of Salon.com's Sexiest Man Living in 2007. 2008 saw Sarsgaard star in the drama Elegy, based on a Phillip Roth novel, The Dying Animal. The film received favorable good reception amongst critics.|$|E

5|$|In Cuvier's {{landmark}} 1796 {{paper on}} living and fossil elephants, {{he referred to}} a single catastrophe that destroyed life {{to be replaced by}} the current forms. As a result of his studies of extinct mammals, he realized <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> such as Palaeotherium had lived before the time of the mammoths, which led him to write in terms of multiple geological catastrophes that had wiped out a series of successive faunas. By 1830, a scientific consensus had formed around his ideas as a result of paleobotany and the dinosaur and marine reptile discoveries in Britain. In Great Britain, where natural theology was very influential in the early 19th century, a group of geologists that included Buckland, and Robert Jameson insisted on explicitly linking the most recent of Cuvier's catastrophes to the biblical flood. Catastrophism had a religious overtone in Britain that was absent elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, the {{systematic}} study of fossils emerged {{as an integral part}} of the changes in natural philosophy that occurred during the Age of Reason. In the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci made various significant contributions to the field as well designed numerous fossils. At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific discipline and, by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> could become extinct, leading to the emergence of paleontology. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E

5|$|It is {{one thing}} to say that a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E

In the United States, nativity scenes on public lands and in public buildings have provoked court challenges, and the prankish theft of ceramic or plastic nativity figurines from outdoor displays has become commonplace.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt was a well-publicized nature-enthusiast, {{known for}} his grand hunting expeditions. While he admired the natural world, and the animals who {{inhabited}} it, he believed <b>that</b> <b>animals</b> served a singular purpose: to satisfy human needs, especially {{in the name of}} progress. Roosevelt had been following the debate in newspaper articles and magazines with great interest, and as a result he became a friend and confidant of John Burroughs; shortly after Burroughs' first article condemning popular nature writers as sham naturalists, Roosevelt sent him a letter of support as well as an invitation to travel west in each other's company. In April 1903, Roosevelt and Burroughs explored Yellowstone National Park and its surrounding areas together.|$|E
