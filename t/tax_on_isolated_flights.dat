50|$|From {{a period}} {{spanning}} the seventeenth {{to the beginning}} of the nineteenth centuries, the expansion of the Welsh population combined with poverty brought about a series of incidents of squatting <b>on</b> <b>isolated</b> patches of land in the most rural parts of Wales. The practice arose because of the pressure of the lack of land due to the land enclosures of the period, and the taxation laws established by landowners. Family units paid <b>taxes</b> based <b>on</b> the land they inhabited, so families with adult and married children faced either paying additional <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> a second home, even if it was on the same land.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we make an {{analysis}} of the major aspects concerning the budgets of the EU countries. On this paper we focus <b>on</b> the main <b>taxes</b> of the 27 EU countries. Our analysis concerns the direct taxes and indirect taxes. Direct taxes have the following structure: current <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> income and <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> capital. Current <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> income are made up of: <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> income and other current <b>taxes.</b> <b>Taxes</b> <b>on</b> income consist of <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> personal income and the <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the revenue or profit of companies. Indirect taxes consist of: <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production and imports, which in turn are composed of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production and other <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production. The <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production consist of: Value Added <b>Tax,</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> imports excluding VAT and <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> production excluding VAT and duties. Analysis of main trends of taxation in the European Union countries will be achieved by calculating several indicators, namely: fixed-base indices, chain-based indices, minimum, maximum, average, percentages and percentages of total GDP. </p...|$|R
