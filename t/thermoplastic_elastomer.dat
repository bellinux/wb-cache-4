50|$|<b>Thermoplastic</b> <b>elastomers</b> (TPE), {{sometimes}} referred to as thermoplastic rubbers, are a class of copolymers or a physical mix of polymers (usually a plastic and a rubber) which consist of materials with both thermoplastic and elastomeric properties. While most <b>elastomers</b> are thermosets, <b>thermoplastics</b> are in contrast relatively easy to use in manufacturing, for example, by injection molding. <b>Thermoplastic</b> <b>elastomers</b> show advantages typical of both rubbery materials and plastic materials. The benefit of using <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>elastomers</b> is the ability to stretch to moderate elongations and return to its near original shape creating a longer life and better physical range than other materials. The principal difference between thermoset <b>elastomers</b> and <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>elastomers</b> is the type of cross-linking bond in their structures. In fact, crosslinking is a critical structural factor which imparts high elastic properties.|$|R
30|$|Synthetic {{elastomers}} can {{be divided}} into two categories: <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>elastomers</b> and cross-linked elastomers, based on the type of ‘cross-link’ used to join their molecular chains. Unlike cross-linked elastomers, where the cross-link is a covalent bond created during the vulcanization process, the cross-link in <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>elastomers</b> is a weaker dipole or hydrogen bond,or takes place in one of the phases of the material. Linear <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>elastomers</b> usually consist of two separated microphases: crystalline, hydrogen-bonded hard segments and amorphous soft segments. The crystalline or hard segments function as cross-linkers which provide mechanical strength and stiffness, whereas soft segments provide the flexibility (Hiki et al. [2000]).|$|R
