5000|$|Drum <b>hoists</b> are <b>the</b> {{most common}} type of hoist used in North America, South Africa and South America. When using a drum <b>hoist</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoisting</b> cable is wound around the drum when the {{conveyance}} is lifted. Single-drum hoists can be used in smaller applications, however double-drum <b>hoists</b> easily allow <b>the</b> <b>hoisting</b> of two conveyances in balance (i.e. one skip being lifted while a second skip is being lowered). [...] Drum hoists are mounted on concrete slabs within a hoistroom, <b>the</b> <b>hoisting</b> ropes run from the drum, {{up to the top of}} the headframe, over a sheave wheel and down where they connect to the conveyance (cage or skip).|$|R
5|$|The flag {{does not}} differ {{significantly}} from {{the flag of the}} Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star, and the reversal of red and white in <b>the</b> <b>hoist</b> pattern. While there is no official interpretation for the colors of the flag, an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation's forefathers, while green represents life.|$|E
5|$|A {{decorative}} pattern, {{designed in}} 1917 by Matrena Markevich, is displayed on <b>the</b> <b>hoist</b> {{of the flag}} (as it was previously, on the 1951 flag). The pattern, derived from local plants and flowers, is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus. These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments, most importantly in the traditional 'rushnyk', a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services, funerals, and other more mundane social functions, such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a rushnyk.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag {{has been in}} use since June 7, 1995, one of two symbols adopted in the 1995 referendum. The main elements of the flag is a red and green bicolor, then decorated with an ornament pattern at <b>the</b> <b>hoist</b> position. The current flag is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle was placed near the top-hoist corner and the ornament colors were inverted. Several flags used by government officials and agencies {{were based on the}} {{national flag}}.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} Belarusian dress originates {{from the}} Kievan Rus' period. Due to the cool climate, clothes {{were designed to}} preserve body heat and were usually made from flax or wool. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns. One ornamental pattern common in early dresses currently decorates <b>the</b> <b>hoist</b> of the Belarusian national flag, adopted in a disputed referendum in 1995.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} {{variant of}} the sun disc design is the sun disc with 16 red rays in a Siemens star formation, which was also historically used by Japan's military, particularly the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ensign, known in Japanese as the , was first adopted as the War flag on May 15, 1870, and was used {{until the end of}} World WarII in 1945. It was re-adopted on June 30, 1954, and is now used as the war flag and naval ensign of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). In Korea and China, this flag still carries a negative connotation. The JMSDF also employs the use of a masthead pennant. First adopted in 1914 and readopted in 1965, the masthead pennant contains a simplified version of the naval ensign at <b>the</b> <b>hoist</b> end, {{with the rest of the}} pennant colored white. The ratio of the pennant is between 1:40 and 1:90.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, President Lukashenko {{issued a}} decree {{granting}} a flag to the Armed Forces of Belarus. The flag, {{which has a}} ratio of 1:1.7, has the national ornamental pattern {{along the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>hoist</b> side of the flag. On the front of the flag is the Belarusian coat of arms, with the wording УЗБРОЕНЫЯ СІЛЫ ("Armed Forces") arched over it, and РЭСПУБЛІКІ БЕЛАРУСЬ ("of Republic of Belarus") written below; the text of both is in gold. On the reverse of the flag, the center contains the symbol of the armed forces, which is a red star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel. Above the symbol is the phrase ЗА НАШУ РАДЗІМУ ("For our Motherland"), while below is the full name of the military unit.|$|E
5000|$|The Flag Satyagraha was a term coined to {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>hoisting</b> of <b>the</b> flag as a defiance against British-imposed restrictions on civil freedom {{and also the}} legitimacy of British rule in India altogether. Proliferating during the Non-cooperation movement (1920-1922) and a prominent element of the Salt Satyagraha (1930) and the Quit India movement (1942), this means of revolt combined <b>the</b> <b>hoisting</b> of <b>the</b> nationalist flag with the technique of Satyagraha [...] - [...] non-violent civil disobedience [...] - [...] as pioneered by Mahatma Gandhi. Nationalists were encouraged to violate <b>the</b> law and <b>hoist</b> <b>the</b> flag without resisting arrest or retaliating against police.|$|R

5|$|Whenever {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it {{should always be}} on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with <b>the</b> <b>hoist</b> cord at the top.|$|E
5|$|Before 1928 {{the only}} flag that had {{official}} {{status in the}} Union of South Africa was the United Kingdom's Union Jack as South Africa {{was part of the}} British Empire. The South Africa Red Ensign was used as an unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for South Africa as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South Africa legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and a badge of the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with <b>the</b> <b>hoist</b> on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag of the}} Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic {{was adopted}} by decree on December 25, 1951. The flag was {{slightly}} modified in 1956 when construction details were added for the red star, and golden hammer and sickle. The final specifications of the flag was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and {{are very similar to}} the current Belarusian flag. The flag had a length-to-width ratio of one to two (1:2), just like the flag of the Soviet Union (and the other fourteen union republics). The main portion of the flag was red (representing the Revolution), with the rest being green (representing the Belarusian forests). A pattern of white drawn on red decorated <b>the</b> <b>hoist</b> portion of the flag; this design is often used on Belarusian traditional costumes. In the upper corner of the flag, in the red portion, a gold hammer and sickle was added, with a red star outlined in gold above it. The hammer represented the worker, and the sickle the peasant; according to Soviet ideology, these two symbols crossed together symbolized co-operation between the two classes. The red star, a symbol commonly used by Communist parties, was said to stand either for the five social groups (workers, youth, peasants, military, and academics), the five known continents, or the five fingers of the worker's hand. The hammer, sickle and star were sometimes not displayed on the reverse of the flag. The purpose for this design was that the Byelorussian SSR, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR, were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as founding members and needed distinct flags for each other. The designer of the flag was Milkahil Gusyev.|$|E
