40|$|Microtubule-associated protein <b>tau</b> is {{the major}} {{component}} of paired helical filaments (PHFs) associated with the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). <b>Tau</b> in the normal brain binds and stabilizes microtubules. <b>Tau</b> isolated from PHFs is hyperphosphorylated, which prevents it from binding to microtubules. <b>Tau</b> phosphorylation has been suggested {{to be involved in}} the development of NFT pathology in the AD brain. Recently, we showed that 14 - 3 - 3 ζ is bound to <b>tau</b> in the PHFs and when incubated in vitro with 14 - 3 - 3 ζ, <b>tau</b> formed amorphous aggregates, single-stranded straight filaments, double stranded ribbon-like filaments and PHF-like filaments that displayed close resemblance with corresponding ultrastructures of AD brain.
