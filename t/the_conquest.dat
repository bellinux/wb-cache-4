5000|$|The role of {{religion}} in these early conquests is debated. Medieval Arabic authors believed <b>the</b> <b>conquests</b> were commanded by God, and presented them as orderly and disciplined, under the command of the caliph. Many modern historians question whether hunger and desertification, rather than jihad, was a motivating force in <b>the</b> <b>conquests.</b> <b>The</b> famous historian William Montgomery Watt argued that “Most {{of the participants in the}} Islamic expeditions probably thought of nothing more than booty ... There was no thought of spreading the religion of Islam.” Similarly, Edward J. Jurji argues that the motivations of <b>the</b> Arab <b>conquests</b> were certainly not “for the propagation of Islam ... Military advantage, economic desires, and the attempt to strengthen the hand of the state and enhance its sovereignty ... are some of the determining factors.” Some recent explanations cite both material and religious causes in <b>the</b> <b>conquests.</b>|$|R
5|$|AjTut {{was one of}} {{the lords}} of the {{northern}} Chak'an Itza province of the conquered Itza kingdom; friar Avendaño had met him during his expedition to Nojpetén.

For some years after <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> he established the Mompana region as a refuge from the Spanish and engaged in internecine war against the surviving Kowoj to the south.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} of this truce in 638639, the Arabs overran Byzantine Mesopotamia and Byzantine Armenia, and terminated <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> of Palestine by storming Caesarea Maritima and effecting their final capture of Ascalon.

5|$|Given the chaos, the {{governor}} of Yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The Mongol army commanded by Prince Ye-sin Timour, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan. According to mainstream traditional (British colonial era) scholarship, the Mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate; fought its way down to Pagan {{with the loss of}} 7000 men; occupied the city; and sent out detachments to receive homage, one of which reached south of Prome. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary Mongol/Chinese records specifically mentioned <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> of Pagan or the temporary completeness of <b>the</b> <b>conquest.</b>|$|E

5|$|News of {{the battle}} was {{received}} in England shortly after news {{of the fall of}} Louisbourg, putting a damper on the celebrations marking that victory. The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year, when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac, key steps in completing <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> of New France. Had Carillon also fallen in 1758, <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> might have been completed in 1758 or 1759; as it happened, Montreal (the last point of resistance) did not surrender until 1760, with campaigns launched from Fort Oswego, Quebec, and Carillon, which was captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759 by forces under the command of Jeffrey Amherst, the victor at Louisbourg.|$|E
5|$|Nojpetén fell to a Spanish {{assault on}} 13 March 1697, more than 150 years after <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> {{of the rest}} of the Yucatán Peninsula and more than 160 years after <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> of the Guatemalan Highlands. The lengthy delay in conquering the Petén region was due to a {{combination}} of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants. During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from Belize. The lengthy indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to develop an understanding of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the period of almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by European-dominated territories. This understanding distinguished <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> of Petén from the 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and Incas. In contrast, the Spanish had a very poor understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages whose kingdom was protected by Satan from the Christianising efforts of the Spanish Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. From the time that Hernán Cortés crossed Petén in the early 16th century, the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the Aj Kan Ek) was the overlord of the entire central Petén region.|$|E

5|$|Stigand {{was later}} accused of simony by monastic chroniclers, but all such accusations date to after 1066, {{and are thus}} suspect owing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify the English Church as corrupt and backward.

This claim was used as {{propaganda}} after <b>the</b> <b>Conquest,</b> {{but according to the}} historian David Bates, among others, it is unlikely to be true.
