40|$|The role of alpha- 1 {{adrenergic}} {{mechanism in}} <b>the</b> <b>shaking</b> stress-induced adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and plasma noradrenaline secretion and pressor response were investigated using conscious rats. We also studied {{whether or not}} central corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is involved in <b>the</b> <b>shaking</b> stress-induced ACTH secretion. <b>The</b> <b>shaking</b> stress caused significant elevations of plasma ACTH, noradrenaline, and systolic blood pressure. Intra-third ventricular administration of alpha- 1 adrenergic blocker, bunazosin, inhibited <b>the</b> <b>shaking</b> stress-induced ACTH secretion, but did not alter stress-induced noradrenaline secretion and pressor response. Furthermore, intra-third ventricular administration of CRH antagonist, alpha-helical CRH, significantly attenuated stress-induced ACTH secretion.

25|$|Another {{factor that}} impacts total CPU time needed by a {{simulation}} {{is the size}} of the integration timestep. This is the time length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid discretization errors (i.e., smaller than the fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1femtosecond (10−15 s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as <b>the</b> <b>SHAKE</b> constraint algorithm, which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the above}} scoring {{possibilities}} can be combined, meaning {{the maximum number of}} points available on a single stroke is nine, accomplished by caroming into and pocketing both object balls combined with knocking over the bottle with the cue ball. The winning shot in the game (other than one which rights <b>the</b> <b>shake</b> bottle) must bring a player's score to exactly 31. If a player overshoots that benchmark, known as a [...] "burst" [...] in the game's terminology, the amount of points 31 is overshot by becomes the player's new score. This means, for example, that if a player has 30 points and then scores 5 points (instead of the requisite 1 point) by caroming the cue ball off an object ball and into the bottle knocking it on its side, the player's score resets to four points.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} ultracold bosons in a 2 D square optical lattice {{described by}} the Bose-Hubbard model. In addition, an external time-dependent sinusoidal {{force is applied to}} <b>the</b> system, which <b>shakes</b> <b>the</b> lattice along one of the diagonals. The effect of <b>the</b> <b>shaking</b> is to renormalize the nearest-neighbor hopping coefficients, which can be arbitrarily reduced, can vanish, or can even change sign, depending on <b>the</b> <b>shaking</b> parameter. It is therefore necessary to account for higher-order hopping terms, which are renormalized differently by <b>the</b> <b>shaking,</b> and introduce anisotropy into the problem. We show that the competition between these different hopping terms leads to finite-momentum condensates, with a momentum that may be tuned via the strength of <b>the</b> <b>shaking.</b> We calculate <b>the</b> boundaries between the Mott-insulator and the different superfluid phases, and present the time-of-flight images expected to be observed experimentally.

But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go.

40|$|A shaking motion {{could be}} used to improve fish {{escapement}} from a cod-end net by creating a sieving effect over the swept vol-ume or by disturbing the optomotor response of the fish. In this study, a perpendicular shaking motion was generated in a towed cod-end net by a circular canvas attached {{to the end of the}} codend, which formed a biased cap-like shape. This concept was tested by using a model in a flow tank and by towing a prototype cod-end during sea trials. For the model tests, the amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>shaking</b> motion was 0. 6 ± 0. 1 times the rear diameter of the cod-end, and the period of <b>the</b> <b>shaking</b> motion was 2. 6 ± 0. 1 s at a flow velocity of 0. 6 or 0. 8 m/s.
