5|$|As the war progressed, Temple was {{promoted}} to colonel and became governor of <b>Tilbury</b> Fort in Essex, a post {{that had previously been}} held by his father. The fort was close to Temple's childhood home at Longhouse Place and was of strategic importance because it controlled the approach to London by river. During the Second Civil War, there were Royalist uprisings in Kent and Essex. Temple's control of <b>Tilbury</b> Fort for Parliament enabled Lord Fairfax's troops to cross from Gravesend to <b>Tilbury</b> on route to Colchester for the siege of royalists in that town.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain {{and as a result}} the coastal defences {{received}} little attention; surveys reported multiple problems with <b>Tilbury</b> Fort including flooding caused by the estuary tides, and ferry passengers and animals making their way uninvited into the fort. In 1642 civil war broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and those of Parliament. <b>Tilbury</b> was controlled by Parliament, who placed the <b>Tilbury</b> and Gravesend forts under the command of a military governor, using them to control traffic entering London and to search for spies; it saw no military action during the war. <b>Tilbury</b> remained in use during the interregnum, having a garrison of three officers and sixty-six men in 1651.|$|E

5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the <b>Tilbury</b> and Gravesend fortifications. In reality, the forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at <b>Tilbury</b> {{there were only two}} guns ready for action. The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving enough time for the government to improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed his Chief Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de Gomme, to develop <b>Tilbury</b> Fort's defences further.|$|E

5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of an artillery blockhouse at East <b>Tilbury</b> in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to fears that the Catholic powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at <b>Tilbury</b> and East <b>Tilbury</b> and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E

5|$|The East <b>Tilbury</b> Blockhouse {{was built}} partly with stone taken from St Margaret's Chapel in <b>Tilbury,</b> which was {{dissolved}} in 1536. Its form {{is not known}} but it probably consisted of a brick and stone structure, perhaps in a D-shape, with a rampart and ditch to enclose its landward side. It was recorded as having fifteen iron and brass cannon of various calibres in 1540; these had been increased to 27 by 1539–40. It had a small permanent garrison, consisting of a commander and his deputy, a porter, two soldiers and four gunners. The blockhouse may have been altered in 1545 but in 1553 it was disarmed. Although the corresponding blockhouse at Gravesend continued in use and that at <b>Tilbury</b> was eventually incorporated into <b>Tilbury</b> Fort between 1670 and 1683, the one at East <b>Tilbury</b> {{seems to have been}} abandoned {{before the end of the}} 16th century. By 1735 it had been inundated by the river and was in ruins. Its site by the shoreline has since been eroded away by tidal action, though it is possible that remains from the blockhouse may still survive under the river mud.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} Dutch threat were {{intensified}} after an unexpected naval raid along the Thames in 1667, during which Gravesend and <b>Tilbury</b> prevented the attack reaching the capital itself. In response, Charles made extensive improvements to his coastal defences. As {{part of this}} investments were made to Pendennis, Southsea and Yarmouth, while <b>Tilbury</b> was hugely expanded with an updated system of ramparts, bastions and moats at considerable cost. In the final phases of Charles's work, the castle and southern blockhouse at Hull were incorporated into a massive new fortification called the Citadel during the 1680s.|$|E

5|$|East <b>Tilbury,</b> {{which stands}} at {{the western end of}} the section of the Thames known as Lower Hope Reach, was {{fortified}} long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers. Settlements {{on both sides of the}} Thames were raided by the French in 1379 during the second phase of the Hundred Years' War. The attack prompted the building of Cooling Castle on Kent's Hoo Peninsula between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East <b>Tilbury.</b>|$|E
5|$|Naval and {{defensive}} technology continued to improve {{over the next}} few decades, rendering <b>Tilbury</b> Fort's bastion design out-moded. The government considered the defences further down the Thames to be sufficient and <b>Tilbury</b> was therefore not improved; it was largely redundant as a defensive fortification {{by the end of the}} century, although still in use as a strategic depot. From 1889 onwards it formed a mobilisation centre to support a mobile strike force in the event of an invasion, part of the wider London Defence Scheme, and large storage buildings were built across the site to store materiel.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s, {{the advent}} of steam ships meant that enemy vessels could sail up the Thames far more quickly than before, {{reducing}} the time available for forts to intercept them. Rifled guns and turret-mounted weapons and new armour-plating meant that enemy warships could fire on forts such as <b>Tilbury</b> from downstream more easily while being protected from their guns. Fears of an potential invasion by Napoleon III of France led to the establishment Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom in 1859. The Commission reported the following year and recommended that new, more powerful forts be built further downstream, with defences such as <b>Tilbury</b> Fort forming a second-line of defence. Work began on strengthening <b>Tilbury</b> in 1868, {{under the direction of}} the then Captain Charles Gordon, focusing on adding heavier gun positions able to fire upstream to support the new forts. The west, north-east and east bastions and the south-east curtain wall were altered to house thirteen rifled muzzle-loading guns, protected by brick walls, earthworks and iron shields. Initially 7-ton, 7-inch (7,112 kg, 17 cm) guns were deployed but these were upgraded to 9-inch ((22 cm) weapons by 1888, supported by a heavier 25-ton, 11-inch (25,401 kg, 27 cm) gun. The old Tudor block-house was destroyed to make way for the new guns.|$|E

5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} grew {{that the}} Thames might {{be vulnerable to}} attack from torpedo boats and armoured cruisers, and in 1903 four quick-firing 12-pounder, 12 cwt (5.4 kg, 50.8 kg) guns were positioned on <b>Tilbury's</b> south-east curtain wall, supplemented in 1904 by two 6-inch (15 cm) breech loading guns. In 1905, however, the government decided that the Royal Navy and the forts downstream gave sufficient protection for the capital and removed the artillery, leaving only machine-guns in place.|$|R
