Ratings are based on <b>the</b> <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> a country's economy, export growth and {{real effective exchange rate}} (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with <b>the</b> <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to <b>the</b> <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E

During that period, Bernhardt was about to begin her world tour; knowing that Damala was transferred in Saint Petersburg and interested in meeting him again, she decided to arrange a six-month stay in Russia, despite the fact she had previously – repeatedly – rejected offers of making appearances there. Indeed, she resided in Saint Petersburg for a few months, as an official guest of Emperor Alexander III of Russia, during which her romance with Damala flourished. <b>The</b> <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> their affair scandalized the social circles of the city and proved a common topic of discussion.|$|E

25|$|Though open-plan, the first-level {{interior}} of the Purcell–Cutts House features individual room areas by virtue of alterations in floor level and breadth of floor space, while the tented ceiling maintains the same height throughout. The ground floor living room area {{at the front of}} the house features a high ceiling, increasing available space for the repeated pairs of art glass windows that comprise the walls of the front of the living room, while the dining area behind, set a half-story above, has a low ceiling. The pointed prow separating the dining and living areas creates a small nook, reserved as Edna Purcell’s writing area. The effect of the main level’s design is to maintain intimacy within the larger space, not rendering adjacent spaces automatically visible in main areas of the house, while preserving unity between rooms and <b>the</b> <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the entire floor.|$|E
25|$|In Rabelais and His World, {{a classic}} of Renaissance studies, Bakhtin {{concerns}} himself with <b>the</b> <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> Gargantua and Pantagruel; however, the book itself {{also serves as}} an example of such openness. Throughout the text, Bakhtin attempts two things: he seeks to recover sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that, in the past, were either ignored or suppressed, and conducts an analysis of the Renaissance social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. It is by means of this analysis that Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: the first is carnival (carnivalesque) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is grotesque realism which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in Rabelais and His World Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body and the material bodily lower stratum.|$|E

The most important factors that increase <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> are a firm's need for financial funding in innovation and the effectiveness of a firm's IP protection mechanisms...|$|R

25|$|MEG is {{also being}} used to better {{localize}} responses in the brain. <b>The</b> <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the MEG setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. Some movement by the subject is also possible {{as long as it}} does not jar the subject's head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of studies have been done comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG {{is also being}} used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.|$|E
25|$|Looking over St Martin's Square is {{the statue}} of Horatio Nelson. The bronze statue was the first public {{monument}} for Birmingham and was sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It is also the first figurative memorial to Lord Nelson to be erected in Great Britain (only second in the world after Montreal) and was unveiled on 25 October 1809, as part of King George III's Golden Jubilee celebrations. It was originally located {{on the edge of}} the previous Bull Ring and stood on a marble base, but this was damaged when the statue was moved in 1958 and the current Portland stone plinth dates from 1960. As part of the Bullring development, the developer agreed to restore the statue and railings, but in 2003 when the Bullring opened, there was no sign of the railings. The Birmingham Civic Society mounted a campaign to get the railings re-instated, whilst Bullring argued they were a health and safety risk and would destroy <b>the</b> <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the public space.

40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} explore <b>the</b> {{dynamics}} <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> within SMEs, this study investigates how business model transformation relates to innovation strategy transformation. Design/Methodology/Approach: This research is conducted as a longitudinal qualitative single {{case study in}} order to fully follow transformation as a process. Findings: This research revealed that openness in SMEs is not about continuously increasing <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>openness,</b> but SMEs can also begin to close their innovation strategy, even though the business model stays open. <b>The</b> level <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> varies based on strategic openness. Research limitations/implications: This study emphasizes that openness needs {{to be viewed as}} a continuum, where <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> may fluctuate during transformation. Furthermore, openness in business models and openness in innovation indeed are separate phenomena. Practical implications: Having an understanding how strategic openness guides business model transformation enables practitioners to better utilize open innovation as an innovation strategy. Originality/value: Through focusing on the relationship between business model transformation and innovation strategy transformation, we broaden the discussion on <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> within SMEs. ...|$|R
