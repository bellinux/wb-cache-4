5|$|After {{affecting}} the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> Caicos Islands, the hurricane {{passed through the}} Bahamas. The eye crossed over Nassau, where a barometric pressure of 938mbar (27.70inHg) was reported. Based on this observation, the hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). The hurricane struck without warning in the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in Nassau. In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs. Every building in Nassau was damaged or destroyed. After moving through the islands, the hurricane curved northeastward, affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four. On October4, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force11 winds on the Beaufort scale. The hurricane was last observed on October5 to the southeast of Atlantic Canada.

5|$|The Arabization of the Ayyubid ruling {{families}} differed starkly {{from the}} ranks of their armies, which lacked cultural cohesion, with <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> Kurds dominating the cavalry and nomadic Turcomans and Arabs filling the ranks of the infantry.

This isolation allowed them to preserve their traditions. It is thought that Saladin spoke Turkish to his military commanders. Like their Fatimid predecessors, the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt maintained a substantial force of mamluks (military slaves).
