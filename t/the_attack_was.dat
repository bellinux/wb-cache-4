5|$|Four {{days later}} on 21 August at 08:30, Orizaba, {{traveling}} with Siboney, spotted a submarine {{in the act}} of submerging. Orizaba attempted to ram the sub and dropped depth charges, but there was no indication that <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> successful.|$|E
5|$|From 20–25 October, Japanese land {{forces on}} Guadalcanal {{attempted}} to capture Henderson Field with a large-scale attack against U.S. troops defending the airfield. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> decisively defeated with heavy casualties for the Japanese during the Battle for Henderson Field.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> spoofed, that is random fake Internet source {{addresses}} {{are used}} {{which makes it}} difficult to identify the attacker. The idea of <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> to either degrade the performance of <b>the</b> <b>attacked</b> computer or make it crash. <b>The</b> <b>attacking</b> program <b>is</b> called Twinge, but the ICMP packets have a particular signature which gives its identity away.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> later {{condemned}} by Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, and Iranian president Hassan Rouhani.

5000|$|Prime Minister Stefan Löfven {{said that}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> [...] "hateful violence" [...] and denounced the crime.

5|$|On 2 November 2014, {{a suicide}} bombing {{following}} the daily parade took place at Wagah border in Pakistan, more than 55 killed and over 200 injured. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> claimed by militant groups jamaat-ul-Ahrar and jundallah, sub-groups of TTP.|$|E
5|$|The third {{attack on}} Anzac Cove (19 May 1915) was an {{engagement}} during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted by the}} forces of the Ottoman Turkish Empire, against the forces of the British Empire defending the cove.|$|E
5|$|A BBC {{documentary}} titled India's Daughter {{based on}} <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> broadcast in the UK on 4 March 2015.

2500|$|Palestinian {{historian}} Abbas Shiblak {{believes that}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> committed by Zionist activists and that <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> pre-eminent {{reason for the}} subsequent exodus of Iraqi Jews to Israel. Shiblak also argues that <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> an attempt to sour Iraq-American relations, saying [...] "The March 1951 <b>attack</b> on <b>the</b> US Information Centre was probably an attempt to portray the Iraqis as anti-American and to gain more support for the Zionist cause in the United States".|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> first {{blamed on}} the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), but its leader, Yasser Arafat, denied the accusations and denounced the strikes.

5|$|According to Melman, Abu Nidal had {{recommended}} Hindawi to Syrian intelligence. Seale {{writes that the}} bomb had been manufactured by Abu Nidal's technical committee, who had delivered it to Syrian air force intelligence. It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, it was widely believed that <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> in response to Israel having forced down a jet, two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials to Damascus, which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the base}} was secured and 150 mostly Afghan workers were {{detained}} and held incommunicado for three days. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> a major setback for the intelligence agency's operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It {{was the second}} largest single-day loss in the CIA's history, after the 1983 United States Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight CIA officers. The incident suggested that al-Qaeda {{might not be as}} weakened as previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Believing <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> over, Giffen {{ordered his}} ships to cease zigzagging and {{continue}} towards Guadalcanal {{on the same}} course {{and at the same}} speed.

5|$|Braithwaite had {{a further}} period {{in command of}} the {{division}} while Russell was on sick leave in late October and in early December led his brigade in attacks on Polderhoek Chateau. The brigade suffered heavy losses and <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> regarded as a failure. At this stage of the war, Braithwaite was one of the longest serving brigade commanders of the NZEF. Worn down by stresses of command, his health was so poor it forced his evacuation to England.|$|E
5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even trying to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. <b>The</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in his Atlético Madrid career, Costa's {{physical}} {{play was}} used in support of Radamel Falcao, thus ensuring a lower goalscoring rate. After Falcao was sold in 2013, <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> restructured around Costa by manager Diego Simeone. Simeone, who like Costa {{was known for his}} competitiveness and aggression, found ways to enhance his discipline while retaining his determination.|$|E

After a week of fighting, the division secured the islands of the atoll. The division then returned to Hawaii to continue training. There, in June 1944, General Douglas MacArthur and President Franklin Roosevelt personally reviewed the division.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, in {{the wake}} of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, {{administrative}} control over Bani Na'im was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).

From February to July, 1918, the German Army launched four major offensives, attempting to secure victory before the full American forces could be mobilized. The final offensive, started in July 1918, {{was an attempt to}} cross the Marne, in the area of Château-Thierry, but I Corps and other formations on the American lines held, and <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> rebuffed.|$|E
