5|$|Hale–Bopp {{showed the}} highest ever linear {{polarization}} detected for any comet.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Coma</b> Supercluster, itself part of <b>the</b> <b>Coma</b> Filament, {{contains}} <b>the</b> <b>Coma</b> and Leo Cluster of galaxies. <b>The</b> <b>Coma</b> Cluster (Abell 1656) is 230 to 300 {{million light-years}} away. It {{is one of}} the largest known clusters, with at least 10,000 galaxies (mainly elliptical, with a few spiral galaxies). Due to its distance from Earth, most of the galaxies are visible only through large telescopes. Its brightest members are NGC 4874 and NGC 4889, both with a magnitude of 13; most others are magnitude 15 or dimmer. NGC 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy with one of the largest known black holes (21 billion solar masses), and NGC 4921 is the cluster's brightest spiral galaxy. After observing <b>the</b> <b>Coma</b> Cluster, astronomer Fritz Zwicky first postulated the existence of dark matter during the 1930s. The massive galaxy Dragonfly 44 discovered in 2015 was found to consist almost entirely of dark matter. Its mass is very similar to that of the Milky Way, but it emits only 1% of the light emitted by the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>coma</b> {{and tail}} are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of <b>the</b> <b>coma</b> greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E

5|$|The Giotto and Vega {{missions}} gave {{planetary scientists}} their first view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, {{carbon dioxide and}} other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000km across. Evaporation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in <b>the</b> <b>coma</b> absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas dust particles scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making <b>the</b> <b>coma</b> visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in <b>the</b> <b>coma</b> are ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100millionkilometers into space. Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.|$|E

Several plasma populations are found to exist in <b>the</b> inner <b>coma.</b> <b>The</b> characteristics of a particular population are largely determined by how far upstream the population was created. All particle populations in <b>the</b> inner <b>coma</b> are strongly affected by collisional processes, such as charge-transfer, ion-neutral chemistry, ion-neutral friction, and thermal cooling.

5|$|Three of the constellation's {{stars are}} {{visible to the}} naked eye: Alpha Comae Berenices, Beta Comae Berenices and Gamma Comae Berenices. They form a 45-degree triangle, from which Berenice's {{imaginary}} tresses, formed by <b>the</b> <b>Coma</b> Star Cluster, hang. The constellation's brightest star is Beta Comae Berenices, a 4.2-magnitude main sequence star similar to the Sun. Coma Berenices contains the North Galactic Pole and one of the richest known galaxy clusters, <b>the</b> <b>Coma</b> Cluster, part of <b>the</b> <b>Coma</b> Supercluster. Galaxy Malin 1, in the constellation, is the first known giant low-surface-brightness galaxy. Supernova SN 2005ap discovered in Coma Berenices is the brightest known, and SN 1940B was the first observed example of a type II supernova. The star FK Comae Berenices is the prototype of an eponymous class of variable stars. The constellation is the radiant of one meteor shower, Coma Berenicids, which has one of the fastest meteor speeds, up to 65km/s (40 mps).|$|E
5|$|Comets are {{distinguished}} from asteroids {{by the presence}} of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed <b>the</b> <b>coma</b> (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from <b>the</b> <b>coma</b> by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets.|$|E

5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases {{to break out}} of a weak spot on the surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser. These streams of gas and dust can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart. In 2010 it was revealed dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus. Infrared imaging of Hartley 2 shows such jets exiting and carrying with it dust grains into <b>the</b> <b>coma.</b>|$|E
5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. <b>The</b> <b>coma</b> may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impact. Debate {{continues}} {{about how}} much ice is in a comet. In 2001, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface of Comet Borrelly.

In July 2005, the Deep Impact probe blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporised water that form <b>the</b> <b>coma</b> of Tempel 1.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Comae</b> Berenicids (COM) {{is a minor}} {{meteor shower}} with an {{activity}} period that extends from Dec. 12 to January 23 and a maximum {{around the end of}} December. This shower was tentatively linked to comet 1913 I (Lowe), but this object was so poorly observed that its existence was not confirmed [1, 2]. By simultaneously imaging meteors belonging to this shower, we can obtain precise physicochemical parameters that can provide a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>Comae</b> Berenicids meteoroids stream. These include, for instance, radiant and orbit information. But, besides, bright events allow us to register the emission spectrum produced when meteoroids ablate in the atmosphere, and this can provide useful information related to the chemical composition of these particles of interplanetary matter [3, 4, 5, 6]. Nowadays, the SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN) monitors the night sky from 27 meteor observing stations located in the Iberian Peninsula. We have the advantage of more favourable weather conditions during December and January when compared to other areas in the northern hemisphere and, so, this provides good conditions to analyze <b>the</b> <b>Comae</b> Berenicids during <b>the</b> activity period of this shower.
