5|$|The Callistoan {{surface is}} asymmetric: the leading {{hemisphere}} is darker than <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> one.

Overall, the chemical composition of the surface, especially in the dark areas, may be close to that seen on D-type asteroids, whose surfaces are made of carbonaceous material.|$|E
5|$|The Ganymedian surface albedo is very asymmetric; {{the leading}} {{hemisphere}} is brighter than <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> one. This {{is similar to}} Europa, but the reverse for Callisto. <b>The</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur dioxide. The distribution of carbon dioxide does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry, {{although it is not}} observed near the poles. Impact craters on Ganymede (except one) do not show any enrichment in carbon dioxide, which also distinguishes it from Callisto. Ganymede's carbon dioxide gas was probably depleted in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian plasma is in many respects {{similar to that of}} the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede.

40|$|<b>The</b> Pacific Crest <b>Trail</b> {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular since Clinton Clarke first envisioned such a <b>trail</b> in <b>the</b> 1930 ’s. By comparing the original motives and experience of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> to <b>the</b> realities of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> today, <b>the</b> <b>trail’s</b> fluid narrative becomes apparent. While this narrative is ever changing, {{over the course of}} <b>the</b> <b>trail’s</b> history one theme has remained constant – a notably problematic relationship with wilderness rooted in an exaltation of the sublime and post-frontier ideals. This thesis focuses on how <b>the</b> Pacific Crest <b>Trail’s</b> development over <b>the</b> past eighty years has created an experience that, on the surface, is notably different from Clarke’s original vision for <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> but is still influenced by a perception of wilderness born from a romanticization of nature and a pursuit to preserve the western frontier. Chapter one, <b>The</b> Historic <b>Trail,</b> investigates Clarke’s manners and motives behind promoting <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Chapter two, <b>The</b> Popular <b>Trail,</b> examines <b>the</b> visual culture surrounding <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> from nineteenth century landscape painting to <b>the</b> <b>trail’s</b> presence in social media today. Chapter three, <b>The</b> <b>Trail</b> Community, focuses on the growth of a strong community of hikers, and what this means for the future of <b>the</b> <b>trail...</b>|$|R

5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. <b>The</b> <b>trailing</b> edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
5|$|Among Uranus's {{five major}} moons, Ariel {{is the second}} closest to the planet, {{orbiting}} at the distance of about 190,000km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that {{one side of the}} moon always faces the planet; a condition known as tidal lock. Ariel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. <b>The</b> <b>trailing</b> hemispheres (those facing away from their directions of orbit) of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Except for water, {{the only}} other {{compound}} identified {{on the surface of}} Titania by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide, which is concentrated mainly on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials {{under the influence of the}} solar ultraviolet radiation or energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus. The latter process would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, because <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the outgassing of the primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Titania's interior. The escape of CO2 from the interior may be related to the past geological activity on this moon.|$|E

5|$|Oberon orbits Uranus at a {{distance}} of about 584,000km, being the farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Oberon's orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 13.5days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Oberon is a synchronous satellite, tidally locked, with one face always pointing toward the planet. Oberon spends a significant part of its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere. As a result, its surface is directly struck by the solar wind. This is important, because <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by the magnetospheric plasma, which co–rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|E
5|$|The Texas and Pacific {{intended}} {{to enter the}} Silver Slipper into operational service between Fort Worth, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.

By 1935, the Silver Slipper had been scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins originate {{below the}} third or fourth gill slits, and are no longer than the front margin of the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is about twice as long as the second dorsal fin and preceded by long ridges. The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second dorsal fin originates over the last third of the anal fin base. The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The leading edge of the first dorsal fin and <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge of the caudal fin may be dark, and <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edges of the pectoral fins may be light.|$|E

5|$|The limited {{high-resolution}} {{radar coverage}} of Titan obtained through 2007 (22%) suggested {{the existence of}} nonuniformities in its crater distribution. Xanadu has 2–9 times more craters than elsewhere. The leading hemisphere has a 30% higher density than <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere. There are lower crater densities in areas of equatorial dunes and in the north polar region (where hydrocarbon lakes and seas are most common).|$|E
5|$|The night shark has {{a slender}} build with an elongated, pointed snout. The nares are flanked by {{moderately}} developed flaps of skin. The eyes are large, circular, and green in life, with irregularly shaped pupils and a nictitating membrane (protective third eyelid). The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows {{at the corners}} and usually bears 15 tooth rows {{on either side of}} both jaws, plus 12 upper and 1 lower symphysial (jaw midline) tooth rows. Each upper tooth has a smooth to serrated edge, a narrow cusp becoming more oblique towards the corner of the mouth, and 25 coarse serrations at the base of <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> margin. The number and size of serrations on the leading margin of the tooth cusp increase relative to those on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> margin as the animal grows older. The lower teeth are upright and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are rather short.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} Metis is heavily cratered, dark, {{and appears to}} be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (presumably ice) from its interior.|$|E
5|$|Titania is {{the largest}} and most massive Uranian moon, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System. Its density of 1.71 g/cm³, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on Oberon, where <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel is {{the third}} largest and fourth most massive of Uranian moons. The moon's density is 1.39g/cm3, which {{indicates}} that it mainly consists of water ice, with a dense non-ice component constituting around 40% of its mass. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Umbriel's leading hemisphere than on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation).
