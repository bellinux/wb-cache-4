500|$|Scheyer was 7th in the ACC in {{free throw}} {{percentage}} (.841) for the season, 8th in minutes per game (32.8), tied for 8th in steals per game (1.6) and three-point field goals made per game (2.1), and 18th in {{points per game}} (14.9). [...] In the team's 36 games, Scheyer led the Blue Devils in minutes, free throws, free throw percentage, 3-point field goals, 3-point field goal percentage (.395), assists, and assists per game (2.8). [...] He was named the MVP of the 2009 ACC Tournament after scoring 29 points in the championship game. Krzyzewski said after the season: [...] "He's a great competitor. [...] He handles the ball real well. He scores—he scored more when he was bringing the ball up than when he didn't bring the ball up. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> the ball is in Jon's hands, the better." [...] Reflecting his off-the-court accomplishments, Scheyer was a 2009 ACC Academic Honor Roll selection.|$|E
2500|$|Meyer, {{who owns}} several homes and travels {{in a private}} jet (currently a Gulfstream G-IV), has been criticized by some of her peers for living an {{excessive}} lifestyle. She responded that she doesn't have to defend her spending habits because [...] "...there's no need for us to apologize for being blessed." [...] Meyer commented, [...] "You can be a businessman here in St. Louis, and people <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> you have, the more wonderful it is...but if you’re a preacher, {{then all of a}} sudden it becomes a problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2002, {{appearing}} on CNN's Crossfire, Fossella argued for partly privatizing Social Security and allow {{some of the}} funds be placed on Wall Street investments. He said [...] "I happen to think the President {{is on the right}} side of history here. And I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> you empower American people, the more you give them the opportunity to invest on their own and being in control of their own destiny and their own retirement, the better off we'll be." [...] In a standardized constituent letter in February 2005, Fossella said [...] "We need to examine the viability of voluntary personal savings accounts in which young people would have the opportunity to invest a small portion of their savings." ...|$|E
60|$|L. The {{scientific}} men are all busy {{in determining}} the constant laws under which the struggle takes place; these indefinite humors of the elements are of no interest to them. And unscientific people rarely give themselves the trouble of thinking at all, {{when they look at}} stones.

6000|$|His {{resolution}} {{in reference to}} the Hair Bracelet was not more firmly settled than his resolution to keep his real sensations on seeing Madonna, and the purpose which had grown out of them, a profound secret from young Thorpe, who was too warmly Mr. Blyth's friend to be trusted. Every word that Zack had let slip, had been of vital importance, hitherto; every word that might yet escape him, might be of the most precious use for future guidance. [...] "If it's his fun and fancy," [...] mused Mat, [...] "to go on thinking I'm sweet on the girl, let him <b>think</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> he <b>thinks,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> he'll talk. All I've got to do is to hold in; and then he's sure to let out." ...|$|R

2500|$|After the Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, {{he joined a}} Connecticut militia and was elected first {{lieutenant}} within five months. His militia unit participated in the Siege of Boston, but Hale remained behind. It {{has been suggested that}} he was unsure as to whether he wanted to fight, or whether he was hindered because his teaching contract in New London did not expire until several months later, in July 1775. On July 4, 1775, Hale received a letter from his classmate and friend Benjamin Tallmadge, who had gone to Boston to see the siege for himself. He wrote to Hale, [...] "Was I in your condition, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> extensive service would be my choice. Our holy Religion, the honor of our God, a glorious country, & a happy constitution is what we have to defend." [...] Tallmadge's letter was so inspiring that, several days later, Hale accepted a commission as first lieutenant in the 7th Connecticut Regiment under Colonel Charles Webb of Stamford.|$|E

John also is the greater warrior, if a pilgrim can be a warrior--look at his muscles; but Peter <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>more.</b> It {{would be hard for}} a woman to choose between Peter and John, who must both of them be hungry, so I go to prepare their food." ...|$|R

60|$|Scrooge {{went to bed}} again, {{and thought}}, and thought, and thought it over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured not to <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> he thought.|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{it must be}} so," [...] {{answered}} Suzanne, sighing, [...] "perhaps Sigwe will escort us to {{the house}} of the Umpondwana before he turns homewards, for they will <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> of us if they see us {{at the head of a}} great army." ...|$|E

60|$|I do {{not think}} that in this I confess to any unusual temperament.

6000|$|... "Perhaps you mistake their feeling, good woman; a thing I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> probable, as {{you seem}} to fancy money {{the source of their}} pride, at the very moment you deny their having any.

60|$|They did not {{say whether}} or not they {{expected}} the Minor Canon to stay there also, and he did not ask them any thing about it.

6000|$|P.S.--The more I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> desperate {{does our}} {{position}} seem. I see no possible hope of our return.

6000|$|... "It {{does not}} strike {{you so much}} as it does me," [...] said Mrs. Spalding, with one of her sweetest smiles. [...] "The truth is, we all value what we have not got.

"Ay, {{that will}} I, boy," [...] replied the hunter; [...] "an' now I think on it, there's four as jolly trappers in Pine Point {{settlement}} at this here moment as ever floored a grisly or fought an Injun.
