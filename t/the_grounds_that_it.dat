5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or {{the meaning of}} life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined {{to refer to the}} entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{winning the}} Jack Adams Award as top coach and being {{popular with the}} Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year {{contract}} extension by replacement GM Darcy Regier. He rejected this under <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was too short, and decided to part ways with the franchise. This upset many fans, who blamed Nolan's departure on Hašek's alleged attempt to rid him.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again {{raised the}} issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, but said that Sharp had denied paternity of the child on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a mulatto and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.|$|E

5|$|He was {{the only}} Republican senator {{to vote against the}} Freedom to Farm Act in 1996, saying that it catered to special {{interests}} rather than representing true reform of farm subsidies policy. He was one of only five senators to vote against the Telecommunications Act of 1996, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> put the economic interests of corporations ahead of those of consumers.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Council of Ulemas, an Islamic body in Indonesia, {{passed a}} fatwa banning yoga on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{contains}} Hindu elements. These fatwas have, in turn, {{been criticized by}} Darul Uloom Deoband, a Deobandi Islamic seminary in India. Similar fatwas banning yoga, for its link to Hinduism, were issued by the Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa in Egypt in 2004, and by Islamic clerics in Singapore earlier.|$|E

5|$|The 1985 All Blacks tour to South Africa was {{cancelled}} after {{legal action}} on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would breach the NZRU's constitution. In 1986, a rebel tour to South Africa took place {{that had not}} been authorised by the NZRU and the team, named the Cavaliers, included many All Blacks. Those that participated in the tour received a ban for two tests from the NZRU when they returned to New Zealand. Allegations that players received payment for the tour were never proved.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} by Russia was condemned by the United States, France, the {{secretary-general of the}} Council of Europe, {{the president of the}} Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the OSCE chairman, NATO and the G7 on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> violated Georgia's territorial integrity, United Nations Security Council resolutions and the ceasefire agreement.

5|$|In 2004, four {{female athletes}} – Anette Sagen, Helena Olsson Smeby, Line Jahr, and Lindsey Van – {{were invited to}} perform test jumps prior to the men's 2004 Continental Cup event in Vikersund. However, this was {{initially}} blocked by Torbjørn Yggeseth, founder of the Ski Jumping World Cup {{and a member of}} the FIS technical committee at the time, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was too dangerous to allow women on ski flying hills. Sagen challenged this and eventually won the right to jump from the hill, along with her fellow athletes. Both Sagen and Smeby jumped , which remains the third longest distance for women.|$|E

Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest {{and half of the}} costs of the tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{decided to}} publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document {{the results of the}} competition and feature a photograph of the protesters. Life initially wanted to photograph the painters {{on the steps of the}} Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would look like they were trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E

5|$|Operation Dragoon was {{controversial}} {{from the}} time it was first proposed. The American military leadership and its British counterparts disagreed on the operation. Winston Churchill argued against it on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> diverted military resources that were better deployed for Allied operations in Italy; instead, he favored an invasion of the oil-producing regions of the Balkans. Churchill reasoned that by attacking the Balkans, the Western Allies could deny Germany petroleum, forestall the advance of the Red Army of the Soviet Union, and achieve a superior negotiating position in post-war Europe, all at a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} {{imposed on}} {{a speech at}} Speakers' Corner were {{that it had to}} take place only between 7:00a.m. and 7:00p.m. on the date notified by the person to the police, had to be in any of Singapore's four official languages (English, Malay, Mandarin or Tamil) or any related dialects, and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited. The latter restriction was justified on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would reduce noise pollution and prevent one speaker from drowning out another one, and that it also applied to Speakers' Corner in London.|$|E
