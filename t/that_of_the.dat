5|$|Apart {{from its}} larger size and more {{primitive}} molars, the Columbian mammoth also {{differed from the}} woolly mammoth by its more downturned mandibular symphysis; the dental alveoli (tooth sockets) of the tusks were directed more laterally away from the midline.

Since no Columbian mammoth soft tissue has been found, much less is known about its appearance than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woolly mammoth. It lived in warmer habitats than the woolly mammoth, and probably lacked many of the adaptations seen in that species. Hair thought to be <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Columbian mammoth has been discovered in Bechan Cave in Utah, where mammoth dung has also been found.

The distribution and density of fur on the living animal is unknown, but it was probably less dense than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woolly mammoth due to the warmer habitat.|$|E
