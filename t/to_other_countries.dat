In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{failed to}} {{recognize}} Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations that started on December 22, 1917, between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims. During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was {{made clear that the}} Council would serve only as an advisory board. This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries.</b> The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act.|$|E
