5|$|Eichelberger's {{period in}} command of the 77th Infantry Division was brief, for on 18 June 1942 he became {{commander}} of I Corps, with Byers as his chief of staff. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service with the 77th Infantry Division. I Corps consisted of the 8th, 30th and 77th Infantry Divisions. Eichelberger was given the initial task of arranging a demonstration for dignitaries including Winston Churchill, Marshall, Henry Stimson, Sir John Dill and Sir Alan Brooke. The demonstration was judged a success, although <b>the</b> <b>trained</b> eyes of Brooke and Lesley McNair noted flaws. Within days, two of the division commanders were relieved of their commands. Eichelberger was nominated to command American forces in Operation Torch, and he was ordered to conduct training in amphibious warfare with the 3rd, 9th and 30th Infantry Divisions in Chesapeake Bay in cooperation with Rear Admiral Kent Hewitt.|$|E
5|$|Later the Calvinism {{that came}} to {{dominate}} the Scottish Reformation was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing an emphasis on what was biblical, which meant the Psalms.

It drew {{on the work of}} French musician Clément Marot, Calvin's contributions to the Strasbourg Psalter of 1539 and English writers, particularly the 1561 edition of the Psalter produced by William Whittingham for the English congregation in Geneva. The intention was to produce individual tunes for each psalm, but of 150 psalms, 105 had proper tunes and in the seventeenth century, common tunes, which could be used for psalms with the same metre, became more frequent. Because whole congregations would now sing these psalms, unlike <b>the</b> <b>trained</b> choirs who had sung the many parts of polyphonic hymns, there was a need for simplicity and most church compositions were confined to homophonic settings.|$|E

5|$|Political {{tensions}} between CharlesI and Parliament {{in the second}} quarter of the 17thcentury led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents, including money and munitions. London's Trained Bands, a militia force, were moved into the castle in 1640. Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built, readying the Tower for war. The preparations were never put to the test. In 1642, CharlesI attempted to arrest five members of parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir John Byron, the Lieutenant of the Tower. <b>The</b> <b>Trained</b> Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir John Conyers. By the time the English Civil War broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control.|$|E
5|$|Public {{occasions}} {{were treated}} with mistrust and from the later seventeenth century there were efforts by kirk sessions to stamp out activities such as well-dressing, bonfires, guising, penny weddings and dancing. The Reformation had a severe impact on church music. The Lutheranism that influenced the early Scottish Reformation attempted to accommodate Catholic musical traditions into worship, drawing on Latin hymns and vernacular songs. The most important product of this tradition in Scotland was The Gude and Godlie Ballatis, which were spiritual satires on popular ballads composed by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn. Never adopted by the kirk, they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the 1540s to the 1620s. Later the Calvinism that came to dominate was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing {{an emphasis on the}} Psalms.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the ride, the linear induction motors propel <b>the</b> <b>train</b> forward out of the station during its first launch at 50 mi/h km/h, which carries <b>the</b> <b>train</b> approximately halfway up the front tower.

50|$|Alternatively, {{propulsion}} coils on the guideway {{are used}} to exert a force on the magnets in <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and make <b>the</b> <b>train</b> move forward. <b>The</b> propulsion coils that exert a force on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> are effectively a linear motor: an alternating current flowing through the coils generates a continuously varying magnetic field that moves forward along the track. The frequency of the alternating current is synchronized to match the speed of <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> <b>The</b> offset between the field exerted by magnets on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and <b>the</b> applied field creates a force moving <b>the</b> <b>train</b> forward.|$|R
50|$|Station timing, {{a method}} of evening out trains, has been imposed on certain {{stations}} with interlocking (or home) signals.
