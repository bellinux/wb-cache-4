40|$|We {{propose to}} use high-energy {{exclusive}} reactions for probing internal structure of exotic hadron candidates. First, the constituent counting rule of perturbative QCD {{can be used}} for finding internal configurations of an exotic hadron candidate. It is because the number of constituents (n), which participate in the exclusive reaction, is found by the scaling behavior of the cross section dσ/dt ∝ 1 /s^n- 2 at large momentum transfer, where s is the center-of-mass energy squared. As an example, we show that the internal structure of Λ (1405) should be found, for example, by the reaction π^- + p → K^ 0 + Λ (1405). Second, the internal structure of exotic hadron candidates should be investigated by hadron tomography with generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) in exclusive reactions. <b>Exotic</b> <b>nature</b> should be reflected in the GPDs which contain two factors, longitudinal parton distributions as indicated by the constituent counting rule and transverse form factors as suggested by the hadron size. The GDAs should be investigated by the two-photon process γ^* γ→ hh̅, for example h=f_ 0 or a_ 0, in electron-positron annihilation. Since the GDAs contain information on a time-like form factor, <b>exotic</b> <b>nature</b> should be found by studying the hh̅ invariant mass dependence of the cross section. The internal structure of exotic hadron candidates should be clarified by the exclusive reactions at facilities such as J-PARC and KEKB.

COLONIZATION AND TRADE By the early fifteenth century, a new socioeconomic system already was evidently emerging in Western Europe. The system was capitalism at its commercial or mercantile stage. The main thrust of this new system of socioeconomic organization was the production of commodities for sale at home and abroad in the hope of making a profit. Trade was primarily concentrated in the cities of Western Europe, and its structure was the exchange of food and raw materials produced in the more backward parts of Europe for <b>the</b> <b>products</b> of <b>the</b> city artisans and imported <b>products</b> from <b>the</b> Near and Far East. The main dynamic of the West European economies came from the commercial activities of the merchants and bankers in the cities. By their activities the merchants and bankers created a system of regional trade that tied together the various regions of Europe, the Islamic world, and the Far East. In its regional trade, Europe ran a chronic trade deficit with the Eastern countries largely because it had no export that was greatly desired in the East while <b>the</b> <b>exotic</b> <b>products</b> and textiles of the East were much in demand by the feudal classes of Europe. To service its balance of trade deficit, Europe was forced to export gold and silver to the East.
