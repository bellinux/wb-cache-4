5|$|Von Neumann's {{assessment}} that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> a lead in missile technology, considered pessimistic at the time, was soon proven correct in the Sputnik crisis.|$|E
5|$|According to {{his student}} and biographer, Mark Kac, Steinhaus {{told him that}} the happiest day of his life were the twenty four hours between the time that the Germans left {{occupied}} Poland and <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> not yet arrived ("They had left, and they had not yet come").|$|E
5|$|At the ten-minute mark, Sinden {{noticed that}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> changed their style, playing defence {{to protect the}} lead, rather than pressing. However, the {{strategy}} back-fired on the Soviets. The change in tactics gave the Canadians more chances to score and Cournoyer scored to even it up.|$|E
50|$|A {{major change}} from Red Alert 2 is <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> air force: in {{addition}} to Kirovs, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> access to MiG (Mikoyan and Gurevich) fighters and versatile attack helicopters. In lieu of nuclear bombs, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> developed <b>the</b> Vacuum Imploder, a warhead which sucks humans, vehicles and damaged buildings into a dense hole before exploding.|$|R

50|$|The {{novel is}} set in a future a few decades ahead of the 1960s, when it was written. The USA is still {{competing}} with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Both <b>have</b> functioning bases on the Moon, and <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> gained <b>the</b> lead in sending an expedition to Mars.|$|R
5|$|The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for {{the first}} time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968. Shortly before, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> sent an {{unmanned}} spacecraft around the Moon. On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.|$|E
5|$|By September 1949, {{information}} from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the British intelligence services were wary of indicating {{the source of their}} information. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. In October 1949, Fuchs approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news that his father had been given a chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the Potsdam Conference. He was there {{when he learned that}} the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to Joseph Stalin that the U.S. was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though {{this was the first time}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> been officially given {{information}} about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project, having learned about it (through espionage) long before Truman did.|$|E

5|$|On 15 April, Hitler issued Operational Order No. 6, {{which called}} for the Kursk {{offensive}} operation, codenamed Zitadelle ("Citadel"), to begin on 3 May or shortly thereafter. The directive was drafted by Kurt Zeitzler, the OKH Chief of Staff. For the offensive to succeed it was deemed essential to attack before <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> a chance to prepare extensive defences or to launch an offensive of their own. Some military historians have described the operation using the term blitzkrieg (lightning war); other military historians do not use the term in their works on the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October, Molotov {{announced}} the Soviet demands in public, during a {{session of the}} Supreme Soviet. The Finns made two counteroffers—the first on 23 October and the second on 3 November. In both offers Finland would cede the Terijoki area to the Soviet Union, which was far less than <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> demanded. The Finnish delegation returned home on November 13, taking for granted that the negotiations would continue in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} D-21 {{that had}} {{disappeared}} on the first operational flight was finally revealed in February 1986 when an official from the CIA returned a panel to Ben Rich {{that he had been}} given by a Soviet KGB agent. The drone had self-destructed over Siberia and <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> recovered the wreckage. The Tupolev design bureau reverse-engineered the wreck and produced plans for a Soviet copy, named the Voron (Raven), but it was never built.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} renamed Weser, but work was ceased in June 1943, before the {{conversion}} was completed. The unfinished vessel was {{then transferred to}} Königsberg, where she remained {{for the rest of}} the war. On 29 January 1945, the ship was scuttled before the advancing Soviet Red Army could seize her. The Soviet Navy nevertheless considered using the wreck for parts to complete the cruiser , a sister-ship of Seydlitz <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> purchased unfinished before the outbreak of war. This was not carried out, however, and the ship was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} of Zeppelin {{involved}} a delay until 21 May, {{on the basis}} that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> asked for them to be synchronised with their own invasion plans. This ran from 21 April until 9 May, when a major revision to the plans (stage four) was introduced. The Twelfth Army and Polish forces would land in Albania and Croatia, bypassing Greece due to mutiny within Allied Greek forces in Africa, with an invasion set in June. A major invasion of Southern France was also added, codenamed Vendetta.|$|E
5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> no more than 25 ICBMs and {{would not be able to}} add more for some time.|$|E

5|$|At around 04:00 on 5 July, the German attack {{commenced}} with {{a preliminary}} bombardment. Manstein's main attack was delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, which was organized into densely concentrated spearheads. Opposing the 4th Panzer Army was the Soviet 6th Guards Army, which {{was composed of}} the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 23rd Guards Rifle Corps. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> constructed three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces. Though they had been provided superb intelligence, the Voronezh Front headquarters had still {{not been able to}} pinpoint the exact location where the Germans would place their offensive weight.|$|E
5|$|Baliszewski and Tadeusz Kisielewski {{are among}} those who point out the {{opportunity}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> at Gibraltar. At {{about the same time}} that Sikorski's plane was left unguarded at the Gibraltar airfield, a Soviet plane was parked nearby; it carried Soviet ambassador Ivan Maisky, giving the Soviets an officially confirmed presence {{at the site of the}} accident. The head of the British Secret Intelligence Service's counterintelligence for the Iberian Peninsula from 1941 to 1944 was Kim Philby, the Soviet double agent who would defect in 1963 and later claim to have been a double agent since the 1940s. Before 1941, Philby had served as an instructor with the Special Operations Executive, an organization specializing in sabotage and diversion behind enemy lines.|$|E
5|$|Chlomo {{missed his}} freedom by three months. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were {{making their way}} towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is {{transferred}} to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E

50|$|This was {{despite the}} fact that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union <b>had</b> {{invested}} enormously to agriculture. Production costs were very high, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union <b>had</b> to import food, and it had widespread food shortages even though the country had a large share of the best agricultural soil in the world and a high land/population ratio.|$|R
5|$|Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev was {{intended}} as the main Soviet offensive for 1943. Its aim was to destroy the 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf, and cut off the extended southern portion of Army Group South. After the heavy losses sustained by the Voronezh Front, during Operation Citadel, the Soviets needed time to regroup and refit, delaying {{the start of the}} offensive until 3 August. Diversionary attacks, launched two weeks earlier across the Donets and Mius Rivers into the Donbass, drew the attention of German reserves and thinned the defending forces that would face the main blow. The offensive was initiated by the Voronezh Front and Steppe Fronts against the northern wing of Army Group South. They drove through the German positions, making broad and deep penetrations. By 5 August, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> liberated Belgorod.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army {{allocated}} {{an estimated}} 1,100,000 personnel, 804 tanks, 13,400 artillery pieces and over 1,000 aircraft {{for the upcoming}} offensive. Across the Third Romanian Army, the Soviets placed the redeployed 5th Tank Army, {{as well as the}} 21st and 65th Armies, in order to penetrate and overrun the German flanks. The German southern flank was targeted by the Stalingrad Front's 51st and 57th Armies, led by the 13th and 4th Mechanized Corps; these would punch through the Fourth Romanian Army, in order to link up with the 5th Tank Army near the town of Kalach. In total, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> amassed 11 armies and various independent tank brigades and corps.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>had</b> {{planned to}} provide China with {{an atomic bomb}} {{complete}} with full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead. When Khrushchev {{paid a visit to}} China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and Khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit. Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader Peng Zhen mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{cooperation}} in the Arctic has gained momentum {{during the last two}} years. Thechanging attitude of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, <b>the</b> most advanced Arctic state in this respect, has {{played a crucial role in}} this evolution. This article, which focusses on non-Soviet research efforts in Soviet Arctic waters, concludes that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union <b>has</b> lately given a clear signal by allowing foreigners, after many years of repeated refusal, to conduct marine scientific research close to its own coasts. In doing so <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>have</b> further clarified <b>the</b> legal status of their northern waters. © 1991, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

50|$|The theory {{continues}} that Japanese-Soviet relations, and Japanese-Russian relations {{before and}} after the existence of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, <b>have</b> been in some ways secretive and mysterious.
