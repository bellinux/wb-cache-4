50|$|In the past, {{letters rogatory}} could not usually be {{transmitted}} directly between the applicable courts, {{and had to}} be transmitted via consular or diplomatic channels, which could make the whole process very slow. There have been various international conventions in regard to service of process and <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> One of the earliest conventions to simplify the procedure of Letters Rogatory was the 1905 Civil Procedure Convention, signed at The Hague. Drafted only in French, it was only ratified by 22 countries. Later conventions, created after the institution of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, drafted in both English and French commanded more support. The Hague Service Convention, ratified in 1965, enabled designated authorities in each of the signatory states to transmit documents for service to each other, bypassing the diplomatic route. This convention has been ratified by 60 states including the United Kingdom and the United States, neither of whom had ratified the 1905 convention. The Hague Evidence Convention, ratified in 1970, formalised procedures for <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> This convention has been ratified by 43 states. For situations exclusively among Member States of the European Union, two regulations, 1348/2000 and 1206/2001 superseded the two Hague Conventions.

The Supreme Court can then assess the master's ruling much as a normal appeals court would, rather than conduct the trial itself.

There are several existing justifications for conditionalisation, but none directly addresses the idea that conditionalisation will be epistemically rational {{if and only if}} it can reasonably be expected to lead to epistemically good outcomes. We apply the approach of cognitive decision theory to provide a justification for conditionalisation using precisely that idea. We assign epistemic utility functions to epistemically rational agents; an agent's epistemic utility is to depend both upon the actual state of the world and on the agent's credence distribution over possible states. We prove that, under independently motivated conditions, conditionalisation is the unique updating rule that maximizes expected epistemic utility...|$|R
