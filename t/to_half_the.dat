5|$|A mugging {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E

By 1872, the only principal European countries not to have adopted the metric system were Russia and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E

5|$|As the Industrial Revolution {{began in}} the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, the Welsh metal mines {{declined}} and mining in Cornwall and Devon became viable once more. Women and girls were recruited in large numbers for work in ore processing. Women and children accounted for up <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> workers in the area's copper mines. Although machinery was capable of performing much of the work done by bal maidens, the industry grew so quickly that the number of women and girls working grew steadily even though their numbers fell as a proportion of the workforce to 15–20% by 1850. At the peak of the Cornish mining boom, in around 1860, at least 6000 bal maidens were working at the region's mines; the actual number is likely to have been much higher. While it was not unusual for girls to become bal maidens at the age of six and to work into old age, they generally began at around age 10 or 11 and left work once they married.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Captain Mends on Arethusa, {{casualties}} were severe on both sides. Amethyst had eight killed and 37 wounded from {{a crew of}} 222, while the French ship lost 47 killed and 73 wounded from a crew of 339. Recriminations among the British officers began within minutes of the French surrender: Mends took possession of Niémen and sent a note to Seymour informing {{him that he had}} seized the valuable French nautical charts and the French captain's personal stores. The note also requested that Seymour send back Arethusas surgeon, who had gone aboard Amethyst to assist with the wounded, so that Mends could be ready to leave without notice. Seymour, who was still effecting hasty repairs and dealing with his casualties, responded angrily, forcing Mends to back down and return the stores. Seymour was also annoyed by Mends' late arrival, which meant that Arethusa was entitled <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> prize money from the captured frigate without having done any of the fighting. Repairs were completed on 7 April, and Amethyst and Niémen limped back to Plymouth, arriving on 13 April.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian pale, a pale {{division}} amounting <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> entire field, {{derived from}} the Canadian flag, is widely used in Canadian heraldry, while the Canadian fess, a similar horizontal division, has been used once. The term érablé, referring to maple leaves, is often used in Canadian arms. For example, as a tressure érablé {{in the arms of}} the Monarchist League of Canada, coronets érablé in the arms of Sudbury and Canada's National History Society, and as a partition much like engrailed or dancetty. Canadian animals and birds, both real and fantastical, have also been widely used in arms, including the mythical raven-bears in the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch bid {{to control}} {{southeast}} Asia's spice trade hinged on two principal strategies: the first: {{the first was}} to directly attack Iberian assets in the region, including Portugal's stronghold at Malacca and Spanish shipping between Manila and Acapulco; the second was to forge alliances with local rulers and offer protection in exchange for trading concessions. An important alliance was consolidated in 1603 when Dutch East India Company ships joined forces with the Sultanate of Johor to capture the Santa Catarina, a Portuguese carrack transiting the Singapore Straits. The vessel's pillaged cargo was later sold in Europe for approximately 3.5million florins, equivalent <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> Dutch East India Company's paid capital and double that of the British East India Company. Soon after this triumph, possibly in 1605, Dutch officers presented the Seri Rambai to Johor's sultan.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to sing and play the improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> normal speed; eventually they learned to sing and play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E
5|$|V. thapsus is a {{dicotyledonous}} {{plant that}} produces a rosette of leaves {{in its first year}} of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n=36.|$|E
50|$|During {{positive}} climb, {{the crystal}} shrinks {{in the direction}} perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extra <b>half</b> plane of atoms because atoms are being removed from <b>the</b> <b>half</b> plane. Since negative climb involves an addition of atoms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>half</b> plane, <b>the</b> crystal grows in the direction perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>half</b> plane. Therefore, compressive stress in the direction perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>half</b> plane promotes positive climb, while tensile stress promotes negative climb. This is one main difference between slip and climb, since slip is caused by only shear stress.|$|R

5|$|Værøy Airport {{had opened}} on 1 July 1986 {{as part of}} the {{regional}} airport network in Northern Norway operated by Widerøe. Prior to this, Værøy and Røst had been served by helicopters using a heliport; that had replaced previous services with seaplanes. All services to the airport were suspended immediately after the incident. On 7 May, Widerøe stated that they would not use Værøy Airport, and that they would decline the concession to operate to Værøy if the island community did not receive a new airport. They commented that the restrictions caused by the wind forced the airline to terminate up <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> departures. The chairman of the Widerøe's Pilots' Union, Cpt. Helge Høvik, stated the same day that the airline might have to lower the number of calls at some other regional airports, namely Mosjøen Airport, Kjærstad, Mo i Rana Airport, Røssvold, Sandnessjøen Airport, Stokka and Sandane Airport, Anda. Høvik stated that he felt that many of the airports were located in the wrong place, for instance at the bottom of valleys, on top of hills and between mountains. Widerøe stated that there was not a safety problem at any other regional airports.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Bostwick scored in Stevenage's 2–1 {{pre-season}} victory at Dagenham & Redbridge on 30 July 2011. A week later, he started in Stevenage's first ever League One fixture, a 0–0 draw against Exeter City. Three days after the draw, on 9 August, Bostwick scored his first goal of the campaign in a 4–3 extra-time defeat to Championship team Peterborough United, scoring with a 25-yard shot that took the match to extra-time. In Stevenage's next league fixture, a 1–1 draw away at Chesterfield, he was sent-off after receiving two yellow cards, resulting in a one-match suspension. Bostwick signed a two-year contract extension with the club on 26 August 2011. He scored his second goal of the 2011–12 season in Stevenage's 5–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, with his 25-yard half-volley rebounding off of the post and into the net to give Stevenage a three-goal lead in the first-half. Bostwick was also instrumental in the club's 6–1 away victory at Colchester United on 26 December, scoring one goal and assisting another. His goal restored Stevenage's two-goal cushion in the match on the hour mark, before he assisted Scott Laird from a well-worked free-kick routine ten minutes later. He beat his goal tally from the previous season when he scored his fourth goal of the campaign in Stevenage's 4–2 victory against Milton Keynes Dons at Broadhall Way on 24 January 2012, with Bostwick restoring parity in the first-half with a long-range strike. Bostwick also scored in a 2–2 draw against Huddersfield Town on 28 February 2012, heading in Joel Byrom's cross <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> deficit as Stevenage fought back to earn a point after being two goals down. He scored two goals in as many matches in late March 2012, both of which were long-range strikes that drew Stevenage level in matches against Walsall and Bournemouth respectively. Four days after the goal against Bournemouth, Bostwick was on the scoresheet once again, his third goal within the space of a week, scoring late-on to give Stevenage a brief lead in an eventual draw against Wycombe Wanderers. He was almost ever-present during the campaign, playing 53 times and scoring eight goals, as Stevenage narrowly lost over two legs in the play-off semi-final. During his successful four seasons with the club, Bostwick made 207 appearances, scoring 22 goals.|$|E
