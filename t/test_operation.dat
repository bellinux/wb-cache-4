5|$|In February 1981, {{the long-standing}} {{operator}} Orpington & District collapsed due to financial difficulties, so Tillingbourne decided {{to launch a}} <b>test</b> <b>operation</b> of three former O services. These proved successful, so more services were added and two new AEC Reliance coaches purchased for the operation. In July 1981, the Orpington operation was given a separate licence, under the name Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited, with six vehicles allocated to it. By 1983, however, {{it became clear that}} the local area management of Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) wanted to develop the business in a different way from that of the main company. On 24 September 1983, the Orpington operation's directors, Gary Wood and Peter Larking, bought out the subsidiary to form Metrobus Limited.|$|E
5|$|During {{her return}} from Korea, Sydney ferried Spitfires and Vampires between several British bases in Southeast Asia. After a brief refit, Sydney {{embarked}} the 20th CAG in June 1952, before proceeding on a round-Australia cruise. The carrier visited Manus Island, was present {{off the coast}} of the Montebello Islands for the first British atomic bomb <b>test,</b> <b>Operation</b> Hurricane, on 3 October, and arrived back in her namesake city in November. On 25 March 1953, Sydney departed for England with representatives from each of the three branches of the Australian and New Zealand militaries for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The carrier and her aircraft participated in the Coronation Fleet Review on 15 June, and visited Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, Panama, Hawaii, and New Zealand on the return voyage, before reaching Sydney on 15 August. The carrier's 10,000th deck landing occurred during this voyage: a Firefly completed the landing on 17 July, while Sydney was en route to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} first {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the Cambrian Line between Aberystwyth and Pwllheli by the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway around 1861-2. It was designed by Benjamin Piercy and Henry Conybeare in 1864, and opened on 10 October 1867. Conybeare decided to construct the viaduct from timber as it would be cheaper to import by sea than iron. As built, it included a wooden lifting drawbridge section at the northern end to permit the passage of tall ships. It was never in regular use since the opening of the railway killed off competition from boat traffic. In 1899, the drawbridge arrangement was changed to the current swing bridge arrangement. It is still theoretically in operation, though it has not been opened since 1987 as part of a <b>test</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 23 February 1948, No.23 Squadron was redesignated No. 6 Squadron. The {{unit was}} based at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland and {{equipped}} with Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. No 6 Squadron formed part of No.82 Wing, and was {{primarily responsible for}} training aircrews to serve with the wing's two front line units; No.1 and No.2 Squadrons. Its training effort was increased from 1950 when No.1 Squadron was deployed to Malaya as part of Australia's contribution to the Malayan Emergency. During October that year three of No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were deliberately flown through the cloud which resulted from the first British atomic bomb <b>test</b> (<b>Operation</b> Hurricane) {{which took place in}} the Montebello Islands off Western Australian. These aircraft had the role of determining the level of radioactivity caused by the atomic blast, and No.6 Squadron performed similar duties for the subsequent British atomic bomb tests at Maralinga, South Australia. Several Lincolns were so heavily contaminated with radioactivity during these flights that they could not be flown again. The squadron lost three Lincolns in one day on 8 April 1953 when one was written off after its undercarriage collapsed while landing at Amberley and a further two were destroyed when they collided on the ground at Cloncurry, Queensland; no aircrew were injured in these accidents.|$|E

After successfully completing her first oceanographic survey in July, she embarked on her first oceanographic cruise on 20 August. On 20 September, the ship performed the first survey of the Montebello Islands following the British atomic <b>test,</b> <b>Operation</b> Hurricane. On 22 October, Diamantina carried out the first survey of the waters around Christmas Island.|$|E

The project was formally dedicated and began <b>test</b> <b>operations</b> in May 1982.

25|$|The {{conversion}} of the Josephine Lawrence began 11 September 1943. The U.S. Army Transportation Corps (TC) had {{the lead in the}} {{conversion of}} the ships to Corps of Engineers specifications and then turned over to the Engineers for operations. The converted ship had been promised by TC for 15 January 1944 almost on the schedule required by the European command. Delays, shortages of materials, workers and intense competition from other requirements pushed that date even further into February and then 19 April 1944. On initial <b>test</b> <b>operation</b> the TC found the generators it had specified were insufficient and replacement was required. The Corps of Engineers crews had been trained ashore separately from the ships and thus had to join the ships to learn the practical details. The Junior N. Van Noy, the first of the port repair ships to be ready, sailed from Mobile, Alabama in late April with an Engineers crew sent from Fort Belvoir to Philadelphia for final preparation before deployment overseas. The crew was an organized, designated Corps of Engineers unit designated as an Engineer Port Repair Ship Crew.|$|E
2500|$|The First Battle of Fort McAllister was {{a series}} of naval attacks that took place from January 27 to March 3, 1863, in Bryan County, Georgia, during the American Civil War.

2500|$|The British {{relationship}} with the United States did not suffer lasting consequences from the crisis. [...] "The Anglo-American 'special relationship' was revitalised immediately after the Suez Crisis," [...] writes Risse Kappen. [...] The United States wanted to restore the prestige of its closest ally and thus [...] "The two governments... engaged in almost ritualistic reassurances that their 'special relationship' would be restored quickly". One example came with Britain's first Hydrogen bomb <b>test</b> <b>Operation</b> Grapple {{which led to the}} 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement. Six years after the crisis, the Americans amazed the British by selling them state-of-the-art missile technology at a moderate cost, which became the UK Polaris programme.|$|E

2500|$|For example, Boeing has {{maintained}} longstanding relationships since 1974 with Japanese suppliers including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries by which {{these companies have}} had increasing involvement on successive Boeing jet programs, a process which has helped Boeing achieve almost total dominance of the Japanese market for commercial jets. Outsourcing was extended on the 787 {{to the extent that}} Boeing's own involvement was reduced to little more than project management, design, assembly and <b>test</b> <b>operation,</b> outsourcing most of the actual manufacturing all around the world.
