Inside Man is Plummer's second collaboration with Lee and Washington, following 1992's Malcolm X. He described Case as a [...] "wonderful, rich head of all sorts of organizations — I suppose a kind of 'Enron creature' — who runs banks and other world businesses.

500|$|After Victoria's {{divorce from}} Ernst, Grand Duke Kirill, whom Victoria {{had seen on}} all her {{subsequent}} visits to Russia, was discouraged by his parents from <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> close relationship with her. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna told Kirill to keep Victoria as his mistress and marry someone else. A few months later, war broke out between Russia and Japan. As {{a senior member of}} the navy, Kirill was sent on active service to the front in the Russo-Japanese War. His ship was blown up by a Japanese mine while entering Port Arthur and he was one of the few survivors. Sent home to recover, the Tsar finally allowed him permission to leave Russia and he left for Coburg to be with Victoria. The narrow escape from death had hardened Kirill's determination to marry Victoria. [...] "To those over whom the shadow of death has passed, life has a new meaning," [...] Kirill wrote in his memoirs. [...] "It is like daylight. And I was now within visible reach of fulfillment of the dream of my life. Nothing would cheat me of it now. I had gone through much. Now, at last, the future lay radiant before me." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1968, Smith {{began to}} feel large amounts of {{pressure}} from the music business. The stress of touring, recording, promoting, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> personal life led Smith to contemplate the possibility of suicide. Although she thought about suicide, Smith later clarified that she never saw the idea as an actual possibility. These pressures eventually led Smith to seek solace in both her family life and religion, becoming a Born Again Christian {{in the spring of}} 1968. Although she did not give up her music career completely, Smith did balance it with a lighter schedule in order to avoid stress. In 1968 and 1969, Smith also began to record darker songs, including the single [...] "Ribbon of Darkness", among others. Smith stated that it was reflection on her personal life, after recently divorcing her first husband Jerry Smith. Despite her recent personal troubles, Smith continued to enjoy the same commercial success she had before. In 1969 her next single [...] "You and Your Sweet Love" [...] (written by Bill Anderson) reached No.6 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. This was followed by another top ten single in 1970, entitled [...] "I Never Once Stopped Loving You", which reached No.5 on the same singles chart. Between 1969 and 1970, Smith released two collaborative albums with American country artist Nat Stuckey called Young Love and Sunday Morning with Nat Stuckey and Connie Smith, the latter of which was a gospel album.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Lundgren {{starred in}} The Last Warrior as Captain Nick Preston under {{director}} Sheldon Lettich. This post apocalyptic movie {{is set in}} 2006 {{in the context of}} a 9.5-magnitude earthquake which kills millions of people, with Preston leading a motley military patrol on the island to help survivors in the pole shift-affected world. The film was partly shot in Eilat, Israel. Later in 2000, Dolph appeared in Damian Lee's Agent Red (also known as Captured), alongside Alexander Kuznetsov, Natalie Radford and Randolph Mantooth. The film is set during the Cold War, and is about two soldiers trapped on a submarine with a group of terrorists who plan to use a chemical weapon against the United States. Lundgren's character, Matt Hendricks, must work with his wife, a virologist, to prevent the scenario occurring. After the film was completed, producer Andrew Stevens thought it was too poor to be released and multiple people had to be hired to at least make the film half-competent. The film was very poorly received, given its [...] "shoestring budget"; the DVD and Film Guide of 2005 wrote, [...] "low-budget mess stars Dolph Lundgren as a navy special operations commander <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> deadly virus out of the hands of terrorists. This subpar effort sinks to the bottom of the ocean in a tidal wave of cliche." [...] During an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in May 2008, Gladiator director Ridley Scott said Lundgren had been considered for the part of undefeated fighter Tigris of Gaul in 2000, but was eventually rejected because [...] "as an actor, he just didn't fit in with what we were trying to achieve".|$|E
500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E

2500|$|According to Simon Price of The Independent, [...] "It Ain't Easy" [...] is {{reminiscent}} of [...] "Rock Is Dead" [...] by Marilyn Manson. Alex Roginski of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song [...] "utilises electro clash for a grinding foray into R" [...] K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic noted that the song [...] "pits a menacingly swung, twangy guitar riff", which according to him is [...] "lifted so blatantly" [...] from Depeche Mode's song, [...] "Personal Jesus". Buchanan spoke of the song's lyrical content and meaning, saying: [...] "It's basically about us as people. It's not easy being where we are now, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> balance between normality and doing this. When you're content within yourself, you should know how you are, and people around us know what we're like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Production {{went very}} well, and as {{expected}} {{with so many}} comic actors and personalities around, was very lively. During production, Hudlin said that whenever David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence worked, the film's crew usually worked a little slower because wherever they were, there {{would be so much}} comedy being generated and they were so funny that everyone wanted to hang out near where they were throughout the day. In the scene where the new fragrance is being presented to Strangé, the director said that [...] "what Grace was doing on the set while we were shooting was so funny that I remember Halle crying off camera, cause she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> straight face but she couldn't. So whenever she was off-camera, she would just be literally crying because she was laughing so hard. And fortunately, for her reaction shots she was able to recover." ...|$|E

Gort had {{foreseen}} the order and preliminary plans were already in hand. The first such plan, for a defence along the Lys Canal, could not be carried out because of German advances on 26 May, with the 2nd and 50th Divisions pinned down, and the 1st, 5th and 48th Divisions under heavy attack. The 2nd Division took heavy casualties <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> corridor open, being reduced to brigade strength, but they succeeded; the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 42nd Divisions escaped along the corridor that day, as did {{about one-third of the}} French First Army.

Both drivers ended with no points after finally retiring from the event. In Ireland, during 1st Rally Ireland almost the same happened– Marcus Grönholm overcooked a slippery right corner on one of the early stages, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> fast pace, and had to retire from the rally. Loeb made use of his rival's mistake and, by making no major mistakes, although having some suspension-related problems with keeping pace at the beginning, he added 10 points to his account, moving ahead of the Finnish driver just one round before the season's end. In Wales he was not fighting for the win, focusing mostly on securing his advantage, finishing the event third– on [...] 2007 Loeb became World Rally Champion for the fourth time in a row.|$|E
2500|$|Lister's Republican {{division}} attacked Teruel, in falling snow, on December 15, 1937, without preliminary aerial or artillery bombardments. Lister {{and fellow}} commander Colonel Enrique Fernández Heredia moved to surround the town. [...] They immediately gained {{a position on}} Teruel's Tooth, and by evening encircled the city. [...] Rey d'Harcourt pulled his defenses into the town, and by December 17 gave up <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> foothold on Teruel's Tooth. Francisco Franco, Nationalist Commander, finally decided on December 23 to aid the defenders at Teruel, having decided {{as a matter of}} policy that no provincial capital must fall to the Republicans. [...] Such a loss would be a political failure, and Franco determined to make no concession. [...] He had just started a major offensive at Guadalajara, and to relieve Teruel meant he had to abandon that offensive, much to the disgust of his Italian and German allies. The Nationalist relief of Teruel also signified that Franco was giving up the idea of a knockout blow to end the war, and was accepting a long war of attrition to be won by weight of arms and foreign aid.|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{produced}} an Audience Research report for episodes one, five and seven. Many respondents criticised the serial for being slow {{and full of}} scientific terminology. However, as the serial progressed, viewers became more enthusiastic; after episode five, one viewer said, [...] "The serial, like Andromeda herself, suddenly came alive. This episode was spine-chilling". Another commented [...] "I didn't like the way Andromeda was created – it is absolutely against Christian belief". J.A.K. Fraser of Dornock, Scotland, wrote to the BBC's correspondence programme Points of View, saying, [...] "Enough surely has been seen of Prof. Fleming's overacted hysterical outbursts". Writing to the Radio Times, B.W. Wolfe of Basingstoke said, [...] "Congratulations on the recent BBC-tv science-fiction serial A for Andromeda. Bug-eyed monsters we have seen before, but never a creature so radiantly beautiful as Andromeda herself. I was completely captivated". Other letter writers to the Radio Times discussed the scientific accuracy of the serial including one correspondent, C.W. Bartlett of Watford, who wrote to inform readers that the reference to DNA (then newly discovered) was not a fictional substance but really existed. This was expounded upon by the Daily Mail which drew comparisons {{with the creation of}} Andromeda and an announcement from Italy and Russia that scientists had fertilised a human egg outside of the womb; [...] "These are tough times for the science fiction writer", the paper wrote, [...] "Jules Verne and H.
