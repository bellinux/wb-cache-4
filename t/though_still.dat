5|$|In 2009, {{the live}} album Still Dangerous was released, which {{features}} {{material from the}} 20 October 1977 gig at Philadelphia that was used for some of Live and Dangerous. There is some overlap of tracks between the two albums, <b>though</b> <b>Still</b> Dangerous is completely live with no overdubs.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{assessments}} of the Home Army's activities in Lithuania have been controversial. In 1993, the Home Army's activities there were investigated by a special Lithuanian government commission. Only {{in recent years have}} Polish and Lithuanian historians been able to approach consensus, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> differing in their interpretations of many events.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett's {{earliest}} Discworld novels {{were written}} largely to parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science-fiction); as the series progressed, Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely, and the Discworld series evolved into straightforward (<b>though</b> <b>still</b> comedic) satire.|$|E

5|$|While {{passing through}} the Bahamas, David brought 70–80 mph (115–130 km/h) winds to Andros Island as the eye crossed the archipelago. David, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> disorganized, {{produced}} heavy rainfall in the country peaking at 8 inches (200 mm). Strong wind gusts uprooted trees, and overall damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|After years, Ulmo {{returned}} to Beleriand {{to seek out}} the remaining Teleri. As Elwë had not yet been found, a great part of the Teleri took his brother Olwë as their leader and were ferried to Valinor. Some Teleri stayed behind <b>though,</b> <b>still</b> looking for Elwë, and others stayed on the shores, being called by Ossë. They took Círdan as their leader and became the Falathrim. All Teleri who stayed in Beleriand later became known as the Sindar.|$|E
5|$|Despite the project's termination, the two {{companies}} continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> expensive, project catering {{to the needs of}} the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items—such as the larger Pegasus engine—McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{was seen}} by Pocket Gamer UK to be yet another {{iteration}} of the series on mobile platforms, though the game still stands on its own given the numerous other music-based games for mobile phones. They praised {{the ability to use}} higher-quality versions of the songs <b>though</b> <b>still</b> allowing those with limited data plans to enjoy the game with the MIDI versions.|$|E
5|$|The Anatomy Act 1832 {{ended the}} {{dissection}} of murderers, {{and most of}} the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, so by the 1850s The Four Stages of Cruelty had come to be viewed as a somewhat historical series, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> one with the power to shock, a power it retains for a modern audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} advocated is transporting sulfates {{into the}} next higher layer of the atmosphere - stratosphere. Aerosols in the stratosphere last years instead of weeks - so only a relatively smaller (<b>though</b> <b>still</b> large) amount of sulfate emissions would be necessary, and side effects would be less. This would require developing {{an efficient way to}} transport large amounts of gases into stratosphere, many of which have been proposed though none are known to be effective or economically viable.|$|E

Meanwhile, Olivia and Peter attempt to reconcile and rekindle their relationship. <b>Though</b> <b>still</b> cautious about moving forward, Olivia and Peter kiss and head to the bedroom upstairs at the Bishops' home.|$|E
5|$|With Grisélidis and Cendrillon complete, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> {{awaiting}} performance, Massenet {{began work}} on Sapho, based on a novel by Daudet about the love of an innocent young man from {{the country for a}} worldly-wise Parisienne. It was given at the Opéra-Comique in November 1897, with great success, though it has been neglected since the composer's death. His next work staged there was Cendrillon, his version of the Cinderella story, which was well received in May 1899.|$|E
5|$|After another bright start, Oxford led {{the table}} {{several times in}} the first half of the 2013–14 season. On 25 January 2014, with the club faltering <b>though</b> <b>still</b> in the {{play-off}} places, Wilder resigned as manager to take up the reins at relegation-threatened Northampton. Mickey Lewis subsequently became the caretaker manager for a second time for the club. On 22 March 2014, Gary Waddock was appointed the head coach of the club after a lengthy interview process, leaving his job as Head of Coaching at MK Dons. Under Lewis and Waddock, Oxford slipped out of the play-off places in the final few weeks of the season, finishing a disappointing eighth in the table, nine points off the last playoff place.|$|E

5|$|Amalthea orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of 181000km (2.54Jupiter radii). The orbit of Amalthea has an eccentricity of 0.003 and an inclination of 0.37° relative to the equator of Jupiter. Such appreciably nonzero values of inclination and eccentricity, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> small, are unusual for an inner satellite and {{can be explained by the}} influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io: in the past Amalthea has passed through several mean-motion resonances with Io that have excited its inclination and eccentricity (in a mean-motion resonance the ratio of orbital periods of two bodies is a rational number like m:n).|$|E
5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, <b>though,</b> <b>still</b> flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{assessments}} in the Philippines began on October31, with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas. With numerous roads blocked off or washed away, clearing operations were a priority. The Philippine Red Cross {{assisted in the}} immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron, evacuating people in La Union and providing relief goods to more than 16,000people in Aurora. The majority of relief work was handled by local governments, though some assistance from the National Disaster Coordinating Council was received. By November1, the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3.2million PHP (US$81,000). Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron's aftermath. Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later, Typhoon Chebi struck nearly the same areas. A weaker, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> powerful typhoon, damage from Chebi was relatively limited.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th {{century the}} area around the Bastille {{developed}} further. Early modern Paris continued to grow, {{and by the end of}} the century it had around 250,000 inhabitants and was one of the most populous cities in Europe, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> largely contained within its old city walls – open countryside remained beyond the Bastille. The Arsenal, a large military-industrial complex tasked with the production of cannons and other weapons for the royal armies, was established to the south of the Bastille by Francis I, and substantially expanded under Charles IX. An arms depot was later built above the Porte Saint-Antoine, all making the Bastille part of a major military centre.|$|E
5|$|Handel's {{earliest}} opera compositions, in the German style, {{date from}} his Hamburg years, 1704–06, {{under the influence}} of Johann Mattheson. In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, <b>though</b> <b>still</b> reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.|$|E
