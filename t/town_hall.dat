40|$|Purpose – This study {{seeks to}} analyse {{the links between}} strategies, {{structures}} and processes {{in the case of}} the largest Spanish <b>town</b> <b>halls,</b> using the Miles and Snow's models about organisational strategies, and asking the following questions: “What is the situation of municipal services' outsourcing in the largest Spanish town halls?”; “Do Spanish <b>town</b> <b>halls</b> follow the strategies suggested in Miles and Snow's model?”; and “Is there a relationship between the strategic position adopted by <b>town</b> <b>halls</b> and their stance on outsourcing?”. Design/methodology/approach – In order to achieve these aims a questionnaire was administered to the human resource managers in the <b>town</b> <b>halls</b> of the largest Spanish cities. Findings – The paper finds that outsourcing is a complement, which seeks to improve the services delivered, and local institutions do not resort to it due to a lack of internal resources but as a way to complement their own capabilities. Originality/value – The paper has identified three distinct strategic profiles in the <b>town</b> <b>halls</b> interviewed which coincide with the profiles that Miles and Snow call prospective, defensive and reactive strategies. It reveals that <b>town</b> <b>halls</b> which outsource to a greater extent are the ones which identify more with the prospective or reactive strategy, whereas those which outsource less are closer to the defensive strategy. This work was supported by the University of Alicante (Spain) – Vicerrectorado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación (GRE- 09 - 08) and by Valencia Government – Consellería de Educación de la Generalitat Valenciana (GV 72011 / 029) ...|$|R
