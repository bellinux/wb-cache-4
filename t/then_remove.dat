5|$|During the Postclassic period, {{the most}} common form of human {{sacrifice}} was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid. Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The officiating priest would <b>then</b> <b>remove</b> his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolized the rebirth of life. Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.|$|E

25|$|An {{evacuation}} {{system was}} installed on Knott's Berry Farm's Windseeker.

25|$|The {{dismantling}} of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays {{will create a}} temporary community to service a mine site, building all the accommodation, shops and services required, and <b>then</b> <b>remove</b> them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings {{can be used to}} facilitate the process. A gold rush would often bring intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.|$|E
25|$|McGrath was {{regarded}} as one of the best fast bowlers in the world and has had success against every opposition team, in both Test and one-day cricket. He deliberately (and publicly) targeted the opposition's best batsmen prior to a series in an attempt to distract them, a ploy which regularly worked. At the beginning of the Frank Worrell series against the West Indies he stated in interviews before the match, that he would dismiss Sherwin Campbell for his 299th wicket, <b>then</b> <b>remove</b> star batsman Brian Lara for his 300th wicket the very next ball. In a masterstroke this happened as planned, following this with the dismissal of captain Jimmy Adams to complete a memorable hat trick. The targeting of opposition batsmen was generally successful; he dismissed Mike Atherton of England 19 times – the most times any batsman has been dismissed by one bowler in cricket history. On the other hand, he targeted Michael Vaughan prior to the 2002/03 Ashes series in Australia, with Vaughan going on to score three centuries at an average greater than 60. He targeted Andrew Strauss in the 2005 series in England, who went on to score two centuries.|$|E

The video then changes to the two walking onto the brightly lighted stage, singing the chorus, and then being joined by Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas who sing the second verse. The entire group is then shown on the stage as they sing the chorus. Kevin and Joe Jonas <b>then</b> <b>remove</b> a curtain covering the background of stage to reveal a sky-painted backdrop in which Selena Gomez and Kevin Jonas proceed to sing the third verse.

The video ends with the group jumping onto and sitting on a couch in the middle of the park with the crowd stopping in the background to watch the sunset.|$|E
500|$|The named plaintiff, Clyde Reed, is {{the pastor}} of Good News Community Church. The church is a [...] "small, cash-strapped entity that own no building" [...] and held {{services}} in elementary schools and other buildings in Gilbert, Arizona. On the original docket, the name was Good News Presbyterian Church because according to Reed, the church's name has actually [...] "vacillated" [...] between that and Good News Community Church. Because the briefs had used [...] "Community", the District Court used it as well. To advertise their services, the church placed fifteen-to-twenty temporary signs in various locations around Gilbert. The signs would typically include the church's name {{as well as the}} location and time of services. Members of the church [...] "would post the signs early in the day on Saturday and <b>then</b> <b>remove</b> them around midday on Sunday". However, the town's Sign Code compliance manager cited the church on two occasions, for exceeding time limits when displaying signs and for failing to include the date of the event on a sign, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Like all Silent Hill games, one of Silent Hill 3s {{influences}} is {{the film}} Jacob's Ladder: {{one of the}} subway platforms is named Bergen Street Station, the station Jacob was inquiring about {{at the beginning of}} the film. The developers also cited horror writer Stephen King as another of their influences. Silent Hill 3 incorporates references drawn from real life actors and actresses. Douglas Cartland's name came from American actor Douglas Fairbanks. The developers stated that his name [...] "just seemed to suit him" [...] and that there was no true connection to his namesake. During the sketching process, his character was modeled after actors Giancarlo Giannini and Ian Holm. It was noted that even during the concept designs that Cartland was designed as a middle-aged detective. Claudia Wolf's character was considered the most difficult to design. Early sketches revealed that the creators wanted to dress her like a holy woman, and at one point she had a shaved head, with her body covered with tattoos, however, the creators thought that this way of showing her malevolent side was too obvious. Eventually, the creators decided to model her on Julianne Moore, and <b>then</b> <b>remove</b> her eyebrows, so that the appearance was slightly skewed. She was first named [...] "Christie", but it was deemed too [...] "cute" [...] and the character was eventually named after Italian actress Claudia Cardinale. Vincent's name originated from actor Vincent Gallo in connection with his unshaven look. Early designs were based on actor Ethan Hawke and focused on capturing a look of [...] "derangement and moodiness." ...|$|E
