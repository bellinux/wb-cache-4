5|$|Copper {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of extraction. However, {{only a tiny fraction of}} these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil.|$|E
5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of consumption, these reserves {{are estimated to be}} depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.|$|E

40|$|We use the Cox {{proportional}} hazard {{model to}} investigate the probability of rating transitions using data for the period 1986 to 2005. Variables that capture <b>rating</b> history and <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> significantly affect <b>the</b> probability of a rating transition.
