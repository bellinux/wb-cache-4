5|$|Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University of Libya in Benghazi, before {{dropping}} out {{to join the}} military. Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata. The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change. Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly he refused <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>English</b> and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion {{that he was involved}} in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963. Such reports were ignored and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course.|$|E

40|$|Deaf {{international}} students are {{a vital part}} of the student population at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Those students arrive at RIT with a variety of English skills and at various levels. The objective of this study is to investigate how deaf {{international students}} improve their English skills once they arrive at RIT /NTID. Did they improve their English skills through Spoken American English, American Sign Systems (i. e. American Sign Language and/or Signed English), and/or English classes from NTID/RIT? Furthermore, participants were asked how they felt about <b>learning</b> <b>English</b> and if their feelings changed while attending NTID/RIT. Participants were selected by responding to a formal e-mail announcing the nature of this study and its goal. Data were collected, analyzed and placed into thematic categories related <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>English,</b> communication styles and feelings about improving their English. Findings show that, unlike American deaf students (Meath-Lang, 1980), deaf international students have generally positive experiences related <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>English.</b> However, their responses indicate confusing views about using sign language...|$|R
