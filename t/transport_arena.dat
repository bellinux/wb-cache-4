40|$|This paper {{presents}} a state-of-art review of {{why and how}} policies and policy lessons in the transport planning arena are transferred between cities. It begins by drawing on literature from the fields of political science, public administration, organisational learning and management to outline a conceptual framework for policy transfer and learning. This framework is then used to structure a review of policy transfer literature {{in the fields of}} transport and planning policy. Although there is only a limited amount of literature on policy transfer in this field, the findings suggest that transport has much in common with other areas of public policy in terms of the main aspects and influences on policy transfer. As well as being part of a process for introducing new ideas into countries or cities, policy transfer in the transport sector (as in other areas of public policy) can also be a highly politicised process that seeks to justify preferred solutions. Little is known about the relative importance of different parts of the transfer process or the extent to which learning about policies in other areas can influence the effectiveness of policy design in the <b>transport</b> <b>arena</b> and/or policy outcomes. The paper concludes with some research and methodological recommendations that may help to answer these questions. It is suggested that policy transfer concepts can be important to both practitioners and researchers in the <b>transport</b> <b>arena</b> given the pressures to seek solutions to accelerate progress to a more sustainable future...|$|E
40|$|Children’s {{physical}} mobility {{and access to}} transport is an issue commonly overlooked in the child rights context. However, {{the opportunity to be}} mobile, in order to access health and basic education services not available in close vicinity to the child’s residence, is crucial to many formal rights, notably Articles 24 and 28. Drawing principally on field evidence from four off-road villages in Gomoa district, southern Ghana, we review children’s patterns of access to education and health services, the implications of child poverty for access to motorised transport, limitations imposed by physique and smaller stature on ability to walk long distances, and associated vulnerability to traffic accidents. Because young people commonly lack power and access to decision-making processes in Ghana, their transport and mobility needs are even less likely to be met than those of other groups.

40|$|The {{place of}} women in {{transport}} planning and development has been marginal if not invisible. This {{has resulted in a}} lack of recognition of their needs and of the distributional impacts that current transport policy and directions have on women. It has also led to limited attention being paid to w o m e n and women's experiences in their use of both cars and public transport: their travel patterns and mobility issues remain largely unexplored. In addition, the current policy environment of privatisation and competition in the <b>transport</b> <b>arena</b> contributes to the exacerbation of women's disadvantaged status, and does little to encourage gender sensitivity in transport policies and practice. The thesis explores these issues with particular reference to the travel experiences of fifteen different w o m e n living in various parts of Melbourne and Victoria.

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} growth of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and their {{benefits}} for business processes, intermodal freight transport companies still face challenges in ICT adoption including low compatibility, low level of management support and insufficient awareness of the expected advantages. This may prevent companies from thoroughly deploying ICT, although the benefits of being proactive in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) adoption are largely documented. This study investigates the antecedents of ITS adoption in intermodal freight transport companies at both the levels of company and managers. This is important because the uptake of recent ICT advantages in the intermodal freight <b>transport</b> <b>arena</b> seems slow and the evidence on the determinants of such posteriori acceptability of ITS is limited in current applied ITS studies. We present a framework that identifies four broad categories of environmental, organisational, technological and individual characteristics, and show how these categories influence the decision-making process of both companies and managers to adopt ICT in intermodal freight industry. This adoption framework draws on theoretical perspectives in Technologic, Organization and Environmental (TOE) theory and Unified theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UATUA). We further discuss the implications of this research for academicians and practitioners...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSafety {{regulation}} can {{decrease the}} frequent accidents in sea transportation, but {{aspects of the}} existing regulations are found to contribute negatively to safety. Earlier studies suggest other framework conditions to influence maritime safety more than regulation, without reviewing {{the relation between the}} maritime context and regulation. Therefore, this paper explores maritime regulators’ safety-related decisions. The data consist of interviews with regulators and facts about other actors (i. e., politicians, shipping companies, interests groups, and the media) in the maritime <b>transport</b> <b>arena.</b> The findings, which are based on safety, decision-making, and arena theories, are not described by earlier research. Primarily, I find that a paralysis constrains safety regulation. Despite wanting a safe industry, transport competition leads the maritime actors to disagree about the priority of safety or profit, which paralyzes safety regulation development and constrains the regulators and their discretionary space (where they enforce the right safety regulations for the right sectors). Many of the decision criteria with which regulators must comply are forced upon them by others, so that regulators see them as constraints. Safety regulation is further weakened when market forces influence both regulation-making and enforcement. The findings demonstrate that industrial or political actors do not prioritize safety in practice; however, safety priority could lift maritime transport above the choice between safety and survival...|$|E

Flight training is an intense activity during which the Flight Instructor is subject to many factors causing fatigue, both physiological and psychological, many {{of which may be}} outside their immediate control. Considerations such as low pay mean that Flight Instructors often work long hours and often have another job which adds to their time at work each day, resulting in a decrease in their time available for sleep. Although considerable research has been done on pilot fatigue in the Air <b>Transport</b> <b>arena,</b> particularly on long-haul pilots, {{there is a lack of}} information about fatigue in other areas, particularly where Flight Instructors are concerned, as they are not involved in Air Transport Operations. This study examines the potential for fatigue in Flight Instructors in the General Aviation industry in New Zealand. To achieve this a Questionnaire and Time Diary were developed, based on previously used materials, and adapted for use in the flight instruction environment. This enabled the flight and duty times of Flight Instructors to be recorded, and subsequent investigation of any preventative strategies or operational countermeasures currently being used to help prevent fatigue. Interviews were also carried out, and compared with the data from the Questionnaire and Time Diary. The results of the research found that despite recorded flight times not exceeding any nominated safe limits, duty times did, especially for Flight Instructors that had secondary employment outside the aviation industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{current policy}} {{decision}} making in Australia regarding non-health public investments (for example, transport/housing/social welfare programmes) does not quantify health benefits and costs systematically. To address this knowledge gap, this study proposes an economic model for quantifying health impacts of public policies in terms of dollar value. The intention is to enable policy-makers in conducting economic evaluation of health effects of non-health policies and in implementing policies those reduce health inequalities as well as enhance positive health gains of the target population. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) provides an appropriate framework for this study since HIA assesses the beneficial and adverse effects of a programme/policy on public health and on health inequalities through the distribution of those effects. However, HIA usually tries to influence the decision making process using its scientific findings, mostly epidemiological and toxicological evidence. In reality, this evidence can not establish causal links between policy and health impacts since it can not explain how an individual or a community reacts to changing circumstances. The proposed economic model addresses this health-policy linkage using a consumer choice approach that can explain changes in group and individual behaviour in a given economic set up. The economic model suggested in this paper links epidemiological findings with economic analysis to estimate the health {{costs and benefits of}} public investment policies. That is, estimating dollar impacts when health status of the exposed population group changes by public programmes – for example, transport initiatives to reduce congestion by building new roads/ highways/ tunnels etc. or by imposing congestion taxes. For policy evaluation purposes, the model is incorporated in the HIA framework by establishing association among identified factors, which drive changes in the behaviour of target population group and in turn, in the health outcomes. The economic variables identified to estimate the health inequality and health costs are levels of income, unemployment, education, age groups, disadvantaged population groups, mortality/morbidity etc. However, though the model validation using case studies and/or available database from Australian non-health policy (say, <b>transport)</b> <b>arena</b> is in the future tasks agenda, it {{is beyond the scope of}} this current paper...|$|E

However, depending on the way they are used and maintained, recent diesel vehicles may produce pollutant rates which largely deviate from certification levels, even after a moderate mileage and despite of the on-board electronic control capacity increase. A quick pollution test at exhaust (new method of engine diagnosis) was performed on 168 diesel cars to determine if any engine maintenance was needed. A typology of the encountered engine defects or malfunctions is presented. Furthermore, emissions measurements according to the European specifications and along representative driving cycles were carried out on two diesel cars. Deviations from the original emission levels, associated with voluntary faults generated with defective injectors and closed EGR on a 'sane' vehicle, were assessed. Reversely, deviations are also analysed after repair and maintenance of a vehicle with multiple defects...|$|R
