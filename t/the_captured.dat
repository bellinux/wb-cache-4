5|$|By {{the end of}} 1798 the Legions under Kniaziewicz were {{fighting}} against the anti-French forces from the Kingdom of Naples, defeating them at the Battle of Civita Castellana on 4 December. Soon afterward, supplies from <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> Gaeta fortress allowed {{the creation of a}} Legion cavalry unit under Andrzej Karwowski.

After careful study, Roy Grumman decided that he could match or surpass the Zero in most respects, except in range, without sacrificing pilot armor, self-sealing tanks and fuselage structure. The new F6F Hellcat would compensate for the extra weight with additional power.|$|E

5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). <b>The</b> <b>captured</b> piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E

5|$|On 14 March, before Rowley {{could return}} to his blockade, Hamelin ordered a {{squadron}} to sea. This force consisted of the large frigate Bellone, <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> Minerva now renamed Minerve and <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> brig Victor. The force was led by Guy-Victor Duperré on Bellone, with Pierre Bouvet in Minerve as his second in command. Avoiding the remaining frigates of the British blockade, Duperré's ships escaped unnoticed and began cruising in the Bay of Bengal, capturing a few small vessels but making no serious impression on British trade in the region. By the 1 June, Duperré {{had moved to the}} Western Indian Ocean, sailing off Madagascar in the hope of sighting British ships from Cape Town. Due to the extended period at sea, his ships were in a poor state of repair and much of the following month was spent conducting repairs at isolated beaches.|$|E
5|$|Prudente {{was badly}} damaged in the {{engagement}} and had lost heavy casualties, including 27 killed and 22 wounded. Losses and damage on Daedalus were much lighter, {{with only one}} sailor and one Royal Marine killed and eleven wounded. Ball conducted hasty repairs and then brought <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> Prudente into Table Bay on 15 February. There <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> ship was condemned by the port commander Captain George Losack: although Prudente was a high-quality ship the naval facilities at the Cape Colony were insufficient to conduct the necessary repairs and the French frigate was not subsequently commissioned into the Royal Navy. As a result, there were few rewards for the action, unusually the junior officers of Daedalus were not promoted {{in the aftermath of}} the battle. Among the prisoners taken from Prudente was a deserter from the Royal Navy named Thomas Tring, who was subsequently court martialed and hanged.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{had kept}} <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> Ottoman foot-soldiers under his control, however. The {{same day that}} he {{defeated}} Hamza's army he sent several men to Tahip's army (which {{had moved to the}} center of Albania) where they displayed the captives along with <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> Ottoman standards in order to demoralize Tahip's army. Tahip was not intimidated and split his forces in two in the plains of Meçad, with his elite forces covering his flanks. Skanderbeg, however, had sent Moses of Dibra around Tahip's rear flanks in order to weaken the Ottoman army before launching his main attack. After this was done, Skanderbeg then attacked with his own men. In the heat of the battle, Moses was able to spot out Tahip and after a fierce duel, managed to kill him. The Turks were thus left without their commander and they fled.|$|E

They also rescue <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> mercenary Trench, Ross's rival. Yang leaves {{the group to}} escort Zhou back to China.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> military stores would accrue to him. (If he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign of competence and a willingness to take action.|$|E
