50|$|So after <b>the</b> <b>coordinated</b> <b>work,</b> {{the first}} {{fisheries}} management model based in Argentina´s ecosystem based in Golfo San Matías, Rio Negro province, was developed. This model fishery was concrete evidence {{that all this}} is possible. Since 2004, together with local companies, {{the government of the}} province of Rio Negro and the Marine Biology Institute (MBI) in San Antonio Oeste, Vida Silvestre promotes the Golfo San Matias as a model to follow.At the same time the national authorities were encouraged to back planning of the industry based on the best scientific data available, considering the sustainability of the resource as a basis for fishing. Vida Silvestre works simultaneously on informing on fishing problems, especially with hake, having campaigned towards dealing only with adult specimens (yielding fillets of over 20 cm in length) and proposals of markets for other species of fish.As to the certification, Vida Silvestre promoted a sustainable environmental alternative through a program of fishery licensing of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). Such licensing of fisheries aims at recognizing and favoring good fishing practices and providing a simple way for buyers and consumers to identify sustainable marine resources. In Argentina at present there are three fisheries with MSC certification: Patagonian Scallops (2006), the first scallop in the world to be thus certified, the Anchovy Sardine of Buenos Aires (2012) the world´s first such fishery to be certified (2011) and the Argentine hake (2012). Including these in a medium long term plan, MSC´s ecolabelling is aimed as a tool for regional, sustainable development.|$|E

Andrea Bracciali and Elisabeth Larsson, guest editors of this volume and chairs of WG 3 and WG 4, respectively, have compiled papers presenting general examples of modelling and simulation for big data problems in the context of the two working groups. Within the Action, these and other approaches are of strong interest as paradigmatic case studies for the coordinated development of HPC solutions and for fostering collaboration across the various scientific communities in the cHiPSet network. Analogously, readers interested in state-of-the-art examples of efficient big data modelling will find the contributions of this volume of interest.|$|E

A documentary design is used, of descriptive type, and as a data collection technique, bibliographic archiving and content analysis of previous sources are used. The results indicate that the international debate on the importance of water resources is a fact and that in countries such as Venezuela that have great reserves, a strategy must be adopted that aims at a true integral management of water resources.
