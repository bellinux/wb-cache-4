It was developed into a commercial product in the 1930s, when several patents were filed, and a product was announced by the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company in 1944. Their product was sold under the <b>Thermopane</b> brand name, which had been registered as a trademark in 1941. The <b>Thermopane</b> technology differs significantly from contemporary IGUs. The two panes of glass were welded together by a glass seal, and the two panes were separated by less than the [...] typical of modern units.

5000|$|The Train of Tomorrow {{consisted}} of four cars: a chair car (Star Dust), a dining car (Sky View), a sleeping car (Dream Cloud), and a lounge-observation car (Moon Glow), all featuring [...] "Astra-Domes". The domes on the Train of Tomorrow each measured 30 ft in length, 10 ft in width, and 2 ft in height, and sat 24 people apiece. The domes {{were made with}} <b>Thermopane</b> glass, developed by Libbey-Owens-Ford, and {{consisted of}} a plate-glass exterior layer and a shatterproof interior layer with a pocket of air in between to provide insulation and sound reduction; the <b>Thermopane</b> glass was also resistant to heat and glare-free. The low profile of the domes allowed them to operate on most mainlines, including those with low clearances, such as on the Boston & Albany. Like the dome windows, {{the rest of the}} windows in the train were made of <b>Thermopane</b> and [...] "designed for maximum viewing of the passing scenery." [...] They ranged in size from 3 ft for sleeping car Dream Cloud&apos;s roomettes to 5 ft in Dream Cloud&apos;s two drawing rooms and the chair car Star Dust.|$|E

There are newer Glass Blocks {{injected}} with Argon gas and having a layer of low-emissivity glass between the halves, which increases the insulative (U) value to 1.5 W/m²·K, which is between triple glazed windows(1.8 W/m²·K) and specialty double glazed windows with advanced frame and coatings(1.2 W/m²·K).|$|E

But such creatures, it seemed, no longer existed. The strange fact of the matter was that young people with serious literary ambitions were no longer interested in the metropolis or any other big, rich slices of contemporary life." ...|$|E

He was a professor of engineering at Berkeley and at Purdue University. At Purdue, he established a solar energy research program in which two experimental solar houses (one with large double glazed windows) were built on the Purdue campus {{in the summer of}} 1945. By analyzing this experiment, Hutchinson concluded that the solar gain through the double glazed house was greater than the excess heat loss. This study led to the manufacture of <b>Thermopane</b> http://www.utoledo.edu/library/canaday/findingaids1/MSS-066.pdf glass in 1946, which is widely used in modern architecture.|$|E
5000|$|The train {{consisted}} of four cars: a chair car (Star Dust), a dining car (Sky View), a sleeping car (Dream Cloud), and a lounge-observation car (Moon Glow), all featuring [...] "Astra-Domes". It was pulled by a largely stock EMD E7A. Its dining car, Sky View, {{was the first}} dome diner to be built and the first diner of any kind with an all-electric kitchen. The train was constructed with low-alloy, high-tensile steel and <b>Thermopane</b> glass for its domes and windows. Although GM never publicly stated the total price of the Train of Tomorrow, contemporary sources estimated it at between $1 million and $1.5 million.|$|E
