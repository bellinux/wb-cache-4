5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey puppet called Falzouille, in which the puppet never speaks. He <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the puppet is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E
5|$|Later on, it is Bigger Brothers Day in Marine World, {{where the}} Bigger Brothers and their boys attend to {{celebrate}} (including Homer, Tom, Bart, and Pepi). After running into Homer, Tom begins to brawl with him, {{in a fight}} which rages across Springfield. In the end, Homer winds up getting poked on the back by a fire hydrant, breaking his spine, much to Tom's shock. As a result, Homer is sent to a hospital on a stretcher, and Bart holds himself responsible for this. Later on, Tom sadly <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> much he will miss being a Bigger Brother, while Pepi is sad over losing his Bigger Brother. Fortunately, Bart suggests Tom become Pepi's big brother, to which they happily agree, and both Tom and Pepi walk out into the sunset holding hands. At the same time, Homer (whose back is now fixed) and Bart reconcile, as Homer teaches Bart how to brawl due to his experience with Tom.|$|E

5|$|Many {{actors were}} {{considered}} to replace Reeves including: Simon Baker Denny, Jon Bon Jovi, Patrick Muldoon, Johnathon Schaech, Christian Slater, and Billy Zane. Bullock initially suggested Matthew McConaughey, who passed on the role, prompting her to suggest Jason Patric, {{with whom she had}} wanted to work since seeing his performance in After Dark, My Sweet (1990). De Bont was skeptical of featuring a relatively unknown actor such as Patric, but was reminded by the studio that Bullock and Reeves were also relatively unknown prior to Speed, and ultimately chose Patric based on his role in Sleepers (1996). Patric was paid a reported $4.5–$8 million for his role in Speed2 and used his salary to finance a 1998 drama, Your Friends & Neighbors. After accepting the role, Patric stated that he never saw Speed or had any intentions of seeing it; Reeves said he was looking forward to seeing Patric star in the sequel. After Reeves declined to appear in Speed2, the screenplay was rewritten to remove his character from the story, which De Bont wanted to deal with early in the film. His absence is explained in the first scene, where Annie <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> her relationship with Jack did not work out, and mentions her current relationship with Alex (Patric), before his character is introduced in the film.|$|E

She directly ties the colonizers to today’s white America by calling them the skullmongers who are excavating the skulls of the dead Indians. Her poetry sarcastically <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the colonials thought they had {{earned the right to}} the land because they traveled over the sea. The Indians believed that the Americans should have come over bearing gifts, but instead came only talking of land and money.|$|E

25|$|This poem {{is a clear}} {{description}} of Martí’s societal hopes for his homeland. Within the poem, he <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> regardless of the person, whether kind or cruel he cultivates a white rose, meaning that he remains peaceful. This coincides with his ideology about establishing unity amongst the people, more so those of Cuba, through a common identity, with no regards to ethnic and racial differences. This doctrine could be accomplished if one treated his enemy with peace as he would treat a friend. The kindness of one person should be shared with all people, regardless of personal conflict. By following the moral that lies within “Cultivo Rosa Blanca”, Martí’s vision of Cuban solidarity could be possible, creating a more peaceful society that would emanate through future generations.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the confessional}} song talks plainly and plaintively about the {{detachment}} and loneliness that [...] Madonna feels {{in the face}} of the press, with the singer lamenting: [...] "Each time they write a hateful word / dragging my soul into the dirt / I wanna die." [...] John Marrs of Gay Times compared the lyrical content of the song to Madonna's [...] "Drowned World/Substitute For Love" [...] (1998) explaining that the lyrics are essentially autobiographical as well as <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> her outspokenness had led to the media trying to [...] "hurt her". It also <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> although Madonna is tough at heart, she still feels the [...] "negativity"of the media. The chorus, which features skittering drums and strings, has Madonna simply saying: [...] "I don't wanna talk about it right now / even hearts made out of steel can break down." [...] In an interview for The New York Times, Madonna explained the lyrics that she did not have the conviction of Joan of Arc, and is still hurt by any negative words. She further elaborated for a Rolling Stone interview: ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{disagreement}} on the bullying storyline. Some critics, including Canning and Hankinson, praised it, while others had reservations, such as Brown, who characterized it as [...] "heavy-handed", and Fallon, who considered it [...] "well-acted" [...] but [...] "far too stagnant". The Sam and Quinn storyline was panned by VanDerWerff, who wrote [...] "the series has wasted whatever chemistry {{the two had}} in 'Duets' on scenes where Sam <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> {{he wants to be}} the most popular kid in school", and by Kubicek, who criticized the lack of consistency in Sam's characterization.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} is upbeat, keeping in theme with the music. According to Madonna the verses are a mystical {{look at the}} {{universe}} and how small we are compared to it. She wanted to capture a feeling of [...] "wonderment" [...] with the lyrics, as if some one has just opened their eyes {{and looked at the}} world for the first time. With NME, she further clarified that the lyrics convey the feeling of being small in comparison to the vast universe.

500|$|The Islamic {{concept of}} Taqwa {{is closely related}} to conscience. In the Qur’ān verses 2:197 & 22:37 Taqwa refers to [...] "right conduct" [...] or [...] "piety", [...] "guarding of oneself" [...] or [...] "guarding against evil". Qur’ān verse 47:17 says that God is the {{ultimate}} source of the believer's taqwā which is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration from God. In Qur’ān verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> He has perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the wrong (fujūr) and right (taqwā). Hence, the awareness of vice and virtue is inherent in the soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of this world and tried, held accountable on the day of judgment for responsibilities to God and all humans.|$|E

Erik Johnson, the game's project lead, states that the Hunters are [...] "big and impressive, but they can go anywhere the player can go", as the player can encounter them both indoors and outdoors. Ted Backman, senior artist for Valve, <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the Hunter can express emotions, being a somewhat non-human character. [...] "We want the Hunter {{to be able to}} express nervousness or aggression, [...] whether it's aggressive, hurt, or mad." [...] Hunters are very aggressive and they tend to operate in packs, but can also be found supporting other Combine troops. Late in the game, they can be found escorting Striders, using their flechette guns to protect the Striders that the player is trying to attack.|$|E

500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "Everybody" [...] demo version {{is more or}} less same as the single version, without the synth grooves added in it.

Madonna's voice sounds fuller in the verses and chorus, but takes a higher pitch in the bridge. [...] "Laugh to Keep from Crying" [...] is a rock song, with 12-string Rickenbacker guitar played by Madonna herself. Madonna's voice sounds drunk and the drum machine backs her voice in the chorus.
