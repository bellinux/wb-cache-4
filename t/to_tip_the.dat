The discovery and theft of the True Cross threatens <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> internecine conflict in the favor of the Owls, leaving them in control of the Group; the assembled members are Roosters and wish to stop this.|$|E
5|$|TGS {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{learns that}} the new actor on the show, Danny, is a talented singer. Despite Danny's {{lack of interest in}} singing on the show, Pete gives him the Christmas solo as revenge for Jenna not chipping in <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> cleaning ladies, which is a yearly source of frustration for Pete. Jenna is outraged when she hears Danny was assigned the solo, and tries to get Subhas the janitor to punch Danny in the throat. But when the agreeable Danny learns of Jenna's hurt feelings, he arranges for them to perform a duet, in which he sings off-key to make Jenna look good.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, he was {{appointed}} Deputy Director-General of the Ministry of Defense, and the following year, he became Director-General. At age 29, he was the youngest person to hold this position. He was involved in arms purchases and establishing strategic alliances that were important for the State of Israel. He was instrumental in establishing close relations with France, securing massive amounts of quality arms that, in turn, helped <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> {{balance of power in}} the region.|$|E
25|$|Slam Tilt: There {{are special}} tilt {{switches}} {{placed on the}} underside of the playfield, on the coin door, and (on electromechanical games) in the lower cabinet and upper cabinet, designed to prevent cheating. If a player lifts and drops, pounds, or kicks the machine and activates any slam tilt, the entire game ends immediately for all players and may go into a reset/reboot mode. These are also used on video games. A similar Incline Tilt prevents a player from lifting the front of the cabinet <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> ball back up the playfield by ending his turn.|$|E

25|$|Although Rieve had purged his {{union of}} {{communist}}s in the mid-1930s, {{he found himself}} accused of communist dictatorship in 1944. American Labor Party (ALP) leader Sidney Hillman felt that the 1944 presidential election would be a close one in New York state. Hillman proposed that communists be permitted {{to play a role}} in the party, hoping <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> state toward Roosevelt. ALP leader David Dubinsky felt the communists should be expelled from the ALP. Rieve supported Hillman. Rieve was labeled a communist, and Samuel Baron (the general manager of the TWUA) resigned in protest from the union. Nevertheless, Hillman's proposal won the approval of ALP delegates, and Roosevelt easily carried New York in the general election.|$|E
25|$|Beginning on 22 August, Russian forces under Zakhar Chernyshyov and Pyotr Rumyantsev besieged and {{blockaded}} the Prussian Pomeranian port of Kolberg; {{the town}} was strongly defended and held out well, but several attempts to break the siege were repulsed. Then, in October Frederick ordered much of the garrison to withdraw to Berlin and defend Brandenburg; the town finally capitulated on 16 December. The fall of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea, and it gave Russia a way to supply its armies in Central Europe by sea, rather than overland through Poland. The resulting benefits to Russian logistics threatened <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> balance of power decisively against Prussia the following year.|$|E
25|$|While {{the result}} {{represented}} a significant reverse for the Germans, {{it did not}} {{put an end to}} their offensive campaign on the Western Front. Less than a fortnight later, the Germans launched a strong attack on the French during the Second Battle of the Marne. The four American companies that had joined the Australians during the assault were withdrawn from the line after the battle and returned to their regiments, having gained valuable experience. Monash sent Bell his personal thanks, praising the Americans' gallantry, while Pershing set out explicit instructions to ensure that US troops would not be employed in a similar manner again. They would subsequently {{play a significant role in}} the fighting that followed right up until the end of the war, as US reinforcements came <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> manpower balance in favour of the Allies.|$|E

25|$|The Act of Union {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the Irish Parliament in 1799 but defeated by 111 votes to 116. The idea of Union was supported by in Parliament those whose main concern was security {{in the wake of}} the 1798 rebellion and the need for the 40,000 strong British military garrison to remain. It was opposed by two distinct groups. On one side, by those known as the 'ultra Protestants', who feared that direct British rule would mean reforms that would give Catholics equal rights and overturn Protestant supremacy in Ireland, and from the other side by the 'patriot' tendency led by Henry Grattan who wanted to defend Ireland's constitutional independence and were also worried about the effect that a Union would have on Irish trade. Lord Castlereagh managed <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> balance in favour of the Union by offering titles, land and in some cases cash payments to Parliamentarians. The Act was passed at the second attempt in 1800.|$|E
25|$|In 1869, a {{group of}} speculators, headed by James Fisk and Jay Gould, both {{directors}} of the Erie Railroad, sought to corner the gold market through a plot to induce President Grant to stop Boutwell from releasing weekly gold from the Treasury Department {{in order to raise}} the gold price. Fisk was a gregarious showman who controlled the Erie Railroad, while Gould had made his fortune as a cotton smuggler during the Civil War. The first step in the plan was to recruit Daniel Butterfield, a former Major General and war hero during the Civil War who lacked any experience in finance. Both Corbin and Gould lobbied successfully for Butterfield's appointment as the assistant treasurer, through whom Boutwell gave orders to sell Treasury Department gold. Gould bribed Butterfield with a $10,000 check, more than Butterfield's annual salary of $8,000. Butterfield agreed <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> men off when the government intended to sell gold.|$|E
25|$|With the {{departure}} of Brown, team president Isiah Thomas took over the head coaching responsibilities. Thomas continued his practice of signing players to high priced contracts while the franchise struggled to capitalize on their talent on the court. As a testament to their struggles, on December 16, 2006, the Knicks and the Denver Nuggets broke into a brawl during their game in Madison Square Garden. With multiple players still serving a suspension {{as a result of}} the brawl, on December 20, 2006, David Lee created one of the most memorable plays in recent Knicks history, and served as a bright spot as the team's struggles persisted, during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. With a tie game and 0.1 seconds left on the game clock in double overtime, Jamal Crawford inbounded from the sideline, near half-court. The ball sailed towards the basket, and with that 0.1 seconds still remaining on the game clock, Lee tipped the ball off of the backboard and into the hoop. Because of the Trent Tucker Rule, a player is allowed solely <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> ball to score when the ball is put back into play with three-tenths of a second or less remaining. Because of this rule, the rarity of Lee's play increases. The Knicks won, 111–109 in double overtime. The Knicks improved by ten games in the 2006–2007 campaign in spite of injuries that ravaged the team at the end of the year; they ended with a 33–49 record, avoiding a 50-loss season by defeating the Charlotte Bobcats 94–93 on the last day of the season.|$|E

500|$|In early November, France's {{ambassador}} to the U.S., Pierre Adet, inserted himself into the political debate on behalf of Jefferson, publishing statements designed to arouse anti-British sentiment and to leave the impression that a Jefferson victory would result in improved relations with France.

500|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, fears grew among Hamilton {{and his supporters}} that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions once elected.

[...] This threatened <b>to</b> <b>tip</b> <b>the</b> delicate political balance in border states. [...] Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland all might have been pushed towards secession if such a precedent had been backed by the federal government at the beginning of the war.|$|E
