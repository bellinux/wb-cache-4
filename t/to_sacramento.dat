5|$|Director {{and story}} writer Hironobu Sakaguchi, {{designer}} Hiromichi Tanaka, character designer Yoshitaka Amano, scenario writer Kenji Terada, and music composer Nobuo Uematsu {{returned from the}} two previous Final Fantasy games {{to contribute to the}} development of Final Fantasy III. As with the previous two installments of the series, Final Fantasy III was programmed for the Famicom by Nasir Gebelli. It was the last original Final Fantasy title on which Gebelli worked. Midway through the development of the game, Gebelli was forced to return <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento,</b> California from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento</b> with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there. The completed game was one of the largest ever released for the Famicom, published on a 512KiB cartridge, the second-highest capacity available for the console. Like many console role-playing games of the era, Final Fantasy III is noted for its difficulty.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, the {{original}} part of State Route 24 {{was replaced by}} U.S. Route 40 Alternate, which continued south on U.S. 99W from Woodland to Davis and southeast on U.S. 395 to Reno, Nevada to join U.S. 40 at both ends. A direct route from Marysville south <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento</b> {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1949 as Route 232, and later became part of a rerouted State Route 24. The U.S. 40 Alternate designation was short-lived, and was mostly replaced by State Route 70 in the 1964 renumbering. Southwest of Marysville, former U.S. 40 Alternate instead became State Route 113, and SR 70 ran south along former State Route 24 (Route 232) to a point north of Sacramento, where the new State Route 99 came in from the northwest and continued south. Despite SR 70 always ending at State Route 99, it was once signed along State Route 99 (El Centro Road, Garden Highway, and the Jibboom Street Bridge) <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the deal}} was announced, NBA Commissioner David Stern stated that he was opposed to a relocation, as no NBA {{franchise}} had moved since 1985, when the Kansas City Kings relocated <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento,</b> California. He stated that his goal was that the Grizzlies remain in Vancouver and succeed there. The NBA Board of Governors' Finance Committee also made negative statements, as the purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move the team. The deal was then renegotiated before the board could vote on the issue. On 21 January 2001, Laurie {{announced that he had}} paid McCaw an undisclosed amount {{to walk away from the}} deal.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the second}} force, {{comprising}} {{the majority of}} the Brazilian troops (about 12,000 men) under the command of Caxias, had remained in Colonia del Sacramento. The Brazilian commander took the steamship Dom Afonso (named in honor of the late Prince Afonso) and entered the port at Buenos Aires to select the best place to disembark his troops. He expected to have to defeat the Argentine flotilla anchored there, but the force did nothing to stop him and he safely returned <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento</b> to plan his assault. The attack was aborted, however, when news arrived of the Allied victory at Caseros.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} added {{this road}} to the state highway system in 1933, and it became part of Legislative Route 11, which had stretched east from Sacramento along US 50. This part of Route 11 was not assigned a sign route number in 1934, but, by 1937, when the new Broadway Low Level Tunnel opened, {{it was part of}} Sign Route 24. That route had initially begun at Woodland and traveled northeast and east through the Feather River Canyon, and was extended southeast from Woodland along Sign Route 16 <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento</b> and then south and west via Antioch to the San Francisco– Oakland Bay Bridge approach in Berkeley. The California Freeway and Expressway System was formed in 1959, and included in the planned upgrades was the road between Antioch and Rio Vista. (North of Rio Vista the present SR 84 was part of the system.) The entire length was included in the State Scenic Highway System in 1963. In the 1964 renumbering, the Antioch-Sacramento roadway was split between two routes: Route 84 from Antioch to SR 12 near Rio Vista, and Route 160 from SR 12 <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento.</b> However, the entire route was marked as SR 160, and in 1981 the legislative definition was changed to reflect this.|$|E
5|$|Though Madonna {{is often}} overshadowed by her producers, {{she has her}} moments, and she is never more {{inspired}} than on the so-silly-it's-great 'Impressive Instant', yet another homage to the music that leaves her and legions of followers 'spinning, baby, out of control'. She deserves credit for allowing her latest interpretation of that music to be bent, folded and so lovingly mutilated by her collaborators, and when she chirps, 'I like to singy singy singy/Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy', I can envision discos from Stockholm <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento</b> going bonkers with her.|$|E

5|$|At its west end, US 50 was {{extended}} south from Sacramento along U.S. Route 99 to Stockton and {{west to the}} San Francisco Bay Area, replacing U.S. Route 48, by the early 1930s. US 50 was officially cut back <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento</b> in the 1964 renumbering, replaced by Interstate 580, but remained on maps and signs for several more years. US 50 {{was extended}} east from Annapolis to Ocean City, Maryland in 1949, three {{years prior to the}} opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952; this extension replaced Maryland Route 404 between Annapolis and Wye Mills and U.S. Route 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City. Prior to the bridge opening, US 50 used a ferry across the Chesapeake Bay between Sandy Point and Matapeake and followed present-day Maryland Route 8 between Matapeake and Stevensville before continuing east.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, {{the city}} of Sacramento {{maintained}} the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the city limits under a contract with Caltrans. However, since Caltrans's main goal is to move traffic efficiently, the city {{was not able to}} carry out pedestrian-friendly projects that they and local residents wanted. Under a law passed in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the city limits <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento.</b> The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000 the portion from the south city limits to the American River became the full responsibility of the city. A 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, US 50 had been {{extended}} to San Francisco via the former US 48 by overlapping US 99 from Sacramento to Stockton and replacing US 48 over Altamont Pass to US 101E (Foothill Boulevard at Castro Valley Boulevard) near Hayward. It was extended over the new Bay Bridge {{at the time of}} its opening in 1936, replacing US 101E on Foothill Boulevard and the present MacArthur Boulevard to the Bay Bridge Distribution Structure in Oakland. As the new MacArthur Freeway (now I-580) was constructed, US 50 was moved to it. This extension was officially eliminated in the 1964 renumbering, but it remained on maps and signs for several more years before being replaced by I-80 over the Bay Bridge, I-580 over Altamont Pass, I-205 business route through Tracy, I-5 to Stockton, SR 4 (Charter Way) and SR 26 through Stockton, and SR 99 <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the {{development}} of the first installment in the series, Square's management decided to manufacture 400,000 copies of the game to make a sequel possible. As there were no concrete ideas for Final Fantasy II from the start, it was eventually taken in a new direction and included none of the previous game's characters or locations. Hironobu Sakaguchi, who had previously served as the main planner for Final Fantasy, assumed the role of director to accommodate for the larger development team. Using the experience gained from the first installment, which focused more on fitting story ideas into their new gameplay system and game world, the developers fully crafted the story of Final Fantasy II first. The gameplay was then built around the narrative. The experience system was designed to be a more realistic advancement system than that of the first game. Several members of the original staff from the first game reprised their jobs for Final Fantasy II. Sakaguchi again created the plot for the title, with the actual scenario written by Kenji Terada. Nobuo Uematsu composed the music, as he had for the first game, while Yoshitaka Amano was again the concept artist. As with the original, Final Fantasy II was programmed by Nasir Gebelli. Midway through {{the development}} of the game, Gebelli was forced to return <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento,</b> California from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento</b> with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there. The game was released one day {{less than a year after}} the first game came out.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, Sarria became {{determined}} to join the military, despite being, at just under five feet tall, too short to meet the Army's height requirement. He seduced a major who {{was attached to the}} San Francisco recruiting station on the condition that the major approve Sarria's enlistment. Jose Sarria was approved and entered the Army Reserve, continuing his studies as he waited to be called up to active duty. Shortly before he was scheduled for induction in the regular Army, his beloved second father, Charles Millen, died of a heart attack. Sarria's induction was delayed a month, then he was sworn in and ordered <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento,</b> California, for basic training with the Signal Corps.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 10 March 1826 {{and in the midst}} of the siege of Sacramento, Joaquim Inácio boarded a small, unarmed boat {{accompanied}} by a single army officer and passed unnoticed through a line of nineteen enemy ships under cover of darkness. He reached the main Brazilian fleet on the morning of the next day and requested assistance from Vice-Admiral Rodrigo José Ferreira Lobo, the commander-in-chief of the naval forces operating in the war. Joaquim Inácio returned <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento</b> two days later under heavy enemy fire along with three boats carrying supplies and arms. Although welcomed as a hero in the besieged town, he was passed over for a promotion. Disregard for this achievement was due to his lack of wealth and family connections, a burden which continued to thwart his career for years to come.|$|E

5|$|One major {{controversy}} {{related to}} the preliminary route of US 50. The through route {{had been assigned to}} the Old Santa Fe Trail, while the spur U.S. Route 250 followed the competing New Santa Fe Trail to the south. As a compromise, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways approved a split configuration—U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S—in January. Another problem was in western Utah, where no improved road existed for US 50 to use. The final numbering plan, approved in November 1926, left a gap in US 50 between Ely, Nevada and Thistle, Utah. Finally, rather than ending US 50 at Wadsworth, where the Lincoln and Victory Highways merged, it was sent over the Lincoln Highway's Pioneer Branch, past the south side of Lake Tahoe, <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento,</b> California.|$|E
5|$|West of Placerville, {{the wagon}} road headed south to Diamond Springs, where it turned west along the {{original}} Carson Route over relatively gentle terrain <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento,</b> generally following the present US 50 on parallel surface roads, such as Pleasant Valley Road and White Rock Road. The Pony Express used this route from its beginning in April 1860 until July 1, when its western terminus became Folsom on the Sacramento Valley Railroad. (The route was further {{cut back to}} Placerville, where messages were passed to the telegraph, from July 1861 to its discontinuance in October.) The Placerville and Sacramento Valley Railroad reached Latrobe in 1864, Shingle Springs (on the old Carson Route west of Placerville) in 1865, and was finally completed to Placerville in 1888. As the railroad extended east, the western terminus of the stage lines followed; {{the completion of the}} First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 took most of the traffic off the Placerville wagon road.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, California was in {{the midst}} of a gold rush; backed by this sudden demand for luxuries, New England {{companies}} made the first shipments, by ship to San Francisco and Sacramento, in California, including a shipment of refrigerated apples. The market was proved, but shipping ice in this way was expensive and demand outstripped supply. Ice began to be ordered instead from the then Russian-controlled Alaska in 1851 at $75 a ton (901kg). The American-Russian Commercial Company was subsequently formed in San Francisco in 1853 to work in partnership with the Russian-American Company of Alaska to supply ice to the west coast of America. The Russian company trained Aleutian teams to harvest ice in Alaska, built saw-mills to produce insulating saw-dust and shipped the ice south along with supplies of chilled fish. The costs of this operation remained high and M. Tallman founded the rival Nevada Ice Company, which harvested ice on Pilot Creek and transported <b>to</b> <b>Sacramento,</b> bringing the west coast price for ice down to seven cents ($2) a pound (0.5kg).|$|E
