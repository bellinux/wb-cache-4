Until 1994, there were separate General Advices and Queries, which tended to be related to each other - <b>the</b> <b>advices</b> giving advice on Christian living, and the queries being questions which asked Friends how they were living their lives, and could be used for personal reflection or discussion in groups. There was a requirement that all <b>the</b> <b>advices</b> and queries were read in each meeting {{over the course of a}} year. Since 1994, <b>the</b> <b>advices</b> and queries have been mixed together, so that each paragraph has both advices and queries within it.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of specialists to the audit of significant accounting estimates, PCAOB inspection reports highlight instances where auditors discount advice received from a specialist. I examine when and why auditors discount a specialist?s advice. I find that auditors discount a specialist?s advice when it is evaluated {{at the same time}} as irrelevant advice from colleagues that consistently supports an alternate position. In doing so, auditors evaluate advice by applying a ?consensus implies correctness? heuristic, instead of evaluating <b>the</b> <b>advice?s</b> relevance. I also find that when auditors first evaluate only irrelevant colleagues? advice and then evaluate <b>the</b> specialist?s <b>advice,</b> they change their assessments to align with <b>the</b> specialist?s <b>advice.</b> Results suggest that separately evaluating <b>the</b> specialist?s <b>advice</b> and colleagues? <b>advice</b> mitigates <b>the</b> effects of the consensus heuristic and discounting of <b>the</b> specialist?s <b>advice.</b> My results should be of interest to the PCAOB and public accounting firms as they revise audit guidance to increase reliance on specialist advice...|$|R
