Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that {{this would have been}} an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E

Ivan claims {{there is no way}} a real gun could have been brought into the highly-secured building. The agents are shown a video from the game, featuring the female character who killed the player. Mulder takes the printout of the character and shows it to a detective, as he believes she is the killer.|$|E

One of the most important merchants is chosen to be Leader (Gang Shou), another is Deputy Leader (Fu Gang Shou), and a third is Business Manager (Za Shi). The Superintendent of Merchant Shipping gives them an unofficially sealed red certificate permitting them to use the light bamboo for punishing their company when necessary. Should anyone die at sea, his property becomes forfeit to the government...The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars, and in the day-time by the sun.

They also use a line a hundred feet long with a hook at the end which they let down to take samples of mud from the sea-bottom; by its (appearance and) smell they can determine their whereabouts.|$|E

25|$|Card and Krueger {{expanded}} on {{this initial}} article in their 1995 book Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage. They {{argued that the}} negative employment effects of minimum wage laws are minimal if not non-existent. For example, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage, the 1988 rise in California's minimum wage, and the 1990–91 increases in the federal minimum wage. In addition to their own findings, they reanalyzed earlier studies with updated data, generally finding that the older results of a negative employment effect did not hold up in the larger datasets.|$|E
25|$|As <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> burning {{night sky}} over the Underworld Storybrooke, Hades and Zelena {{are on a}} date, as he {{explained}} why he created the world for her, then tells Zelena {{that he wants to}} follow her back to the real Storybrooke, if he is able to restore his heart and become human again. However, he also tells Zelena that {{in order to do that}} he wants to leave the outsiders in the Underworld forever, then he asks her to be his partner in chaos (a modified version of a wedding proposal), leaving Zelena feeling awkward. Hades also tells her that he took the precaution of adding the remaining outsiders' names to more tombstones, after Mary Margaret had her name replaced by David's. Unfortunately for Zelena, Regina saw this through a magic mirror, and then confronts Zelena afterwards, as the latter thinks that Hades, like Robin Hood (or Regina), might not be a villain forever. Regina explain this to the rest of the outsiders, saying that Zelena was thinking irrationally and in danger, and telling them that the only way to solve this problem was to go to Cora, to break them up. Cora is working in the Underworld Mill, situated above the Lethe, the yellow-colored River of Forgetfulness, and supervised by two guards. She finds a hook hidden under the stalks on grain, cuts off the black anti-magic handcuff, and uses her magic to knock out the guards. Escaping, she bumps into Hook who retrieves his hook and brings her to Regina.|$|E

Since Bethe and Brown were good at calculating things {{that could not be}} seen, could <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mergers? The 90-year-old Bethe quickly became enthused, and soon began the required calculations. The result was a 1998 paper on the [...] "Evolution of Binary Compact Objects Which Merge", which Brown regarded as the best that the two produced together.|$|E

Half a century of systematic maiming and murdering of another people has left its deep marks {{on the faces of}} these people, the way they talk, the way they walk, the way they handle objects, the way they greet each other, the way <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> world. There is an endemic prevarication to this machinery, a vulgarity of character that is bone-deep and structural to the skeletal vertebrae of its culture.|$|E

60|$|In {{due time}} the gold of Klondyke will {{find its way}} to the great cities of the world. But the old dilemma will keep {{continually}} reproducing itself. The man who will turn his back on love, and upon all the fruitful it, and will set himself single-heartedly to gather gold in an exultant dream of wielding its Plutonic powers, will find the treasure yielding quickly to his touch. But few men will make this sacrifice voluntarily. Not until the Plutonic power is so strongly set up that the higher human impulses are suppressed as rebellious, and even the mere appetites are denied, starved, and insulted when they cannot purchase their satisfaction with gold, are the energetic spirits driven to build their lives upon riches. How inevitable that course has become to us is plain enough to those who have the power of understanding what they see as <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plutocratic societies of our modern capitals.|$|E
60|$|The first {{answer that}} {{naturally}} occurs to one is that, although different people {{may see the}} table slightly differently, still they all see more or less similar things when <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table, and the variations in what they see follow the laws of perspective and reflection of light, {{so that it is}} easy to arrive at a permanent object underlying all the different people's sense-data. I bought my table from the former occupant of my room; I could not buy his sense-data, which died when he went away, but I could and did buy the confident expectation of more or less similar sense-data. Thus it is the fact that different people have similar sense-data, and that one person in a given place at different times has similar sense-data, which makes us suppose that over and above the sense-data there is a permanent public object which underlies or causes the sense-data of various people at various times.|$|E
