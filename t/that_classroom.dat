In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter asked one of the men why they [...] "abandoned" [...] the women when it was clear that Lépine's targets were women. [...] René Jalbert, the sergeant-at-arms who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that [...] "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror." [...] Newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a [...] "culture of passivity" [...] prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: [...] "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in <b>that</b> <b>classroom,</b> who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{critical}} discourse theories, {{in particular}} Fairclough’s three-dimensional model of discourse analysis, and highlights {{their role as}} an invaluable analytic tool {{within the field of}} educational research. It also signals the comparable view of language, discourse and subjectivity – as shared by many critical discourse theories and poststructuralism(s) – and suggests that these theoretical frameworks and associated analytical tools are in this way complementary. More specifically, the paper identifies the ways in which critical discourse theories provide an avenue for examining and unravelling the complex and multifarious site <b>that</b> is the <b>classroom.</b> Following discussion of the theoretical and analytical underpinnings and merits of critical discourse theories, the paper focuses upon the effective use of critical discourse theories in one classroom-based research project. In line with the premise upon which the classroom-based study is founded, the paper advocates <b>that</b> <b>classrooms</b> are discursively constituted sites and that discourses, often competing and at times contradictory discourses, operate as organisers of social interactions within these sites. It also contends <b>that</b> <b>classrooms,</b> given <b>that</b> they are discursivel...|$|R

50|$|Proponents of {{personalized}} learning {{say that}} many elements of curriculum, assessment and instructional design must be present in classrooms for students to succeed and often use software systems to manage and facilitate student-led instruction. Proponents argue <b>that</b> <b>classroom</b> learning activities must build upon students' prior knowledge and teachers need to allocate time for practice. Advocates argue that teachers must continuously assess student learning against clearly defined standards and goals and student input into the assessment process is integral.|$|E

Also, slang terms differ greatly between different regions and can change quickly in response to popular culture. Some phrases can become unintentionally rude if misused.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} {{of social skills}} in children is largely affected in <b>that</b> <b>classroom</b> setting by both teachers and peers. Reinforcement and punishment play major roles here as well. Peers frequently reinforce each other’s behavior. One of the major areas that teachers and peers influence is sex-typed behavior, while peers also largely influence modes of initiating interaction, and aggression. Peers {{are more likely to}} punish cross-gender play {{while at the same time}} reinforcing play specific to gender[...] Some studies found that teachers were more likely to reinforce dependent behavior in females.|$|E

50|$|The {{curriculum}} {{followed at}} IIT Ropar {{provides for a}} science-based engineering education, {{with a view to}} produce quality engineer-scientists. If facilitates broad-based knowledge acquisition and, simultaneously, nurtures a temper for lifelong learning and exploration. Students are encouraged to go beyond the classroom to conduct and carry out independent work by means of research projects, guided reading, and by allowing them to join the research activities undertaken by faculty members. The idea behind such a fashioning of the curriculum is the belief <b>that</b> <b>classroom</b> activities must be supplemented by independent study and also by individual research that broadens one's horizon and provides for opportunities to bring one's ideas to fruition.|$|E

Proponents of student blogging argue that blogging can contribute directly to improved writing abilities and argue <b>that</b> <b>classroom</b> blogging can enable students to engage with audiences beyond their classroom walls by using blogs as personal journals, as diaries, for story writing, and for making editorial responses to news events.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} <b>that</b> early <b>classroom</b> experiences {{influence the}} socialization of aggression. Tracking {{changes in the}} aggressive behavior of 4179 children from kindergarten to second-grade (ages 5 – 8) {{this study examined the}} impact of two important features of the classroom context– aggregate peer aggression and climates characterized by supportive teacher-student interactions. The aggregate aggression scores of children assigned to first-grade classrooms predicted the level of classroom aggression (assessed by teacher ratings) and quality of classroom climate (assessed by observers) that emerged by the end of grade 1. HLM analyses revealed <b>that</b> first-grade <b>classroom</b> aggression and quality of classroom climate made independent contributions to changes in student aggression, as students moved from kindergarten to second grade. Implications for policy and practice are discussed. Accumulating research suggests <b>that</b> the <b>classroom</b> context may {{play an important role in}} socializing student aggressive behavior – particularly during the initial years of elementary school. Several studies suggest that being placed in first-grade <b>classrooms</b> <b>that</b> contain many aggressive peers promotes student aggression that has enduring effects (Barth, Dunlap...|$|R
50|$|Research {{on using}} Twitter in {{education}} has been conducted by Dr. Reynol Junco and his colleagues. Using a controlled experimental design with random assignment, they found <b>that</b> <b>classroom</b> use of Twitter in specific ways such as continuing course discussions outside of class led to significant increases in student engagement and grades for all of their courses. Junco {{and his colleagues have}} also found that these benefits only apply when professors interact with students on Twitter, when they require Twitter use as part of a course, and when Twitter is integrated into the curriculum in ways that make sense for that particular course. This data shows the benefits of Twitter as compared to other static educational technology tools such as blogs, wikis, and learning management systems.|$|E

[...] In reaction to the case, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, both houses of Congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge, and condemning the panel's ruling. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, where the case was ultimately overturned in June 2004, solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue. Rather, a five-justice majority held that Newdow, a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter, lacked standing to sue.|$|E
