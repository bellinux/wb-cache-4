25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist to know how much water is currently in the soil before deciding if and how much to irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the surface soil appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using <b>tensiometers</b> which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron moisture meters that utilize an aluminium tube with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition to monitoring for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E
500|$|Du Noüy–Padday method: A {{minimized}} {{version of}} Du Noüy method uses a small diameter metal needle {{instead of a}} ring, in combination with a high sensitivity microbalance to record maximum pull. The advantage of this method is that very small sample volumes (down to few tens of microliters) can be measured with very high precision, without the need to correct for buoyancy (for a needle or rather, rod, with proper geometry). Further, the measurement can be performed very quickly, minimally in about 20 seconds. First commercial multichannel <b>tensiometers</b> [...] were recently built based on this principle.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>tensiometer</b> in {{soil science}} is a {{measuring}} instrument {{used to determine}} the matric water potential (...) (soil moisture tension) in the vadose zone. This device typically consists of a glass or plastic tube with a porous ceramic cup, and is filled with water. The top of the tube has either a built-in vacuum gauge or a rubber cap used with a portable puncture <b>tensiometer</b> instrument, which uses a hypodermic needle to measure the pressure inside the <b>tensiometer.</b> The <b>tensiometer</b> is buried in the soil, and a hand pump is used to pull a partial vacuum. As water is pulled out of the soil by plants and evaporation, the vacuum inside the tube increases. As water is added to the soil, the vacuum inside the tube pulls moisture from the soil and decreases. As the water in <b>tensiometer</b> is considered to be equilibrium with the soil water, the gauge reading of the <b>tensiometer</b> represents the matric potential of the soil.|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate soil matric potential using mercury <b>tensiometer</b> and puncture digital <b>tensiometer,</b> and to compare the gravimetric soil moisture values obtained by tensiometric system with gravimetric soil moisture obtained by neutron attenuation technique. Four experimental plots were maintained with different soil moisture by irrigation. Three repetitions of each type of <b>tensiometer</b> were installed at 0. 20 m depth. Based on the soil matric potential and the soil water retention curve, the corresponding gravimetric soil moisture was determined. The data was then compared to those obtained by neutron attenuation technique. The results showed that both tensiometric methods showed no difference under soil matric potential higher than - 40 kPa.

50|$|<b>Tensiometers</b> are {{directly}} influenced by {{this type of}} hysteresis. Two other types of sensors used to measure soil water matric potential are also influenced by hysteresis effects within the sensor itself. Resistance blocks, both nylon and gypsum based, measure matric potential {{as a function of}} electrical resistance. The relation between the sensor’s electrical resistance and sensor matric potential is hysteretic. Thermocouples measure matric potential as a function of heat dissipation. Hysteresis occurs because measured heat dissipation depends on sensor water content, and the sensor water content-matric potential relationship is hysteretic. , only desorption curves are usually measured during calibration of soil moisture sensors. Despite the fact that it can be a source of significant error, the sensor specific effect of hysteresis is generally ignored.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the three geometrical aspects of truing, the overall tension of the spokes is significant to the wheel's fatigue durability, stiffness, and ability to absorb shock. Too little tension leads to a rim that is easily deformed by impact with rough terrain. Too much tension leads to overstressed spokes which have a short life. Spoke <b>tensiometers</b> are tools which measure the tension in a spoke. Another common method for making rough estimates of spoke tension involves plucking the spokes {{and listening to the}} audible tone of the vibrating spoke. The optimum tension depends on the spoke length and spoke gauge (diameter). Tables are available online which list tensions for each spoke length, either in terms of absolute physical tension, or notes on the musical scale which coincide with the approximate tension to which the spoke should be tuned. It should be noted that in the real world, a properly trued wheel will not, in general, have a uniform tension across all spokes, due to variation among the parts from which the wheel is made.|$|E
