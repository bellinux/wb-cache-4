The notion of representation in connectionism is generally confused; this can be clarified when at all times it is made explicit who or what Q and S are in the formula "P is used by Q to represent R to S". Frequently they may be layers or modules within a network, but the typical confusion is symptomatic of the computer metaphor which in practice favours feedforward and militates against arbitrarily connected networks.

40|$|Motivation: Analysis of gene {{expression}} data can provide {{insights into the}} time-lagged co-regulations of genes/gene clusters. However, existing methods such as Event Method and Edge Detection Method are inefficient as they only compare two genes each time. More importantly, they lose some important information due to their scoring criterion. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify time-lagged co-regulated gene clusters. The algorithm facilitates localized comparison and processes several genes simultaneously to generate detailed and complete time-lagged information between genes/gene clusters.

40|$|Spike {{synchronization}} {{is thought}} to have a constructive role for feature integration, attention, associativelearning, and the formation of bidirectionally connected Hebbian cell assemblies. By contrast, theoreticalstudies on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) report an inherently decoupling influence of spikesynchronization on synaptic connections of coactivated neurons. For example, bidirectional synapticconnections as found in cortical areas could be reproduced only by assuming realistic models of STDP andrate coding. We resolve this conflict by theoretical analysis and simulation of various simple and realisticSTDP models that provide a more complete characterization of conditions when STDP leads to eithercoupling or decoupling of neurons firing in synchrony. In particular, we show that STDP consistentlycouples synchronized neurons if key model parameters are matched to physiological data: First, synapticpotentiation must be significantly stronger than synaptic depression for small (positive or negative) <b>timelags</b> between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. Second, spike synchronization must be sufficientlyimprecise, for example, within a time window of 5 - 10 msec instead of 1 msec. Third, axonal propagationdelays should not be much larger than dendritic delays. Under these assumptions synchronized neuronswill be strongly coupled leading to a dominance of bidirectional synaptic connections even for simpleSTDP models and low mean firing rates at the level of spontaneous activity...|$|R

Each unit was gridded with 40 × 40 m cells, and alternate gridpoints in rows and columns were selected to sample at least 30 gridpoints per experimental unit. Fuels were measured along two 20 m line transects at each gridpoint. Direction for one transect was randomly selected, and the other was selected randomly within the opposite 180 ° hemisphere of the first. Each transect began 5 m from the gridpoint to avoid surface disruption by the various disciplinary teams using the unit. Standard line transects for dead and down fuels were applied (Brown 1974), with 1 -hr <b>timelag</b> fuels (0 – 0.62 cm dia) measured in the first 2 m, 10 -hr <b>timelag</b> fuels (0.63 – 2.54 cm dia) from 0 – 3 m, and 100 hr <b>timelag</b> fuels (2.55 – 7.62 cm dia) from 0 – 5 m.

40|$|Background: Biodiversity offsets {{provide a}} {{mechanism}} to compensate for unavoidable damages from new energy development as the U. S. increases its domestic production. Proponents argue that offsets provide a partial solution for funding conservation while opponents contend the practice is flawed because offsets are negotiated without the science necessary to backup resulting decisions. Missing in negotiations is a biologically-based currency for estimating sufficiency of offsets and a framework for applying proceeds to maximize conservation benefits. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we quantify a common currency for offsets for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) by estimating number of impacted birds at 4 levels of development commonly permitted. Impacts were indiscernible at 1 – 12 wells per 32. 2 km 2. Above this threshold lek losses were 2 – 5 times greater inside than outside of development and bird abundance at remaining leks declined by 232 to 277 %. Findings reiterated the importance of <b>timelags</b> as evidenced by greater impacts 4 years after initial development. Clustering well locations enabled a few small leks to remain active inside of developments. Conclusions/Significance: Documented impacts relative to development intensity {{can be used to}} forecast biological tradeoffs of newly proposed or ongoing developments, and when drilling is approved, anticipated bird declines form the biological currency for negotiating offsets. Monetary costs for offsets will be determined by true conservation cost t...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this synthesis is to present the key messages and draw the main conclusions from the work on lakes in the REBECCA project, pointing out their links to theoretical ecology and their applicability for the WFD implementation. Type-specific results were obtained from analyses of large pan-European datasets for phytoplankton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish, and indicators and relationships showing the impact of eutrophication or acidification on these biological elements were constructed. The thresholds identified {{in many of the}} response curves are well suited for setting ecological status class boundaries and can be applied in the intercalibration of classification systems. Good indicators for phytoplankton (chrysophytes, cyanobacteria) and macrophytes (isoetids and charaphytes) responses to eutrophication were identified, and the level of eutrophication pressure needed to reach the thresholds for these indicators was quantified. Several existing metrics developed for macrophytes had low comparability and need further harmonisation to be useful for intercalibration of classification systems. For macroinvertebrates, a number of metrics developed for rivers turned out to be less useful to describe lake responses to eutrophication and acidification, whereas other species based indicators were more promising. All the biological elements showed different responses in different lake types according to alkalinity and humic substances, and also partly according to depth. Better harmonisation of monitoring methods is needed to achieve better precision in the dose–response curves. Future research should include impacts of hydromorphological pressures and climate change, as well as predictions of <b>timelags</b> involved in responses to reduction of pressures...|$|R
40|$|Climatic {{relationships}} {{were established in}} two 210 Pb dated pollen sequences from small mires closely surrounded by forest just below actual forest limits (but about 300 m below potential climatic forest limits) in the northern Swiss Alps (suboceanic in climate; mainly with Picea) and the central Swiss Alps (subcontinental; mainly Pinus cembra and Larix) at annual or near-annual resolution from ad 1901 to 1996. Effects of vegetational succession were removed by splitting the time series into early and late periods and by linear detrending. Both pollen concentrations detrended by the depth-age model and modified percentages (in which counts of dominant pollen types are down-weighted) are correlated by simple linear regression with smoothed climatic parameters with one-and two-year <b>timelags,</b> including average monthly and April/September daylight air temperatures and with seasonal and annual precipitation sums. Results from detrended pollen concentrations suggest that peat accumulation is favoured in the northern-Alpine mire either by early snowmelt or by summer precipitation, but in the central-Alpine mire by increased precipitation and cooler summers, suggesting a position of the northern-Alpine mire near the upper altitudinal limit of peat formation, but of the central-Alpine mire near the lower limit. Results from modified pollen percentages indicate that pollen pro duction by plants growing near their upper altitudinal limit is limited by insufficient warmth in summer, and pollen production by plants growing near their lower altitudinal limit is limited by too-high temperatures. Only weakly significant pollen/climate {{relationships were}} found for Pinus cembra and Larix, probably because they experience little climatic stress growing 300 m below the potential climatic forest limit...|$|R

The 100 h <b>timelag</b> (2.55 cm to 7.62 cm) particles are large enough that they likely have an uncharred core (Figure 2); thus they would be treated in similar fashion to coarse WD, using the quadratic mean diameter for that size class.|$|E

40|$|Widespread {{outbreaks}} {{of the mountain}} pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) in the lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) forests of North America have produced stands with significant levels of recent tree mortality. The needle foliage from recently attacked trees typically turns red within {{one to two years}} of attack indicating successful colonization by the beetle and tree death. Attempts to model crown fire potential in these stands have assumed that the moisture content of dead foliage responds similarly to changes in air temperature and relative humidity as other fine, dead surface fuels. However, this assumption has not been verified. In this exploratory study we sampled the moisture content of dead foliage on an hourly basis through two different diurnal cycles during the fire season and compared the results to measurements of 10 -h fuel moisture indicator sticks and predictions made from models used to estimate dead fuel moisture in the USA, Canada, and Australia. The observed degree of variation in dead foliar moisture content was small (6. 9 – 14. 5 %) with a mean value of ∼ 10 %. All existing models performed poorly, but measurements of 10 -h fuel moisture and a modified version of an existing model where <b>timelags</b> were extended to ∼ 20 -h had the best fit to the data. The results from our study suggest that the dead foliage on attacked trees does not respond similarly to changing environmental conditions as other fine, dead surface fuels as has been assumed. This in turn has important implications for wildland fire suppression operations, including firefighter safety, and in modeling fire behavior, and solicits the need for further research...|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThis dissertation examines the efficacy of using passive acoustic monitoring of dolphin echolocation clicks to study ecological questions about spatial and temporal distribution patterns {{and the influence of}} environmental variability on dolphin activity. First, the groundwork is laid by examining echolocation clicks recorded from concurrent visual and acoustic surveys and testing whether species-specific features exist in the spectral content of clicks recorded in the presence of five delphinid species: short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus capensis), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), and Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). Unique spectral banding patterns are discovered only for Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphins and two distinct click types are found for Pacific white-sided dolphins. Next, autonomous recordings from six sites are analyzed for the presence of Pacific white-sided and Risso's dolphin click bouts and diel, seasonal, and interannual variability in click activity are described. Risso's dolphins are more vocally active during the night which I suggest is related to foraging on diel vertically migrating squid. Seasonal and interannual variability in Risso's dolphin call activity are high. Comparisons of diel, seasonal and spatial variability of the two Pacific white-sided click types are made and the two click types are shown to exhibit differences in usage patterns. This comparison reveals a southern and northern distribution pattern between the click types adding support to the hypothesis that the two click types represent the two morphologically and genetically distinct populations which overlap in the study area. Finally, the ability to predict variability in click activity is examined with respect to the environment by building generalized additive models. Remotely-sensed environmental variables are modeled with respect to current time and time-lagged data to examine questions about the underlying oceanographic processes which may lead to dolphin occurrence. The inclusion of <b>timelagged</b> environmental data can improve predictive models and allows a realistic time frame for conservation and management mitigation efforts. Passive acoustic monitoring of echolocation clicks has revealed patterns in diel activity and seasonal movements of Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphins and shows promise for improved predictive habitat models...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe tectonic {{context of}} {{south-east}} Asia {{is dominated by}} subduction. One such major convergent boundary is the Java-Sunda trench, where the Australian-Indian plates are being subducted beneath the Eurasian plate. We measure shear-wave splitting in local and teleseismic data from 12 broadband stations across Sumatra and Java to study the anisotropic characteristics of this subduction system, which can provide important constraints on dynamical processes involved. Splitting in S-waves from local earthquakes between 75 - 300 km deep show roughly trench parallel fast directions, and with <b>timelags</b> 0. 1 - 1. 3 s (92 % _ 0. 6 s). Splitting from deeper local events and SKS, however, shows larger time-lags (0. 8 - 2. 0 s) and significant variation in fast direction. In order to infer patterns of deformation in the slab we apply a hybrid modelling scheme. We raytrace through an isotropic subduction zone velocity model, obtaining event to station raypaths in the upper mantle. We then apply appropriately rotated olivine elastic constants to {{various parts of the}} subduction zone, and predict the shear-wave splitting accrued along the raypath. Finally, we perform grid searches for orientation of deformation, and attempt to minimise the misfit between predicted and observed shear-wave splitting. Splitting from the shallow local events is best explained by anisotropy confined to a 40 km over-riding plate with horizontal, trench parallel deformation. However, in order to explain the larger lag times from SKS and deeper events, we must consider an additional region of seismic anisotropy in or around the slab. The slab geometry in the model is constrained by seismicity and regional tomography models, and many SKS raypaths travel large distances within the slab. Models placing anisotropy in the slab produce smaller misfits than outside for most stations. There is a strong indication that inferred flow directions are different for sub-Sumatran stations than for sub-Javanese, with > 60 _ change over _ 375 km. The former appear aligned with the subduction plate motion, whereas the latter are closer to perpendicular, parallel to the trench direction. There are significant differences between the slab being subducted beneath Sumatra, and that beneath Java: age of seafloor, maximum depth of seismicity, relative strength of the bulk sound and shear-wave velocity anomaly and location of volcanic front all vary along the trench. We speculate, therefore, that the anisotropy may be a fossilised signature rather than due to contemporary dynamics...|$|R

30|$|Prescribed {{fire and}} low {{thinning}} {{were applied to}} dry forests dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in the eastern Washington Cascades. Experimental design was an unbalanced analysis of variance with 4 control units, 4 thin units, 2 burn units and 2 thin/burn units. Thinning was designed to reduce basal area to 10 – 14 m 2 ha− 1 in a non-uniform pattern and burning was a low intensity spring burn. Burn coverage was spotty, ranging from 23 – 51 %, and considered ineffective in reducing fuels {{at the time of}} application by management and research personnel. Both thinning and burning had effects on vegetation and fuels variables. Thinning reduced canopy closure, canopy bulk density, and basal area, and increased canopy base height. Burning had no influence on these canopy variables. Thinning increased 10 -hr <b>timelag</b> (0.62 – 2.54 cm) fuels. Burning decreased 1 -hr (0 – 0.62 cm) and 10 -hr <b>timelag</b> fuels, forest floor depth and mass, and increased fuelbed depth. There were interactions between thinning and burning for 1 -hr and 10 -hr <b>timelag</b> fuels, and fuelbed depth. These differences in fuel properties did not translate into differences in simulated wildfire behavior and tree mortality. Thinning did increase potential surface fire flame length under 97 percentile weather, and active crown fire potential decreased on thinned units, but basal area survival did not significantly differ between treatments under 80 and 97 percentile weather. The scale at which data are presented has a large influence on interpretation of results. For example, torching fire behavior, expressed as an average at the unit level, was low, but 17 % of the individual plots (about 30 plots total per unit) across all treatments did exhibit potential torching behavior.|$|E

Using the simulated data based on the two LIGO detectors, we were able to detect 77 signals out of 126 above SNR 5 in coincidence, with 43 missed events characterized by signal to noise ratio SNR less than 10.
