5|$|In 1996, Khanna {{campaigned for}} her father's {{election}} in New Delhi (Lok Sabha constituency). In 2000, {{she was part}} of the judges panel at Femina Miss India. She made her theater debut as the female lead in Feroz Khan's All The Best in February 2001. In 2002, Khanna opened her own interior design store in Crawford Market, Mumbai, called The White Window, in partnership with her longtime friend Gurlein Manchanda. Since then, the store has received the Elle Decor International Design Award. She has opened up another branch of the store elsewhere in Mumbai. She does not hold a professional degree and worked with an architect for two years to learn the procedures. During her pregnancy, she practised maps and designs using CAD. Khanna did the interiors for Rani Mukerji's, Reemma Sen's and Tabu's houses, Kareena Kapoor Khan's Bandra flat in 2008 and Poonam Bajaj's design studio. On the request of one of her clients, she ordered a company to make a golden <b>toilet</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E

25|$|UDDTs {{can also}} be built with a bench style <b>toilet</b> <b>seat.</b> This design has been {{standardised}} by the company Rotaria del Peru who have built by now 800 double vault bench UDDTs in and around Lima, Peru. This type of toilet has a wide, spacious bench or box, covering both feces chambers, into which two urine diversion toilet seats are integrated.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E

50|$|<b>Toilet</b> <b>seats</b> are {{manufactured}} {{in a range}} of different styles and colors, and they may be furnished matching the style of the toilet itself. They are usually built to fit the shape of the toilet bowl: two examples of this being the elongated bowl and the regular bowl. Some <b>toilet</b> <b>seats</b> are fitted with slow-closing hinges to reduce noise by preventing them from slamming against the bowl.|$|R
25|$|In {{many parts}} of Asia, people {{traditionally}} use the toilet in a squatting position. This applies to defecation and urination by males and females. Therefore, homes and public washrooms have squat toilets, with the toilet bowl installed in the floor. This has the advantages of not needing an additional <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> and also being more convenient for cultures where people use water to wash their genitals instead of toilet paper. However, Western-style toilets that are mounted at sitting height and which have a plastic seat have become popular as well. Many public washrooms have both squatting and sitting toilets.|$|E

The soccer school is based in Dartford, Kent, and its primary focus is training and development within local schools {{and one of his}} students is currently at West Ham United. In January 2007, while still at loan to Portsmouth, Johnson and former Millwall teammate Ben May were caught trying to steal bathroom fittings from a B store, switching a more expensive <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> into a cheaper box. Johnson received an on the spot fine of £80 by the police. In December 2013, Johnson was banned from driving for six months after he was caught speeding in North Wales; he later lost his appeal against his conviction.|$|E
25|$|In some {{circumstances}} and {{for reasons of}} simplicity, it can be sufficient to not use cover materials at all or to use toilet paper itself as cover material. One example is the case where the UDDT has a mechanized ventilation system and a view guard, like the UDDT manufactured by Separett which has a removable bucket, built-in fan and blue plastic view guard which closes when weight {{is removed from the}} <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> after use. Also in the case of public toilets, it can be easier to let the caretaker perform the task of adding cover material, rather than the user. An example of this are the public single vault UDDTs operated by the not-for-profit company Sanergy in low-income urban areas in Kenya.|$|E

After Epstein became the Beatles' manager, Lennon rushed into Harry's office and asked for them back, saying, [...] "Brian [...] insists I've got to get them back—the pictures, everything you've got. I must take it all with me now." [...] When Epstein finally secured a recording contract with EMI, he sent Harry a telegram from London to the Mersey Beat office to announce the news.|$|E
500|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament {{features}} greater background interaction {{than the}} original, such as {{levels in the}} dark. Williamson's favourite addition to the game was the sponge in the kitchen, which forced players to time their entry onto and exit from a platform. He also liked the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> track. David Darling initially disliked the physics, stating he liked the way the first game achieved skids without feeling like a train manoeuvring. It was worked on until it {{was similar to the}} original, and ultimately it worked [...] "perfectly".

[...] The 777's windows were the largest of any current commercial airliner until the 787, and measure [...] by [...] in size (all models outside the 777-8 and -9). The cabin also features [...] "Flexibility Zones", which entails deliberate placement of water, electrical, pneumatic, and other connection points throughout the interior space, allowing airlines to move seats, galleys, and lavatories quickly and more easily when adjusting cabin arrangements. Several aircraft have also been fitted with VIP interiors for non-airline use. Boeing designed a hydraulically damped <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> cover hinge that closes slowly.|$|E
500|$|There {{were two}} space toilets (ASUs) on Mir, {{located in the}} core module and Kvant-2. They used a fan-driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle Waste Collection System. The user is first {{fastened}} to the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> which was equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal. A lever operated a powerful fan and a suction hole slid open: the air stream carried the waste away. Solid waste was collected in individual bags which were stored in an aluminium container. Full containers were transferred to Progress spacecraft for disposal. Liquid waste was evacuated by a hose connected {{to the front of}} the toilet, with anatomically appropriate [...] "urine funnel adapters" [...] attached to the tube so both men and women could use the same toilet. Waste was collected and transferred to the Water Recovery System, where it was recycled back into drinking water, although this was usually used to produce oxygen via the Elektron system.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{was missing}} for a {{performance}} one evening, and Fascher found him in the toilet with a woman. He broke up the tête-à-tête with a bucket of cold water which he threw over them both, and ordered Lennon onto the stage. Lennon was furious, and complained {{that he could not}} go on stage dripping wet. Fascher snapped back: [...] "I don't give a shit, you're going onstage and I don't care if you do it naked." [...] A short time later the audience was roaring with laughter. Fascher ran to see what the commotion was, and saw Lennon playing guitar, but only wearing underpants with a <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> around his neck. (Epstein later asked Liverpool journalist Bill Harry not to publish photos showing Lennon walking along the Reeperbahn in his underpants). Fascher's brother, Fred, sang lead vocals with the group on [...] "Be Bop A Lula", while he sang with them on [...] "Hallelujah I Love Her So", and his alliance with the Beatles continued, as he later went to work at the Star-Club.|$|E

500|$|Indigenous Australians in New South Wales mixed {{the venom}} {{with that of}} snakes and pine tree gum to form a broth used to coat spear tips. Slim Newton drew popular {{attention}} to redbacks with his song [...] "The Redback on the Toilet Seat", which won the Golden Guitar at the first Country Music Awards of Australia in 1973. Newton recalled an occasion when a friend used his outside toilet where the light globe had blown and reported he was lucky {{there was not a}} redback spider on the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat.</b> The phrase inspired him to write the song. [...] A sculpture of an impossibly large redback, one of Australia's big things, was built in 1996 at Eight Mile Plains, Queensland. The Angels 1991 album Red Back Fever takes its name from the spider. Matilda Bay Brewing Company produces a wheat beer called Redback, with the distinctive red stripe as the logo. The redback appears in the name and emblem of the South Australia cricket team. The Airborne Redback, an Australian ultralight trike, was also named after the spider. Redback Boots is an Australian workboot manufacturing company, which uses the spider in its name and logo. In 2006 a redback spider stamp was designed as part of a [...] "Dangerous Australians" [...] stamp series, but was withheld from general circulation by Australia Post due to concerns that the realistic depiction would scare people opening their letter boxes.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, at the Simpson family's home, Patty {{comes out}} of the closet as a lesbian, saying that she is in love with a pro golfer named Veronica and asking Homer to perform the ceremony. This makes Marge {{extremely}} uncomfortable, even though the evidence was always there. While Homer accepts Patty's sexuality, a furious Marge reveals that she doesn't want her with Veronica and still insists she marries a man. Patty gets angry and points out that Marge acts very [...] "liberal" [...] about the issue but cannot accept her sister's sexuality, and says she hopes to see Marge at her wedding. Before the wedding, Marge accidentally discovers Veronica is actually a man, ironically while Veronica is singing Aerosmith's [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] while shaving, and because Veronica left the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> up after leaving. Happily she decides to keep quiet about it knowing that Patty will be marrying a man. But Marge is so moved by Patty's heartfelt declaration of love for Veronica during the ceremony that she reveals Veronica's Adam's apple. [...] "Veronica" [...] explains that as the straight Leslie Robin Swisher, he posed as a woman to get onto the LPGA golf tour. He then asks Patty if she'll still marry him, but she declines. Afterwards, Marge reconciles with Patty after telling her that she's learned a lesson and has accepted the fact that Patty's a lesbian; they hug after reconciling. Patty and her other sister, Selma, then go to leave a bag at the airport unattended, as a way to meet security personnel they can date.|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{references}} Nixon's dog Checkers. In addition, the veterinarian is {{a reference}} to Vince Edwards, who played Ben Casey on the 1960s drama of the same name. Also, among the books that {{end up in the}} Simpsons' fireplace are The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, Fatherhood by Bill Cosby, and a book entitled Canine Surgery. Fatherhood was heavily referenced in the episode [...] "Saturdays of Thunder" [...] earlier this season. The scene in which Mr. Burns and Smithers brainwash Santa's Little Helper is a parody of A Clockwork Orange with Beethoven's [...] "Ode to Joy". The film uses footage of a kind that would aggravate a dog: a dog being hit with a rolled-up newspaper, a shoe kicking a water dish, a kitten playing with a ball of string, a tank running over a doghouse, a dog being hit on the head by a falling <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> and finally [...] "footage" [...] of Lyndon Johnson holding his dog up in the air by the ears, which actually occurred. Music from Peter and the Wolf, a children's story composed by Sergei Prokofiev, is played over the wanderings of Santa's Little Helper through Springfield's outer domains. This episode also references several controversies about Michael Jackson; for example, Kent Brockman's butler tells Kent that his pet llama bit Ted Kennedy, and Mr. Burns is sleeping in an iron lung as part of his longevity treatment. This episode shows the first time where someone other than Homer says [...] "Doh!". Lisa exclaims it when she is assigned to do a book report on Copernicus and she realizes she does not have any reference books. In addition, the doctor, who was played by Hank Azaria, and the music that plays when he desperately attempts to save the hamster, is {{a reference to}} Ben Casey. One of the places to where Santa's Little Helper voyages, Swartzwelder County, where he rescues a baby from a burning house, is a reference to the writer of this episode, John Swartzwelder.|$|E
