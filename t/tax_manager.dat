40|$|Many {{governments are}} {{struggling}} with inadequate tax revenue and increasing tax gaps. Consequently, changing behaviour of non-compliant taxpayers as small and medium enterprises (SMEs) because of their tax revenue potential and non-compliance behaviour is essential. This thesis examined the impact of corporate income tax penalty incidence, retributive justice, procedural justice, the interaction between retributive and procedural justice on corporate income tax compliance behaviour. Also, the thesis analysed whether corporate income tax compliance costs affect SMEs tax compliance behaviour. Laboratory experimental methods found corporate income tax penalties levied on individual <b>tax</b> <b>managers</b> might {{be more effective than}} corporate income tax penalties charged on corporates. Also high tax compliance costs may decrease tax compliance levels. Likewise, a survey method discovered perceptions of retributive and procedural justice might associate with tax compliance behaviour. However, a perception of procedural justice can moderate the relationship between retributive justice and tax compliance. Conclusively, tax authorities may increase SMEs’ corporate income tax compliance by imposing corporate income tax penalties on <b>tax</b> <b>managers,</b> but these penalties should be perceived to fit the crime of corporate tax non-compliance and imposed through fair procedures. Also, the authorities may increase SMEs’ corporate tax compliance by decreasing tax compliance costs. Shortly, the thesis contributes to the limited tax literature on corporate income tax compliance, procedural and retributive justice and usage of real taxpayers in an experiment. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|On 24 November 2008, {{two of the}} {{remaining}} four defendants, former KPMG tax partner Robert Pfaff and former senior <b>tax</b> <b>manager</b> John Larson, filed a motion to dismiss the charges against them or declare a mistrial. The motion said that during the trial prosecutors elicited testimony from a witness accusing Pfaff and Larson of concealing information from KPMG and its tax department to obtain KPMG approval for BLIPS, thus transforming a tax fraud conspiracy with KPMG against the IRS into an honest services fraud conspiracy against KPMG. The motion said the defense had received no notice of such {{a change in the}} prosecution's theory and could not prepare a defense and so sought to have the judge to dismiss the indictment or grant a mistrial. The motion claimed that the government’s alleged deceitful procurement of KPMG’s confidential tax returns through a parallel civil tax fraud investigation by the DOJ was a violation of due process. The defendants relied on three cases where district courts dismissed indictments or suppressed evidence “where the Government has brought a civil action solely to obtain evidence for its criminal prosecution, or has failed to advise the defendant in its civil proceeding that it contemplates his criminal prosecution.” (Two of these cases were later reversed on appeal.) The prosecution responded that the government has always alleged, and still contends, that KPMG as an entity was a conspirator, not a victim of any kind of fraud. [...] "That {{for a period of time}} there was an effort to keep certain facts from certain individual KPMG employees is of no moment whatever," [...] the government said. Judge Kaplan rejected the motion, finding that neither of the circumstances invoked by the defendants applied to their case: “Defendants do not deny that there was a bona fide civil investigation, they complain merely that there was a criminal investigation as well. And defendants, who were not the targets of the civil investigation, do not claim to have been deceived by the government.” Interestingly, in a footnote, the court notes that the defendants relied in part on the fact that four of the now dismissed defendants had given deposition testimony while unaware of the criminal investigation. Judge Kaplan added that they “do not suggest that the government deceived these individuals,” suggesting perhaps that if the government had engaged in some deceptive conduct, the defendants’ motion might have had more traction.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{corporate tax}} evasion {{in the context}} of the contractual relationship between the shareholders of a firm and a <b>tax</b> <b>manager</b> who possesses private information regarding the extent of legally permissible reductions in taxable income, and who may also undertake illegal tax evasion. Using a costly state falsification framework, we characterize formally the optimal incentive compensation contract for the <b>tax</b> <b>manager</b> and, in particular, how the form of that contract changes in response to alternative enforcement policies imposed by the taxing authority. The optimal contract may adjust to offset, at least partially, the effect of sanctions against illegal evasion, and we find a new and policy-relevant non-equivalence result: penalties imposed on the <b>tax</b> <b>manager</b> are more effective in reducing evasion than are those imposed on shareholders. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} economic view of {{the personal}} income tax {{is that it is}} a distortionary way of raising revenue which nonetheless has value because it tends to increase equality. However, when wages deviate from marginal product, the laissez-faire equilibrium is inefficient, and there can be an independent efficiency rationale for income taxation. I study a setting of wage bargaining within hierarchical teams of workers and managers, and show that the efficiency case for <b>taxing</b> <b>managers</b> depends on a "job-creation" effect: if increased labour supply allows managers to supervise larger teams and thus collect larger rents, they will have an incentive to work too hard to create jobs at their firm. In other words, it is because of their job-creation activity that the "job creators" should be heavily taxed. Simulation of a calibrated model suggests an efficient tax schedule that is progressive over most of the income distribution with a top marginal rate of between 50 % and 60 %, and this result is not sensitive to the magnitude of the labour supply response to taxation. For a planner with redistributive motives, optimal marginal tax rates are also considerably higher at the top of the distribution in the presence of wage bargaining rather than a competitive labour market...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of why some companies pay more taxes than others is a widely investigated topic of interest. One of the famous suspect explanations is a phenomenon called tax avoidance. We develop a holistic theoretical concept of influences on corporate tax planning {{through a series of}} 19 in-depth German tax expert interviews. Our findings show that three distinct hurdles in the tax planning process can explain different levels of tax expense across companies. Those three hurdles are which tax planning methods are. available (defined by business context), desirable (given via aims of tax planning), and implementable (determined by <b>tax</b> <b>manager</b> power). A large part of previous research has estimated the influence of firm characteristics, which we define as part of the business context, on the tax expense, while the other influences that we identify have largely been left "out of the equation". In order to apply and operationalize the identified three-hurdle concept, we construct five short, real-world company case studies. In these case studies, we show how variation in two key constructs across companies leads to different levels of tax expense. First, companies vary widely in the aggressiveness of their aims of tax planning. Second, tax managers can assume very different levels of power in their organization, determining the ability to implement tax planning methods. In conclusion, we provide generalizable insights into the tax planning process of companies which help to explain the observed variation in tax expenses across firms...|$|E
