500|$|Morrissey {{explained}} that the song's theme was [...] "complete loneliness," [...] going on to state: [...] "It was important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> there'd be something searingly poetic about it, in a lyrical sense, and yet jubilant at the same time." [...] Goddard described [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] as [...] "a bleak proclamation of doomed happiness [...] a shattering left-hook of self-loathing, loss and desperation". Years later Morrissey considered the song to be the group's [...] "most special." [...] The singer said he was particularly proud of the song's second verse, which included the lines [...] "Though we may be hidden by rags/We have something they'll never have." [...] Morrissey {{explained that}} the verse described [...] "how I felt when I couldn't afford clothes and used to dress in rags but I didn't really feel mentally impoverished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More book-larning," [...] {{said the}} boatswain, in tones of deep respect. [...] "It’s a wonder <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> head of yours don’t bust." ...|$|E
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. And {{you have}} God's proxy. Well, it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{is a very}} {{delightful}} arrangement, Asher--William appears to approve of it, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} won't much matter either," [...] said the father, [...] "if {{he goes to}} prison and rots there. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> the other alternative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>that's</b> what I mean," [...] Mrs. Assingham pensively pursued. [...] "That's what {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with her to-day," [...] {{she continued to}} explain. [...] "It came home <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> what I've really been doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know as I can all the time," [...] said Lemuel. [...] "But {{it seems}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> what I've learnt here, if I've learnt anything. I think the world's {{a good deal}} better than I used to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is really}} what I do mean, niece. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is the very best thing we could do with the young scamp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a {{dangerous}} game Caswall is up to. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> young man--though he doesn't appear to know it--is riding for a fall!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen!" [...] whispered Unc' Billy Possum. [...] "Do mah ol' ears hear right? 'Pears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> song {{is coming}} right from where Brer Toad is sitting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keaton {{also had}} a {{relationship}} with her The Godfather Trilogy costar Al Pacino. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended following the filming of The Godfather Part III. Keaton said of Pacino, [...] "Al was simply the most entertaining man... <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that's,</b> <b>that</b> is the most beautiful face. I think Warren was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al's face is like whoa. Killer, killer face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you remember," [...] he went on, [...] "how {{the young lady}} {{proposed}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> night <b>that</b> I should finance a little venture in which she and her sleepy-eyed friend opposite were interested." ...|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. Stop a moment. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in {{everything}} <b>that</b> {{you have said}} there is something radically immoral.|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is a {{very nice}} {{distinction}} that you made," [...] said Mr. George, as soon as Rollo had gone, [...] "and that those two things are very near the line." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{he did not}} say so, but he {{has said}} more than once that he feels very {{grateful}} to my brother, and it has just occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> may be his reason. It would be very natural--wouldn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is {{a pretty}} good-looking suit of clothes you're wearing," [...] said Mr. Toad, eyeing Danny critically. [...] "Sunny weather, plenty to eat and drink, and good clothes--must be you don't know when you're well off, Danny Meadow Mouse." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{asked this}} abruptly, because it {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at <b>that</b> moment <b>that</b> he and Peterkin {{should have been}} together.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>that</b> I {{understand}} {{what you mean by}} behaving picturesquely, but it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you do <b>that</b> always, my dear." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} I {{had a few}} pounds still {{remaining}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but <b>that</b> after <b>that</b> was gone I should be penniless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, really," [...] {{said the}} headmaster, [...] "it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{is the only}} {{explanation}} that will square with the facts. A boot that is really smeared with red paint does not become black of itself {{in the course of}} a few minutes." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were many}} more shocks of this kind--when I {{go back in}} memory to that sad time, it seems almost {{incredible}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> poor doubtful faith in revealed religion still survived, and that the struggle still went on, but go on it certainly did.|$|E
60|$|When {{you wrote}} before, {{you were able}} to say the charges against him were not proven. But you know now that they are proven, and it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> bars you and all other honest and honorable men (who are {{independently}} situated) from voting for him.|$|E
5000|$|Warren recounts when {{he lived}} in Los Angeles, [...] "I {{remember}} seeing like Merzbow and stuff {{when he was just}} doing all pedals, and <b>that</b> was the first time I had ever seen a performance with no guitars, no keyboards, no anything. When I saw Masonna, he just had a coin purse, a microphone, and stacks behind him. <b>That</b> was a revolutionary musical experience for me, but I still played guitar for five years after <b>that,</b> and sang, and it never occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was something I was going to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why,' replied {{his sister}} {{with an air}} of triumph, 'hasn't there been {{somebody}} always coming in and out of this office for {{the last three or four}} weeks; hasn't <b>that</b> somebody been left alone in it sometimes--thanks to you; and do you mean <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> somebody isn't the thief!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Captain Eli. [...] "If she can't {{afford to}} keep the little gal, she can't afford to give no Christmas trees nor stockin's, and so it seems <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> cap'n, <b>that</b> <b>that</b> little gal would {{be a pretty good}} child to help us keep Christmas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{likely to}} be, for ONE while, I reckon, if my last act was giving away {{money for the}} sake of doing {{somebody}} a harm with it. But never mind about Tilbury, Aleck, let's talk about something worldly. It does seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> mine is the place for the whole thirty. What's the objection?" ...|$|E
60|$|Livy darling, {{we had a}} {{rattling}} {{good time}} to-day, but we came very near being left at Baden-Baden, for instead of waiting in the waiting-room, we {{sat down on the}} platform to wait where the trains come in from the other direction. We sat there full ten minutes--and {{then all of a sudden}} it occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was not the right place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay--that is to say, {{you have}} hit the mark in your own sage opinion? Lord! Lord! how this world is given to folly! Well, I will allow for once the Oneirocritical science--I will give faith to the {{exposition}} of dreams, and say a Daniel hath arisen to interpret them, if you can prove <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> dream of yours has pointed to a prudent line of conduct." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, Miss Mac-Ivor, I {{dare not}} hope it; a {{thousand}} circumstances of fatal self-indulgence {{have made me}} the creature rather of imagination than reason. Durst I but hope--could I but think--that you would deign <b>to</b> be <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> affectionate, <b>that</b> condescending friend, who would strengthen <b>me</b> <b>to</b> redeem my errors, my future life--' ...|$|R
5000|$|Lars Dalgaard, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said of Conrad: [...] "It’s very {{compelling}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> someone is <b>that</b> humble...I just loved <b>that</b> personality. It’s a very simpatico attitude." ...|$|R
6000|$|BURGESS. He sez to me--this is {{as sure as}} we're settin' here now--he sez: [...] "I'm a fool," [...] he sez;--"and yore a scounderl"--as cool as possible. Me a scounderl, mind you! And {{then shook}} 'ands with me on it, {{as if it was}} to my credit! Do you mean <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> man's sane? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted to}} oblige Cynthia, if I could, {{but there were}} moments during the first day or so when I {{wondered}} how on earth I was going to snatch the necessary time to combine kidnapping with my other duties. Of all the learned professions it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> of the kidnapper most urgently demanded certain intervals for leisured thought, in which schemes and plots might be matured.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was {{the best}} plan too, major. If I had been sent back to my regiment, I don't know what I should have done with your horse; and then, if you did return, I might not have heard about it, and {{you would not have}} known what had become of me. Once or twice during the last month Captain Lindsay has said to me: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Greatson," [...] she said, [...] "you {{will think}} that I am {{a very strange}} girl. I {{am going to be}} married in a few months to a man I do not care for one little bit, and it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> will be the end of my life. I want you to marry Isobel, and I hope you will both be very happy--and--will you please kiss me once? I am Isobel's cousin, you know." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{was aware}} of the very popular notion <b>that</b> our theatres ought to be very small; but it {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if <b>that</b> very popular notion should be suffered to proceed too far it would in every way deteriorate our dramatic performances depriving the proprietors of <b>that</b> revenue which is indispensable to defray the heavy expenses of such a concern.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be as a friend of mine <b>that</b> he'll come; and it {{will not be}} <b>to</b> prove <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'm wrong <b>that</b> you'll ask him--but to prove it to yourself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's why I {{jumped at}} you. A bigger dose {{of you may}} {{disagree}} with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> extent <b>that</b> I shall either die or get better." ...|$|R
