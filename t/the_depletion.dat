5|$|During {{the period}} 1868–1876, Sitting Bull {{developed}} {{into the most}} important of Native American political leaders. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brulé, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.|$|E
40|$|The MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) {{spacecraft}} {{is providing}} new detailed {{observations of the}} Martian ionosphere thanks to its unique orbital coverage and instrument suite. During most periapsis passages on the nightside ionosphere suprathermal electron depletions were detected. A simple criterion was implemented to identify <b>the</b> 1742 <b>depletions</b> observed from 16 November 2014 to 28 February 2015. A statistical analysis reveals that the main ion and electron populations within <b>the</b> <b>depletions</b> are surprisingly constant in time and altitude. Absorption by CO 2 is the main loss process for suprathermal electrons, and electrons that strongly peaked around 6 [*]eV are resulting from this interaction. <b>The</b> observation of <b>depletions</b> appears however highly dependent on altitude. Depletions are mainly located above strong crustal magnetic sources above 170 [*]km, whereas <b>the</b> <b>depletions</b> observed for <b>the</b> first time below 170 [*]km are globally scattered onto the Martian surface with no particular dependence on crustal fields...|$|R

The Government Police (G-Police) was formed by Earth’s remaining coalition government to maintain order in these colonies.|$|E
5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
40|$|Depletions of {{volatile}} siderophile elements (VSE; Ga, Ge, In, As, Sb, Sn, Bi, Zn, Cu, Cd) in mantles of Earth and Moon, {{constrain the}} origin of volatile elements in these bodies, and <b>the</b> overall <b>depletion</b> of volatile elements in Moon relative to Earth. A satisfactory explanation has remained elusive [1, 2]. We examine <b>the</b> <b>depletions</b> of VSE in Earth and Moon and quantify <b>the</b> amount of <b>depletion</b> due to core formation and volatility of potential building blocks. We calculate {{the composition of the}} Earth's PUM during continuous accretion scenarios with constant and variable fO 2. Results suggest that the VSE can be explained by a rather simple scenario of continuous accretion leading to a high PT metal-silicate equilibrium scenario that establishes the siderophile element content of Earth's PUM near the end of accretion [3]. Core formation models for the Moon explain most VSE, but calculated contents of In, Sn, and Zn (all with Tc < 750 K) are all still too high after core formation, and must therefore require an additional process to explain <b>the</b> <b>depletions</b> in <b>the</b> lunar mantle.

Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the perception of a swell in the number of Han.|$|E
5|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for the Moon's formation 4.51 billion years ago, and some 60 million years after {{the origin of the}} Solar System. These mechanisms included the fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force (which would require too great an initial spin of Earth), the gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon (which would require an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon), and the co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk (which does not explain <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> of metals in the Moon). These hypotheses also cannot account for the high angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system.|$|E

5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals.

Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|After withdrawing, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau rendezvoused with Nürnberg and Titania at Nuku Hiva, {{where they}} resupplied and their crews took shore leave {{before moving on}} to meet the rest of the {{squadron}} at Easter Island. Although the Germans had destroyed the shipping at Papeete and wreaked havoc in the town, they had been denied their primary objective of seizing the French coal piles and replenishing their own stocks. Von Spee's raid allowed the British Admiralty to receive word on his position and heading, allowing them to inform Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock of the German intentions thus leading to the Battle of Coronel. Another effect was the reduction of ammunition available to the two German cruisers. The hundreds of shells fired by von Spee's ships at Papeete were irreplaceable. <b>The</b> <b>depletion</b> of ammunition {{as a result of the}} action at Papeete contributed to the German East Asia Squadron's failure to adequately defend itself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands against British battlecruisers. Lieutenant Destremau was chastised by his misinformed superior officer for his actions during the defense of Papeete and for the loss of the gunboat Zélée. He was summoned back to Toulon under arrest to be court-martialled, but died of illness in 1915 before the trial.

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first time during which production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with <b>the</b> <b>depletion</b> of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E
