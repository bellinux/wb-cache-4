5|$|Walter Raleigh Gilbert (16 September 1853 – 26 July 1924) was an English amateur cricketer {{who played}} {{first-class}} cricket for Middlesex and Gloucestershire between 1873 and 1886. A cousin of W. G. Grace, {{he played for}} Gloucestershire when, dominated by the Grace family, it was the leading county. Gilbert's best season was 1876, when he scored 205 not out for the county, but he was subsequently less successful. Closely connected with the United South of England Eleven, a professional touring team of which he eventually became secretary, Gilbert was financially affected by a declining interest in such teams. With insufficient income to continue as an amateur he became a professional in 1886, but played only one match before he was caught stealing from teammates in a minor match, ending his first-class career. After serving a 28-day prison sentence Gilbert moved to Canada, where {{he worked for the}} Land Titles Office in Calgary while remaining a prominent cricketer. He died aged 70 in 1924, but for nearly 60 years after his death, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> conspiracy of silence over his fate.|$|E
25|$|During the {{off-season}} of 2008, the Wild re-acquired Andrew Brunette from the Avalanche, {{as well as}} trading for defenseman Marek Zidlicky. The Wild also signed free agents Antti Miettinen and Owen Nolan to multi-year deals. <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stigma about Jacques Lemaire's defensive system that caused a number of top free agents to avoid the Wild.|$|E
25|$|He firmly {{declined}} to confirm their disciplinary arrangements, {{which seemed to}} allow Constantinople a practically equal authority with Rome and regarded the civil importance of a city as a determining factor in its ecclesiastical position; but he strongly supported its dogmatic decrees, especially when, after the accession of Leo I the Thracian (457), <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> disposition toward compromise with the Eutychians.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lot {{of enthusiasm}} for Kliper within Alan Thirkettle’s team at ESA (as {{outlined}} in the above paragraph), on December 7, 2005, the European space summit of governmental officials of ESA member states declined to approve a 50-million-euro two-year study focusing on ESA's potential involvement in the Kliper project. In denying funding for the study ESA members stated that, among other factors that seemed unfavourable, under the current Russian proposal Europe would not share control over {{the design of the}} program and would be limited to being a small industrial contributor.|$|E
25|$|I saw in {{his hand}} a long spear of gold, and at the point <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> little fire. He {{appeared}} {{to me to be}} thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...|$|E
25|$|King George VI {{had great}} affection for his younger brother. Circumstances {{had made them}} closer {{following}} the abdication, and the King trusted Prince Henry with important matters, which he dutifully undertook. Sometimes, though, the organised King found his brother's less systematic manner irritating. On one occasion {{after a day of}} shooting at Balmoral Castle, the King found a mistake on his shot-game record, where <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pair of grouse missing. A member of staff suggested that the King call and ask the Duke of Gloucester, who was staying at Birkhall. When the Duke confirmed he had taken the birds, the King's gruff warning to his brother that he should never again take birds without telling him surprised the member of staff.|$|E

500|$|... "Grift of the Magi" [...] {{was written}} by Tom Martin and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was the first episode that Martin wrote on his own, having previously co-written the season ten episode [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday" [...] with George Meyer, Brian Scully, and The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully. Martin got the inspiration for [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] after reading a magazine article about how major companies were receiving permission to advertise their products in school students' textbooks. He thought it [...] "seemed like a gigantic conflict that could lead to big problems", and therefore believed an episode based on {{it would be a good}} idea. According to DVD Talk reviewer Adam Tyner, the episode is a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. A writer for Newsday has commented that episode skewers [...] "the annual craze for that one 'hot' toy." [...] This has also been pointed out by Mike Scully, who said in 2008 that [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] was produced around the time when [...] "every year <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hot toy. Like the Furbies, or whatever – some toy that kids just had to have that year." [...] In response to Scully's comment, Martin added that every year [...] "the media would create this gigantic rush at the toy store for various things. This [...] was coming on the heels of, yeah, the Furby." ...|$|E
500|$|After Gilbert's retirement, {{and even}} {{following}} his death, controversy remained {{attached to his}} name; <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> conspiracy of silence surrounding his fate. Cricket historians rarely mentioned him, despite his varied career. W. G. Grace, although including Gilbert in an appendix of leading batsmen in his 1891 book Cricket, did not include him in the text at all, despite the book's more than 400pages; in his Cricketers I Have Met, Grace described 121cricketers but did not mention his cousin. Further evidence of Gilbert's disgrace came {{in the pages of}} Wisden. Although Gilbert began as an amateur cricketer, which entitled him to have [...] "Mr." [...] before his name in the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] section, he was referred to until his death as [...] "Gilbert, W. R.", which denoted a professional. However, in his Wisden obituary he received the title [...] "Mr. W. R. Gilbert", even though the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] still listed him as a professional, and in 1935 he was once again restored to amateur status in [...] "Births and Deaths", for reasons which are unclear. The same obituary glossed over Gilbert's enforced retirement from cricket, simply observing: [...] "At the beginning of 1886 he became a professional, and the season was not far advanced before his career in first-class cricket ended abruptly. He then left England for Canada." [...] Even in 1970, the silence continued; historian Rowland Bowen wrote about the story but concluded by saying: [...] "Another indication of the recurring instinct for suppression was a suggestion to me that if this story had not appeared in print before (it has not) it should not now." [...] It is not clear who made this suggestion, whether it was descendants of the Grace family, a cricket administrator or someone else. It was not until 1984 that the full story was published by historian Robert Brook. In reviewing what he considered to be the injustice of the case, and reflecting on Gilbert's success in Canada, Green wrote: [...] "No wonder that those responsible for this act of appalling cruelty went to such fatuous lengths to keep its details a secret." ...|$|E

2500|$|As one {{experiment}} {{to test for}} personal survival of bodily death, in the 1960s Stevenson set a combination lock using a secret word or phrase {{and placed it in}} a filing cabinet in the department, telling his colleagues he would try to pass the code to them after his death. Emily Williams Kelly told The New York Times: [...] "Presumably, if someone had a vivid dream about him, in which <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> word or a phrase that kept being repeated—I don't quite know how it would work—if it seemed promising enough, we would try to open it using the combination suggested."

2500|$|During the 1961 season, Mantle and {{teammate}} Roger Maris, {{known as}} the M Boys, chased Babe Ruth's 1927 single-season home run record. Five years earlier, in 1956, Mantle had challenged Ruth's record {{for most of the}} season, and the New York press had been protective of Ruth on that occasion also. When Mantle finally fell short, finishing with 52, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> collective sigh of relief from the New York traditionalists. Nor had the New York press been all that kind to Mantle in his early years with the team: he struck out frequently, was injury-prone, was a [...] "true hick" [...] from Oklahoma, and was perceived as being distinctly inferior to his predecessor in center field, Joe DiMaggio.|$|E
2500|$|Comic Jumper was {{revealed}} on September 4, 2009 at PAX. Joystiq interviewed Twisted Pixel's Mike Wilford who cited Final Fight as {{an inspiration for}} melee combat, while Contra and Gunstar Heroes served as inspirations for gun sequences, and said the humor as akin to Earthworm Jim. Wilford further stated [...] "Back in the day, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> whole lot of mascot-type characters in games, like Mario, Sonic, all those things, and not many devs {{seem to be doing}} that anymore. We're trying to bring that back a little bit with our games." [...] Comic Jumper is the brainchild of Josh Bear, co-founder and director at Twisted Pixel. [...] Wilford stated that Bear had the idea for the game beginning in seventh grade. It was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace on October 6, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Feast promotion.|$|E

2500|$|Inquiries in the West Riding of Yorkshire by an {{assistant}} to the Royal Commission had led him to note that out-door relief was an important (and relatively cheap) way of coping with the trade cycle. When trade was slack manufacturers could lay off 500 hands at once - this was a scale for which it would be impracticable to provide workhouse accommodation; where unemployment {{was likely to be}} temporary (e.g. caused by the trade cycle or sickness) the eventual cost (and inconvenience) of re-establishing a household on leaving the workhouse had to be borne in mind and could well suggest the wisdom of out-door relief. Furthermore, where the head of a household containing child wage-earners became unemployed, it would be more sensible (and cheaper) to supplement the household income by a judicious amount of out-door relief than to move the family to the poorhouse. [...] Hand-loom weavers, a group of workers now habitually in great distress, had very low earnings; not because their wages were supplemented by out-door relief, but because they were competing with power-looms; nothing would be gained by forcing them into the workhouse or to turn to some occupation for which they would not have the required physical strength. [...] The Assistant Commissioner also noted that diet of West-Riding poorhouse inmates was not a deterrent; <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> deliberate policy of 'the best of everything, and plenty of it'.|$|E
2500|$|After {{losing the}} 1967 American League pennant by one game to the Red Sox, the Tigers {{got off to}} a 9–1 start in 1968. By April 29, they were 12–4. On May 10, the Tigers moved into first place and {{remained}} there {{for the rest of the}} season. In baseball's final season before the leagues each split into two divisions, the Tigers finished with a record of 103–59 and outscored their opponents 671 to 492. The Orioles stayed close through much of the season, but the Tigers wound up winning the pennant with a 12-game lead over Baltimore. The 1968 Tigers also won the season series against all nine league opponents‚ the first team to accomplish that since the 1955 Dodgers. The 1968 Tigers developed a reputation for dramatic comebacks, often with winning late-inning home runs. The Tigers led the major leagues with 185 home runs in 1968. They won 40 games from the 7th inning forward, and won 30 games in their last at bat. In each game, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> new hero, with even the light-hitting Don Wert, Ray Oyler and Tom Matchick providing clutch hits to win ballgames. [...] The 1968 Tigers were also known for their esprit de corps. The starting lineup had been intact since 1965, and several of those starters had grown up in Michigan as Detroit Tigers fans: Willie Horton in Detroit's inner city, Bill Freehan in suburban Royal Oak, Jim Northrup in a small town [...] west of Saginaw, and Mickey Stanley from the west of the state in Grand Rapids.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the degree}} to which it {{impacted}} their relationship is not clear, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> struggle between Abraham's yearning for study and Thomas' understanding about the importance of study to Abraham's life. [...] Abraham seemed particularly critical of his father's lack of education and lack of an earnest drive to see that his children received a good education. Historian Ronald C. White wrote that negative portraits of Thomas Lincoln come [...] "from a son who said his father 'grew up literally without education,' the very value Abraham Lincoln would come to prize the most." [...] Abraham Lincoln, in turn, appears to have been unaware of his father's early struggles, particularly how the death of his grandfather forced Thomas to become a laborer: [...] "Abraham Lincoln never fully understood how hard his father had to struggle during his early years. It required an immense effort for Thomas, who earned three shillings a day for manual labor or made a little more when he did carpentry or cabinetmaking, to accumulate enough money to buy his first farm." [...] Father and son also differed in their beliefs about religion; Thomas was a conventional Baptist. [...] Growing up in a nonconformist household Abe developed his own free-thinker. [...] Lastly, some say that Thomas favored John Johnston, his stepson, over Abraham. Their relationship had become strained after Abraham left his father's house and even moreso after Abraham bailed Thomas out of financial situations. His stepbrother, John D. Johnston, with whom Thomas had a closer relationship, also made repeated requests for money.|$|E

2500|$|During {{this period}} Vernon, Cokayne and Henry Grey, Baron Grey of Codnor, were the decisive {{influences}} {{in the choice}} of knights of the shire, generally in collusion, although Humphrey Stafford also took a close interest. However, in 1433 the tacit collaboration between the gentry and Grey broke down. In April Grey sought a closer aliance by granting his livery to both Cokayne and Vernon. However, the county was already in a state of great tension, with a major dispute between the Foljambe and Pierrepont families overshadowing other issues. This did not reach a climax until 1 January 1434 at Chesterfield parish church, when Sir Henry Pierrepont was maimed and two of his companions killed. Subsequently, through the interpretations of two separate grand juries set before a commission of oyer and terminer at Derby in March and a trial the following month, the previous year's events were filtered into rival and shifting narratives. Cokayne and Vernon were part of a jury that upheld Thomas Foljambe's version of events. Grey was indicted for bringing a force of 200 men to Derby on 24 June 1433 to hinder the county election. However, Vernon and Cokayne were also indicted for turning out a force of 300 to take the county seats for themselves – the last time either would sit in Parliament. There was no direct connection between the contested election and the sensational murders but at the time <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pattern of widespread violence and intimidation which both sides sought to use in justification. The 1433 Parliament had agreed that [...] "no Lorde, nor none other persone, of what estate, degree or condition that he be, shal wetyngly receyve, cherishe, hold in household, ne maynteyne" [...] criminals of any sort. To that end it had specifically forbidden the granting of livery and the maintenance of retinues as part of a general condemnation of intimidation in judicial and political affairs. Ironically, it was Grey, together with Vernon and Cokayne, described as [...] "knights of the shire," [...] who were in May 1434 commissioned {{under the terms of the}} act to take oaths from a large number of Derbyshire men, pledging themselves not to maintain peace breakers.|$|E
