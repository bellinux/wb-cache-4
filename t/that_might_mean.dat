25|$|With Lou Harrison...being gay is {{something}} affirmative. He's {{proud to be}} a gay composer and interested in talking about what <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean.</b> He doesn't feel threatened that this means he won't be thought of as an American composer who is also great and timeless and universal.|$|E
2500|$|Felicity Hampel SC, {{president}} {{of civil liberties}} group Liberty Victoria, replied in response to Hulls, [...] "Neither imprisonment in itself nor parole in itself {{is going to stop}} everybody from committing offences. What's important to bear in mind is that a person has to be sentenced for the offence they've committed, and <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that somebody gets a sentence that is proportionate for the crime, but it doesn't cure them of the dangerousness or the characteristic that makes them continue to offend".|$|E
2500|$|As an Illinois State Senator, Obama {{supported}} Senate bill 0099 for [...] "age and developmentally appropriate" [...] sex education, {{which would}} have allowed parents to choose to withdraw their children from the classes. The bill was endorsed by the Illinois Parent Teacher Association, the Illinois State Medical Society, the Illinois Public Health Association, and the Illinois Education Association. In a debate in 2004, when questioned by Alan Keyes {{about what kind of}} sex education was [...] "age appropriate" [...] for kindergarteners, Obama said, [...] "I'll give you an example, because I have a six-year-old daughter and a three-year-old daughter, {{and one of the things}} my wife and I talked to our daughter about is the possibility of somebody touching them inappropriately, and what <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean.</b> And that was included specifically in the law, so that kindergarteners are able to exercise some possible protection against abuse...." [...] In 2007, in response to a similar attack from Mitt Romney, an Obama spokesperson stated his position that communities should determine the curriculum. The Illinois bill did not call for addressing all sex-related issues in kindergarten classes, and Obama has said that he [...] "does not support teaching explicit sex education to children in kindergarten." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{interaction}} with PSD95 and S-SCAM is {{mediated by the}} GUK domain {{and it has been}} hypothesized <b>that</b> this <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> it can also interact with other GUK containing proteins.|$|R
5000|$|Hidden on {{the back}} cover is a {{sequence}} of letters and numbers reading [...] "EnHo_001", usually pronounced [...] "EN-hoe won." [...] Clues inside the book suggest <b>that</b> this <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "Encyclopedia Horrifica Book 1".|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Norris," [...] she said, [...] "forgive me if I am disagreeable, {{but think}} what I went {{through to get}} that paper. Think how I have hoped <b>that</b> it <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> {{everything}} to you, perhaps to us." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Nelson was 11 years old, {{the family}} moved to Fort Worth, where he barely survived typhoid fever after losing nearly half his body weight to the disease, which also left him unable to sire children. Soon after his baptism at age 12, he started caddying at Glen Garden Country Club. On his caddying days, Nelson said, [...] "I knew nothing about caddying at first, but it wasn't {{difficult}} to learn. The other caddies, though, didn't like to see any new ones, because <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> they wouldn't get a job sometime." [...] An article on Nelson in Sports Illustrated noted that initially caddies were not permitted to play at the club: [...] "e would often practice in the dark, putting his white handkerchief over the hole so he could find it in the darkness." [...] The club later changed its policy and sponsored a caddie tournament, where a 14-year-old Nelson beat fellow caddie and future golf great Ben Hogan by a single stroke after a nine-hole playoff. Nelson and Hogan were rivals but close friends in their teen years, and for the first part of their professional careers as well, but Nelson's early success was difficult for the struggling Hogan to deal with, and they gradually grew apart, while retaining mutual respect.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{at these}} ominous words, <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> so much or so little, the sweat started to my brow, and a shiver went down my back.|$|E

5000|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the etymology of angama. One theory decomposes angama into *an (possibly meaning mother) and *gama (possibly a diminutive suffix). Another theory relates angama to [...] "elder sister" [...] (angwƒÅ in Okinawan). Some argue <b>that</b> it <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "disguise of a mask." ...|$|R
60|$|They talked it all over, and as {{they entered}} town they agreed to believe <b>that</b> he <b>might</b> {{possibly}} <b>mean</b> somebody else--at least <b>that</b> he <b>might</b> at least <b>mean</b> nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.|$|R
6000|$|Here was an idea. The {{description}} of the article required, a [...] "spirit-haunted shape of power" [...] that spoke [...] "both of {{the spirit and the}} body of man and yet of more than man," [...] was so vague <b>that</b> it <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> anything or nothing. And yet---- ...|$|R
6000|$|Firstly. If {{this word}} could mean {{anything}} {{it would mean}} firstlike, whatever <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean.</b> The ordinal numbers should have no adverbial form: [...] "firstly," [...] "secondly," [...] and the rest are words without meaning.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think we}} ought to go home, Siegmund.' He made a small sound, <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> anything, but did not stir or release her. His mouth, however, {{remained}} motionless on her throat, and the caress went out of it.|$|E
60|$|The {{communication}} was signed with a scrawl <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> anything. The negro {{read it and}} passed it to his friends. All were mystified, but they decided that they must do as the letter said, and without loss of time.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "Boshita Boshita" [...] {{originated}} in the Korean language. [...] A book entitled History of Kumamoto city, published in 1932, wrote that [...] "Ehekoroboshita" [...] {{was used as the}} shouting phrase which came from the Korean language. A Korean association in Kumamoto said <b>that</b> it <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> a great man (Toyotomi Hideyoshi) died.|$|R
6000|$|It must be {{confessed that}} though he walked swiftly, Dave's heart was {{anything}} but light. Turn the subject as he might he felt it [...] "in his bones," [...] as he afterward declared, that a big uprising was close at hand and <b>that</b> this <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> the wiping out of every pioneer for scores of miles around.|$|R
60|$|Here, again, I suppose I had a fair {{warning of}} the drift of things. I seem to {{remember}} myself in the train to Paddington, sitting {{with a handful of}} papers--galley proofs for the BLUE WEEKLY, I suppose--on my lap, and thinking about her and that last sentence of hers, and all <b>that</b> it <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> to me.|$|R
60|$|Yet I {{reflected}} that the tramp-- {{or whatever the}} man was-- had evinced a determination to secure an interview with Mr. Woodward before quitting Darbyville. There was important business to be transacted between them. Mr. John Stumpy intended to have his say, whatever <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Dave {{had noticed}} {{a good many}} whispered conversations taking place between {{some of the old}} {{students}} and all of the new ones, and he had wondered what was going on. A hint was dropped that the football meeting would [...] "wake things up," [...] whatever <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean.</b>|$|E
60|$|Whatever the Indian {{had listened}} to or for, {{presently}} he satisfied himself, and, with a grunt <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> anything, he rose and {{turned away from the}} rim. Gale followed, rested now and eager to go on. He saw that the great cliff they had climbed was only a stairway up to the huge looming dark bulk of the plateau above.|$|E
60|$|The shadows {{lengthened}} in the stable-yard, {{and still}} nobody came. I {{began to wonder}} if they had forgotten me, and presently, in spite of myself, a faint hope began to spring up inside me <b>that</b> this <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> I was not to be shot after all. Perhaps Toto at the eleventh hour had explained everything.|$|R
60|$|Away she bustled, half distracted, {{while my}} father sat moody, {{with his chin}} upon his hands, and I {{remained}} lost in wonder {{at the thought of}} this grand new relative from London, and of all <b>that</b> his coming <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> to us.|$|R
2500|$|Literally Shearing of the Court, Fergus Kelly {{suggests}} <b>that</b> this <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> more loosely [...] "court summary" [...] or [...] "synopsis {{of court}} procedure."

Interesting, it covers the ways that sureties were appointed to their duties, and hence it is informative on the way contracts were created.|$|R
60|$|Poor Mrs. Merrifield! {{this was}} quite {{too much for}} her. She thought it irreverent to apply the word in any save an ecclesiastical sense; nor did she at all desire to have the parish, which was {{considered}} to be admirably worked by the constituted authorities, 'regenerated,' whatever <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean,</b> by a young lady of one-and- twenty. She rose up and observed to her daughter that she saw papa out upon the lawn, and she thought {{it was time to go}} home.|$|E
60|$|He sealed up the letter--that incriminating letter, <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> so {{much more}} than he ever put into it--and took it out to the post, with the three {{thousand}} pounds and Montague Nevitt's pocket-book in a separate packet. Proud Kelmscott as he was by birth and nature, he slunk through the streets like a guilty man, fancying all eyes were fixed suspiciously upon him. Then he returned to the hotel in a burning heat, went into the smoking room on purpose like an honest man, and rang the bell for the servant boldly.|$|E
6000|$|His {{telegram}} read: [...] "Coming {{on important}} business." [...] <b>That</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> concerning the mine--on the surface; but beneath ran something more vital to them both than any mine or labor war, something {{which developed in}} the girl both fear and wonder--fear of the power that came from his eyes, wonder of the world his love had already opened to her. What was {{the meaning of this}} mad, sweet riot of the blood--this forgetfulness of {{all the rest of the}} world--this longing which was both pleasure and pain, doubt and delight, which turned her face to the West as though through a long, shining vista she saw love's messenger speeding towards her? ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the death}} of Great King Burebista, Dacia split into four, then five smaller kingdoms. Nothing is known about Decebalus' youth or background. Decebalus appears to have risen to {{prominence}} {{in the court of}} the Dacian king Duras, who claimed authority over all Dacian territory. An ancient Dacian pot bearing the words ‚ÄúDecebalus per Scorilo‚Äù led to the suggestion <b>that</b> this <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "Decebalus son of Scorilo".|$|R

60|$|The letter, {{crumpled}} and damp, {{remained in}} Crystal's hand {{all the while}} that she sat by the open window, {{and the sound of}} moving horses and men in the distance conjured up before her eyes mental visions of all <b>that</b> to-morrow <b>might</b> <b>mean.</b> The letter was damp with her tears now, they had fallen incessantly on the paper while she re-read it a second time and then re-read it again.|$|R
60|$|Psmith's {{brain was}} working rapidly {{as he went}} downstairs. What exactly was {{at the back of}} the sleuth's mind, {{prompting}} these maneuvers, he did not know. But that there was something, and that that something was directed in a hostile manner against Mike, probably in connection with last night's wild happenings, he was certain. Psmith had noticed, on leaving his bed at the sound of the alarm bell, that he and Jellicoe were alone in the room. <b>That</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that Mike had gone out through the door when the bell sounded, or it might mean that he had been out all the time. It began to look as if the latter solution were the correct one.|$|E
60|$|It was {{possible}} that Sam and his allies had departed in the automobile to get reinforcements, leaving the coast temporarily clear; in which case, by escaping from the house at once, {{we might be able}} to slip unobserved through the grounds and reach the village in safety. To support this theory there was the fact that the car, on its late visit, had contained only the chauffeur and the two ambassadors, while Sam had spoken of the remainder of Buck's gang as being in readiness to attack in the event of my not coming to terms. <b>That</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that they were waiting at Buck's headquarters, wherever those might be--at one of the cottages down the road, I imagined; and, in the interval before the attack began, it might be possible for us to make our sortie with success.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR ST. GAUDENS,--I had {{determined}} not to write to you till I had seen the medallion, but {{it looks as if}} <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> the Greek Kalends or the day after to-morrow. Reassure yourself, your part is done, it is ours that halts--the consideration of conveyance over our sweet little road on boys' backs, for we cannot very well apply the horses to this work; there is only one; you cannot put it in a panier; {{to put it on the}} horse's back we have not the heart. Beneath the beauty of R. L. S., to say nothing of his verses, which the publishers find heavy enough, and the genius of the god-like sculptor, the spine would snap and the well-knit limbs of the (ahem) cart-horse would be loosed by death. So you are to conceive me, sitting in my house, dubitative, and the medallion chuckling in the warehouse of the German firm, for some days longer; and hear me meanwhile on the golden letters.|$|E

He is the representative of a completely-new way of discourse with alternative lexical resources in preference of connotation rather than the commonly-old usage of denotation.

60|$|In {{which set}} of chambers, never having troubled his head about the inscription, unless to bethink himself at odd times on glancing up at it, <b>that</b> haply it <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> Perhaps John Thomas, or Perhaps Joe Tyler, sat Mr. Grewgious writing by his fire.|$|R
50|$|In 1887, a new {{government}} came into office. It ended the forced exile of leprosy patients to Molokai and closed the specialty hospital in Oahu.

She accepted the call, knowing <b>that</b> it <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> she would never return to New York. ‚ÄúWe will cheerfully accept the work‚Ä¶‚Äù was her response.|$|R
