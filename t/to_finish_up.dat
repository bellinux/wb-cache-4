5|$|Production on The Orphanage {{began on}} May 15, 2006 in Llanes, Asturias. This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place. The orphanage was an old colonial house {{from the end of}} the nineteenth century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E
25|$|Also in April, {{the band}} decided <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> their demo CD which was {{entitled}} Frail. They printed 1,000 copies {{for friends and}} family members to purchase and had a small release party at school. The copies went fast, and by June they printed 500 more for record companies and those who weren't able to obtain them the first time around.|$|E
25|$|Also in February 2006, {{the band}} {{went back into}} the studio <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the {{recordings}} they started the previous fall. Initially unsure of how to release so many songs, the band announced in May 2006 that they would release a one-disc album in early September entitled Barenaked Ladies Are Me. Several alternate versions are available, including downloadable versions and a USB flash drive version. The B.L.A.M. tour in support of the album, and its follow-up Barenaked Ladies Are Men (both of which hail from the same sessions), ran in Fall 2006 for the U.S., February 2007 for Canada, and later in 2007 for the UK. That same year, the band wrote and recorded the theme song for the television series The Big Bang Theory.|$|E

25|$|Less Than {{a minute}} {{into the game}} Brady Quinn proved just why he's {{one of the top}} QBs in College Football today and he didn't stop there going 14 of 19 for 207 yards passing and 4 TDs. At :54 seconds Quinn hit Jeff Samardzija for a 51-yd TD pass and a 7-0 lead. Less than five minutes later he threw a 1-yd pass to John Carlson to put Notre Dame up 14-0. At 8:40 into the game Air Force got on the board when Zach Sasser kicked a 32-yd field goal to shrink the deficit to 14-3. But Quinn would respond with a 24-yd pass to Rhema McKnight. Air Force was able to block the Extra Point Attempt and Notre Dame was now up 20-3 <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the 1st quarter. The second quarter showed off a lot of good defense {{including}} a blocked FG attempt that saw Terrail Lambert return the blocked kick 76-yds for a TD to put Notre Dame up 27-3 at the half.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 10, {{the third}} spacewalk of the STS-134 mission was conducted. The spacewalk {{made use of}} a new spacewalk pre-breathe {{protocol}}, called In-Suit Light Exercise (ISLE), instead of the normal campout pre-breathe protocol. The new pre-breathe protocol had the astronauts breathe pure oxygen for 60 minutes in the airlock, which had its air pressure lowered to 10.2 Psi (703hPa). The astronauts then put their spacesuits on, performed light exercise and rested for an additional 50 minutes, breathing pure oxygen all the while. After astronauts Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke exited the Quest Airlock, the pair began installing the Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). The fixture itself {{and most of its}} components were installed, but the data cable associated with it was to be installed later. The spacewalking pair then moved on and routed some new power cables from the Unity module to the Zarya module on the Russian segment of the ISS, providing a redundant power supply to the Russian segment. Feustel and Fincke then moved on <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the installation of the wireless video system which Fuestel and Greg Chamitoff had begun to install on EVA 1. The pair also took pictures of the Zarya module's thrusters and captured some infrared video of an experiment delivered on board the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3. Commander Mark Kelly documented the spacewalk from inside the station. While the EVA was going on, pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialist Roberto Vittori assisted Expedition 28 flight engineer Ron Garan in stowing new equipment and supplies on the ISS.|$|E
500|$|Since {{her first}} visit to Gwaeynynog {{fourteen}} years before the composition of The Flopsy Bunnies, Potter had sketched the garden many times. She described it following a visit in 1895: [...] "The garden is very large, two-thirds surrounded by a red brick wall with many apricots, and an inner circle of old grey apple trees on espaliers. It is very productive but not tidy, the prettiest kind of garden, where bright old-fashioned flowers grow amongst the currant bushes." [...] Early in 1909 she wrote to her publisher, [...] "I have done lots of sketches [...] not all to the purpose [...] and will now endeavour <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the F. Bunnies without further delay." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Marvin Gaye went to New York {{to record}} a series of ballads with {{arranger}} Bobby Scott, as Gaye continued his attempts to become a successful pop crooner. Sessions ended abruptly, however, when Gaye felt the recordings were too poor for his liking. Disappointed, he stopped pursuing {{a career as a}} crooner, while recording pop hits for Motown. In 1977, two years after buying his own studio, and shortly after reworking the live album, Live at the London Palladium, Gaye began <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>up</b> work on his shelved ballads project.|$|R

500|$|Goldman also {{approached}} Sorkin {{with a story}} premise, which Sorkin {{developed into}} the script for Malice. Goldman oversaw the project as creative consultant while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts. However, {{he had to leave}} the project <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the script for A Few Good Men, so screenwriter Scott Frank stepped in and wrote two drafts of the Malice screenplay. When production on A Few Good Men wrapped up, Sorkin took over and resumed working on the Malice right through the final shooting script. Harold Becker directed the film, a medical thriller released in 1993, which starred Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin. Malice had mixed reviews. Vincent Canby in The New York Times described the film as [...] "deviously entertaining from its start through its finish". Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, and Peter Travers in a 2000 Rolling Stone review summarized it as having [...] "suspense but no staying power".|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1993's Vs., the band members did not go into the {{recording}} sessions with any completed songs, only guitar riffs. Vedder admitted that the band [...] "really went in with nothing." [...] The band sat around playing music together and discussed the song arrangements, and in just one week had completed ten songs. Ament described it as a [...] "real collaborative effort," [...] and Vedder described it as [...] "absolute democracy." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated that the band members were feeling [...] "fresh and energetic" [...] and [...] "were communicating better than ever." [...] Toward the end of the sessions it came down to Vedder <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the material, with Ament observing that [...] "the way the record started and the way that it finished is probably two different things." [...] Regarding his lyric writing process, Vedder said that he wrote at least four different sets of lyrics for each song, with many going as high as eight. Vedder described as a process that demands [...] "the patience of like a National Geographic photographer sitting underneath the bush in a tent", adding he would at times [...] "figure out after eight, nine or eleven drafts that the first one was actually the one". A total of 25 songs were written before coming down to the 13 on the final track listing. Outtakes include [...] "The Forest", later featured on Ament's 2008 solo album Tone, and [...] "Of the Earth", which started being played live in 2010.|$|E
500|$|When {{they reached}} a red brick {{building}} in Beersheba near the Mosque, Robey's squadron rode towards {{the western side of}} the town, towards the north, to reach a point about [...] south of the railway station, then they proceeded across the railway line before turning to the right, <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> near an oval roofed building on the northern outskirts of the town. Meanwhile, Davies' squadron rode up the main street to join Robey on the northern outskirts. Here both squadrons turned about, to stop and capture an Ottoman column, attempting to escape Beersheba. Most of the column surrendered along with nine guns. One troop [...] "silenced" [...] Ottoman soldiers holding trenches east of Beersheba when about 60 of them tried to escape. They were recaptured by a troop from the 12th Light Horse Regiment's [...] "C" [...] Squadron. A large proportion of the Ottoman troops in the town, were eventually killed or captured. It has been estimated more than half the Ottoman dismounted troops in Beersheba, were captured or killed, while 15 of the 28 guns in the town were captured. The 12th Light Horse Regiment handed over 37 officers and 63 other ranks prisoners to Brigade Headquarters at 23:00 with four guns and transport. Together the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments captured 1,148 prisoners, 10 field guns, four machine guns, a huge quantity of military stores, an aerodrome, and railway rolling stock. Total captures by Desert Mounted Corps for the day amounted to 1,528 prisoners. All available engineer units were sent to develop the wells in the town but the supply was not great. Fortunately on 25 October there had been thunderstorms which left pools of water over a wide area from which the horses were watered.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{recording}} sessions {{on the new}} album progressed, U2 decided {{they would not be}} ready to finish their album for the mid-year production deadline, and pushed back the release date by several months. [...] To get the album ready for its March 1997 release, the album's recording sessions had to be finished by the end of December. [...] Within one month of the production deadline, the album was still untitled and had much work left before it could be completed. [...] Because the dates for the tour had already been booked, the album's release could not be delayed any further. [...] Eventually, the album was titled Pop, and Williams dubbed the title [...] "PopMart" [...] for the tour. [...] The album's recording sessions were finished in time for the March 1997 release date, but the band felt they still needed another month to fully complete the album. [...] Bono later stated that letting McGuinness book the tour before the album was finished was the worst decision that U2 ever made because it forced them <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the album sooner than they had wanted.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the cast}} of the series {{performed}} a small promotional tour ("The Gleek Tour") at various Hot Topic stores in the U.S. to showcase the series' soundtrack and to meet with fans of the show. This was followed with a performance of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] at Citizens Bank Park for the 2009 World Series. A concert tour was hinted by several cast members via Twitter {{at the beginning of}} 2010. The success of the promotional outing lead {{to the creation of the}} concert tour. The tour was officially announced via Fox on March 1, 2010 at the conclusion of the first season. Lea Michele (Rachel Berry) expressed her excitement for the tour stating, [...] "This has been such an extraordinary year for 'Glee' and I can’t think of a better way <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> the first season than performing live on stage with the cast". Her comments were later shared by Cory Monteith (Finn Hudson) stating, [...] "This show has changed my life in so many ways. If you had told me a year ago that I’d be performing classic rock songs in concert theaters around the country, I would never have believed you. We are psyched!". The tour performed over a dozen sell-out shows in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|After touring {{through the}} spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered Bear Creek Studio in Woodinville, Washington, with {{producer}} Gil Norton to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, {{the rest of the}} band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>up</b> his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's [...] "drum tracks with his own for all but two songs." [...] During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, [...] "Dude, don't come down here, I'm recording some of the drum tracks". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording [...] "some" [...] of the tracks. Mendel asked, [...] "Is that what he told you?"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, [...] "No, man, he did them all".|$|E
