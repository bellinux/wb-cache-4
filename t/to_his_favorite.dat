5|$|Because of Nintendo's solid {{infrastructure}} for the DS, Igarashi {{wanted to try}} the online components, and test for possible online game play, in future Castlevania titles. Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage <b>to</b> , <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> Castlevania game. The anime style of artwork was retained from Dawn of Sorrow, which Igarashi had switched to in the previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems. Portrait of Ruins development cycle took roughly {{the same amount of}} time as Dawn of Sorrow did. Koji Igarashi stated that the schedule became tight due to Nintendo Wi-Fi difficulties, considering it was their first online enabled game.|$|E
5|$|That night, SpongeBob goes <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> restaurant, Goofy Goober's, {{where he}} drowns his sorrows in {{ice cream with}} his best friend Patrick Star. Elsewhere, Mr. Krabs' {{business}} rival Plankton steals King Neptune's crown, leaving false evidence to frame Mr. Krabs for the crime, and sends the crown to Shell City, a distant, mysterious land from which no fish has returned. The next morning, Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 and threatens Mr. Krabs for his alleged thievery. SpongeBob later arrives and chastises Krabs {{under the influence of}} an ice cream headache, but seeing his boss's life is at risk, he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune freezes Krabs and orders SpongeBob to return with the crown in six days for him to spare Krabs' life. Neptune's sympathetic daughter, Princess Mindy, gives SpongeBob a Bag of Winds so that they can return from Shell City once they find the crown. SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City in the Patty Wagon, a car shaped like a Krabby Patty.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, Rosa is {{recognized}} as one of the best Disney comics creators. Carl Barks and Rosa are among the few artists who have their name written on the covers of Disney magazines when their stories are published. Rosa enjoys including subtle references <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> works of fiction as well as his own previous work. He normally uses about 12 panels per page, instead of the more common eight. He needs to use the extra panels, because his stories usually are too long to be published if he does not minimize them.|$|E

25|$|Yamamoto practiced calligraphy. He and his wife, Reiko, {{had four}} children: {{two sons and}} two daughters. Yamamoto was an avid gambler, enjoying Go, shogi, billiards, bridge, mah jong, poker, and other games that tested his wits and {{sharpened}} his mind. He frequently made jokes about moving to Monaco and starting his own casino. He enjoyed the company of geisha, and his wife Reiko revealed to the Japanese public in 1954 that Yamamoto was closer <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> geisha Kawai Chiyoko than to her, which stirred some controversy. After his death, his funeral procession passed by Kawai's quarters {{on the way to}} the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|In October of that year, Wetz was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer, brought about by excessive smoking. Although strongly impaired, the composer continued with unbroken creative urge, working on the outlines of an oratorio, Love, Life, Eternity after the texts of Goethe, which {{he wanted to be}} a monument <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> poet. The work, however, was left unfinished on his death. A fourth symphony was also left in a fragmentary state, and a third string quartet was also found incomplete amongst his papers. Richard Wetz died on 16 January 1935 in Erfurt, age 59. According to his will the fragments of the Goethe oratorio were to be completed by the composer Werner Trenkner, who Wetz considered his greatest pupil. Trenkner failed at completing the work due to civil disputes, and the sketches have since been lost.|$|E

He was shot {{in the back of the}} head by two slugs and died almost instantly. His funeral, which his recovering wife could not attend, was held the following Monday at his church at 2:30p.m. More than 500 people attended his funeral; more than 60 which were his and his wife's relatives.

500|$|Babb was {{involved}} in the production and marketing of many films and television shows, promoting each according <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> marketing motto: [...] "You gotta tell 'em to sell 'em." [...] His films ranged from sex education-style dramas to [...] "documentaries" [...] on foreign cultures, intended to titillate audiences rather than to educate them, maximizing profits via marketing gimmicks.|$|E
500|$|The {{first such}} {{instance}} {{occurred in the}} seventh-season episode [...] "Radioactive Man," [...] in which Comic Book Guy is logging on <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> newsgroup alt.nerd.obsessive.

500|$|Another {{issue of}} concern for Dodd was Alabama's and other SEC schools' over-recruitment of players. Universities would recruit more players than they had roster space for. During the summer {{practice}} sessions, the teams in question would cut the players well after signing day thus preventing the cut players from finding new colleges to play for. Dodd appealed the SEC administration to punish the [...] "tryout camps" [...] of his fellow SEC members but the SEC did not. Finally, Dodd withdrew Georgia Tech from the SEC in 1964. Tech would remain an independent like Notre Dame and Penn State (at the time) during the final four years of Dodd's coaching tenure. In 1967, Dodd passed the head coach position <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> coordinator, Bud Carson. Dodd simply retained his athletic director position, which he had acquired in 1950. He would not retire from athletic directing until 1976.|$|E
500|$|With [...] "Flicker", one of Porter Robinson's {{favorite}} songs of his debut studio album Worlds (2014), {{he wanted to}} experiment with samples of soul music, which he became a fan of ever since he listened <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> album, Daft Punk's second studio record Discovery (2001). The result was a hip-hop-style instrumental that he felt was [...] "incomplete" [...] with only drums and the phased samples. He didn't initially plan [...] "Flicker" [...] to be a track on Worlds until some time later when he was using a translation website to translate [...] "song titles that would never be seen" [...] incorrectly into Japanese, and then put the Japanese text into a text-to-speech program {{for it to be}} converted into a WAV file for him to [...] "cut it into a rap" [...] which he called a [...] "charming little thing". Finally, he composed the lead melody and chord progression. The song also features the laugh of Remon Yamano from the anime [...] "Ano Natsu de Matteru" [...] at multiple points.

500|$|On March 7, 1999, {{six days}} after {{screening}} a final cut of Eyes Wide Shut for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep {{at the age of}} 70, after suffering a massive heart attack. His funeral was held five days later at his home estate at Childwickbury Manor, with only close friends and family in attendance, totaling approximately 100 people. The media were kept a mile away outside the entrance gate. Alexander Walker, who attended the funeral, describes it as a [...] "family farewell,... almost like an English picnic", with cellists, clarinetists and singers providing song and music from many of his favorite classical compositions. Kaddish, the Jewish prayer of mourning, was recited. A few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background. Among those who gave eulogies were Terry Semel, Jan Harlan, Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. He was buried next <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> tree on the estate.

500|$|Owner Billingsley {{was well}} known for his extravagant gifts {{presented}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> patrons, spending an average of $100,000 a year on them. [...] They included compacts studded with diamonds and rubies, French perfumes, Champagne and liquor, and even automobiles. Many of the gifts were specially made for the Stork Club, with the club's name and logo on them. Some {{of the best known}} examples were the gifts of Sortilège perfume by Le Galion, which became known as the [...] "fragrance of the Stork Club". Billingsley convinced Arthur Godfrey, Morton Downey, and his own assistant, Steve Hannigan, to form an investment group with him to obtain the United States distributorship of the fragrance. The partners expanded into the sale of soap, cosmetics and other sundries under the Stork Club name. [...] They called the business Cignonethe French word for stork; the line was carried by various drug and department stores in the United States. [...] Every female guest of the club received a small vial of perfume and a tube of Stork Club lipstick as souvenirs of her visit. It was also Billingsley's standard practice to send every regular club patron a case of Champagne at Christmas.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} focused on more unusual themes for rock music than the band had written for Hello Master as they instead wrote about {{personal}} interests. For his part, Heppner described the songs as being about [...] "mega geek shit", and recalled some advice {{he had been}} given to simply write about things he liked, which became how most of the songs on the album were written. Heppner wrote [...] "Murphy's Law" [...] as an ode <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>favorite</b> film, RoboCop; he was inspired to write it when he was writing songs in his room and saw his poster for the movie on the wall. His lyrics to [...] "It Baffles the Mind" [...] recount a tournament in the manga/anime series Dragon Ball, while the seminal Lone Wolf and Cub inspired him to write [...] "Sideways Attack". The influential serial drama Twin Peaks served as the basis for a song that he wrote that did not make it into the final track listing; outtakes from the album, of which there were at least three, were set for separate release on 7" [...] singles. Watchorn has noted that this album {{was not the first time}} the band had described their favorite films in songs; although he did not specify which ones, he did note that there were songs from Hello Master that pertained to films as well.|$|E
