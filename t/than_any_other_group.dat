5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> of vertebrates.|$|E

25|$|To {{implement}} these strategies, Rolf led the union’s organizing staff into communities they hadn’t {{worked in}} before, and hired organizers that reflected those areas demographically. A neighborhood-based group meeting structure {{was developed for}} home care workers to share stories, identify common challenges, and activate around the need for collective action. Rolf noted that through these meetings, home care workers “found {{out for the first}} time that they weren’t alone.” The local also worked closely with other groups, such as the disability community, around shared interests in a form of coalition-based social unionism. He raised the new local's credibility by taking a lead role on Proposition 210, a 1996 California State initiative that raised the minimum wage to $5.75 per hour beginning March 1, 1998. The local collected more signatures <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

This meant voluntary education campaigns would be needed. It was also noted that low-income, elderly, disabled, inner city, immigrants, and rural Americans were targeted the most, because these groups mainly watch analog antenna TV more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
25|$|Historically, a {{continuous}} Hispanic {{presence in the}} territory of the United States has existed since the 16th century, earlier <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> after the Amerindians. Spaniards pioneered the present-day United States. The first confirmed European landing on the continent was that of Juan Ponce de León, who landed in 1513 on the shore he christened La Florida. Within three decades of Ponce de León's landing, the Spanish became the first Europeans to reach the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon, and the Great Plains. Spanish ships sailed along the East Coast, penetrating to present-day Bangor, Maine, and up the Pacific Coast as far as Oregon. From 1528 to 1536, four castaways from a Spanish expedition, including a black Moor, journeyed all the way from Florida to the Gulf of California, 267 years before the Lewis and Clark Expedition.|$|E
25|$|Donald Akenson, Professor of Irish Studies in the {{department}} of history at Queen's University has argued that, with very few exceptions, the historians attempting to reconstruct a biography of the man apart from the mere facts of his existence and crucifixion have not followed sound historical practices. He has stated that there is an unhealthy reliance on consensus, for propositions, which should otherwise be based on primary sources, or rigorous interpretation. He also identifies a peculiar downward dating creep, and holds that some of the criteria being used are faulty. He says that the overwhelming majority of biblical scholars are employed in institutions whose roots are in religious beliefs. Because of this, more <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> in present-day academia, biblical historians are under immense pressure to theologize their historical work. It is only through considerable individual heroism, that many biblical historians have managed to maintain the scholarly integrity of their work.|$|E
25|$|A colonial Assembly {{was created}} in October 1683. New York {{was the last of}} the English colonies to have an {{assembly}}. The assembly passed the Province of New York constitution on October 30, {{the first of its kind}} in the colonies. This constitution gave New Yorkers more rights <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> of colonists including the protection from taxation without representation. On November 1, 1683, the government was reorganized, and the state was divided into twelve counties, each of which was subdivided into towns. Ten of those counties still exist (see above), but two (Cornwall and Dukes) were in territory purchased by the Duke of York from the Earl of Stirling, and are no longer within the territory of the State of New York, having been transferred by treaty to Massachusetts. While the number of counties has been increased to 62, the pattern still remains that a town in New York State is a subdivision of a county, similar to New England.|$|E
