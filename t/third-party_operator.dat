2500|$|Many {{audience}} members arrive {{early on the}} day of a taping, and often camp out the night before to attend. Most have already received tickets for that day's show, although some hope to get same-day tickets. Audience members are then given the iconic name tags with a temporary identification number, which is also written on the person's ticket. A Social Security Number (or some national I.D. number for non-U.S. {{audience members}}) is also required to be submitted. Audience members are eventually brought through in groups of twelve for brief interviews with the production staff. Contrary to popular belief, contestant names are not chosen at random; rather, the interviews determine possible selections for the nine contestants per taping from among the pool of approximately 325 audience members. Since 1988, the minimum age for audience members has been 18; prior to 1988, teenagers and children as young as 12 were present in the audience. With few exceptions, anyone at least 18 years old who attends a taping of the show has the potential to become a contestant. Those ineligible include current candidates for political office, employees of CBS Corporation or its affiliates, RTL Group or any firm involved in offering prizes for the show. Contestants who have appeared on a different game show within the previous year or either two other game shows or any version of The Price Is Right itself within the past ten years are also ineligible. The show's staff alerts potential contestantsin person, on the show's website and on the tickets themselvesto dress in [...] "street clothes" [...] and not to wear costumes, such as those used to attract attention on Let's Make a Deal, another show that featured contestants selected from the audience. Those who have attended tapings in June 2008 noted that producers disallowed audience members from wearing fake eyeglasses designed to look similar to those worn by Carey, a restriction that has since been relaxed. Instead, contestants will often wear shirts with hand-decorated slogans. Members of the Armed Forces are often in uniform. Cell phones, tape recorders, backpacks, price lists and portable electronic devices are not allowed in the studio. Prospective contestants obtain tickets by contacting a third-party ticketing operator via the show's website, which is promoted on-air during the broadcast. Prior to 2011, ticketing was directly through CBS, originally via mail, with online ticket access added in 2005. The mail practice ended after CBS began outsourcing ticketing to the <b>third-party</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aircraft {{maintenance}} repair and overhaul (MRO) outsourcing has grown rapidly {{over the past}} few years with many airlines approaching more than 50 to 60 percent of their maintenance contracted to <b>third-party</b> <b>operators.</b> With MRO providers performing maintenance on several different airlines and aircraft types within the same hangar facilities, the standardization of maintenance practices and tasks within the MRO has become more difficult. One area of maintenance, the non-routine process, has become a central point for reducing redundancy of work tasks and maintenance cycle time. Non-routine tasks are additional maintenance needs found during aircraft maintenance checks but not included in the scheduled task requirements. A graduate class in the Aviation Technology Department at Purdue University has designed a futuristic process of the non-routine system that shows promise for reducing cycle time and improving the standardization of work. By comparing the existing non-routine processes to an innovative digital application, the total non-routine required tasks were reduced by more than 50 percent. The new system also moved critical information flow of expected non-routines forward in the process so that they begin prior to aircraft arrival, while maintaining the prevailing technician mindset in their current system and without forcing a new computer process ideology.

40|$|Much of the {{environmental}} and technical data useful to {{the oil and gas}} industry and regulatory agencies is now contained in disparate state and federal databases. Delays in coordinating permit approvals between federal and state agencies translate into increased operational costs and stresses for {{the oil and gas industry}}. Making federal lease stipulation and area restriction data available on state agency Web sites will streamline a potential lessors review of available leases, encourage more active bidding on unleased federal lands, and give <b>third-party</b> <b>operators</b> independent access to data who otherwise may not have access to lease restrictions and other environmental data. As a requirement of the Energy Policy Conservation Act (EPCA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is in the process of inventorying oil and natural gas resources beneath onshore federal lands and the extent and nature of any stipulation, restrictions, or impediments to the development of these resources. The EPCA Phase 1 Inventory resulted in a collection of GIS coverage files organized according to numerous lease stipulation reference codes. Meanwhile, state agencies also collect millions of data elements concerning oil and gas operations. Much of the oil and gas data nationwide is catalogued in the Ground Water Protection Council's (GWPC's) successfully completed Risk Based Data Management System (RBDMS). The GWPC and the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Montana are implementing a pilot project where BLM lease stipulation data and RBDMS data will be displayed in a GIS format on the Internet. This increased access to data will increase bid activity, help expedite permitting, and encourage exploration on federal lands. Linking environmental, lease stipulation and resource inventory assessment data and making a GIS interface for the data available to industry and other agencies via the internet represents an important step in the GWPC strategy for all oil and gas regulatory e-commerce. The next step beyond mere data sharing for facilitating the permitting process is to make it possible for industry to file those permit applications electronically. This process will involve the use of common XML schemas...|$|R
5000|$|Scope of the {{concession}} and regulatory framework of railway activity. Sitarail is technically and financially responsible for (a) {{the operation of}} freight and passenger services, including all equipment maintenance; (b) the maintenance of rail infrastructure and, in part, the renewal and adaptation of infrastructure; and (c) the current management {{of the real estate}} belonging to the railway domain.While rail transport is still qualified in {{the concession}} agreement as a [...] "public service activity," [...] the concession agreement makes a clear distinction between commercial services and services operated under a Public Service Obligation (PSO) scheme.For commercial freight and passenger services, Sitarail has the freedom to set service configuration and tariffs, in accordance with profitability criteria set by Sitarail. The concessionaire is simply required to keep the governments informed of the criteria used for selecting services operated commercially. Tariffs freely set and revised by Sitarail are applicable one month after their communication, for information, to the governments, and fifteen days after they are publicized. Special contract rates may be negotiated with shippers; these rates are not publicized.Services operated under a specific PSO scheme can be run at the request of one or both national governments, or at the request of local governments under special contracts between the authority requesting the service and Sitarail. Contracts have to specify the characteristics of the service and the modalities of the financial compensation paid to Sitarail. Presently, no service is operated under a PSO scheme.The concession agreement reserves the governments’ right to grant access to rail infrastructure to [...] "third party" [...] operators after a seven-year exclusivity period. <b>Third-party</b> <b>operators</b> would then pay an infrastructure access fee, to be negotiated between Sitarail and the operator (or to be decided through arbitration, if the parties cannot agree on the fee).The concessionaire is subject to the tax regime applicable to private enterprises. However, for petroleum products used in locomotives, Sitarail is exempt from the fraction of the petroleum taxes levied by the governments for road user charges.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{formula for}} fractional flight {{is similar to}} its present incarnation: customers purchase pro-rata portions of aircraft that are 100 percent guaranteed to be available. The fractional jet provider then purchases an additional 26 percent of capacity (over and above the fleet purchased by clients) to fulfill that guarantee. These extra planes brings the guarantee to 98 percent statistically. The last 2% of the guarantee represents holidays and other worst-case situations. To close this gap in the guarantee, the company relies on “supplemental lift” from charter -- either from affiliated companies, or trusted <b>third-party</b> charter <b>operators.</b> As more client-owners join, a network effect results in a reduction of expensive empty legs: with {{a critical mass of}} customers, the theory is that it becomes more likely that a particular trip can be accommodated with minimal deadheading.

40|$|The chapter {{moves from}} the belief that {{adopting}} a supply chain approach is crucial to understand how urban freight distribution works and {{what will be the}} impact of the various potential urban transport policies on supply chain performance. According to a recent strand of the literature, the chapter aims at (a) characterizing the urban supply chains; (b) discussing how a urban supply chain can be modelled, which role do actors play and how the coordination issue can be handled; (c) showing how transport decisions, in particular whether to use own-account or <b>third-party</b> transport <b>operators,</b> are dealt within each urban supply chain and by each actor; and analysing how urban supply chains are affected by the many proposed freight transport policies. Although much {{progress has been made in}} the field, both with regard to modelling and empirical analysis, it is concluded that important progress needs to be made with regard to both the ex-ante and the ex-post evaluation of the private and social efficiency of the different urban supply chains and on how they are impacted by local authorities’ transport policies...|$|R
30|$|Efficient {{supply chain}} in {{maritime}} environment obliges that shipping and port connectivity is optimized {{with the remote}} areas. When a large bulk company delivers {{hundreds of thousands of}} tons of finished products annually to the market, this phenomenon requires accurate coordination and communication with the <b>third-party</b> transport <b>operators</b> during the whole chain. Openness, like sharing of best practices in the transport sector, could support the process improvements and the development of efficient logistics models for all partners from the remote areas to the end customers (also ChangKeun et al. 2017). Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) note that it is rather laborious to identify and measure the real trade costs generated from deliveries between countries. The longitudinal case data from an export company somewhat unwraps this complexity of logistics research (Hämäläinen 2011; 2015). Logistics and transportation rates change over time and, furthermore, the manufacturing costs compared to competitors {{have an impact on the}} export performance. Davis and Weinstein (1999) and Krugman (1991), who have developed industrial location models, have argued that the freight movement costs have an essential role when companies are looking for a favourable location. Efficient connections from remote areas to the markets must be taken into account when location decisions are discussed and made.|$|R

We consider a broad class of practical applications where brute force attacks exist which are easier and cheaper to implement than an attack through appropriately configured PIVOTS, making our system, effectively, very trustworthy.
