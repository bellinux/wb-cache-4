5|$|Mantises are generalist predators of arthropods. The {{majority}} of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within <b>their</b> <b>reach.</b> They either camouflage themselves and remain stationary, waiting for prey to approach, or stalk their prey with slow, stealthy movements. Larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals {{of their own}} species, as well as small vertebrates such as lizards, frogs, and small birds.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{reclaiming}} the Drivers' Championship lead at {{the preceding}} Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton {{said that he}} was not relieved because of the closeness of the race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, set his sights on a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of <b>their</b> <b>reach,</b> although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.|$|E
5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within <b>their</b> <b>reach,</b> and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E

25|$|In a two-player game of cribbage, {{a player}} scores one match point for winning a game. Their {{opponent}} will start as dealer {{in the next}} game. If a player skunks <b>their</b> opponent (<b>reaches</b> 121 points before their opponent scores 91 points), that player wins two match points for that game. If a player double skunks <b>their</b> opponent (<b>reaches</b> 121 points before <b>their</b> opponent <b>reaches</b> 61), they score three or four match points for the game, depending on local convention. If a player triple skunks <b>their</b> opponent (<b>reaches</b> 121 points before <b>their</b> opponent <b>reaches</b> 31 points), they automatically win the match. Double and triple skunks {{are not included in}} the official rules of cribbage play and are optional. There are several different formats for scoring match points.|$|R

5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism also triggered religious and political repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Gebhard's conversion had widespread implications {{for the future of}} the Holy Roman Empire's electoral process, established by the Golden Bull of 1356. The council continued for more than a year, and eventually moved to other cities; although several times they seemed close to negotiating a conclusion to the crisis, a successful agreement remained beyond <b>their</b> <b>reach.</b> They also offered Gebhard a sum of money to relinquish his claim, which he refused on the high moral grounds of religious principle.|$|E
5|$|These crowns {{continue}} {{a history of}} monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization. Both tribal and more complex pre-Columbian societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast empires under a central king figure, while others {{did the same with}} a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary chieftain. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current European monarchies that spread <b>their</b> <b>reach</b> across the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the mid 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Due to the FCC's {{limits on}} station {{ownership}} {{at the time}} (which prevented the common ownership of multiple radio stations), local marketing agreements in radio, in which a smaller station would sell its entire airtime to a third-party in time-buy, were widespread between the 1970s and early 1990s. These alliances gave larger broadcasters a way to expand <b>their</b> <b>reach,</b> and smaller broadcasters a means of obtaining a stable stream of revenue. In 1992, the FCC began allowing broadcasting companies to own multiple radio stations in a single market. Following these changes, local marketing agreements largely fell out of favor for radio, as it was now possible for broadcasters to simply buy another station outright rather than lease it – consequentially triggering a wave of mass consolidation in the radio industry. However, broadcasters still used local marketing agreements to help transition acquired stations to their new owners.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{evaluation}} system and treatment program {{for patients with}} cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) {{is one of the}} major concerns of occupational therapists. The purpose of this descriptive study was to investigate the patterns of side reaching and weight shift in sitting position. Twenty college students and faculties without disabilities (10 men, 10 women) were recruited. Each participant reached out to the limit for each side with each upper extremity. Their performances were measured and analyzed with the variables of reaching kinematics. Three different patterns were found in the trajectories of <b>their</b> side <b>reaching.</b> A half of the participants shifted their heads and trunks simultaneously toward the same side of <b>their</b> <b>reaching</b> extremities. Some <b>reached</b> out with <b>their</b> head moving toward the same side. Two participants demonstrated head righting reaction, that is, they moved their head contralateral to <b>their</b> <b>reaching</b> extremities. These results suggested that functional balance reactions in reaching should be evaluated in working with patients with CVA...|$|R
5|$|Emerald and Seahorse chased Anemone inshore, {{where she}} {{anchored}} {{in shallow water}} out of <b>their</b> <b>reach.</b> When they launched their boats to cut-out Anėmone, her crew cut the anchor cable and their ship drifted on to the shore; as the Frenchmen were attempting to escape along the coast, hostile Arabs captured them and stripped them of their clothes, shooting those who resisted. A heavy surf prevented the British boats from landing, so a midshipman from Emerald, the young Francis Fane, swam ashore with a line and empty cask to rescue the commander and seven others who had escaped naked to the beach. Anėmone had a crew of 60 men {{under the command of}} Enseigne de Vaisseau (Ensign) Garibou, and was also carrying General Camin and Citoyen Valette, Aide-de-Camp to General Napoleon Bonaparte, with dispatches from Toulon. Camin and Valette were among those the Arabs killed. Emerald remained stationed off Alexandria {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist's icy {{reception}} at the Gabba did not faze him; he took five catches, stumped Azhar Mahmood off Shane Warne's bowling and scored a rapid 81, mostly in partnership with ODI partner Waugh, in a match that Australia won comfortably by ten wickets. In his second Test match he made an unbeaten 149 to help guide Australia to victory {{in a game that}} looked well beyond <b>their</b> <b>reach.</b> Australia were struggling at 5/126 in pursuit of 369 for victory as he joined his Western Australian teammate, Justin Langer, but the pair put on a record-breaking partnership of 238 to seal an Australian win. Gilchrist continued his strong run throughout his debut Test season, and ended the summer with 485 runs at 69.28 in six matches, three each against Pakistan and India, adding two fifties against the latter.|$|E
5|$|With {{the bulk}} of the French Navy {{confined}} to port, the British were able to strike directly at French colonies, although <b>their</b> <b>reach</b> was limited by the significant resources required in blockading the French coast and so the size and quality of operations varied widely. In 1804, Haiti fell to a nationalist uprising supported by the Royal Navy, and in 1806 British forces secured most of the northern coast of South America from its Dutch owners. In 1807 the Danish West Indies were invaded and in 1808 Spain changed sides and allied with Britain, while Cayenne fell to an improvised force under Captain James Lucas Yeo in January 1809. The damage done to the Martinique economy during this period was severe, as British frigates raided coastal towns and shipping, and merchant vessels were prevented from trading Martinique's produce with France or allied islands. Disaffection grew on the island, especially among the recently emancipated black majority, and during the summer of 1808 the island's governor, Vice-amiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, sent urgent messages back to France requesting supplies and reinforcements. Some of these messages were intercepted by British ships and the low morale on Martinique was {{brought to the attention of}} the Admiralty, who ordered their commander on the West Indian Station, Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, to raise an expeditionary force from the ships and garrisons available to him and invade the island.|$|E

40|$|When infants first {{learn to}} reach at about 4 months, their hand paths are jerky and tortuous, but <b>their</b> <b>reaches</b> become {{smoother}} and straighter {{over the first}} year. Here the authors consider {{the role of the}} underlying limb dynamics, which scale with movement speed, on the development of trajectory control. The authors observed 4 infants weekly and then biweekly from reach onset to 1 year. Improvements in trajectories were not linear, but showed plateaus and regressions in straightness and smoothness. When infants' nonreaching movements were fast, <b>their</b> <b>reaches</b> were also fast, and faster reaches were also less straight. This is consistent with an equilibrium trajectory form of control, where development involves the increasing ability to stabilize the trajectory against self-generated movement perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Subjects {{exposed to}} {{constant}} velocity rotation {{in a large}} fully-enclosed room that rotates initially make large reaching errors in pointing to targets. The paths and endpoints of <b>their</b> <b>reaches</b> are deviated {{in the direction of}} the transient lateral Coriolis forces generated by the forward velocity of <b>their</b> <b>reaches.</b> With additional reaches, subjects soon reach in straighter paths and become more accurate at landing on target even in the absence of visual feedback about their movements. Two factors contribute to this adaptation: first, muscle spindle and golgi tendon organ feedback interpreted in relation to efferent commands provide information about movement trajectory, and second, somatosensory stimulation of the fingertip at the completion of a reach provides information about the location of the fingertip relative to the torso...|$|R
