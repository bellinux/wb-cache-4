500|$|There is {{difference}} of opinion among biographers regarding the year of birth of Tulsidas. Many sources rely on Veni Madhav Das' account in the Mula Gosain Charita, which gives the year of Tulsidas' birth as Vikrami Samvat 1554 (1497 CE). These sources include Shivlal Pathak, popular editions of Ramcharitmanas (Gita Press, Naval Kishore Press and Venkateshvar Press), Edwin Greaves, Hanuman Prasad Poddar, Ramanand Sarasvati, Ayodhyanath Sharma, Ramchandra Shukla, Narayandas, and Rambhadracharya. A second group of biographers led by Sant Tulsi Sahib of Hathras and Sir George Grierson give the year as Vikram 1589 (1532 CE). These biographers include Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, Ramghulam Dwivedi, James Lochtefeld, Swami Sivananda and others. A third small group of authors which includes H. H. Wilson, Garse De <b>Tasse</b> and Krishnadatta Mishra gives the year as Vikram 1600 (1543 CE). [...] The year 1497 appears in many current-day biographies in India and in popular culture. Biographers who disagree with this year argue that it makes {{the life span of}} Tulsidas equal 126 years, which in their opinion is unlikely if not impossible. In contrast, Ramchandra Shukla says that an age of 126 is not impossible for a Mahatma (great soul) like Tulsidas. The Government of India and provincial governments celebrated the 500th birth anniversary of Tulsidas in the year 2011 CE, according to the year of Tulsidas' birth in popular culture.|$|E

2500|$|The Harper {{government}} announced in May 2006 {{that it would}} conduct {{a review of the}} Port Authority, and scrutinize past decisions related to the bridge project. Former deputy minister of justice Roger <b>Tassé</b> was named to oversee the review. Miller described himself as [...] "cautiously optimistic", although he later found it [...] "very regrettable and very worrying" [...] that federal Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon appointed five members of the Port Authority executive before the report was complete. [...] When the <b>Tassé</b> Report was released in November 2006, it defended the Port Authority's decision to sign a bridge contract just before the 2003 election, and described the $35 million payout to DeLuce as [...] "reasonable". [...] Miller dismissed the document as [...] "not worth the paper it is written on", while MP Olivia Chow referred to it as a [...] "total whitewash" [...] and accused the Conservative government of doing a [...] "complete about face" [...] on the issue.|$|E
2500|$|Extending from Net Lake to Vermilion Lake lies a northeast-southwest {{trending}} high strain zone {{known as}} the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. Because geologic mapping has not been done comprehensively throughout this zone, its exact width is unknown. The expression of this deformation zone is clearly identifiable by the intense change in volcanic rocks of the TGB. Volcanic units comprising the northwestern portion of the shear zone have shifted to the northeast while the volcanic rocks comprising its southeastern portion have shifted to the southwest. Along the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami in Strathcona Township lies the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone. This northeast-trending shear zone has not been studied in detail, but casual studies of many islands along the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami have shown that there is severe foliation and minor ferroan carbonate across an area about [...] wide. The Link Lake Deformation Zone, also {{known as the}} Link Lake Shear Zone, is an area of deformation [...] wide and over [...] long in Strathy Township. It extends through Link Lake to east of Highway 11, but it is uncertain whether it extends west of Link Lake because no expression of it has been found in the Sherman Mine area. Therefore, the Link Lake Shear Zone might be a northern extension of the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone further south. Strain intensity of the Link Lake Shear Zone is diverse. Generally, the greatest strain intensity is throughout pyroclastic rocks. Extending from the western boundary of central Chambers Township through <b>Tasse</b> Lake to the east is the <b>Tasse</b> Lake Deformation Zone. This deformation zone is roughly [...] long and at least [...] wide. It is uncertain if this deformation zone extends east of <b>Tasse</b> Lake.|$|E

2500|$|Art Eggleton {{was elected}} Toronto mayor and a {{compromise}} was reached in 1981, when the City of Toronto {{agreed to a}} limited level of commercial STOL passenger service, and the exclusion of jet airplanes. A memorandum of understanding was signed by the THC, the City and Transport Canada, and in 1982, the Canadian Transport Commission issued a licence to City Centre Airways to operate Dash 7 planes between the island, Ottawa and Montreal. In 1983, the City of Toronto, the THC, and the Government of Canada signed a tripartite agreement over operation of the airport. The agreement, in force until 2033, leases the land for the airport {{at a rate of}} $1 per year. The majority of the airport land is owned by the Government of Ontario with two small sections owned by the Government of Canada and a small section owned by Toronto. The agreement made provisions for a restricted list of aircraft allowed to use the airport due to noise levels, prohibitions on jet traffic except for MEDEVAC flights and prohibition against the construction of a fixed link between Toronto Island and the mainland. According to the <b>Tassé</b> report: [...] "The Tripartite Agreement does not directly set a maximum number of flights or passengers at the Island Airport; it does, however, establish noise exposure parameters which are not to be exceeded (NEF 25), thus effectively providing restrictions on the number of flights." [...] The number and type of flights are to stay within the Noise Exposure Forecast (NEF) 25 exposure level to neighbours. The agreement was amended in 1985 to specifically allow the new de Havilland Dash 8, small 37–39 seat planes at the time, which are not considered STOL planes.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1983, the {{operating}} {{agreement between the}} City of Toronto and the THC expired and a new tripartite agreement was signed between the City of Toronto, the THC, and the Government of Canada for operation of the airport. The agreement, in force from August 1, 1983 until 2033, leases the land for the airport {{at a rate of}} $1 per year. The majority of the airport land is owned by the Government of Ontario with two small sections owned by the Government of Canada and a small section owned by the City of Toronto. The agreement made provisions for a restricted list of aircraft allowed to use the airport due to noise levels, prohibitions on jet traffic except for MEDEVAC flights and prohibition against the construction of a fixed link between Toronto Island and the mainland. Executive jets were now banned and had to land at Toronto International or face a fine of $6,500. According to the 2006 <b>Tassé</b> report: [...] "The Tripartite Agreement does not directly set a maximum number of flights or passengers at the Island Airport; it does, however, establish noise exposure parameters which are not to be exceeded (NEF 25), thus effectively providing restrictions on the number of flights."

The agreement was amended in 1985 to specifically allow the new de Havilland Dash 8, (small 37–39 seat planes at the time) which are not considered STOL planes. 1983 was a weak year for the airport, seeing traffic drop for 298,000 takeoffs and landings to 194,000, attributed to the closing of the York Flight Training company in June 1983.|$|E
