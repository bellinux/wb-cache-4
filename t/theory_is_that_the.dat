5|$|Modern human {{settlement}} {{of what is}} now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the last glacial period, either in the Neolithic period around 8000 BC, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter gatherers in the late stone age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced dimpled pottery and iron tools. These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin. An alternative <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} falafel is unknown and controversial. A common <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dish {{originated}} in Egypt, possibly eaten by Copts {{as a replacement}} for meat during Lent. As Alexandria is a port city, it was possible to export the dish and name to other areas in the Middle East. The dish later migrated northwards to the Levant, where chickpeas replaced the fava beans. It has been speculated that its history may go back to Pharaonic Egypt.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1938, the Mingo Oak failed to produce leaves, and on May of that year, West Virginia state {{forester}} D.B. Griffin announced the tree's death. The prevailing <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tree died from the release of poisonous gases and sulfur fumes from a burning spoil tip in nearby Trace Gap. The tree was felled with fanfare on September 23, 1938, with transections {{being sent to the}} Smithsonian Institution and the West Virginia State Museum. Under the terms of the Island Creek Coal Company's lease with the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission, the land's lease around the former tree reverted to the company following the tree's felling.|$|E
5|$|One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sculptures {{represent}} deceased {{individuals with}} bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies and puffed out faces. The {{position of the}} limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression {{of the position of}} corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatep√©quez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E

5|$|Some prey {{animals such as}} zebra {{are marked}} with high-contrast {{patterns}} which possibly help to confuse their predators, such as lions, during a chase. The bold stripes of a herd of running Zebra have been claimed {{make it difficult for}} predators to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, or to identify individual animals, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Since dazzle patterns (such as the Zebra's stripes) make animals harder to catch when moving, but easier to detect when stationary, there is an evolutionary trade-off between dazzle and camouflage. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> zebra's stripes could provide some protection from flies and biting insects.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E

40|$|A common {{objection}} to the Bayesian account of the confirmation of scientific <b>theories</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> language of science regularly changes but Bayesianism can only cope with a fixed language.

500|$|Over the 64 years {{following}} the disappearance of M-24 after the attacks, more than 50 people approached the Royal Australian Navy claiming to have found the submarine. All of these claims {{were found to be}} false. One early theory about <b>the</b> midget's fate <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> damaged or destroyed, along with M-21, in or around Taylors Bay, which would account for reports from Steady Hour and Yarroma of multiple submarines during their three-hour attack against M-21. [...] A second <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> midget attempted to return to the mother submarines but exhausted its battery power before reaching the Port Hacking recovery point and would therefore be outside and to the south of Sydney Heads. <b>The</b> third <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> midget's crew decided to avoid endangering the five larger submarines during the recovery process, and either ran straight out to sea or headed north.|$|R
5|$|The entire Colorado Plateau {{then started}} to uplift from near sea level to several {{thousand}} feet (over a kilometer) in elevation. An alternate <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau {{and that the}} tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete.|$|E
5|$|The straight, {{symmetrical}} stone columns {{found in}} the Polonnaruwa Vatadage are quite similar to those seen in buildings of the Anuradhapura period. The foot of each column is carved {{in the shape of}} a lotus flower. Archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana has suggested that these stone columns had supported a wooden roof. This is widely accepted, and nails and roof tiles found in excavations seem to support this. However, another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vatadage did not have a roof, and the stone columns were used to hang lamps, curtains or Buddhist symbols.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} reasons put forth {{as to why}} Dickinson and the Pennsylvania Council did not act. The Council's {{official}} reasoning {{was that they were}} unsure that the local militiamen would actually protect Congress from their fellow soldiers. Further, the council may have thought that the conflict was not as serious as Congress believed and that the mutiny could be resolved peacefully. The second theory put forth is that Dickinson, having been an officer in the militia, was sympathetic to the soldiers' grievances. The third <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Council refused to allow Pennsylvania, a sovereign state, to be subjugated by the demands of a few members of Congress.|$|E
50|$|El Mallakh {{maintained}} that a nearby pit contained another boat.

2500|$|Another <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CIA and FBI did {{not have}} the ability to capture {{suspects}} in Pakistan (where most people were passionately anti-American), only the ISI had the ability to capture Siddiqui, and while they may have known how to get her or even have her in custody, they were not [...] "ready to hand her over", whatever reward the Americans offered.|$|R
5|$|Structurally, the late-18th century Bastille was not greatly {{changed from}} its 14th-century predecessor. The eight stone towers had {{gradually}} acquired individual names: {{running from the}} north-east side of the external gate, these were La Chapelle, Tr√©sor, Comt√©, Bazini√®re, Bertaudi√®re, Libert√©, Puits and Coin. La Chapelle contained the Bastille's chapel, decorated with a painting of Saint Peter in chains. Tr√©sor took {{its name from the}} reign of Henry IV, when it had contained the royal treasury. The origins of the name of Comt√© tower are unclear; one <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name refers to the County of Paris. Bazini√®re was named after Bertrand de La Bazini√®re, a royal treasurer who was imprisoned there in 1663. Bertaudi√®re was named after a medieval mason who died building the structure in the 14th century. Libert√© tower took its name either from a protest in 1380, when Parisians shouted the phrase outside the castle, or because it was used to house prisoners who had more freedom to walk around the castle than the typical prisoner. Puits tower contained the castle well, while Coin formed the corner of the Rue Saint-Antoine.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persian cavalry left Marathon for an {{unspecified}} reason, {{and that the}} Greeks moved {{to take advantage of}} this by attacking. This theory is based on the absence of any mention of cavalry in Herodotus' account of the battle, and an entry in the Suda dictionary. The entry œáœâœÅŒØœÇ ·º∞œÄœÄŒµ·øñœÇ ("without cavalry") is explained thus: The cavalry left. When Datis surrendered and was ready for retreat, the Ionians climbed the trees and gave the Athenians the signal that the cavalry had left. And when Miltiades realized that, he attacked and thus won. From there comes the above-mentioned quote, which is used when someone breaks ranks before battle. There are many variations of this theory, but perhaps the most prevalent is that the cavalry were completing the time-consuming process of re-embarking on the ships, and were to be sent by sea to attack (undefended) Athens in the rear, whilst the rest of the Persians pinned down the Athenian army at Marathon. This theory therefore utilises Herodotus' suggestion that after Marathon, the Persian army began to re-embark, intending to sail around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. Thus, this re-embarcation would have occurred before the battle (and indeed have triggered the battle).|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crest {{was used for}} intra-species recognition. This means that the crest {{could have been used}} for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal, and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Plasmodium falciparum <b>is</b> very {{sensitive}} to oxidative damage.

50|$|Hollindale's most renowned <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> {{three levels}} of {{ideology}} in a text which pertained to all four modern reading approaches (author-centred, reader-centred, text-centred, world-view-centred).|$|R
5|$|The {{resulting}} castle {{centred on}} a stone tower-keep, measuring 60 feet by 24 feet (18 m by 7 m) internally and 54 feet (16 m) tall, with four round corner-towers. The tower-keep had eight-foot (2.4 m) thick walls made from Lias Oolite ashlar stone and was designed around three floors. The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations. The ground floor of the tower-house included the kitchen and other service areas. The functions {{of the first and}} second floors are uncertain; one <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first floor was another service area, with the hall on the second floor; another approach argues that the first floor formed the hall, and the second floor living accommodation; a minority view proposes that the first floor was an armoury. The third floor was used as living accommodation for the owning family. The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors, but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow.|$|E
5|$|This {{cycle of}} growth and {{dormancy}} strings together volcanoes over millions of years, {{leaving a trail of}} volcanic islands and seamounts across the ocean floor. According to Wilson's theory, the Hawaiian volcanoes should be progressively older and increasingly eroded the further they are from the hotspot, and this is easily observable; the oldest rock in the main Hawaiian islands, that of Kauai, is about 5.5 million years old and deeply eroded, while the rock on Hawaii island is a comparatively young 0.7 million years of age or less, with new lava constantly erupting at Kƒ´lauea, the hotspot's present center. Another consequence of his <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chain's length and orientation serves to record the direction and speed of the Pacific Plate's movement. A major feature of the Hawaiian trail is a sudden 60¬∞ bend at a 40- to 50-million-year-old section of its length, and according to Wilson's theory, this is evidence of a major change in plate direction, one that would have initiated subduction along much of the Pacific Plate's western boundary. This part of the theory has recently been challenged, and the bend might be attributed to the movement of the hotspot itself.|$|E
5|$|Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based {{systematics}} {{have usually}} given the Hexapoda {{the rank of}} superclass, and identified four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura, and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as the Entognatha {{on the basis of}} internalized mouth parts. Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hexapoda are polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was {{not a member of the}} group), with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta. Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, so rather than using ranks like subclass, superorder, and infraorder, it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group). The following represents the best-supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta.|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} {{assumption of}} non-monetary inflation <b>theories</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monetary <b>theory</b> of the ‚Äúnew economics‚Äù and the stabilisation theories followed since 1965 are basically sound.

The implication of these <b>theories</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> failure of the June 1968 tax action to stop the inflationary pressures thus far is somehow due to implementation errors, but does not reflect on the monetary actions taken since 1965. The present paper focuses on the monetary aspects of post- 1965 inflation in the U. S. : Are the non-monetary inflation theories essentially correct in viewing the inflationary pressures in 1968 and 1969 as consequences of implementation errors committed in 1965 or 1966, {{at the time of}} the Vietnam escalation, and compounded by the delay in passing the surtax in 1967; or are they abstracting from the major factor in the current inflation - the extraordinary high rates of growth in the monetary aggregates since 1965, and especially the pronounced rise in the rate of monetary acceleration after the tax action in June 1968.
