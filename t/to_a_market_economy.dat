5|$|New Zealand is a {{developed}} country and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom {{and quality of}} life. Since the 1980s, New Zealand has transformed from an agrarian, regulated economy <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a governor-general, currently Dame Patsy Reddy. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand {{is a member of}} the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.|$|E

25|$|Sberbank is the {{successor}} of Soviet saving banks, whose assets {{belonged to the}} state. During Russia's transition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> in the 1990s, in which these assets were sold, Sberbank provided no guarantee for citizens' deposits. This resulted in a landslide depreciation, which in turn led to severe discontent among the Russian population. Since 1996, partial compensation for investors' losses has been offered - however, {{it must be noted}} that this only applied to state-owned banks such as Sberbank until 2003, offering them an unfair advantage.|$|E

25|$|In Soviet times, {{the economy}} of Ukraine was the second largest in the Soviet Union, being an {{important}} industrial and agricultural component of the country's planned economy. With {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet system, the country moved from a planned economy <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> The transition process was difficult {{for the majority of the}} population which plunged into poverty. Ukraine's economy contracted severely following the years after the Soviet dissolution. Day-to-day life for the average person living in Ukraine was a struggle. A significant number of citizens in rural Ukraine survived by growing their own food, often working two or more jobs and buying the basic necessities through the barter economy.|$|E
25|$|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels {{interpreted}} {{issues concerning}} nationality on a social evolutionary and class reductionist basis. Marx and Engels {{claim that the}} creation of the modern nation state {{is the result of the}} replacement of feudalism with the capitalist mode of production. With the replacement of feudalism with capitalism, capitalists sought to unify and centralize populations' culture and language within states in order to create conditions conducive <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> in terms of having a common language to coordinate the economy; to contain a large enough population in the state to insure an internal division of labour; and to contain a large enough territory for a state to maintain a viable economy.|$|E
25|$|The forint (sign: Ft; code: HUF) is the {{currency}} of Hungary. It was formerly divided into 100 fillér, but fillér coins {{are no longer in}} circulation. The introduction of the forint on 1 August 1946 was a crucial step in the post-World War II stabilization of the Hungarian economy, and {{the currency}} remained relatively stable until the 1980s. Transition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> in the early 1990s adversely affected the value of the forint; inflation peaked at 35% in 1991. Since 2001, inflation is in single digits, and the forint has been declared fully convertible. As a member of the European Union, the long -term aim of the Hungarian government may be to replace the forint with the euro, but that {{does not appear to be}} likely until some time during the 2020s.|$|E

25|$|The {{monopoly}} of the VAAP was abolished in 1989. Also during Perestroika, a work group was formed {{with the task}} to adapt the Soviet copyright law <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> These efforts culminated in the passing of a profoundly revised copyright law on March 31, 1991. This new law was a radical break with the previous Socialist practice. Author's rights were exclusive again, the copyright term was increased to 50 years p.m.a., neighbouring rights were introduced {{for the first time}} in Soviet legislation, and the free uses were reduced considerably and defined much narrower. Compulsory licenses were abolished altogether. The initial copyright owner in a work in all cases was the natural person who created the work; the copyright of legal entities no longer existed. The provisions of the 1991 Fundamentals, which were scheduled to enter in force on January 1, 1992, never became effective in the Soviet Union, as the USSR was dissolved before that date.|$|E
25|$|Until 2005, {{the value}} of the renminbi was pegged to the US dollar. As China pursued its {{transition}} from central planning <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy,</b> and increased its participation in foreign trade, the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry. It has previously been claimed that the renminbi's official exchange rate was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity. More recently, however, appreciation actions by the Chinese government, as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the American Federal Reserve and other major central banks, have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012. Since 2006, the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed base rate determined with reference to a basket of world currencies. The Chinese government has announced that it will gradually increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the world's 8th most traded currency in 2013, and 5th by 2015.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev {{continued}} to work on drafting a new treaty of union which would have created a truly voluntary federation in an increasingly democratised Soviet Union. The new treaty was strongly supported by the Central Asian republics, who needed the economic power and markets of the Soviet Union to prosper. However, the more radical reformists, such as Russian SFSR President Boris Yeltsin, were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> was required and were {{more than happy to}} contemplate the disintegration of the Soviet Union if that was required to achieve their aims. Nevertheless, a referendum {{on the future of the}} Soviet Union was held in March (with a referendum in Russia on the creation of a presidency), which returned an average of 76.4% in the nine republics where it was taken, with a turnout of 80% of the adult population. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova did not participate. Following this, an April meeting at Novo-Ogarevo between Gorbachev and the heads of the nine republics issued a statement on speeding up the creation of a new Union treaty.|$|E

25|$|Most {{countries}} are experiencing {{significant increases in}} wealth and standard of living. However, there are unfortunate exceptions to this rule. Noticeably some of the former Soviet Union countries has experienced major disruption of industry in the transition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> Many African nations have recently experienced reduced GNPs due to wars and the AIDS epidemic, including Angola, Congo, Sierra Leone and others. Arab oil producers rely very heavily on oil exports to support their GDPs so any reduction in oil's market price can lead to rapid decreases in GNP. Countries which rely on only a few exports for much of their income are very vulnerable {{to changes in the}} market value of those commodities and are often derogatively called banana republics. Many developing countries do rely on exports of a few primary goods for a large amount of their income (coffee and timber for example), and this can create havoc when the value of these commodities drops, leaving these countries with no way to pay off their debts.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment in Poland {{appeared}} in the 19th century, {{during the process of}} industrialization, and was particularly severe during the Great Depression. During communist rule officially Poland had close to full employment although hidden unemployment existed. After Poland's transition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> the unemployment rate sharply increased, peaking at above 16% in 1993, then dropped afterwards, but remained well above pre-1993 levels. Another period of high unemployment occurred in the early 2000s when the rate reached 20%. As Poland entered European Union (EU) in 2004 and its job market, mass emigration due to unemployment took place lowering the figure. Since then the rate had fallen until the onset of the 2008 Great Recession. Recent years have seen an increase in the unemployment rate from below 8% to above 10% (Eurostat) or from below 10% to 13% (GUS). The rate began dropping again in late 2013. Polish government (GUS) reported 9.6% registered unemployment in November 2015, while European Union's Eurostat gave 7.2%. According to Eurostat data, since 2008, unemployment in Poland has been constantly below the EU average. Significant regional differences in the unemployment rate exist across Poland.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Ministry of Construction {{issued a}} policy {{paper on the}} commercialization of public utilities. Subsequently, in October 2003, the central {{government}} decided that state-owned enterprises had {{to be separated from}} Ministries and/or provincial governments and had to be commercialized. Competitive bidding for contracts, private sector participation and commercial financing are important element in the transition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> In the 1990s, the first BOT contracts were signed for wastewater treatment plants. More than 200 wastewater treatment plants were built with some form of private sector participation in their financing and/or management, usually using the BOT formula. Early BOTs saw governments implementing the process without the benefit of financial, legal, and technical advisers, finding to their chagrin that the process becomes more complex in the absence of expert knowledge. Learning from the experience of past BOTs in the sector, local governments sought expert advice on bidding and public tender. In about 2000 for the first time, a BOT water project (Chengdu No. 6 Water Supply Plant) was awarded on the basis of transparent international competitive bidding, with support from the ADB. In 2004, a landmark international competitive bid for the entire water supply and sanitation system of Shenzhen was won by a joint venture including the French firm Veolia.|$|E

500|$|While {{supporting}} the transition {{away from a}} planned economy, Ryzhkov understood that privatisation would weaken the government's power. As changes occurred, skepticism over perestroika and privatisation {{was not limited to}} high-level government officialdom. Several middle and low-ranking officials, who owed their rise in the hierarchy to government-owned enterprises, wanted to retain the existing system. Gorbachev also blamed Ryzhkov and the Council of Ministers for the economic difficulties which arose during perestroika, a move which fostered resentment for both Gorbachev and perestroika. Nevertheless, in 1986, Ryzhkov stated that he, {{along with the rest of}} the Soviet leadership, were already discussing the possibility of creating a market economy in the Soviet Union. Ryzhkov supported the creation of a [...] "regulated market economy" [...] where the government sector occupied the [...] "commanding heights" [...] of the economy as well as the creation of semi private-public companies. His second cabinet, several high-standing members of the KGB and the military establishment all supported Ryzhkov's opposition to the 500 Days Programme, which espoused a quick transition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> Matters did not improve when at the second session of the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union, Ryzhkov proposed postponing the transition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> until 1992, further suggesting that in the period between 19901992, recentralisation of government activities would ensure a period of stabilisation.|$|E
500|$|According to Swedish {{economist}} Anders Åslund, Ryzhkov differed {{little from}} Gorbachev {{when it came}} to price reform. There were, however, subtle differences between the two men's views, with Ryzhkov supporting an administratively controlled price increase while Gorbachev, as a radical economist who supported market reform, opposed such measures. As Hough noted, Ryzhkov supported [...] "the need for greater fiscal responsibility", while Gorbachev advocated the need for more rational prices which, according to Hough, would have brought inflation under control. Ryzhkov proposed price reform measures to Gorbachev several times but was turned down on each occasions, even though Gorbachev had argued strongly on the need for price reform in his speeches. Gorbachev strengthened his public image by accusing the Soviet leadership's conservative faction together with Ryzhkov, of delaying implementation of the necessary price reform. Ryzhkov had the backing of several high-standing institutions, such as the Ministry of Finance and the State Committee on Prices, chaired by the future Soviet Premier Valentin Pavlov. In contrast to Gorbachev, Ryzhkov actually had, according to Hough, a plan for a transition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> Gorbachev on the other hand was never able to turn words into deeds.|$|E
