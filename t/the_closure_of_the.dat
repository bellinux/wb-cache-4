40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the χ-function (<b>the</b> Holevo capacity <b>of</b> constrained channel) and <b>the</b> convex <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output entropy for arbitrary infinite dimensional channel. It is shown that <b>the</b> χ-function <b>of</b> an arbitrary channel is a concave lower semicontinuous function on the whole state space, having continuous restriction to any set <b>of</b> continuity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output entropy. The explicit representation for <b>the</b> convex <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output entropy is obtained and its properties are explored. It is shown that <b>the</b> convex <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output entropy coincides with <b>the</b> convex hull <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output entropy on <b>the</b> convex set <b>of</b> states with finite output entropy. Similarly to <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> χ-function, it is proved that <b>the</b> convex <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output entropy has continuous restriction to any set of continuity of output entropy. Some applications of these results to <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> entanglement are discussed. <b>The</b> obtained properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convex <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output entropy {{make it possible to}} generalize to the infinite dimensional case the convex duality approach to the additivity problem.

50|$|As a corollary, {{it follows}} that any homeomorphism between simple closed {{polygonal}} curves extends to a homeomorphism between their interiors. For each polygon there is a homeomorphism of a given triangle onto <b>the</b> <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> their interior. <b>The</b> three homeomorphisms yield a single homeomorphism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle. By the Alexander trick this homeomorphism can be extended to a homeomorphism <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle.
