5|$|After the {{destruction}} wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Pompey restored {{the independence of}} Azotus, {{as he did with}} all Hellenising coastal cities (Antiquities Book 14, 4:4). A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came under the rule of King Herod, who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1). By the time of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70), <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to feel compelled to place a garrison in the city.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} from necessary being asserts that all beings are contingent, {{meaning that it}} is possible for them not to exist.

25|$|Because of the {{presence}} of hot springs, it is thought that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> thermal bath complex already in the Hellenistic period, but probably at a smaller scale than the later Roman site. No architectural material was found in Allianoi belonging to this period apart from a few archaeological and numismatic clues.|$|E

He posits that certain books of the Bible such as Kohelet and Isaiah were written or redacted during this period.|$|E

25|$|The {{high level}} of {{similarities}} leads Crossan to believe that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> common source. Similar to the reasoning behind the two-document hypothesis {{for the existence of}} a Q source, the percentage of common material found in Thomas and Q would suggest an earlier source shared by the authors of both documents. However, unlike Q, the Common Sayings Source is presumed to be oral, {{due to a lack of}} common order or sequence. This is not to say that a written document is an impossibility. It is clear in the Synoptic Gospels that it was common for authors to edit works for their own needs, including the slight change in the order or sequence.|$|E
25|$|An {{abundance}} of clinical and epidemiological evidence supports that light skin pigmentation developed {{due to the}} importance of maintaining vitamin D3 production in the skin. Dark skin pigmentation was the original condition for the genus Homo and has been maintained for populations in areas of high UV radiation through human evolutionary history. As a consequence, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> strong selective pressure for the evolution of light skin in areas of low UV radiation. The evidence that dark skin evolved as a protection against the effect of UV radiation is overwhelming, and research shows that eumelanin protects against both folate depletion and direct damage to DNA. This accounts for the development of dark skin pigmentation of people living near the equator but does not account for the increasingly lighter-skinned people living outside the tropics.|$|E
25|$|A {{metropolitan}} {{bishop of}} London attended the Council of Arles in 314, {{which indicates that}} <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Christian community in Londinium by this date, {{and it has been}} suggested that a large aisled building excavated in 1993 near Tower Hill can be compared with the 4th-century Cathedral of St Tecla in Milan. However, there is no archaeological evidence to suggest that any of the mediaeval churches in the City of London had a Roman foundation. A grant from William I in 1067 to Westminster Abbey, which refers to the stone church of St Magnus near the bridge ("lapidee eccle sci magni prope pontem"), is generally accepted to be a 12th-century forgery, and it is possible that a charter of confirmation in 1108–16 might also be a later fabrication. Nonetheless, these manuscripts may preserve valid evidence of a date of foundation in the 11th century.|$|E

[...] Langton opined that Shiloh was [...] "a good book, not a great book" [...] and that {{there must have been}} few worthy children's books that year. The Sacramento Bees Judy Green disagreed, believing that Shiloh was [...] "worthy of its award, which labels it the best fiction for children written last year". Green lauded Naylor for her [...] "excellent portrayal of Marty's introspection and superb storytelling in the area's vernacular".|$|E
500|$|While {{the press}} {{releases}} had a substantial impact within Guatemala, the CIA {{was unable to}} staunch the continued criticism of the US role in the coup, which came from virtually all countries except for West Germany and the US itself. Very few news agencies chose to run the press releases from the Comite, even though {{a number of them}} were put out. Information was sent to press agencies worldwide describing infiltration by the PGT and links among Communists elsewhere; nonetheless, their impact remained minimal. The lack of attention frustrated the PBHistory agents {{to the point where they}} planned to stage a false flag attack on their own headquarters, which would later be described as the work of Guatemala's remaining communists. However, the CIA decided that such an attack would need the cooperation of too many [...] "indigenous" [...] people, and the plan was scrapped as being too risky. Operation Kugown also released a large quantity of communist propaganda material that had entered Guatemala from countries within the Soviet sphere of influence; these convinced American journalists such as Donald Grant that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> connection between Árbenz and the Soviet government. Ultimately, these operations were unsuccessful in convincing Latin America that the 1954 coup was justified.|$|E

2500|$|Hesiod {{knew from}} the {{traditional}} poetry, such as the Iliad, and the heirloom bronze artifacts that abounded in Greek society, that before the use of iron to make tools and weapons, bronze had been the preferred material and iron was not smelted at all. He did not continue the manufacturing metaphor, but mixed his metaphors, switching over to {{the market value of}} each metal. Iron was cheaper than bronze, so <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> golden and a silver age. He portrays a sequence of metallic ages, but it is a degradation rather than a progression. Each age has less of a moral value than the preceding. Of his own age he says: [...] "And I wish that I were not any part of the fifth generation of men, but had died before it came, or had been born afterward." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Volcano island, the {{destruction}} was complete. It seems {{that when the}} black, fan-shaped cloud spread, it created a blast downward that forced hot steam and gases down {{the slopes of the}} crater, accompanied by a shower of hot mud and sand. Many trees had the bark shredded and cut away from the surface by the hot sand and mud blast that accompanied the explosion and contributed so much to the loss of life and destruction of property. The fact that practically all the vegetation was bent downward, away from the crater, proved that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> very strong blast down the outside slopes of the cone.
