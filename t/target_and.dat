40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{tracking}} facilitation effect during categorical distinction between <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors in the Multiple Identity Tracking (MIT) task. We asked observers to track 4 targets {{in a total}} of 8 moving objects, and manipulated categorical distinctions of <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors across four experiments, with different combinations of inter-category and intra-category differences. Results show that tracking performance was significantly better when the <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors were inter-category different, compared to when the <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors were identical or intra-category distinctive. As the inter-category distinction between <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors narrowed, tracking performance improved, but the inter-category facilitation effect decreased. These results may indicate a category-based grouping effect: the observers organized the targets within the same semantic category into one group <b>and</b> made the <b>targets</b> more easily <b>and</b> accurately rediscovered when lost during tracking. Furthermore, the tracking facilitation of categorical distinction diminished when all the objects were inverted. This proved that besides their visual distinctiveness, objects’ semantic category information also played an important role during tracking...|$|R

Autonomous manipulation in unknown environments requires <b>target</b> identification <b>and</b> tracking from initial discovery through grasp and stow sequences.

This thesis introduces the Autonomous Vision Application for <b>Target</b> Acquisition <b>and</b> Ranging (AVATAR), a software system capable of recognizing appropriate <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> determining their locations for manipulator retrieval tasks. AVATAR utilizes an RGB color filter to segment possible sampling or tracking targets, applies geometric-based matching constraints, and performs stereo triangulation to determine absolute 3 -D target position. Neutral buoyancy and 1 -G tests verify AVATAR capabilities over a diverse matrix of <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> visual environments {{as well as}} camera and manipulator configurations. AVATAR repeatably <b>and</b> reliably recognizes <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> provides real-time position data sufficiently accurate for autonomous sampling...|$|R
