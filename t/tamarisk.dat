5|$|In {{addition}} to receiving the Victoria Cross, Stuart {{was promoted to}} lieutenant commander and given his own command, HMS <b>Tamarisk.</b> <b>Tamarisk</b> was a small sloop built in 1916 that was capable of being disguised as a merchant vessel and used as a Q-ship, designated Q11.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{report found}} that four out of Eastern England's ten {{cheapest}} streets in which to buy property are in Jaywick, with property on <b>Tamarisk</b> Way selling {{for an average of}} £44,050. A 2013 report in The Guardian showed that bungalows were being sold on the Brooklands estate for around £20,000.|$|E
5|$|It prefers basins {{and desert}} areas vegetated with Chinese <b>tamarisk</b> (Tamarix chinensis), brush, or poplar (Populus), along the {{peripheries}} of rivers {{that surround the}} mountains in the Taklamakan Desert. This distribution of the Yarkand hare is ring shaped. It also uses reed vegetation along rivers for shelter, and tends to avoid agricultural fields. About 200,000 individuals are estimated to inhabit the Tarim Basin.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{territory}} of Segestan thermal baths there are <b>tamarisks</b> and reeds ...|$|R
60|$|Night warm; wind towards morning. Mosquitoes in <b>tamarisks</b> of Wady. Minimum thermometer, 52 degrees.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tamarisk's</b> {{entrance}} is located approximately 800 ft {{south of the}} intersection of Harrison Avenue and Lake Lansing Road.|$|R
5|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} grow in {{riparian}} zones along the park's washes. Willows and cottonwoods are the larger plants, joined by rushes and sedges. Here the invasive Eurasian <b>tamarisk,</b> {{also known as}} saltcedar, threatens native plants by crowding, using most of the available water, and increasing soil salinity by exuding salt through its leaves.|$|E
5|$|Russian olive and <b>tamarisk</b> or salt cedar trees now {{dominate}} the Jordan River floodplain where willow trees and cottonwood trees would {{once have been}} found. Plant species such as foxtail barley, saltgrass, rabbitbrush, cattails and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river. Exotic pasture grasses such as orchard grass, bluegrass, redtop bentgrass, quackgrass, wheatgrass and fescue have become the common species of grass. The vulnerable flower, Ute's Ladies'-tresses, {{can also be found}} along the river.|$|E
5|$|It mostly breeds in acacia and <b>tamarisk</b> scrub {{and tall}} grass, {{invariably}} near rivers or other wetlands. The construction {{and expansion of}} irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India. It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, it moves away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.|$|E
50|$|The native flora of the Camargue {{have adapted}} to the saline conditions. Sea {{lavender}} and glasswort flourish, along with <b>tamarisks</b> and reeds.|$|R
6000|$|... "And this is India!" [...] said Pagett for {{the twentieth}} time staring long and intently at the grey {{feathering}} of the <b>tamarisks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to the Jewish National Fund, {{the name}} means [...] "House of the Tamarisk" [...] and {{refers to the}} <b>tamarisks</b> planted by the patriarch Abraham at Beersheba.|$|R
5|$|Invasive plants include {{fountain}} grass, <b>tamarisk,</b> Malta starthistle, {{and many}} others, but {{by far the}} most severe threat to the native ecosystem is buffelgrass. This drought-tolerant plant, native to parts of Africa and Asia, was imported to the United States in the 1930s and planted near Tucson and elsewhere to create cattle forage and to control erosion. First detected in the park in 1989, it has dispersed widely in both districts. Competing with other plants for sustenance, buffelgrass fills the empty spaces normally found between native desert plants and creates a significant fire hazard. The noxious weed, considered impossible to completely eliminate, is managed in some areas of the park and in Tucson residential zones by hand-pulling and, during periods of wet weather, application of glyphosate-based herbicides.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado River and {{its tributaries}} often nourish {{extensive}} corridors of riparian growth as they traverse the arid desert regions of the watershed. Although riparian zones represent a relatively small proportion of the basin and {{have been affected by}} engineering projects and river diversion in many places, they have the greatest biodiversity of any habitat in the basin. The most prominent riparian zones along the river occur along the lower Colorado below Davis Dam, especially in the Colorado River Delta, where riparian areas support 358 species of birds despite the reduction in freshwater flow and invasive plants such as <b>tamarisk</b> (salt cedar). Reduction of the delta's size has also threatened animals such as jaguars and the vaquita porpoise, which is endemic to the gulf. Human development of the Colorado River has also helped to create new riparian zones by smoothing the river's seasonal flow, notably through the Grand Canyon.|$|E
5|$|The saxaul sparrow {{is found}} in remote parts of Central Asia, where its {{distribution}} is believed to fall into six disjunct areas, although this is uncertain due to the scarcity of records. It {{is found in}} deserts, especially around rivers and oases. It is usually found around shrubs such as saxaul (Haloxylon), poplar (Populus), or <b>tamarisk</b> (Tamarix). Sometimes it occurs around settlements and grain fields, especially during the winter. It is not believed to be threatened, since it is reported as locally common across a wide range, and hence it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. However, {{it seems to have}} lost large parts of its range to the intensification of agriculture and desertification caused by overgrazing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamarisks</b> are {{deciduous}} flowering shrubs which grow in thickets. They {{are rarely}} {{seen on the}} English mainland, but flourish in the warmer climate of the Isles of Scilly.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tamarisks</b> are {{characterized}} by slender branches and grey-green foliage. The bark of young branches is smooth and reddish brown. As the plants age, the bark becomes bluish-purple, ridged and furrowed.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{subgroup}} {{contains the}} deciduous <b>tamarisks,</b> which are small, shrubby trees, {{commonly known as}} [...] "saltcedars". These include Tamarix pentandra, Tamarix tetranda, Tamarix gallica, Tamarix chinensis, Tamarix ramosissima, and Tamarix parvifolia.|$|R
5|$|A {{few months}} after {{assuming}} command, on 15 October 1917, Stuart was on hand to rescue the United States Navy destroyer USS Cassin after she was torpedoed by U-61 in heavy weather. Along with one crewmember killed and nine wounded, the Cassin had lost her entire stern including the rudder and {{was in danger of}} sinking. The dead crew member was Osmond Ingram, who had died throwing burning munitions overboard and was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Twenty miles from the Irish coast and in total darkness, the <b>Tamarisk</b> not only found the crippled ship but was able to come alongside in high seas and a strong gale and pass across a tow line. Twice during the night the tow broke and twice it was reconnected as the battle to save the ship continued. The next morning several trawlers came to the aid of the Q-ship and together they enabled the Cassin to make port, saving the ship and her crew. Ten years after the Cassin's rescue the US Navy awarded Stuart the Navy Cross in recognition of his part in the operation; it was a rare presentation to a sailor of a foreign navy and the only occasion in which the recipient also possessed the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that <b>Tamarisk</b> wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{emblem of}} the municipality of Beersheba depicts an eshel (<b>tamarisk</b> tree), the tree planted by Abraham according to Genesis, and the observation tower connected to the municipality building.|$|E
50|$|The gueltas near Iherir are {{flanked by}} Cape bulrush (Typha capensis), with oleanders (Nerium oleander) and French <b>Tamarisks</b> (Tamarix gallica) {{abundant}} {{along the river}} bed. Notable animals include jungle cats (Felis chaus) and sand cats (Felis margarita).|$|R
50|$|This active {{passerine}} bird {{is typically}} found in shrub or tall grass {{in a variety}} of habitats with thick undergrowth, <b>tamarisks</b> or similar cover. Graceful prinia builds its nest in a bush or grass and lays 3-5 eggs.|$|R
50|$|In the Mediterranean region, Cynomorium is a {{parasite}} of salt-tolerant {{plants in the}} Cistaceae (cistus family) or Amaranthaceae (amaranth family); elsewhere it parasitizes Amaranthaceae, Tamaricaceae (<b>tamarisks)</b> and, in China, Nitrariaceae, especially Nitraria sibirica. Other authorities suggest the host plants are saltbushes (Atriplex species, Amaranthaceae).|$|R
25|$|Natural {{vegetation}} commonly seen along {{water courses}} includes seabuckthorn (Hippophae spp.), wild roses of pink or yellow varieties, <b>tamarisk</b> (Myricaria spp.), caraway, stinging nettles, mint, Physochlaina praealta, and various grasses.|$|E
25|$|A {{much later}} myth relates how Set and 72 conspirators killed Osiris, {{putting him in}} a coffin, and {{throwing}} it into the Nile, the coffin becoming embedded {{in the base of}} a <b>tamarisk</b> tree.|$|E
25|$|The Pines Flora and Fauna Reserve is a 108 hectare reserve which {{contains}} a significant remnant of bushland from the Mornington Peninsula. Access is via walking tracks on <b>Tamarisk</b> Drive, Excelsior Drive and Warrawee Circuit.|$|E
25|$|Recent taxonomic {{analysis}} of the relationships within the Caryophyllales indicate that the Droseraceae, Triphyophyllum, Nepenthaceae and Drosophyllum, while closely related, are embedded within a larger clade that includes non-carnivorous {{groups such as the}} <b>tamarisks,</b> Ancistrocladaceae, Polygonaceae and Plumbaginaceae. Interestingly, the <b>tamarisks</b> possess specialised salt-excreting glands on their leaves, as do several of the Plumbaginaceae (such as the sea lavender, Limonium), which may have been co-opted for the excretion of other chemicals, such as proteases and mucilage. Some of the Plumbaginaceae (e.g. Ceratostigma) also have stalked, vascularised glands that secrete mucilage on their calyces and aid in seed dispersal and possibly in protecting the flowers from crawling parasitic insects. The balsams (such as Impatiens), which are closely related to the Sarraceniaceae and Roridula, similarly possess stalked glands.|$|R
50|$|The white-throated bush chat breeds in {{the alpine}} or sub-alpine meadows and scrub in the {{mountains}} of Mongolia and adjacent parts of Russia. It winters in the Terai of Nepal and northern India in wet and dry grasslands, reeds and <b>tamarisks</b> along riverbeds, and also in sugarcane fields.|$|R
60|$|The country folk were habited in shirts, drawers {{derived from}} the Moors, and tasseled caps of blue stuff, big enough for carpet-bags. The vine still covered every {{possible}} slope of black soil, and the aloes, crowned with flowers, seemed to lord it over the <b>tamarisks,</b> the hemlocks, and the nightshades.|$|R
25|$|Seams between planks {{were filled}} with reed bundles, reeds also covered the floor of each Abydos boat. Without {{internal}} framing, some of these boats became twisted, as was unavoidable without an internal skeleton for support when out of the water. The wood of the Abydos boats was local Tamarix - <b>tamarisk,</b> salt cedar - not cedar from Lebanon which was used for Khufu’s Solar Barque and favored for shipbuilding in Egypt in later dynasties.|$|E
25|$|The {{courtyard}} was adorned {{by a long}} rectangular flower bed, with fifty-five sycamore {{and eight}} <b>tamarisk</b> trees planted in deep pits filled with soil. This {{is one of the}} very few archaeologically documented temple-gardens of ancient Egypt that are known enough about to reconstruct its appearance. The maintenance of such a garden more than 1km from the Nile into the arid desert must have required the constant work of many gardeners and an elaborate irrigation system.|$|E
25|$|The loss of {{freshwater}} flows to the delta over {{the twentieth century}} has reduced delta wetlands to about 5 percent of their original extent, and nonnative species have compromised the ecological health of much of what remains. Stress on ecosystems has allowed invasive plants to out-compete native species along Colorado River riparian areas. Native forests of cottonwood and willow have yielded to sand and mudflats dominated by the nonnative <b>tamarisk</b> (also known as salt cedar), arrowweed, and iodinebush, a transformation that has decreased the habitat value of the riparian forest (Briggs and Cornelius, 1997).|$|E
50|$|The sulphur springs {{themselves}} {{have been known}} since Etruscan times, and named Acquae Stygianae by the Romans. The hotel parkland extends across 20 hectares, and contain the ruins of Roman thermal baths, as well as bamboo, hazel trees, maples, oaks, Roman pines, <b>tamarisks,</b> and fauna including falcons, herons, owls, badgers, ferrets, foxes, porcupines, and weasels.|$|R
50|$|The race in {{the arid}} northwestern India and Pakistan, dilutum, has pale yellow upperparts, a long crest and whiter underparts than the {{nominate}} race of the Gangetic plains. The upperparts have less spots. They prefer to breed in old gnarled <b>tamarisks,</b> Acacia and Dalbergia trunks. The nominate populations is found across India in the low elevations up to about 1000 m.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} along streams and valleys in deserts, {{particularly}} in damp or saline soil. It grows alongside common plants of this habitat type, such as arrowweed (Pluchea sericea) and <b>tamarisks.</b> It {{can be found}} on playas and other areas of alkaline substrates. This and other mesquite species are dominant plants in the Mesquite Bosque-mesquite woodlands, a common habitat type in the desert southwest region.|$|R
