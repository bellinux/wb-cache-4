5000|$|Intercity-Express {{trainset}} 51 was travelling as ICE 884 [...] "Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen" [...] on the Munich to Hamburg route; {{the train}} was scheduled to stop at Augsburg, Nürnberg, Würzburg, Fulda, Kassel, Göttingen, and Hanover before reaching Hamburg. After stopping in Hanover at 10:30, the train continued its journey northwards. About 130 km and forty minutes away from Hamburg and 6 km south of central Eschede, near Celle, the steel <b>tyre</b> on <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> on the third axle of the first car broke, peeled away from the wheel, and punctured {{the floor of the}} car, where it remained embedded.|$|R

50|$|The Paris-Brest, a French dessert made of choux pastry and a praline {{flavoured}} cream, with {{a circular}} shape representative of <b>a</b> <b>tyre</b> or <b>wheel,</b> was reportedly created in 1891 {{to commemorate the}} race. It became popular with participants, partly because of its energy-giving high caloric value, and is now found in pâtisseries all over France.|$|R
25|$|Construction of {{the first}} {{prototype}} was completed in 1968. A first flight on 27 June 1967 ended prematurely due to oscillations caused by control problems; one set of main wheels contacted the ground hard bursting <b>a</b> <b>tyre</b> and bending <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> hub. The cause of the oscillations {{proved to be a}} harmonic amplification of vibrations in the cockpit floor feeding back into the control column when a roll demand was input into the cyclic stick. It was widely but erroneously reported in the Western press that the aircraft had been destroyed.|$|R
2500|$|... 28 January 1972 – A British Caledonian Vickers VC10-1109 (registration: G-ARTA) with no {{passengers}} aboard sustained severe {{structural damage}} {{as a result}} of a hard landing at Gatwick at the end of a short ferry flight from Heathrow, where the aircraft had been diverted due to fog at Gatwick. After touching down on runway 08 and applying spoilers and reverse thrust, the aircraft became airborne again, bounced twice and landed heavily. This resulted in <b>a</b> burst front <b>wheel</b> <b>tyre,</b> <b>a</b> separated <b>wheel</b> and <b>a</b> crumpled fuselage (immediately in front of and behind the wings). A survey of the aircraft's damage revealed that its airframe was bent out of shape, requiring extensive repairs to be restored to airworthiness. Since the repairs were not cost-effective, the airline's management decided to cannibalise the aircraft for spare parts before scrapping it at Gatwick in 1975.|$|R
5000|$|The {{choice of}} front-wheel drive is {{unusual for a}} sports car, but {{according}} to Lotus sales literature, [...] "for a given vehicle weight, power and <b>tyre</b> size, <b>a</b> front <b>wheel</b> drive car was always faster over a given section of road. There were definite advantages in traction and controllability, and drawbacks such as torque steer, bump steer and steering kickback were not insurmountable." [...] This was the only front-wheel-drive vehicle made by Lotus. Every model made since the M100 Elan, such as the Lotus Elise, has been rear-wheel drive.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} a {{finite element model}} used to investigate the quasi-static behaviour of <b>a</b> stationary automobile <b>tyre</b> vertically loaded against a stiff horizontal surface. The model includes {{a representation of the}} <b>tyre,</b> <b>a</b> steel <b>wheel</b> and <b>a</b> surface. The <b>tyre</b> is represented in detail by <b>a</b> number of <b>tyre</b> components, the wheel and surface are coarsely modelled. LS-DYNA 3 D is used to simulate the inflation of the tyre, the fit between the tyre and the wheel and the vertical loading of the tyre against the surface. Simulation results, such as the load-deflection characteristics and the load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are compared with mixed success to those obtained experimentally. The stiffness of the tyre components and the inflation pressure are varied independently and the simulation is repeated. The resulting load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are discussed in context with the development of <b>a</b> rolling <b>tyre</b> model. KEY WORDS: LS-DYNA 3 D, automobile tyre, load-deflection characteristics, load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions...|$|R

The two Holden Racing Team cars filled the podium, with James Courtney and Greg Murphy finishing ahead of Garth Tander and Warren Luff. Mark Winterbottom fell to third in the championship standings behind Craig Lowndes, after Winterbottom and Steve Owen could only finish tenth while Lowndes and Steven Richards finished fourth. Lee Holdsworth had a high-speed crash when his car suffered a mechanical failure {{at the end of the}} back straight, resulting in heavy contact with the <b>tyre</b> barrier. <b>A</b> <b>wheel</b> was torn off in the accident, which was collected by Jason Bright, forcing he and Andrew Jones out of the race. The only other retirement was the car of James Moffat and Taz Douglas, whose car was retired when the team were unable to disconnect the fuel hose from the car during their first pit stop.|$|R
40|$|A wave {{model to}} predict the {{vibrational}} response of <b>a</b> pneumatic <b>tyre</b> subject to line force excitation is presented. The tread and sidewalls are each modelled as thin, flat orthotropic plates with in-plane tension, which are joined together by a translational stiffness, and to a rigid rim. The dynamic response of the tyre to harmonic excitation is decomposed into spatial harmonics around the circumference, and waves in the meridional direction. At low frequencies ( 500 Hz), the response tends towards that of an infinite orthotropic plate. Experiments have been conducted on <b>an</b> inflated <b>tyre</b> fitted to <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> rim to confirm the theoretical findings. The results show reasonable agreement with the predictions, the model accurately reflecting the phenomenological behaviour...|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bird was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 8.792 seconds, ahead of Rosenqvist in second and di Grassi third. Buemi was fourth-fastest; Robin Frijns was fifth and Piquet sixth. Turvey was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Prost ninth and Maro Engel completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front <b>tyre</b> lost <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> nut, causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} red flag to retrieve Duval's tire and the two stoppages seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute practice period was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second red flag was not required because he was off the track. Di Grassi pushed hard and went into the turn four wall, damaging his car's front-right corner and rear-end, and yellow flags were waved to warn drivers about the incident.|$|R
40|$|Shimmy is an {{engineering}} example of self-excited vibration. Much research on shimmy has considered the tyre as the positive feedback or negative damping to create instability {{of the entire}} system. In this context, {{we focus on the}} relation between the energy balance, tyre motion and shimmy stability. The energy flow method is applied to the Von Schlippe tyre model to illustrate the energy transfer through tyre during periodic excitations. It evaluates the <b>tyre</b> performance with <b>a</b> prescribed sinusoidal motion and provides a novel approach in evaluating <b>tyre</b> models. <b>A</b> trailing <b>wheel</b> system is used to study the tyre motion at the boundary of shimmy stability. The tyre motion at these boundaries has to satisfy the condition that zero energy is transferred from the forward motion to the lateral/yaw motion...|$|R

I imagine a malnourished, thin baby with a visibly large head and eyes. This is a rather interesting study. At school-going age ther...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of different tyre models to analyse the shimmy phenomenon. Tyre models with the Magic Formula and a non-constant relaxation length are introduced. The energy flow method is applied to compare these <b>tyre</b> models. <b>A</b> trailing <b>wheel</b> suspension is used to analyse shimmy stability and to evaluate the differences between tyre models. Linearisation and nonlinear techniques, including bifurcation analysis, are applied to analyse this system. Extending the suspension model with lateral flexibility and structural damping reveals more information on shimmy stability. Although the nonlinear tyre models do not change the stability of equilibria, they determine {{the magnitude of the}} oscillation. It is concluded that the non-constant relaxation length {{should be included in the}} shimmy analysis for more accurate results at large amplitude...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{opportunities}} offered by electric vehicles (EVs), {{the design of}} power trains based on in-wheel electric motors represents, from the vehicle dynamics point of view, a very attractive prospect, mainly due to the torque-vectoring capabilities. However, this distributed propulsion also poses some practical challenges, owing to the constraints arising from motor installation in a confined space, to the increased unsprung mass weight and to {{the integration of the}} electric motor with the friction brakes. This last issue is the main theme of thiswork, which, in particular, focuses on the design of the anti-lock braking system (ABS). The proposed structure for the ABS is composed of <b>a</b> <b>tyre</b> slip controller, <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> torque allocator and a braking supervisor. To address the slip regulation problem, an adaptive controller is devised, offering robustness to uncertainties in the tyre–road friction and featuring a gainscheduling mechanism based on the vehicle velocity. Further, an optimisation framework is employed in the torque allocator to determine the optimal split between electric and friction brake torque based on energy performance metrics, actuator constraints and different actuators bandwidth. Finally, based on the EV working condition, the priorities of this allocation scheme are adapted by the braking supervisor unit. Simulation results obtained with the CarSim vehicle model, demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall approach...|$|R

50|$|Signalled in the {{darkness}} by an arrangement similar to traffic lights, the crew awaited their turn to take off, wireless traffic was kept to an absolute minimum to avoid alerting the German wireless listening services. If {{it was to be}} a distant target the aircraft fuel tanks might be topped-up by a fuel bowser immediately before taking off. Each crew would taxi out to the runway in its pre-assigned order with the pilot checking over the intercom with each of his crew in turn that they were well and everything was working before they were signaled to take off, and with the flight engineer standing beside the pilot to help manage the throttles they would go to full power and hope to pick up sufficient speed to get about 25 tons of bomber into the air before the end of the runway. <b>A</b> <b>tyre</b> blow out, <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> running off the runway into soft grass or an engine failure at this point would mean disaster as the 2,000 gallons (up 8 tons) of aviation fuel, approximately 5 tons of bombs (high explosive and incendiary) and multiple thousands of rounds of ammunition crashed at over 130 miles per hour. A crash at this stage usually killed all aboard. Bombers usually took off with about 60 second intervals between them. The pilot would slowly climb to the designated height and head for the group's assembly point near the coast. Once airborne every airman had to hope that his oxygen mask and supply functioned properly when it was switched on at 5,000 feet and did not suffer from icing in the frigid temperatures at high altitude, their electrically heated flying suits, boots and gloves were completely necessary to avoid frostbite throughout the year.|$|R
