5|$|The {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> {{for international}} aid was moderate. American church groups, Cuba, and Mexico collectively contributed around 2,500tons {{of food and}} medicine. The Canadian, Swedish, West German, Spanish, and Dutch Governments contributed aid amounting to 2million dollars (1988) each. No aid was sent by the United States government. The Soviet Union contributed an unknown sum. The slow response <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> for aid was contributed to by the Sandinista Government's actions, which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press, as undermining the peace process championed by Óscar Arias. Those actions were the July 10 arrests of opposition activists and the closing down of independent radio stations. In addition, the government also barred foreign humanitarian groups from receiving American aid, as well as turning back a relief shipment days before the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1941 the Australian ICorps was {{concentrated}} in Syria and Lebanon where it undertook garrison duties while its strength was rebuilt ahead of further operations in the Middle East. Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific most elements of the corps, including the 6thand 7thDivisions, returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia. The Australian Government agreed <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> from Britain and the United States to temporarily retain the 9thDivision in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73squadrons. The Government did not intend that the 9thDivision would {{play a major role in}} active fighting, and it was not sent any further reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's volunteers responded <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> for {{military}} service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E
5|$|Responding <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> from Japanese {{airlines}} for a {{high-capacity aircraft}} to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range {{version of the}} 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from {{a greater number of}} takeoffs and landings. Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow in responding <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> for compensation. While {{waiting for a}} response, {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E

50|$|Since French Act No. 2007-1544 of 29 October 2007, this {{expression}} {{is used in}} almost all the articles of the French Intellectual Property Code relating to the saisie-contrefaçon {{to refer to the}} person entitled <b>to</b> <b>request</b> it. Simply put, the persons having standing <b>to</b> <b>request</b> a saisie-contrefaçon are generally the holders of the allegedly infringed intellectual property right and the exclusive licensees - after the right holder has been notified and yet taken no action. The person having standing <b>to</b> <b>request</b> the saisie-contrefaçon does not have to provide evidence of the alleged infringement as the saisie-contrefaçon precise goal is to gather evidence. However, the requesting party must duly justify both the existence of an intellectual property right in force and its standing <b>to</b> <b>request</b> the saisie-contrefaçon.|$|R

5|$|Luzzaschi's book of madrigals for one, two, {{and three}} sopranos with {{keyboard}} accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music {{may have been}} kept back from publication {{in order to maintain}} the secrecy of Alfonso's musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> from Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1960, in {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>requests</b> by Prime Minister Lumumba, the UN Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 143. This called upon Belgium to remove its troops {{and for the}} UN to provide 'military assistance' to the Congolese forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening to seek help from the Soviet Union {{if they did not}} leave within two days. The UN reacted quickly and established the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's mandate. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba wanted to use the UN troops to subdue Katanga by force. Referring to the resolution, Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, 'From these texts it is clear that, contrary to your personal interpretation, the UN force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.' Secretary General Hammarskjöld refused. To Hammarskjöld, the secession of Katanga was an internal Congolese matter and the UN was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. Disagreements over what the UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment.|$|E
