40|$|This {{article is}} free to read on the {{publishers}} website Objective To estimate the cost-effectiveness of Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages (<b>TEXT</b> <b>ME),</b> a text message-based intervention that provides advice, motivation, information and support to improve health-related behaviours. Methods A lifetime Markov model was used to estimate major vascular events (myocardial infarctions and strokes) avoided, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, costs to the health system and the incremental cost per QALY gained. The model was informed by data from a randomised controlled trial of <b>TEXT</b> <b>ME,</b> with evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to estimate the effects of changes in risk factors on the risk of major vascular events. Expected costs and health outcomes were estimated with uncertainty surrounding these characterised using probabilistic sensitivity analysis {{and a number of}} scenario analyses. Results For a target population of 50 [*] 000 patients with documented coronary heart disease, the intervention is expected to lead to 563 fewer myocardial infarctions, 361 fewer strokes and 1143 additional QALYs. <b>TEXT</b> <b>ME</b> is expected to lead to an overall saving of 10. 56 [*]million for the health system over the patients’ lifetimes. The intervention can therefore be considered cost-saving and health-improving.

2500|$|The {{concept for}} the [...] "Take Me to Church" [...] music video {{was the result}} of a {{collaboration}} between Hozier, Brendan Canty and his writing partner Emmet O'Brien. It was directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson of Feel Good Lost and was released on 25 September 2013. The video, shot in grayscale on location at Inniscarra Dam in Cork, Ireland, follows a same-sex relationship and the violently homophobic backlash that ensues when the community learns of one of the men's sexuality. The song went viral following its release. [...] "I remember someone <b>texting</b> <b>me</b> to say it was getting 10,000 views an hour", he recalled.

40|$|The {{basic text}} {{classification}} technique in forum application {{has been discussed}} in Sainin (2005 a) and Sainin (2005 b). The paper explains {{about the use of}} the basic naïve Bayes algorithm to classify forum <b>text</b> <b>me</b> ssages into two classes namely clean and bad. In the problem of document text classification for conference paper, various papers themes will normally be classified manually by the conference management. Once the classification of the papers is ready, the parallel sessions for presentation according to the themes will be scheduled. This process is time consuming and may classify papers into unrelated themes. Based on this situation, an automated text document classification can replace the manual classification; hence reduce the decision time. In this paper, the similar algorithm that was applied in the previous experiment for the forum messages classification will be discussed according to the experiment for conference paper classification...|$|E

Qualitative data were interpreted using inductive thematic analysis. 307 / 352 (87 % response rate) of recruited patients with CHD completed the program evaluation survey at six months and 25 participated in a focus group. Factors increasing engagement included (i) ability to save and share messages, (ii) having the support of providers and family, (iii) a feeling of support through participation in the program, (iv) the program being initiated close to the time of a cardiovascular event, (v) personalization of the messages, (vi) opportunity for initial face-to-face contact with a provider and (vii) that program and content was perceived to be from a credible source. Clear themes relating to program delivery were that diet and physical activity messages were most valued, four messages per week was ideal and most participants felt program duration should be provided for at least for six months or longer. This study provides context and insight into the factors influencing consumer engagement with a text message program aimed at improving health-related behavior. The study suggests program components that may enhance potential success but will require integration at the development stage to optimize up-scaling.
