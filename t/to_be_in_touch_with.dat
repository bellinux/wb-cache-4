25|$|The Greening of Harlem Coalition {{is another}} example of an ecofeminist movement. In 1989, Bernadette Cozart founded the coalition, which is {{responsible}} for many urban gardens around Harlem. Cozart's goal is to turn vacant lots into community gardens. This is economically beneficial, and also provides a way for very urban communities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> nature and each other. The majority of people interested in this project (as noted in 1990) were women. Through these gardens, they were able to participate in and become leaders of their communities. Urban greening exists in other places as well. Beginning in 1994, a group of African-American women in Detroit have developed city gardens, and call themselves the Gardening Angels. Similar garden movements have been occurring globally.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{this study}} focuses {{more on the}} process rather than {{the outcome of the}} {{tracking}} processes. ICT tools provide significant help in reaching respondents, but they cannot solve {{the problem of how to}} motivate potential respondents to participate; these respondents may reject the survey invitation just because they <b>are</b> not <b>in</b> a good mood. As discussed above, ICT tools per se have pros and cons in bridging researchers and respondents, particularly for young people. Equipped with better education and more information technology, they compose a group that <b>is</b> eager <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> but also wants independence from teachers, parents, and other authorities. To smooth communication with youth respondents and win their cooperation, the use of communication tools must take into consideration the characteristics of youth culture and youth development. The tracking process is a continuing interactive process in which researchers should keep exploring how respondents feel about the survey. Researchers have to adapt to the language of communication among youth, and the research design needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> improved <b>to</b> speak to the needs and characteristics of respondents. Although the biggest loss of respondents occurred at the time when they moved from high schools to universities, the research team adjusted the tracking strategy immediately and continuously and has managed to retain the majority of the remaining sample since then. As such, the remaining sample is a subset of the original respondents, and its size and representativeness are the result of the cumulative efforts that take place in different stages of the panel study (Callegaro and Disogra 2008; Disogra and Callegaro 2010).|$|R

Which communication technologies do they use <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch?</b> How these communication technologies <b>are</b> related <b>to</b> the emotional support? In order to answer these research questions, I explored previous studies in which I found that they only included the immigrants’ point of view.

I interviewed members of 15 transnational families during 2012 and 2013. The results showed that emotional support was identified as: a) contacting relatives in Mexico, initiated by immigrants, b) exchanging daily life experiences; c) solving issues and conflicts; and d) immigrants supporting, participating or being virtually in special celebrations. Immigrants also used communication technologies in order to maintain emotional ties and give emotional support to their parents.

30|$|In this view, {{the state}} and its {{territorial}} border—and the national membership that this frontier implies—have difficulty containing the globe-spanning networks that “transmigrants” construct via their incessant physical, social, and economic connections to the homeland. These connections, it is argued, are possible mainly because of technological advances in travel and communications that compress time and space: jumbo jets make formerly insurmountable distances between destination and origin easily traveled, and mobile phones and the internet allow migrants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> daily <b>touch</b> with their families in the homeland (Diminescu, 2008; Vertovec, 2003). While subsequent research has questioned the argument that cross-border engagement is a novel form of social action (Foner, 1997) and has nuanced the depiction of the fluidity of transnational life (Levitt & Jaworsky, 2007), new technologies have undoubtedly made transnational activities easier and cheaper, and have thus {{had an impact on the}} quantity and kinds of cross-border engagement (Diminescu, 2008; Portes, Guarnizo, & Haller, 2002).|$|R
40|$|With the {{priority}} of poverty reduction and with accelerating change in many dimensions, up-to-date and realistically informed perceptions of the lives and conditions {{of people living in}} poverty have come to matter more than ever. At the same time, new pressures and incentives increasingly trap decision-makers in headquarters and capital cities, reinforcing earlier (1983) analysis of the attraction of urban ‘cores’ and the neglect of rural ‘peripheries’. These trends make decision-makers’ learning about poverty and from people living in poverty rarer and ever more important. One common means has been rural development tourism, the phenomenon of the brief rural visit from an urban centre. In 1983, six biases of such visits – spatial, project, person, seasonal, diplomatic and professional - against seeing, meeting and learning from the poorer people, were identified and described. Security can now be added as a seventh. Much can <b>be</b> done <b>to</b> offset the biases. The solution <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make more visits, not fewer, and to enjoy doing them better. In addition, new and promising approaches have been pioneered for experiential, direct learning, face-to-face with poor and marginalised people. Examples are: UNHCR’s annual participatory assessments by staff; SDC’s ‘views of the poor’ participatory research in Tanzania; and various forms of immersion, most recently those being convened and organised by ActionAid International. In many immersions, outsiders become guests for a few days and nights, and live, experience and learn in a community. The question now is not how an organisation can afford the time and other resources for immersions for its staff. It is how, if it is seriously pro-poor, it can possibly not do so. This paper <b>is</b> a challenge <b>to</b> development actors to practice a responsible pro-poor professionalism; <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pioneers and champions, seizing and making space for themselves and others to offset the biases and traps of headquarters and capital cities; and to have the vision and guts to seek out direct experiential learning and so <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> and up-to-date with the realities of the people living in poverty whom they seek to serve.
