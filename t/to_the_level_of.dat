5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 1950.|$|E

5|$|After retiring, Crozier {{served in}} the Capitals' front office. He {{eventually}} became interim general manager during the 1981–82 season after Max McNab was relieved of his duties. Crozier was also the {{head coach of the}} Capitals for one game during the season. Under his watch, the Capitals picked future hall-of-famer defenceman Scott Stevens during the 1982 NHL Entry Draft. Crozier left the Capitals organization in 1983, and moved to Wilmington, Delaware, to work at MBNA Bank. Working through the ranks, he rose <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> executive vice president and facilities manager of Worldwide Facilities and Construction.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{the river}} by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs {{up to the}} main road, which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too {{dangerous}} and this road must be followed {{most of the way}} from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides.|$|E
5|$|Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has {{usually been}} {{classified}} as a suborder within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most who still employ the use of ranks have retained its traditional ranking of suborder, though some have reduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> infraorder.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Gwyn resumed the life he had left behind in 1861. He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years older than the last time he saw them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> a constitutional violation.|$|E

5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E
5|$|Low-cost {{loans for}} farmers and {{replaced}} the labor service {{with a tax}} instead, hoping this would ultimately help {{the workings of the}} entire economy and state (as he directly linked state income <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> prosperity of rural peasants who owned farms, produced goods for the market, and paid the land tax). These government loans replaced the system of landlords offering their tenants private loans, which was prohibited under the new laws of Wang's reforms.|$|E

5|$|Many central {{government}} officials also began their careers as subordinate officers for commandery-level administrations. There are only rare cases (i.e. involving military merit during rebellions of late Eastern Han) when subordinate officers of county-level administrations advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> {{central government}}. Even if one secured an office by these means, an official was still {{expected to be}} competent, thus a formal education became the hallmark of those aspiring to fill public office. In addition to private tutoring, the Imperial University was established in 124 BCE which then accommodated only fifty pupils, but by the 2nd century CE the student body had reached about thirty thousand. These students could be appointed by the emperor to various government posts according to their examination grades.|$|E
5|$|Nationwide, {{there are}} three state-run and three private TV networks. All provide live music {{at least some of}} the time, thus giving work to musicians, singers, and dancers. Many large cities in Italy have local TV stations, as well, which may provide live folk or dialect music often of {{interest}} only to the immediate area. Book and CD superstores have entered the Italian market over the last decade. The largest of these chains is Feltrinelli, originally a publishing house in the 1950s. In 2001, it geared up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Multimedia Store and now sells massive quantities of recorded music. There are, as of 2006, 14 such mega-stores in Italy, with more planned. FNAC is another large chain, originally French. It has six large outlets in Italy. These stores also serve as venues for music performance, hosting several concerts a week.|$|E
