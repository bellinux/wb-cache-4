40|$|Interface {{agents are}} semi-intelligent systems which assist users with daily {{computer-based}} tasks. Recently, various researchers {{have proposed a}} learning approach towards building such agents and some working prototypes have been demonstrated. Such agents learn by `watching over the shoulder' of the user and detecting patterns and regularities in the user's behavior. Despite the successes booked, a major problem with the learning approach is that the agent has to learn from scratch and thus takes some time becoming useful. Secondly, the agent's competence is necessarily limited to actions it has seen <b>the</b> <b>user</b> <b>perform.</b> Collaboration between agents assisting different users can alleviate both of these problems. We present a framework for multiagent collaboration and discuss results of a working prototype, based on learning agents for electronic mail.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Programming-by-demonstration (PBD) systems learn tasks by {{watching}} <b>the</b> <b>user</b> <b>perform</b> them. CIMA 1 is an {{interactive learning system}} for modeling the data selected and modified by a user {{as he or she}} undertakes a task. Part of a PBD system, CIMA is invoked when user actions are matched to find a common description of their "operands. " Although the system's interfaces to users and applications are still too rough-hewn to permit field trials, its performance on recorded dialogs between users and a simulated agent meets the design goals established prior to its implementation. The contributions of this work lie in three areas:. a design methodology for PBD systems;. a framework for user actions in PBD;. novel methods of interaction with the user. These are discussed in separate sections below. First, however, it is necessary to convey the flavor of {{what it is like to}} use the CIMA system, and this is done in the followi...|$|E

While, in theory, this may seem somewhat trivial, there are many details that must be taken into consideration, such as certificate revocation mechanisms. Since certificates will not be valid forever, there must be a way in which users can obtain accurate information. The research in this thesis provides such a mechanism.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an intelligent interface {{to assist in}} the expert perceptual task of sound equalization. This is commonly done by a sound engineer in a recording studio, live concert setting, or in setting up audio systems.

The computer is used as a tool to sense, process, and act in helping <b>the</b> <b>user</b> <b>perform</b> a perceptual task. Adjusting timbres of sound is {{complicated by the fact that}} there are non-linear relationships between equalization adjustments and perceived sound quality changes.

40|$|Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules (MCRDR) is {{a simple}} and {{effective}} knowledge acquisition technique that produces representations, or knowledge maps, of a human experts' knowledge of a particular domain. This knowledge map can then be used to automate and help <b>the</b> <b>user</b> <b>perform</b> classification and categorisation of cases while still being able to add more refined knowledge incrementally. While MCRDR has been applied in many domains, work on understanding the meta-knowledge acquired or using the knowledge to derive new information {{is still in its}} infancy. This paper will introduce a technique called Rated MCRDR (RM), which looks at deriving and learning information about both linear and non-linear relationships between the multiple classifications within MCRDR. This method uses the knowledge received in the MCRDR knowledge map to derive additional information that allows improvements in functionality within existing domains, to which MCRDR is currently applied, as well as opening up the possibility of new problem domains. Preliminary testing shows that there exists a strong potential for RM to quickly and effectively learn meaningful ratings...|$|E

The high-noise high-dimensional nature of brain-signals make robust decoding techniques a necessity. Generally, the approach has been to use relatively simple feature extraction techniques, such as template matching and band-power estimation, coupled to simple linear classifiers. This {{has led to a}} prevailing view among applied BCI researchers that (sophisticated) machine-learning is irrelevant since it doesnamp;amp;lsquo;t matter what classifier you use once your features are extracted.  Using examples from our own MEG and EEG experiments, Iamp;amp;lsquo;ll demonstrate how machine-learning principles can be applied in order to improve BCI performance, if they are formulated in a domain-specific way.
