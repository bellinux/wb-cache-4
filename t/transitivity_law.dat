The deterministic <b>transitivity</b> <b>law</b> for the subset { 1, 2, 3 } says that (p 12 = 1, p 23 = 1) ⇒ p 13 = 1, and similarly for permutations of 123. The corresponding probabilistic or proportional <b>transitivity</b> <b>law</b> asserts that, for all (λ, μ) in the unit square, (p 12 ≥ λ, p 23 ≥ μ) ⇒ p 13 ≥ f(λ, μ), where f(λ, μ) is the infimum of p 13 over all finite posets that have p 12 ≥ λ and p 23 ≥ μ. It is shown that f(λ, μ) = 0 when λ + μ 1 and max{λ, μ} < 1, f(λ, μ) ≤ 1 − (1 − λ) (1 − μ) [1 − log(1 − λ) (1 − μ) ]. The exact value of f is presently unknown for every case in which λ + μ ≥ 1 and max{λ, μ} < 1...|$|E
40|$|We have {{attempted}} here {{to trace the}} implications, in terms of operational procedures, of some postulates about the "physical" nature of objects {{on one hand and}} individual choice behaviour on the other. We summarize the major result in very loose terms by asserting that if when choosing from among several objects which are characterized by "qualitative" or "ordinal" properties, an individual's choice obeys a <b>transitivity</b> <b>law,</b> then the choice is necessarily" dictated" by one characteristic a lone; that is, the underlying preference must be lexicographic in one of these ordinal properties. The reader must consult the text below for an elaboration on the meaning of the terms emphasized by quotation marks before the proper context of the result can be established...|$|E
40|$|Part I {{proposes a}} numeraire-invariant option pricing framework. It defines an option, its price process, and such notions as option indistinguishability and equivalence, domination, payoff process, trigger option, and semipositive option. It {{develops}} {{some of their}} basic properties, including price <b>transitivity</b> <b>law,</b> indistinguishability results, convergence results, and, in relation to nonnegative arbitrage, characterizations of semipositivity and consequences thereof. These are applied in Part II to study the Snell envelop and american options. The measurability and right-continuity of the former is established in general. The american option is then defined, and its pricing formula (for all times) is presented. Applying a concept of a domineering numeraire for superclaims derived from (the additive) Doob-Meyer decomposition, minimax duality formulae are given which resemble though differ from those in [R] and [H-K]. Multiplicative Doob-Meyer decomposition is discussed last. A part III is also envisaged. Option, Snell envelope, stooping time, martingale, Doob-Meyer Decomposition, price process...|$|E
40|$|The natural {{relations}} for sets are those definable {{in terms of}} the emptiness of the subsets corresponding to Boolean combinations of the sets. For pairs of sets, there are just five natural relations of interest, namely, strict inclusion in each direction, disjointness, intersection with the universe being covered, or not. Let N denote 1, 2, [...] .,n and ((N) (2)) denote (i,j) i, j is an element of N and i < j. A function mu on ((N) (2)) specifies one of these {{relations for}} each pair of indices. Then mu is said to be consistent on M subset of or equal to N if and only if there exists a collection of sets corresponding to indices in M such that the relations specified by mu hold between each associated pair of the sets. Firstly, it is proved that if mu is consistent on all subsets of N of size three then mu is consistent on N. Secondly, explicit conditions that make mu consistent on a subset of size three are given as generalized <b>transitivity</b> <b>laws.</b> Finally, it is shown that the result concerning binary natural relations can be generalized to r-ary natural relations for arbitrary r {{greater than or equal to}} 2...|$|R
50|$|Johnson {{argues that}} more {{abstract}} reasoning {{is shaped by}} such underlying spatial patterns. For example, {{he notes that the}} logic of containment {{is not just a matter}} of being in or out of the container. For example, if someone is in a deep depression, we know it is likely to be a long time before they are well. The deeper the trajector is in the container, the longer it will take for the trajector to get out of it. Similarly, Johnson argues that <b>transitivity</b> and the <b>law</b> of the excluded middle in logic are underlaid by preconceptual embodied experiences of the Containment schema.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} paper test is able {{to measure}} mainly individual student’s understanding level of individual bits of knowledge. However, {{it is difficult to}} measure the internal connection among bits of knowledge. Previously, Takeya, et al. (2004) had presented a new testing method, called a concept mapping test for a formative evaluation tool at the 1 st CMC. This is a test by using concept maps based on the prerequisite relations among concepts. However, future subjects lie in an evaluation method for a concept mapping test based on ordering relations with <b>transitivity</b> <b>law,</b> such as casual relations, inclusion relations, and so on. This paper presents new measurement and evaluation method for these kinds of structural knowledge. Secondly, giving a few examples, this paper discusses scoring method based on qualitative degree of sequencing. Thirdly, these characteristics and validities of the measurement and evaluation method are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSweeping is an {{important}} algorithmic tool in geometry. In {{the first part of}} this paper we define sweeps of arrangements and use the “Sweeping Lemma” to show that Euclidean arrangements of pseudolines can be represented by wiring diagrams and zonotopal tilings. In the second part we introduce a further representation for Euclidean arrangements of pseudolines. This representation records an “orientation” for each triple of lines. It turns out that a “triple orientation” corresponds to an arrangement exactly if it obeys a generalized <b>transitivity</b> <b>law.</b> Moreover, the “triple orientations” carry a natural order relation which induces an order relation on arrangements. A closer look on the combinatorics behind this leads to a series of signotope orders closely related to higher Bruhat orders. We investigate the structure of higher Bruhat orders and give new purely combinatorial proofs for the main structural properties. Finally, we reconnect the combinatorics of the second part to geometry. In particular, we show that the maximum chains in the higher Bruhat orders correspond to sweeps...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Primal infon logic was {{introduced}} in 2009 in connection with access control. In addition to traditional logic constructs, it contains unary connectives p said indispensable in the intended access control applications. Propositional primal infon logic is decidable in linear time, yet suffices for many common access control scenarios. The most obvious limitation on its expressivity is {{the failure of the}} <b>transitivity</b> <b>law</b> for implication: x → y and y → z do not necessarily yield x → z. Here we introduce and investigate equiexpressive “transitive ” extensions TPIL and TPIL ∗ of propositional primal infon logic as well as their quote-free fragments TPIL 0 and TPIL 0 ∗ respectively. We prove the subformula property for TPIL 0 ∗ and a similar property for TPIL ∗; we define Kripke models for the four logics and prove the corresponding soundness-and-completeness theorems; we show that, in all these logics, satisfiable formulas have small models; but our main result is a quadratic-time derivation algorithm for TPIL ∗. § 1. Introduction. In a brick-and-mortar setting, some access control policies may be vague and even unwritten. The clerks ordinarily know them. When in doubt, they know whom to ask. In the cloud there are no clerks, and policies have to be managed automatically. The most challenging are federated scenarios where the policies of differen...|$|E
