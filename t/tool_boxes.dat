40|$|The {{implementation}} of reliable and efficient geometric algorithms is a challenging task. The {{reason is the}} following conflict: On the one hand, computing with rounded arithmetic may question the reliability of programs while, on the other hand, computing with exact arithmetic may be too expensive and hence inefficient. One solution is the {{implementation of}} controlled perturbation algorithms which combine the speed of floating-point arithmetic with a protection mechanism that guarantees reliability, nonetheless. This paper {{is concerned with the}} performance analysis of controlled perturbation algorithms in theory. We answer this question with the presentation of a general analysis <b>tool</b> <b>box.</b> This <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> is separated into independent components which are presented individually with their interfaces. This way, the <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> supports alternative approaches for the derivation of the most crucial bounds. We present three approaches for this task. Furthermore, we have thoroughly reworked the concept of controlled perturbation in order to include rational function based predicates into the theory; polynomial based predicates are included anyway. Even more we introduce object-preserving perturbations. Moreover, the <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> is designed such that it reflects the actual behavior of the controlled perturbation algorithm at hand without any simplifying assumptions.

5000|$|Sigmund H Danziger Jr. (1916-1979) founded Homak Mfg. Co. Inc. in 1947 in Chicago. A Chicago southsider {{and son of}} a sales {{representative}} for houseware products, including bathroom scales, Mr. Danziger began his business career “jobbing” for Chicago manufacturers while {{a student at the}} University of Chicago. After the World War II, in which he served as a captain and translator, he purchased a bathroom cabinet manufacturer {{on the south side of}} Chicago for which he was jobbing. Naming the new company Homak, capturing a sign he noted on a hat store, he began manufacturing steel kitchen cabinets and rapidly moved to a 35000 sq ft building, which he designed at 4433 S. Springfield Ave in Chicago. In the early 1960s, an order for <b>tool</b> <b>boxes</b> lead to the production of a hardware line including roller cabinets, <b>tool</b> <b>boxes,</b> and other accessories. Through the 1970s and 1980s, most of the major retailers and chains of the time became either line or private label customers at one time or another, including Sears, Walmart, Kmart, The Home Depot True Value, Ace Hardware, Montgomery Ward, Coast-to-Coast, Costco, Meijer, Pep Boys, Fingerhut, etc. In 1979, Sigmund Danziger died and his wife Gertrude (Trudy), ran the company for the next 25 years. During this time, the company moved to a 400000 sq ft facility in Bedford Park, Illinois at 5151 W 73rd St. while sales grew to $35,000,000 with hardware, automotive, hospital (under Homed TM), and sporting goods lines. One of the major innovations during this period was the introduction of a consumer gun cabinet (under HomSafe TM), which instantly grew to be a major hit at mass retailers, including Bass Pro Shops, Gander Mountain, Dick's Sporting Goods and Sports Authority. Also a line of garage cabinets was introduced for Whirlpool and Sears under the label [...] "Gladiator Garageworks." [...] Homak employed hundreds of people, who enjoyed the prosperity of the industry, and was the largest privately held sheet-metal fabricator in America.|$|E
50|$|Fishing tackle boxes {{have for}} many years been an {{essential}} part of the anglers equipment. Fishing tackle boxes were originally made of wood or wicker and eventually some metal fishing tackle boxes were manufactured. The first plastic fishing tackle boxes were manufactured by Plano in response to the need for a product that didn't rust. Early plastic fishing tackle boxes were similar to <b>tool</b> <b>boxes</b> but soon evolved into the hip roof cantilever tackle boxes with numerous small trays for small tackle. These types of tackle boxes are still available today but they have the disadvantage that small tackle gets mixed up. Fishing tackle boxes have also been manufactured so the drawers themselves become small storage boxes, each with their own lids. This prevents small tackle from mixing, and can turn each drawer into a stand-alone container which can be used to carry small tackle to a rod some distance from the main tackle box.|$|E
