5|$|Nxumalo {{frequently}} fights {{the racism}} and apartheid that is beginning <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> into his hometown. He tries to tackle stories important to his society's well-being. However, {{he is no}} match to the plan to evict residents and ultimately destroy Sophiatown. Constantly harassed by the government, {{at the end of}} the film he is stabbed to death. The attacker has never been identified.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} H. S. Offler in 1951 {{felt that}} the Libellus was not a contemporary account of the trial, and instead dated from {{the second quarter of}} the 12th century and was produced at Durham. More recent scholars, including W. M. Aird, Frank Barlow, and Emma Mason have concluded that the work is indeed a contemporary record of the trial. Barlow bases his belief in the authenticity on the level of detail {{and the fact that the}} account lacks all knowledge of events outside the court, and explains that Offler's concerns can be explained by the late date for all the manuscripts, which allowed scribal errors <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> in.|$|E
5|$|The {{metropolitan}} areas of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach {{are located on}} a rise in elevation along the eastern coast of Florida, called the Eastern Coastal Ridge, that was formed as waves compressed ooids into a single formation. Along the western border of the Big Cypress Swamp is the Immokolee Ridge (or Immokolee Rise), a slight rise of compressed sand that divides the runoff between the Caloosahatchee River and The Big Cypress. This slight rise in elevation {{on both sides of}} the Everglades creates a basin, and forces water that overflows Lake Okeechobee <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> toward the southwest.|$|E

50|$|Araiostegia is a genus {{of twelve}} epiphytic or {{terrestrial}} ferns from tropical Asia {{belonging to the}} hares-foot fern family. It has finely pinnate thinly textured fronds arising from long scaly stalks jointed <b>to</b> <b>creeping</b> rhizomes.|$|R
50|$|In {{software}} development, <b>creeping</b> elegance, related <b>to</b> <b>creeping</b> featurism and second-system effect, is {{the tendency}} of programmers to disproportionately emphasize elegance in software {{at the expense of}} other requirements such as functionality, shipping schedule, and usability.|$|R
5|$|Arsenal {{scored the}} game's only {{goal in the}} 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta {{on the right and}} shoot the ball into the top-left corner of Courtois's net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of the action in the first half was {{conducted}} in a congested midfield, with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter-attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> into the bottom right-hand corner. Ramires then missed another chance, heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy. Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over. Rémy, often a lone figure upfront, was ruled offside late on.|$|E
5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for Béla IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed that the king was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came right up to the great walls and fought hand to hand. They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning that the king was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir, a number of them turning off toward Split.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

5|$|Porte {{kept the}} pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow {{member of the}} L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 when he could not climb Monte Grappa with the leaders on the day. On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> back {{into the top of}} the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of the climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time trial, closing his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept {{on his hands and knees}} to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.|$|E

50|$|Logging {{also is a}} {{major cause}} of caribou mortality. Logging the mature boreal forest of {{northern}} Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ontario has led <b>to</b> <b>creeping</b> aspen/birch habitat followed by northward moving whitetail deer carrying the parasite Parelaphostrongylus tenuis. The neurological parasite is fatal to caribou and moose.|$|R

In addition, a prostrate, shrubby variety {{known as}} naio papa ("flat naio") grows only at South Point {{on the island}} of Hawaii and is characterized by its similarities <b>to</b> <b>creeping</b> shrubs.|$|R
30|$|For both BLVL and GLB, the {{instantaneous}} recovery ratio (elastic recovery <b>to</b> elastic <b>creep)</b> {{was reduced}} {{with the stress}} level increased, while residual ratio (residual deformation corresponded <b>to</b> the total <b>creep</b> deflections) was increased.|$|R

25|$|In an {{induction}} type meter, creep is {{a phenomenon}} that can adversely affect accuracy, that occurs when the meter disc rotates continuously with potential applied and the load terminals open circuited. A test for error due <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> is called a creep test.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} if a Lévy process creeps then, as a {{function}} of u, the renewal function V(t,u) of the bivariate ascending ladder process (L^- 1,H) is absolutely continuous on [0,∞) and left differentiable on (0,∞), and the left derivative at u is proportional to the (improper) distribution function of the time at which the process creeps over level u, where the constant of proportionality is _H^- 1, the reciprocal of the (positive) drift of H. This yields the (missing) term due <b>to</b> <b>creeping</b> in the recent quintuple law of Doney and Kyprianou (2006). As an application, we derive a Laplace transform identity which generalises the second factorization identity. We also relate Doney and Kyprianou's extension of Vigon's équation amicale inversée <b>to</b> <b>creeping.</b> Some results concerning the ladder process of X, including the second factorization identity, continue to hold for a general bivariate subordinator, and are given in this generality...|$|R
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Minnesota started <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> closer as RB Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run (with a failed PAT) {{for the only}} score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings took the lead with Peterson getting an 8-yard TD run. Chicago tried to rally, but Minnesota's defense was too much.|$|E
25|$|Hardwood plywood is {{made out}} of wood from {{angiosperm}} trees and used for demanding end uses. Hardwood plywood is characterized by its excellent strength, stiffness and resistance <b>to</b> <b>creep.</b> It has a high planar shear strength and impact resistance, which make it especially suitable for heavy-duty floor and wall structures. Oriented plywood construction has a high wheel-carrying capacity. Hardwood plywood has excellent surface hardness, and damage- and wear-resistance.|$|E
25|$|The post-war {{period was}} to prove more {{challenging}} for the LBSCR {{with the national}} railway strike in 1919, followed by two coalminers' strikes in 1920 and 1921 which resulted in reduced levels of service far worse than anything seen during the war. Problems were also experienced with the Oxted Tunnel south of Woldingham which led to services being diverted through the Three Bridges Line. It was only in 1922 that services began <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> back to their pre-war levels.|$|E
30|$|The {{nanostructure}} of C–S–H, {{which is}} believed to be strongly related <b>to</b> its <b>creep</b> performance, is still mysterious and controversial. Therefore, this paper briefly reviews some popular models for nanostructure of C–S–H before going deep <b>to</b> its <b>creep</b> mechanism (in Sect.  3). A more comprehensive review on nanostructure of C–S–H {{can be found in the}} literature (Papatzani et al. 2015).|$|R
50|$|Degradation of a {{high-temperature}} superconductor's properties due <b>to</b> flux <b>creep</b> is a {{limiting factor}} {{in the use of}} these superconductors. SQUID magnetometers suffer reduced precision in a certain range of applied field due <b>to</b> flux <b>creep</b> in the superconducting magnet used to bias the sample, and the maximum field strength of high-temperature superconducting magnets is drastically reduced by the depression in critical field.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a common}} weed of cultivation, known in the Americas as annual bluegrass. It occurs as a common {{constituent}} of lawns, where it is also often treated as a weed, and grows on waste ground. Many golf putting greens, including the famously fast Oakmont Country Club greens, are annual bluegrass, although many courses have converted <b>to</b> <b>creeping</b> bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera).|$|R
25|$|The Pisani Dossi Ms. was {{published}} in facsimile by Francesco Novati in 1902, including the only reproductions of {{a copy of the}} Flower of Battle that are clearly in the public domain. However, it is unclear how accurate this facsimile is as evidence suggests that Novati may have hired an artist to create a tracing of the original manuscript rather than reproducing it directly. This would have provided ample opportunity for errors <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> into the images, and might also account for the significant divergences from the artistic style of the Getty and the Morgan.|$|E
25|$|The first {{decades of}} the 21st century have {{witnessed}} the rapid gentrification of these neighborhoods. Istiklal Avenue has once again become a destination for tourists, and formerly bohemian neighborhoods like Cihangir have once again become fashionable and quite expensive. Some 19th and early 20th century buildings have been tastefully restored, while others have been converted into mammoth luxury malls of dubious aesthetic value. As newer, more international and affluent residents have begun <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> down the hills into Tophane and Tarlabasi, disagreements with more conservative elements in the neighborhoods have become common.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the chemical resistance decreases. The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant <b>to</b> <b>creep</b> than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E
40|$|Alloy 617, a nickel‑based alloy, is {{a leading}} {{candidate}} for application in next‑generation nuclear plants (NGNPs). Creep, a thermally activated, time-dependent deformation process impacts the lifetime and failure of heat exchangers used at the very high operating temperatures and pressures of such plants. Current methods of testing creep are generally limited to bar specimens in uniaxial tension. In an attempt to correlate uniaxial <b>to</b> multiaxial <b>creep</b> behavior a method <b>to</b> test <b>creep</b> in a pressurized tube was developed. Test specimens were pressurized with argon up to 3. 5 MPa, and heated <b>to</b> 950 °C. <b>Creep</b> rates were measured as strain rates by tracking diametric changes with time. Parallel experimental and modeling efforts were used <b>to</b> characterize <b>creep</b> behavior in the pressurized tubes. The aim {{of this research was}} to use the existing body of knowledge concerning creep in Alloy 617 to develop a model <b>to</b> accurately predict <b>creep</b> in tubular components. Towards this end, a constitutive model was developed and computer simulations undertaken which were ultimately verified experimentally...|$|R

40|$|A genetically {{transformed}} creeping bentgrass cultivar that is {{resistant to}} the nonselective herbicide glyphosate has been developed. <b>To</b> date, glyphosate-resistant <b>creeping</b> bentgrass is not commercially available, but its use could ease weed control and improve overall quality of the putting surface. This innovation presents golf course superintendents {{with the opportunity to}} convert existing putting greens <b>to</b> glyphosate-resistant <b>creeping</b> bentgrass. <b>To</b> minimize disruption of golf play, methods that speed conversion of putting greens are needed. The objectives of this experiment were to evaluate how seeding date, mowing height, and nitrogen (N) fertility level affect conversion speed of established putting greens <b>to</b> glyphosate-resistant <b>creeping</b> bentgrass...|$|R
