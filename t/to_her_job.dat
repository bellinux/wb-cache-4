25|$|A popular locally {{produced}} children's television show, Happy Herb & Froggy Doo, features magician Happy Herb (Henry Winkler) and his wisecracking marionette sidekick, Froggy Doo. Froggy Doo is stolen {{and held}} for ransom, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is {{called in to}} investigate. Elliott Plumm (Chris Massoglia) used to watch the show, but now feels he is too grown up to do so any longer. His five-year-old brother, Rocky, is a Froggy Doo fan, however. Their father, Mick Plumm (William Baldwin), is a recovering alcoholic and unemployed ex-boxer who believes Elliott's birth prevented him from going to the Olympic Games 12 years earlier. Mick's emotionally distant relationship with Elliott is causing Elliott to become emotionally troubled. Their mother, Roxie Plumm (Lisa Guerrero), is the only breadwinner in the family, and keeping her husband sober and attending <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job</b> means she has little time for her children.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 {{review by}} Simon noted that Donna lacked {{dedication}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job,</b> and was easily distracted by her love life. Following an April 2008 interview with Jacobs, the itv.com website for the entertainment show This Morning observed that despite Donna's [...] "chaotic" [...] personal life, {{she had grown}} more serious about her work. Ultimately, adopting her half-niece Mia forced Donna to grow up, focussing on her career by attaining promotion to ward sister and accepting the resultant responsibilities. Reflecting on Donna's development in January 2011, Jacobs observed that she had changed {{a great deal from}} her early days, when she was used as a comical character with [...] "bumbling one-liners", into a serious, more responsible person.|$|E

500|$|Yumemi is a goodhearted but {{extremely}} talkative gynoid attendant of {{an abandoned}} planetarium; she is designed {{to look like a}} young girl. Yumemi is slightly damaged and completely unaware of the changes that have occurred in the past 30 years, as none of the facilities and databases that she connects to exist anymore. Therefore, she treats the protagonist like a regular guest by calling him , speaks of the world as it was before the war, and fails to understand any information he tells her, other than things related <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job</b> at the planetarium. The name [...] "Hoshino Yumemi" [...] itself is a pun—"hoshi" [...] means star or planetary body; [...] "no" [...] is a possessive particle; [...] "yume" [...] is a dream or a reverie; [...] "mi" [...] means see. Yumemi is the only character shown to the audience of the game.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{announcing the}} character's creation, BBC Publicity {{initially}} stated of her personality: [...] "Maddy's enthusiasm and ability speaks for itself. She's a young SHO who loves {{her job and}} is fun to be around." [...] Expanding, it was added that: [...] "Maddy's young, fun and up for a laugh while, at the same time, dedicated <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job.</b> She's definitely {{not going to be}} single for very long, but there's a family secret she's harbouring which could just get in the way..." [...] The BBC Holby City homepage describes Maddy as: [...] "enthusiastic and eager to learn. Being with her is fun. She doesn't moan, she loves her job and gets on with it. She just wants to be happy". Comparing the character's personality to her own, [...] Lewington commented: [...] "My good pal, Sir Robert Powell (Mark Williams) has said that a character is often only yourself turned 3 degrees. I think this to be true of Maddy and I. There are similarities. Although she's smarter than me, she does the daftest things! She's says things I wouldn't. But when she cries, I cry and when she smiles, I smile".|$|E
500|$|The concept behind {{having the}} episode based around an alien planet {{occurred}} to Moffat, Skinner, and producer Marcus Wilson when realising {{they had done}} big location pieces {{in the first half}} of the series with [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", but had none for the second half. They decided to do a story set in [...] "a world created in our studios to make you really feel you're out there", rather than having the Doctor [...] "promise unearthly wonders to his companions, and then get them trapped in an underground tunnel". As such, the episode was designed to allow the Doctor to actually show his new companion the wonders he had promised. The production team aimed to show [...] "the best alien planet" [...] on Doctor Who. The episode originally had a different pre-credits sequence, which consisted of a long scene in the kitchen in which Clara informs the Doctor she cannot come and travel with the Doctor because she has responsibilities <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job,</b> and the boy she takes care of asks if the Doctor is her boyfriend. Cross's intent was to juxtapose this [...] "mundane" [...] scene with the vast scale of the planet. However, Moffat thought that at the time in the series the Doctor should be investigating Clara through her parents and Cross revised to include the leaf, an idea Moffat approved of. Originally the resolution was to be the Doctor defeating the planet with his speech, which Cross likened to [...] "facing down one of Lovecraft's Old Gods: an alien so alien that it's practically a supernatural being." [...] Moffat pointed out that the Doctor had given similar speeches before and was more interested in Clara saving the day. After thinking about it for a while, Cross realised he could incorporate the leaf into the solution.|$|E

2500|$|She {{credited}} her longevity {{to eating}} a fried egg sandwich every day. However doctors reputedly {{thought it could}} be due <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job</b> as a clerk at an engineering firm for fifty years, which she retired from {{at the age of}} 75. The company was based on top a steep hill in Woodhouse, Leeds. [...] "She would walk up that hill, come home at lunchtime and then back up it" [...] commented a grandson. Baldwin's daughter believes her mother's longevity was due to no drinking, no smoking and hard work. Baldwin spent time in hospital in her 70s due to cataracts.|$|E
2500|$|PV2 Brenda [...] "Mrs. B" [...] Mitchell (Nicki Lynn Aycox) — was a [...] "pig-headed" [...] and obstinate 18-year-old, who {{was more}} of a {{liability}} than an asset to the squad, and to her partner, [...] "Doublewide." [...] She took great umbrage at the fact that her nickname is short for [...] "Mrs. Bitch." [...] As a teen, she was raped and later gave birth to an autistic child who was put into the custody of his grandparents. Hardships in life made her significantly more willing to risk her life under fire since she seemed to have nothing to lose. She {{is one of the few}} characters to carry an M16A2 rifle instead of an M4 carbine, due <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job</b> as part of a support unit instead of a front-line combat unit like her comrades.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s and prior to {{long-term}} dialysis becoming available, Keith Reemtsma {{and his colleagues}} at Tulane University in New Orleans attempted transplants of chimpanzee kidneys into 13 human patients. [...] Most of these patients only lived one to two months. [...] However in 1964, a 23-year-old woman lived for nine months and even returned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job</b> as a school teacher until she suddenly collapsed and died. [...] It was assumed that she died from an acute electrolyte disturbance. [...] At autopsy, the kidneys had not been rejected nor was there any other obvious cause of death. One source states this patient died from pneumonia. [...] Tom Starzl and his team in Colorado used baboon kidneys with six human patients who lived one or two months, but with no longer term survivors. [...] Others in the United States and France had limited experiences.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cases of}} Hattie Williams and Viola Watson {{highlighted}} {{the difficulties of}} labor organizing on Duke’s campus. Initially, unionization efforts {{had little effect on}} working conditions because of a historically unwelcoming environment for labor unions, and the resulting lack of recognition by the University’s entire population. At first, employees attained only minor improvements in pay, and a new grievance procedure easily manipulated by management and administrators. In the case of Hattie Williams and Viola Watson, members involved with Local 77 and African-American housekeepers who had worked for at least four years, were fired without warning in the winter of 1966. Both workers received no complaints about the quality of their work. However, both previously involved themselves in the Local 77 movement; Williams was a Union Steward and Watson had picketed for higher wages with the union. [...] They used the grievance procedure to reclaim their positions in the University. However, only Hattie Williams was returned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job</b> while Watson was denied permission to her previous position.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Denison University, Lynn began working for Procter & Gamble in the 1980s, {{and became one}} of the first women to hold a {{position}} as manufacturing plant manager. While still working as a plant manager, Lynn began taking commercial flight lessons in 1988 and soon discovered a passion for aerobatic flight. After a year of lessons, Lynn earned the additional rating, quit her job with Procter & Gamble, cashed in her pension plan, and bought a Pitts S-2B aerobatic biplane. Lynn was then one of the few women flying in air shows. At the time of her death, she was one of the 7% of all pilots who are female. In addition <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job</b> as a flight instructor, during which she earned over three thousand hours of aerobatic flight, Lynn worked as a consultant and actor for safety videos released by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and hosted segments of the program [...] "Wing Tips" [...] on Discovery Wings.

6000|$|E14 kept <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>job,</b> on {{the edge}} of the {{procession}} of traffic. Patrol vessels annoyed her to such an extent that [...] "as I had not seen any transports lately I decided to sink a patrol-ship as they were always firing on me." [...] So she torpedoed a thing that looked like a mine-layer, and must have been something of that kidney, for it sank in less than a minute. A tramp-steamer lumbering across the dead flat sea was thoughtfully headed back to Constantinople by firing rifles ahead of her. [...] "Under fire the whole day," [...] E14 observes philosophically. The nature of her work made this inevitable. She was all among the patrols, which kept her down a good deal and made her draw on her batteries, and when she rose to charge, watchers ashore burned oil-flares on the beach or made smokes among the hills according to the light. In either case there would be a general rush of patrolling craft of all kinds, from steam launches to gunboats. Nobody loves the Trade, though E14 did several things which made her popular. She let off a string of very surprised dhows (they were empty) in charge of a tug which promptly fled back to Constantinople; stopped a couple of steamers full of refugees, also bound for Constantinople, who were [...] "very pleased at being allowed to proceed" [...] instead of being lusitaniaed as they had expected. Another refugee-boat, fleeing from goodness knows what horror, she chased into Rodosto Harbour, where, though she could not see any troops, [...] "they opened a heavy rifle fire on us, hitting the boat several times. So I went away and chased two more small tramps who returned towards Constantinople." ...|$|E
