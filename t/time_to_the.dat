5|$|A BLT (Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato) {{is a type}} {{of bacon}} sandwich. The {{standard}} BLT is made up of four ingredients: bacon, lettuce, tomato, and bread.

5|$|For two years, Hand {{tried to}} succeed {{as a lawyer}} by force of will, giving all his <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> practice. By 1900, he was deeply {{dissatisfied}} with his progress. For intellectual stimulation, he increasingly looked outside his daily work. He wrote scholarly articles, taught part-time at Albany Law School, and joined a lawyers' discussion group in New York City. He also developed an interest in politics.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Ministry of Justice {{considered}} reorganizing {{the search}} and rescue services, and looked into moving the 330 Squadron from Banak to Hammerfest Airport. The rationale was the proximity to Hammerfest Hospital and a typical 40-minute shorter flight <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast. However, such a location would give longer travel <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inner parts of Finnmark. The plans were hindered by opposition from the Air Force, {{as they would have}} to establish a military station at Hammerfest. The Norwegian Armed Forces announced in 2007 that they would carry out a major restructuring and decrease of activity in Finnmark, with the long-term plan to close the Garrison of Porsanger.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{volcanic}} {{peaks in the}} Mount Cayley field were named by mountaineers that explored {{the area in the}} early 20th century. Mount Fee was named in September 1928 by British mountaineer Tom Fyles after Charles Fee (1865–1927), {{who was a member of}} the British Columbia Mountaineering Club in Vancouver at the <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> northwest, Mount Cayley was named in September 1928 by Tom Fyles after Beverley Cochrane Cayley during a climbing expedition with the Alpine Club of Canada. Cayley was a friend of those in the climbing expedition and had died in Vancouver on June 8, 1928 at the age of 29. Photographs of Mount Cayley were taken by Fyles during the 1928 expedition and were published in the 1931 Canadian Alpine Journal Vol XX.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ernest Thompson {{exercised}} an option of his lease allowing him to buy Craigiehall from Lord Rosebery. However, the army had still not moved out, and in 1948 offered to purchase the property from Thompson, finally completing the sale in 1951. Through the early 1950s the Army made alterations to Craigiehall. The original roof was replaced in 1953 due to woodworm, and extra rooms added in the attic. This resulted {{in the loss of}} Bruce's chimneys, and Burn's dining room pediment. Internally the house was redecorated, it being considered that there was too little of the original scheme remaining to allow restoration. Another extension was added, this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-west, to house the staff of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC) in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|After van der Linden's {{death in}} 1885, Lie paid his teacher's widow {{a total of}} 1,000gulden to acquire the Zending Press; the funds were, in part, {{borrowed}} from his friends. He changed the printer's name to Lie Kim Hok soon afterwards. He devoted most of his <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> publishing house, and it grew quickly, printing works by other authors and reprinting some of Lie's earlier writings. The publishing house was, however, unable to turn a profit. That year he published a new syair, consisting of 24quartets, entitled Orang Prampoewan. He also wrote opinion pieces in various newspapers, including Bintang Betawi and Domingoe.|$|E
5|$|Back in London Emmeline {{was visited}} by Sylvia, {{who had not}} seen her mother in years. Their {{politics}} were by now very different, and Sylvia was living, unmarried, with an Italian anarchist. Sylvia described a moment of familial affection when they met, followed by a sad distance between them. Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently. According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out of the room, leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become a convert to Adventism and devoted much of her <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church. The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 1933–34 season, Gardiner's teammates unanimously elected him captain. During the regular season, Chicago posted a 20–17–11 record. Gardiner had 10shutouts, and a 1.63goals against average. He was named for the third <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> First All-Star team, and won the Vezina Trophy for the second time. On February 14, 1934, he was a participant of the Ace Bailey Benefit Game, playing goaltender for the All-Stars, who played against the Toronto Maple Leafs. In the playoffs, Gardiner had a 6–1–1 record, with two shutouts and a 1.33goals against average, as Chicago won its first Stanley Cup in franchise history. During the Stanley Cup parade, Chicago defenseman Roger Jenkins carted Gardiner in a wheelbarrow around Chicago's business district after a pre-playoff bet.|$|E

5|$|Brad and Tracy Stevens are {{involved}} with the American Cancer Society's Coaches Vs. Cancer. Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy's mother died of the disease in June 2004. The day before Butler's 2010 Final Four appearance, they hosted a fundraiser for the organization. Brad Stevens has also volunteered his <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jukes Foundation for Kids, a charity benefiting Ugandan children run by former Butler player Avery Jukes. Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family; he notably took a one-game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith, a player on both of Butler's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer; Smith died {{less than a week}} later. At the request of Andrew's widow, Sam, Brad delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on January 17, 2016.|$|E

5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E
