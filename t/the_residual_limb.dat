50|$|In 1953, {{with what}} he had learned at Sunnybrook Hospital, {{opportunity}} drew James to the University of California,Berkeley, where, working with C.W. Radcliff, he helped to develop the quadrilateral socket by developing a jig fitting system for amputations above the knee. Unlike previous technology, these jigs held the correct position of <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb,</b> therefore making fitting of the socket for <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> easier and more comfortable for amputees to walk. As Kevin Carroll, James C. Baird, and Katherine Binder relate in their book, Prosthetics and Patient Management: A Comprehensive Clinical Approach, the work that James Foort did at Berkeley and subsequently with the “exploration of the biomechanics of alignment during ambulation remains the basis of contemporary prosthetic alignment.” In addition to developing the quadrilateral socket, the team at Berkeley systematized the prosthesis developed by Colin MacLaurin and Fred Hampton for total absence of the limb. The Berkeley team developed the PTB Below knee prosthesis for amputations below the knee, completely new technologies, The PTB prosthesis enabled the amputee to walk around with no corset or side joints. Not only did these new adaptations {{solve the problem of}} constriction of circulation and ease restriction on the thigh, but it allowed people to be amputated below the knee twice as was usual for amputations related to circulatory problems, thereby increasing their function.|$|E

The cause of amputation may dictate the length of <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> and the corresponding level of control of the prosthesis. The main impairment for transtibial amputees is the lack of adjustment of the foot and ankle. The foot acts as a lever arm directly attached to the calf muscle, but more than that, it absorbs the impulse from the ground and adapts dynamically to changes in the ground's surface. Transtibial amputees lose the muscle activation pathways necessary for the physical ability to generate work about the ankle joint, as well as the somatosensory and proprioceptive pathways of the lower leg.|$|E

5000|$|Until recently, the {{dominant}} hypothesis {{for the cause}} of phantom limbs was irritation in the severed nerve endings (called [...] "neuromas"). When a limb is amputated, many severed nerve endings are terminated at <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb.</b> These nerve endings can become inflamed, and were thought to send anomalous signals to the brain. These signals, being functionally nonsense, were thought to be interpreted by the brain as pain. Treatments based on this hypothesis were generally failures. In extreme cases, surgeons would perform a second amputation, shortening the stump, with the hope of removing the inflamed nerve endings and causing temporary relief from the phantom pain. But instead, the patients' phantom pains increased, and many were left with the sensation of both the original phantom limb, as well as a new phantom stump, with a pain all its own. In some cases, surgeons even cut the sensory nerves leading into the spinal cord or in extreme cases, even removed the part of the thalamus that receives sensory signals from the body.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{artificial}} limbs {{are attached}} to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by suction. The stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other stump shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the stump. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the stump, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.|$|E

A prosthesis replaces some of the important functions lost due to amputation, and should do so without causing discomfort, pain, or damage to the soft tissue of <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb.</b> An external prosthesis is composed of a prosthetic socket and a prosthetic foot, which are interconnected by a shank and possibly some prosthetic joints. A socket is a part of a prosthesis that connects to <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb.</b> A good understanding of the mechanical interaction between the socket and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> is required to provide comfort and prevent skin breakdown around <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb.</b> The shape of the socket is not exactly a replica of <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb,</b> but should be modified so that the load is transferred to <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> efficiently.

40|$|Abstract—The socket is {{considered}} an element of major importance in the makeup of a prosthesis. Each socket is a tai-lor-made device, designed to fit the unique geometry of <b>the</b> patient’s <b>residual</b> <b>limb.</b> <b>The</b> design and manufacture of a pros-thetic socket traditionally has been a manual process that relies {{on the use of}} plaster of Paris casts to capture the shape of <b>the</b> patient’s <b>residual</b> <b>limb</b> and then artisan fabrication techniques to manufacture the socket. Computer-aided design and manu-facturing technologies have overcome some of the shortcom-ings of the traditional process, but the final manufacture of the prosthetic socket is still performed manually. Rapid prototyp-ing (RP), a relatively new class of manufacturing technologies, creates physical models directly from three-dimensional (3 -D) computer data. Previous research into the application of RP systems to the manufacture of prosthetic sockets has focused on expensive, high-end technologies that have proven too expensive. This paper investigates the use of a cheaper, low-end RP technology known as 3 -D printing.

In this paper, we propose two new devices, a sliding antagonistic mechanism and a soft backbone, to improve the spatial characteristics and disturbance responsiveness. We quantitatively evaluated a prosthetic arm with the two devices. The results showed that the two devices increased the arm's workspace and disturbance responsiveness...|$|R
40|$|The authors studied 13 amputees (7 below knee, 6 above knee) with sequen-tial {{ultrasound}} examinations at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 6 status post amputation {{to define}} the natural evolution of stump healing in below- and above-knee amputa-tions. This would permit diagnosis of abnormal conditions such as abscess. In their series, they found striking differences between below- and above-knee am-putations. In below-knee amputations the development of fluid collections was rare (2 / 6) and, when present, small (less than 3 cm) and transient (resolving within two to three weeks). In above-knee amputations, all stumps first devel-oped subcutaneous edema followed by fluid collections (less than 5 cm) all of which resolved within six weeks. They found that ultrasound examinations are a useful technique to define abnormal fluid collections in <b>the</b> amputee’s <b>residual</b> <b>limb...</b>|$|R
