50|$|When future world {{champion}} Robby Naish began using a harness in Kailua in 1975 {{when he was}} twelve years old, he had problems with his chest being painfully squeezed by the force on the hook. Mike Horgan and Larry Stanley developed a <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> to balance the load and prevent the harness from squeezing the wearer's chest. The <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> is now in almost universal use.|$|R

50|$|The {{basic type}} {{consists}} of a steel cylinder body, a plunger on the top, a spring, a pair of step-cut locks, and a <b>spreader</b> <b>bar.</b> A special type of pliers are used to push in the spring-loaded plunger. This pushes down on the step-cut locks, which pushes {{them away from the}} <b>spreader</b> <b>bars</b> and allows them to come together. This allows the user to slip the locking jaws through a hole made through multiple sheets of material. When the plunger is released the spring pulls the locking jaws back towards the <b>spreader</b> <b>bar,</b> which separates the two jaws. The material sheets are then squeezed in between the step-cut area and the steel cylinder. This keeps the holes in the separate sheets aligned.|$|R
50|$|The spreader-bar hammock {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by wooden or metal bars {{at the head}} and foot of the hammock, spreading its width and allowing for easy access for casual use, such as in a backyard. Unfortunately, the <b>spreader</b> <b>bars</b> also make the hammock unsteady since the metacenter of the hammock when sleeping is very high. This style is generally considered less stable and less comfortable for sleeping than other styles. A subset of this style is the single-spreader bar hammock, which uses a <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> on only one end and is much more stable. A variation of the single-spreader bar hammock has three attachment points, one at each corner of the <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> and one at the non-spreader bar end and is nearly untippable.|$|R

50|$|Cleco-type {{fasteners}} {{are also}} available with a threaded mechanism to draw the <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> up. Clecos of this type take more time to install and remove, but can be made much tighter than the spring-type clecos. They are commonly available with a wingnut for hand tightening, or with a simple hex nut {{so that they may}} be spaced more closely together. In either case they will usually have a hexagonal body that may be better gripped to tighten or release the <b>spreader</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{optimization}} study {{was performed to}} develop a minimum weight <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> to allow two helicopters to lift the same payload. With this arrangement, the maximum payload that can be lifted is almost doubled without the expense of designing and building a new helicopter. The concept has had some limited use by civil helicopter operators using small helicopters and has been demonstrated in large scale by two CH- 54 's which successfully lifted a total load of 20 ton. To this point, rather heavy available beams or tower structures {{have been used for}} the <b>spreader</b> <b>bar.</b> Since the weight of the bar not only detracts from payload but also adds to the logistics problem, there are more than the usual incentives to minimize weight. Since the design requirement is for classic beam column with uniform side loads resulting from bar weight and aerodynamic drag, the design problem is particularly amenable to optimization. A study has been performed at Sikorsky to establish the minimum weight for a <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> sized to carry a load equal to the capacity of two Army BLACK HAWK helicopters. Toward this end, a computer program was written to analyze the <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> deflections and stresses and coupled to the NASA developed CONMIN optimization routines...|$|R

Unlike many manufacturers of the time, PrairieTek did not rest the drive heads on the disks, but instead used reverse EMF to park the drives on a <b>spreader</b> <b>bar.</b> While the concept promised {{to reduce the amount}} of wear on the drive heads and the disk, in practical application the heads came off the <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> too fast, and before the disk had come up to speed (creating an air cushion), which led to the heads impacting the disks and knocking loose magnetic media, shortening the life of the drive to months or weeks.|$|R
40|$|Elsevier use only: Received date here; revised date here; {{accepted}} date here The VeriSpreaderTM {{radiation detection}} system will monitor every container {{passing through a}} shipping terminal without impeding the flow of commerce by making the radiation measurements during normal container handling. This is accomplished by integrating neutron and spectroscopic gamma ray detectors into a container crane <b>spreader</b> <b>bar,</b> {{the part of the}} crane that directly engages the intermodal shipping containers while moving from ship to shore and vice-versa. The use of a spectroscopic gamma detector reduces the rate of nuisance alarms due to naturally occurring radioactive material. The combination of gamma and neutron detection reduces the effectiveness of shielding and countermeasures. The challenges in this <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> based approach arise from the harsh environment, particularly the mechanical shock and the vibration of the moving <b>spreader</b> <b>bar,</b> since the measurement is taken while the container is moving. The electrical interfaces in the port environment, from the crane to a central monitoring office, present further challenges. It is the packaging, electronic interfaces, and data processing software that distinguish this system, which is based on conventional radiation sensors. The core of the system is Amptek’s Gamma-Rad, which integrates a ruggedized scintillator/PMT, digital pulse shaping electronics, electronics for the neutron detector, power supplies, and an Ethernet interface.

25|$|Designed by {{the company}} as its Model 74, the plane was an {{incremental}} improvement over the F2B. The Navy-designated prototype XF3B-1 still had the tapered wings of the F2B for instance, but was built as a single-float seaplane using the FB-5 undercarriage. However, the growing use of aircraft carriers took away most {{of the need for}} floating fighters, and by the time other test results had been taken into account, the production F3B-1 (Model 77) had a larger upper wing that was slightly swept back and a redesigned tail with surfaces made from corrugated aluminum.

The person may be suspended with their legs together, or held apart either by using a <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> or by securing the ankles to two separate locations. With the legs held in this position, the subject may have an increased sense of vulnerability as their genital region would be easily accessible.|$|R

25|$|The term bondage {{describes}} {{the practice of}} physical restraint. Bondage is usually, but not always, a sexual practice. While bondage is a very popular variation within the larger field of BDSM, it is nevertheless sometimes differentiated {{from the rest of}} this field. Studies among BDSM practitioners in the US have shown that about half of all men find the idea of bondage to be erotic; and many women do as well. Strictly speaking, bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together; for example, by the use of handcuffs or ropes, or by lashing their arms to an object. Bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains or ropes to a St. Andrew's cross or <b>spreader</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
