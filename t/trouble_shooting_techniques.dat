40|$|Correspondence can be {{directed}} to this author, as the primary contact. We first propose a new meta methodology, called SOSF (Systems of system failures), to prevent system failures. The basic idea of SOSF is inspired by collaborating SOSM (Jackson,M. (2003)) with Taxonomy of failures (Gigch,J. P. Van. (1986)). SOSF tries to map the elements of mata system failure model into SOSM frames. Since SOSF enables us to identify a paradigm of where system failures resides, with its help we can adopt an appropriate methodology to a target problem. Then, we apply the proposed meta methodology to IT systems so as to confirm the results obtained are quite useful for promoting preventative measures that are not learned otherwise. Every organization has hierarchical structure of their processes. It {{is very important to}} identify what function of the organization has to be rectified learning from system failures. In order to achieve this, we must have some common language to understand fully what have happened, what should be a root cause and what should be a counter measure.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} report the feasibility, <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting</b> and {{surgical}} <b>technique</b> in the total robotic hysterectomy for the patient with adenomyoma uteri. Methods: A 51 year-old patient was diagnosed with adenomyosis. Total robotic hysterectomy was performed. Results: Total operating time was 350 min, estimated blood loss was 50 ml, and length of hospitalization was 6 days. The pathologic section revealed adenomyosis with myoma uteri. The intraoperative and post-operative complications were unremarkable. The patient was in good conditions at 6 th week, 3 rd, 6 th, 12 th and 24 th month. Conclusion: Total robotic hysterectomy for benign gynecologic condition, such as adenomyosis, is safe and feasible. However, the sustained high consuming cost must be weighted with the patient’s advantages...|$|R
