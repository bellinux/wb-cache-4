25|$|Double {{ladder of}} death: This {{involves}} two knifethrowers simultaneously performing a rapid sequence of throws {{at the same}} <b>target</b> <b>board</b> while aiming so that the trajectories of their knives cross. The throwers stand side by side facing the assistant at the board. The knives from the thrower on the right land {{on the left side}} of the <b>target</b> <b>board</b> while the knives from the thrower on the left impact to the right. Each thrower aims their next knife vertically above where they placed the preceding one, so that a ladder of knives is formed up each side of the assistant. This stunt was pioneered by The Great Throwdini in partnership with Harry Munroe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It is {{commonly}} believed {{that women are}} more likely to seek advice than men; for example, on aspects of health or asking for directions when lost. This paper investigates whether women’s relatively greater propensity for advice seeking extends to important business decisions, specifically those involving corporate takeovers. Consistent with the evidence from other contexts, we show that the presence of female directors on <b>target</b> <b>boards</b> is positively and significantly associated with <b>target</b> <b>boards</b> seeking advice from top-ranked financial advisors. In contrast, we do not observe any significant association between the presence of female directors on bidder boards and their engagement of top-ranked financial advisors. We argue that the presence of a gender effect for <b>target</b> <b>boards</b> but not for bidder boards is consistent with less overconfident female versus male directors on bidder boards initiating fewer bids, higher litigation risk facing <b>target</b> <b>boards</b> for accepting too little, and the different type of advice sought by bidders and target firms...|$|R

25|$|Balloon bursting: The {{assistant}} {{stands in}} front of the <b>target</b> <b>board</b> and holds balloons which the thrower or archer then attempts to burst.

25|$|Blind: The thrower or archer wears a blindfold. Generally the {{assistant}} first guides the blindfolded impalement artist into position facing towards the <b>target</b> <b>board.</b> The assistant then stands in place against {{the board and}} gives an audible signal to commence the stunt. The implication is that the impalement artist then has to aim {{on the basis of}} where they remember the target to be. There is a trick behind this stunt and budding impalement artists are warned not to attempt it unless coached by an experienced professional.|$|E

25|$|It is {{occasionally}} {{alleged that}} knife throwing acts are actually a trick {{in which the}} thrower palms the knife as he pretends to throw it and a knife springs out from the target, giving the illusion of perfect aim. Although this technique {{has been used by}} at least one magician to emulate knife throwing, the great majority of knife throwers perform genuine acts. There are secret tricks behind certain stunts, such as throwing while blindfolded, but they do not involve fake knives springing from the <b>target</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} on the simple arrangement of having the assistant {{stand in front of}} a <b>target</b> <b>board</b> and remain still while knives, arrows or other objects land about them.

40|$|Using a {{large sample}} of block share {{acquisitions}} made by private equity (PE) funds over the 1990 to 2006 period, {{we examine the}} sources of value gains in PE minority equity investments. We find that compared to non-PE acquirers, PE acquirers {{are more likely to}} place representatives with finance experience on a <b>target’s</b> <b>board,</b> particularly when the target performs poorly or when it has more pronounced agency problems. PE acquirers {{are also more likely to}} place representatives with experience in the target’s industry on the <b>target’s</b> <b>board</b> when the <b>target</b> has more complex operations (e. g., multiple segments or higher R&D intensity). The targets in PE acquisitions, particularly those whose boards have representatives from PE acquirers, realize both higher abnormal announcement returns and better post-acquisition operating performance than do targets in other types of acquisitions. Target announcement abnormal returns and post-acquisition operating performance are also higher when PE-appointed directors have expertise in the target’s industry, when they sit on the boards of poorly performing targets, or when they sit on the <b>boards</b> of <b>targets</b> with higher R&D intensity.

2500|$|In circus and {{vaudeville}} acts, {{a target}} girl is a female assistant in [...] "impalement" [...] acts such as knife throwing, archery or sharpshooting. The assistant {{stands in front}} of a <b>target</b> <b>board</b> or is strapped to a moving board and the impalement artist throws knives or shoots projectiles so as to hit the board but miss the assistant. The image or character of the target girl has become an icon in fiction and visual media.|$|E
2500|$|Impaling a card {{or paper}} plate: The {{assistant}} {{stands in front}} of the <b>target</b> <b>board</b> and holds out a card, or paper plate which the thrower or archer attempts to pin to the board. The level of danger can be varied to some extent by whether the assistant holds the card at full arms length or keeps it close. The Jasters do a [...] "William Tell" [...] version in which the card is balanced on the head of target girl Elena Busnelli.|$|E
2500|$|The Wheel of death: One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} and dangerous feats for a knifethrower. The assistant is strapped to a large circular <b>target</b> <b>board</b> which spins about its middle, like a wheel. The thrower must execute a series of rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on the segments of the wheel not covered by the assistant's body. There are some variations in the exact configuration of [...] "wheels": in some the assistant is positioned with their arms at their sides while in others the assistant is spreadeagled. Sometimes the [...] "wheel" [...] might not actually be circular: shield shapes and rectangular rotating boards have been known and all will work as [...] "wheels" [...] {{as long as they are}} correctly balanced to rotate smoothly when the assistant is in place. A particularly challenging version of this stunt is [...] "The Veiled Wheel", in which the target is covered with a paper screen so the thrower can't see the assistant. Only four artists are known to have attempted this dangerous trick. It was first performed by The Gibsons in the 1930s; a duo named The Zeros followed them in the 1940s, Fritz Brumbach did it in Monte Carlo in 1978 and The Great Throwdini revived it in New York in October 2010 with Melissa-Anne Ainley acting as his target girl.|$|E

5000|$|Whether a {{purchase}} {{is perceived as}} being a [...] "friendly" [...] one or [...] "hostile" [...] depends significantly on how the proposed acquisition is communicated to and perceived by the <b>target</b> company's <b>board</b> of directors, employees and shareholders. It is normal for M&A deal communications {{to take place in}} a so-called [...] "confidentiality bubble" [...] wherein the flow of information is restricted pursuant to confidentiality agreements. In the case of a friendly transaction, the companies cooperate in negotiations; {{in the case of a}} hostile deal, the board and/or management of the target is unwilling to be bought or the <b>target's</b> <b>board</b> has no prior knowledge of the offer. Hostile acquisitions can, and often do, ultimately become [...] "friendly", as the acquiror secures endorsement of the transaction from the board of the acquiree company. This usually requires an improvement in the terms of the offer and/or through negotiation.|$|R
