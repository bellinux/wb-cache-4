5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{solvent-based}} lubricants, such as {{diesel fuel}} and kerosene, were commonly used.

5|$|The {{precious}} metals {{silver and gold}} were not common in the Eastern Ranges, while copper was mined in Gachantivá, Moniquirá and in {{the mountains to the}} south of the Bogotá savanna at Sumapaz. The process of elaborating the fine filigree figures took place by creating a mold of obsidian, shale or clay, filling the open space with bee wax, obtained through trade with the neighbouring indigenous peoples from the Llanos Orientales to the east of the Altiplano; the Achagua, Tegua and Guayupe. The bee wax occupied the voids of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> and <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> was heated by fires. The bee wax would melt, leaving an open space where the tumbaga or sometimes gold was poured into, a process called lost-wax casting. Using this method, modern tunjos are still fabricated in the centre of Bogotá.|$|E

40|$|Precision molding is a replicative {{production}} method {{for the mass}} production of complex glass optics in high precision. In contrast to the traditional material removal process, such as grinding and polishing, the surface {{as well as the}} entire shape of the optical component is created by deforming glass at elevated temperatures using precise molding tools with optical surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>molded</b> glass components present high shape accuracy and surface finish after <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> process, therefore no further processing is required. During <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> process, <b>the</b> glass is heated in <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> tool up to above the transition temperature Tg, then pressed into desired shape and cooled down to approximately 200 °C. <b>The</b> precision glass <b>molding</b> is therefore a complex thermo-mechanical process, in which the glass lens undergoes uneven cooling speed and stress distribution. These lead to several drawbacks on <b>the</b> <b>molded</b> glass optics, such as form deviation, index change and fracture. In this study, FEM simulation was employed in order to achieve preliminary understanding of <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> process. <b>The</b> FEM model included viscoelasticity behavior of glass material (stress-relaxation, structure-relaxation and thermosrheological simplicity), as well as thermodynamics model of <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> machine. In <b>the</b> form of a case study of a real <b>molding</b> example, <b>the</b> form deviation, index change and fracture of <b>the</b> <b>molded</b> glass optic were predicted in advance of <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> experiment by means of the numerical calculation of thermal shrinkage, volume change and stress distribution respectively.

5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. <b>The</b> <b>mold</b> cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials.

Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E
2500|$|One key in casting metal cores is to {{make sure}} they do not contain any {{porosity}} as it will induce flaws into <b>the</b> <b>molded</b> part. In order to minimize porosity the metal may be gravity cast or <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> cavity may be pressurized. Another system slowly rocks the casting dies as <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> cavity fills to [...] "shake" [...] the air bubbles out.|$|R

5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E

Starting in 1932 she served as a school ship for naval cadets. She was capable of carrying 100cadets, along with their officers, petty officers, and support staff. She remained in this role until she was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1937 and sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers.

5|$|Lactarius torminosus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{and as such}} {{plays an}} important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades.
